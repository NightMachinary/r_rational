Welcome to the story voting thread for the Secret Krampus contest! I'll be posting each story as a top-level comment. The associated prompt and any content warnings will be hidden by spoiler tags, for those who prefer to go in blind.

The contest will run until 11:59PM next Sunday, or technically until whenever the thread comes out of contest mode after that. Whichever story has the most upvotes at that time wins, and I will gift the winning author Reddit platinum. You can upvote as many stories as you want, including your own (but only with one account, please!). I encourage you to vote based on how much you like the stories as opposed to how closely they match their respective prompts, since the prompts are just meant to be inspiration.

I ask that people don't post other top-level comments so that the focus stays on the contest entries, but feel free to reply to the story comments with your thoughts and questions. You may want to ping the author in these, since they won't be notified otherwise.

Only folks who submitted a story will have their prompt included in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jdvlgd/secret_krampus_prompt_voting/][prompt voting thread]]. There will likely be some prompts that didn't get a story written for them, or stories whose prompts aren't in the voting thread. I'll add any late entries to both threads as they arrive, so be sure to check back later in the week for more stories!

This is wonderful! Let me see if I got them all right:\\

- SCP/men in black with just a dash of Warhammer 40k\\
- young adult adventure (or whatever you call hunger games' genre)\\
- dating sim (can I say how great it is that the alien is so alien that it is doing a different /game/ genre instead of /fiction/ genre??)

I have to say this one is my absolute favorite so far. Great prompt, greater execution!

My prompt was about the final judgement, so I went ahead with a standard interpretation of what that would mean, aka you only receive the reward if you did good deeds.

Andrew isn't really a good person, but he's not a bad person either. He's just living a life without meaning, consuming media and games while feeling lonely and insignificant. He desperately wants something worth giving his time and energy to, something real.

Andrew passes the "test" by sacrificing his life for others, which in a way gave his life meaning. I left the reward up to the interpretation of the reader, whether he gets one or not. Personally, I think he goes to a place where he finds the truth, something beautiful, and something that was worth the sacrifice. Wherever that happens to be. :)

*** I loved this story, particularily the part about how they calculate their human-ness as if their code was actual DNA. I suppose it sort of is, in a way. I wonder how else you could calculate one's humanity; perhaps by comparing one's actions to that of a human, see how well they match up?

I also wonder what the drone meant by "We ate them all". Does it consider itself to be a robot more than a human? Were there robots before humanity's (presumed) extinction that humanity was just integrated with (=eaten up by) or were all of the robots of the setting produced as human-robot hybrids? The drone doesn't seem to think there is a difference, judging from the reponse he gave to the flesh-and-blood sentence, but the rest of the text doesn't really give the impression that he actually considers himself human.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this one, [[/u/eniteris]]

If there is one thing I don't understand, it's this:

#+begin_quote
  They wipe the dust off the glass. Faces smile through. Nothing.

What does "nothing" refer to? No emotion being invoked in our robots? No hint as to what happened to the humans? Something else. I feel like the scene is supposed to tell me something, but I have no idea what it would be. Did they come there just to see a picture of a human?

**** Thanks for liking it! I was struggling to write a story, though lots of ideas and themes were floating around. Mostly "what does it mean to be human" and all that entails. I mean, if you compare our actions to that of our neolithic ancestors, most would be completely different, but some would be the same. At what point do humans and our tools become inseparable?

The drone was meant to be a sarcastic friend. "We ate them all" directly references that they are all partially human and technically descended from them (assimilated), but also joke that they are machines/robot uprising. Re:setting : humans uploaded themselves, and slowly merged with other code.

"Nothing" was meant to refer to no (evoked) emotion. The android Vic was going out to try to find their own humanity, and failed to do so. Initially was meant to be their old apartment, but that was a bit too cliche.

And even if you calculate humanity by behavior, you still need to test to see how human you remain.

That's a very cool question, I agree. It's pretty common to see works where people try to "ascend" and become something else (muaha, I'm man no longer; I am a perfect machine!). I like your perspective about remaining human in spite of huge physical changes. /Humanity of the mind/, as it were, rather than of body.

Really? I think that could be rather neat, a way to add a little more emotional umpff to the scene. As it is, I am almost left wondering why they went to that specific apartment only to leave empty-handed. Tying the apartment to the android specifically could help there.

Yes, he got lost in the storm and ended up landing on the other side.

>I was a bit confused at how he didn't understand the local language

On the Earth side, he'd recently moved there for work, and he hadn't yet had time to learn it. On the Luna side, people don't speak English. The former was mostly just a pretense for why he isn't surprised by his inability to understand Kauruva. I'll see what I can do make this clearer.

Hmm, they just moved them with their hands (which is why they had gloves). I didn't anticipate this being unclear. Revision forthcoming.

>as well as how he survived the landing. Is there magic involved?

Not by intention :p It was just plot armor at play there, I'm afraid. Maybe I can give him a parachute.

--------------

Is there anything else that you thought was unclear, or maybe was redundant? I'm not satisfied with the editing---I'm certain I can cut down on the wordcount more than I have. The most obvious contender is to shave off the aeroplane/flying-sequence as well as the immediate post-crash scene. Maybe I can add some words to the truck episode as well; it was supposed to show how Earthlings and Lunarians are emotionally similar and can bond, but it doesn't feel as if I actually accomplished that.

Basically, the questions I most want feedback on are:

- Where do you think I can shave off words?
- How are Kauruva's interactions with Tremain?
- Should I just cut the thylacine-fox thing? It was supposed to be a nod towards convergent evolution. Lunarians and Earthlings are genetically unrelated yet through their cooperation have converged to similar characteristics. Kind of like "A invents spear and shows to B, B tries spear and uses it to great success, B develops same motor skills as A did"---some kind of symbiosis. Thylacines and foxes are visually (and anatomically) close to identical due to similar enviromental input (primarily prey size) despite being genetically dissimilar.
- What did you think of the way the fire-plot ended? Did the fire need greater foreshadowing or greater focus?

I realize this is a lot to ask of you, so it's fine if you don't answer any of it. If you do, please be absolutely merciless---no benefit of the doubt to the author, please. Your personal impression as a reader can never be wrong.

Again, thanks for reading :)

***** 1) The fire felt completely out of nowhere. I still don't understand why there was a fire. It seemed to just be there to add drama and illustrate the purpose of cross-world communication.

2) I liked Kauruva's interactions with Tremain. At times you used 'said' instead of 'signed', which was confusing. Tremain having that PhD seemed to come out of nowhere a bit; he's the best pilot in the world but his PhD was in Lunar linguistics? It makes sense if he's basically an astronaut in training for first contact, but it felt off when reading.

3) The beginning felt slow to start, or at least slow to establish that there's no magic, the boys are using their arms to move the tiles, and also just what the purpose of Tremain's being there was. Was he a slavemaster? Too much of my focus was on the beginning parts, the tiles, and the boys; I guess that would imply you could shave words there. Write more about the interesting thing.

4) The thylacine-fox thing came across as 'oh, they have the same species but different names'. Yet it only added more confusion and questions for me. Just how similar are the two worlds? What is their tech level exactly? Is magic at play?

These I answered without re-reading, to convey my initial impressions as I remember them.

*** Haha, I was wondering about why the President was so absorbed with his lunch and so nonchalant about the whole "cooling of the Earth" thing. I didn't catch on until he was actually addressed as Pooh! But who's the giant? And why does he produce honey in a forge? Is he supposed to be Rabbit?

I suddenly wish I'd paid more attention to the books. Anyway, I love the story, especially how expressive the dialogue was---the entire first section was just dialogue, and I think that worked very well. [[/u/TennisMaster2]]

**** Thank you so much! I'm glad you enjoyed it. I'll reply to my own comment with first the identity of the giant, then to that comment with what's behind the forge.

******* Oooh, I was thinking about greek mythology, what with Gaia, but I didn't see Hephaestus. So Pooh was aware that Hephaestus was down there, and just came to chill? Maybe that explained why he was so unconcerned about the whole core thing.

Thanks again for letting me read it :)

***** Sorry, it seems I missed an exclamation mark! Reddit is very confusing that way---on my reddit (old reddit on browser) the spoiler appeared to work, but on other readers it sometimes doesn't.
