** When mind-controlled by Fallatehr, Amaryllis reflects that the group isn't that far from the stereotypical "murderhobo" RPG party. They have killed /a lot of people/ in the name of "It was more convenient that way".

I mean, yeah, they do need to access that fortress before the locust dies, and there was no way they could let Fallatehr live (though they were kind of casual about killing his minions), and Larkspur and his minions needed to die because... he made a deal with Doris Finch, I guess?

And when you're looking at it objectively, beyond the whole "The hero killed 20 gazillion people during the movie", there's not that much evidence that the protagonists are "The heroes". Everyone is assuming that their quests will allow Juniper to become some sort of god and rewrite reality to not completely suck, but they don't really have any evidence that will happen (especially since it obviously didn't happen to Arthur).

Also, one of the main objectives is to get Mary back "in power", somehow, but do we know if that would even be a good thing in the first place? She obviously has the loosest ethics of the group (I keep thinking that Fenn and Joon weren't wanted serial murderers before they met her); she's argued before for "It's okay to steal things because us getting more powerful is an inherently good thing". We don't know exactly how she ended up in the Risen Lands with a Black Ops squad after her (she claimed to be on a semi-official mission to retrieve the key, but I think it's fairly obvious she was striking on her own), except that it probably involved her family being assholes. But... given that we know of her, it's not ridiculous to imagine that she was banished because of something awful she did and had to work from there.

Overall, a lot of this is giving me the same vibe as I got from Welexi's crew in /Shadows of the Limelight/, except that Joon has more agency and a better read on Mary than Dominic did. All of that to say, if my read on this is right, then I look forward to seeing this house of cards collapse :D

*** This is especially a concern in the context of no quest for Amaryllis regaining power. I definitely see a conflict between them. Especially considering that she has control over all of their gear. Perhaps if they are lucky, Amaryllis will be too focused on the coming technological revolution to worry about political power. She might actually turn out to be more powerful that way, so it's not the worst idea.

One important difference between Amaryllis and Welexi is that Joon has the loyalty of the party, so that interaction won't be quite so one-sided. I do think you're right however: these are the protagonists, but they are definitely following their own path (which is not that of a hero). Until recently, however, almost everyone that they fought/killed was evil in some sense (Aumann, Lakspur, Fallatehr), and I can justify killing Fallatehrs lackeys because they were in many ways copies of him.

Aumann, I can sort of buy. He kidnapped Mary at gunpoint, left the heroes to maybe starve to death in a desert fortress, and /maybe/ tortured Mary before rolling it back with time magic. I'm not sure it makes killing him and the people who worked for him morally justified, but fine.

Do we have any evidence Larkspur was evil? All he did, he did in the name of catching a group of known international terrorists. He tried to negotiate with Juniper. He /maybe/ set Fenn up to die Task Force X style, and /probably/ made a deal with Doris Finch (and the cousin marriage thing is gross)... but we don't know if the Fire Team had orders to kill witnesses at all, and the deal with Doris is more shady than evil, the kind of stuff intelligence agencies do all the time. I'm not sure killing him and his men is justified, especially given that he was running out of duns to track them down.

Yeah, but the "copy" part would have reverted over time. Really, there's not much difference between them and Valencia, but Valencia was Joon-bait and the others were generic henchmen NPCs, so they had to die.

They're both ruthless people who wanted the party dead or captured at best. /Not/ killing them would have been stupid and risky. Especially Larkspur, who became desperate enough to use the strategic elf Bone reserve and make deals with people in forbidden areas, and was constantly on their heels.

Any protagonist who tried to keep them alive would have been painfully, unbelievably moral, from my point of view, and a chore to read about.

I don't see the moral quandary over someone killing the assassins hunting them. Or killing a mage that has captured and tortured someone they know, and has an ever-growing thirst for gold that they sate by taking it from wherever they find, killing whoever is in their way.

Amaryllis has some sketchy morals, especially with her recent idea of the ends justifying the means, because June will be a god later, and can fix everything then.

This whole recent mission has certainly been a lot more morally grey-black than earlier missions. But that doesn't mean the party have secretly been monsters the whole time.

***** Well, Larkspur tried to negotiate with Joon, but as soon as Joon tried to run, Lark chased after him. Then, Lark tracked his group down and sent five choppers full of people after them. Aside from that (which isn't conclusive evidence by any means), we're mostly going on Mary's word (which is fallible, but becoming less so as time goes on).

At high levels of soul magic, we don't know that the copies revert over time: presumably, you could make a set of values that were more self-consistent (and therefore, stable). Furthermore, repeated application of the soul hacking will likely adjust other values into a more stable configuration. Finally, those people were originally sentenced to the same prison as Fallatehr, so it's a good guess that they're evil. Since they value Fallatehr, they are likely to want to save him at any cost, and would be tremendous pains in the ass anyways. Valencia, lacking a soul, is immune to soul magic, so it's not a concern with her.

** The ecology, physics, geology, etc. of the Bottomless Pit boggles the mind. I now get why its a capital M Mystery.

It gets ever wider and has no end, meaning the WHOLE of Aerb is floating above it; what happens when its circumference comes unto the hex boundaries?

Whats happening with the water deficit in the above world? Over geological timespans that should have an impact! Very rough calculation: Yangtze flowrater of 10^{3} km^{3/year} vs earth water amount of 10^{9} km^{3} gives us a million years for one earth water unit to drain. Even if Aerb is 10 times bigger and the flow rate that much smaller its a HUUUUGGEEE problem! Also erosion(!).

The energy cycle is /really/ weird, deepsea like. A of nutrients in the form of fish/soil from the river - I'd expect fish-snapping batlike creatures in the upper kilometers and plants that grab the soil from the water, like in rainforests.

For energy some point you need to resort to rock-dissolving lichens/bacteria. A really low flux energy source - but the area is infinite! (possibly, see hex boundaries) - see also the life of the Tuung in that area. (WTF is up with that super fucked up sort of life?) Magic as external energy source would be invaluable. Also the excluded nuclear energy - maybe instead of thermal vents and volcanism (can't have volcanism because ALL OF AERB IS FLOATING ON THE PIT!!! ) we have Oklo-style natural reactors as hydrothermal vent equivalent?

What sort of hyper efficient vertical transportation infrastructure do the Tuung have?

How deep can a suffiently funded probe fall and give feedback? I am imagining some sort of heavy, high-terminal-velocity aerodynamic radio torpedo, and a big horizontal hanging antenna. How high is absorption in the wet air? There are frequencies that dont get absorbed that much. A couple lighthours? Heck even lightseconds would be incredible!

And...Whats up with the air pressure? That /must/ be automagically stable, or we would have dropwinds. If pressure increases towards the bottom, suffiently well equipped people just die of O^{2} partial pressure toxicity.

**** In order for it to balance out, the entirety of the river would have to evaporate and then diffuse out of the top.

(I'm not a chemist, physicist, meteorologist, or mage. Take this with a good heap of salt.)

It probably would all evaporate. If you imagine a starting point with an infinite expanse of dry air, and then drop a river into it, you'd expect the river to eventually evaporate entirely (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure][vapor pressure]]]. Because the space is infinite, you will always find more dry air the further down you go.

I'm not quite sure how that interacts with pressure and temperature.

There's also the interesting question of gravity. Assuming that the hole is infinite, you would expect “downward” gravity to fall off as you get deeper, but “sideways” and “up” gravity to increase. This potentially means that you could have very cold, low pressure (I think?) atmosphere on the bottom of the world.

Actually, this reminds me of another thing. The world is closed but apparently flat (see [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26627424][Common Knowledge About Aerb]]). If you travel far enough in any direction you get back to where you started. Assuming that this applies vertically as well as horizontally, then you expect that if you go down far enough you'll eventually end up falling from the sky.

(Assuming that the world is on a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4xgwpl/eli5_a_hypertorus_universe_that_has_the/][hypertorus]], and that my ability to reason about higher-dimensional geometry is good. (It's not.))

****** If you imagine descending into the Earth, gravity will get weaker and weaker as the amount of mass below you decreases, and the amount of mass above you increases. Eventually it will balance out and you'll be perfectly weightless at the center.

If we imagine Aerb as a finite, thick plane, then we should see something similar as we descend. At the bottom, gravity will be exactly the inverse from the top.

However, we know there is a big old hole. Let's imagine that plane again, except that there's a cone cut out of it with its tip at the top. As you descend one of the sides, more and more of the mass is above and to the side of you.

I'm not quite sure how this works at the top of the hole, though. If the cone is obtuse enough (it's wide instead of narrow), would you notice an effect at the top of the hole?

--------------

*Edit:* Of course, we already know that gravity is different because Aerb's star isn't crashing into the ground.

Amusingly, you could almost explain this with a hypertorus, but it would be metastable at best. And then there's the whole day cycle thing which just says fuck you to geometry.

******** There's more air below than there is at the top of the hole. Thus there is more volume to diffuse into.

I think you an get a situation where the water flowing out would match the water flowing in, but there would be some weird requirements --- I think the humidity would have to get higher the lower you go so that it always diffuses up.

There's also the issue of whether the mouth of the hole is big enough to for its air to hold the entire cross-section of the river. We know the river is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/32597586][a mile “thick”]] (wide?) and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31367205][Pit is a mile wide]] --- note that the description from chapter 86 says “dozens of miles wide,” but it's referring to the depression the Pit sits within.

Even if the river is relatively shallow, that's a /lot/ of liquid water that you have to balance out with vapor.

I'm just an interested layperson, though, so take it all with a big grain of salt.

** That battle would have been a great time to use some enhanced arrows again. That's an ability to /abuse/. Approximate destruction range for a void arrow is (500 ft/crystal)*sqrt(2000) = ~4 miles (!!!) However, if each arrow had a small flash-bang grenade attached, (or a real grenade attached, depending on the desired lethality), you would not have had much of a fight at all ;-)

I wonder what kinds of magic can be embedded into an arrow? Likely flower magic. Wards? Put a little bit of warding power into an arrow, and then shoot the arrow. If you embed the destructive kind of warding against life, and key it to activate appropriately, you could have wiped out the army without risk.

Speaking of which, that bow is a /fantastic/ wealth multiplier. Forge an arrow out of gold! Fire arrow into unpopulated desert plain! Profit!

If the bow can replicate a void crystal and the required electrical circuitry to make the thing trigger, it'll definitely replicate a computer chip. I wonder if you could duplicate a cell phone (or any other small object with a sufficient value/mass ratio)

  *** Common Knowledge About Aerb
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: common-knowledge-about-aerb
      :END:

  1. Aerb was about ten times larger than Earth, flat instead of a sphere, and shaped like a hexagon. If you went far enough north, you would end up in the south, and it was the same in any direction. (Amaryllis gave me a measurement for Aerb and I had to approximate Earth's size given that I could only remember how wide the continental United States was.)

  2. Aerb had no time zones, because the sun was in the same apparent position no matter where on Aerb you were, with no parallax. Despite that, there were still seasons, because the sun got smaller in the winter and larger in the summer. There were also regional variations in temperature caused by something called the projection layer, a super-atmospheric phenomenon that Fenn was ignorant of and Amaryllis didn't know too much about.
#+end_quote

Of course, it might still be an infinite plane, but each Aerb tile is almost identical ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation][many worlds style]]). That would be nearly impossible to prove, I think.

I initially though that would break down pretty quickly. Then I realized that if somebody, Fred1, walked from Aerb1 to Aerb2, then Fred0 would be walking from Aerb0 to Aerb1, etc.

********* A looping plane is physically identical to an infinite plane physically unless the looping is local only and not infinitely tall.

In which case what is on the other side, is it just a huge planet so large that the curvature over a surface area 10x the size of the earth is unnoticeable?

Surely the elves would know, what did they see from the moon?

********** I'm guessing the infinite flat plane thing includes elf knowledge. It strikes me as something so obvious to ask about that somebody would have made real effort. On the other hand, maybe elves like to keep their secrets.

You might be able to determine what's going on by measuring the curvature of space, but I bet that would only raise more questions given the “fuck you” nature of the sun and the moon.

I suppose there might be some sort of curvature that makes sense that I just can't imagine because it's not analogous to a 2D world projected on a 3D object. For example, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/17fk8e/ive_been_told_that_knots_only_work_in_three/][knots don't work the same ways in higher dimensions.]]

Atmosphere is also going to be a factor, although we can treat air as effectively transparent its not entirely, and you get a lot of diffraction from other light sources (can't remember exactly how the sun works in Aerb but lets assume its the same) and raleigh scattering so at a far enough distance those would start to affect vision a lot. I'm not sure how the maths works out, but you could also say your world has a thicker atmosphere

  (The saving grace of the plan to steal the Down and Out was that it was better than the alternatives, which we'd discussed in some depth. The most promising of them was looping Esuen in on the teleportation key and then trying to see whether her worldline was such that she would be able to put us within a few days climb of Kuum Doona, which had seemed like a stretch. Other options, like quickly-built, makeshift aircraft or abuse of the Immobility Plate while skydiving, had been vetoed on feasibility grounds.)
