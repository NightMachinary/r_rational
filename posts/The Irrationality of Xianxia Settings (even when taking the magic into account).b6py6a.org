Hi [[/r/rational][r/rational]]!

I've been reading a lot of xianxia lately (thousands of chapters) as I find the reads really enjoyable. It's really a guilty pleasure of mine now. At the same time since I've read a lot of non-xianxia, including rationalist fiction, certain things just stand out as really implausible with these xianxia settings (even when accepting the magic of the setting at face value). So here are some of my pet peeves. I'm curious if anyone else reads xianxia and gets the same sense of "why is this happening!?" that I do.

*1. Picking a Fight Without Knowing Enemy Capabilities*

So many characters (especially young masters) get easily offended and wind up making enemies with others at the drop of a hat. They do this fully knowing that they're not the most powerful guy around, and since they're picking fights with pure strangers, they have no idea of the other party's capabilities or connections, and they never think to find out first. What, did they think no one they picked on would have friends in high places? Because given how often they pick fights with others, sooner or later they're going to run into something they can't handle, it's just a numbers game. Amazing how they lack any instinct of self preservation in a world where people routinely get killed for the slightest offense.

*2. Inexplicably Surviving Weakling Organizations*

The protagonist always starts off in a kingdom or encounters an independent organization that's so weak any middling cultivator can show up and annihilate the kingdom without breaking a sweat. In fact the protagonist usually commits exactly this kind of mass murder and gets away with it. Which makes me wonder how did these organization's survive in the first place. In the real world you don't find nations whose armies can be wiped out by lone individuals, these nations would collapse and be replaced or consumed by a more powerful one.

*3. The Worst Techniques are the Most Popular*

The vast majority of Cultivators use the worst cultivation techniques and martial arts, despite the existence of better arts. You'd think they wouldn't waste their time with crappy techniques and do their best to get their hands on something better considering it's a matter of life and death and will pay off many times over. You can't tell me that no one with a high level technique is interested in making massive amounts of free money by teaching others how to use their technique in exchange for great sums of money, or to write out and sell their techniques on the black market or auction house for even more money. There's a reason why in the real world it's the best strategies and products that are the most widely used.

*4. Armies of Useless Weaklings*

Powerful Cultivators can faceroll weaker ones by the hundreds or thousands and no amount of weaker cultivators can ever hurt or exhaust a more powerful one and don't gain any kind of advantage from teaming up against one. Yet despite this, armies regularly field thousands or hundreds of thousands of weaklings, to no effect. Their kingdom's leaders would be much better advised to keep their weaklings safe and support their cultivation to the point that they become actually useful in a battle.

*5. Unmanageably Worthless Currency*

Treasures are routinely auctioned off at thousands or hundreds of thousands of the numeraire currency. Considering these are usually spirit stones or coins, this makes transactions unmanageable - imagine counting out ten thousand of anything - except for the Cultivators miraculously being able to instantly assess exact quantities and instantly bring out and store exact quantities, neither of which are skills which the Cultivators ever explicitly learn (and which decidedly does not seem to be an ability they could ever do with qi, given how qi works).

*6. Misguided Masters Losing Face by Caring about Face*

Masters seem to care so much about defending their disciples so they can keep face, but not so much about how much face they would lose from being known to shelter a known attempted (or in many cases actual) murderer or rapist (which their disciples oftentimes turn out to be) - which you'd think would cause a much greater loss of face. Nor do they seem to care enough to teach their disciples to avoid engaging in such disreputable actions.

*7. Auctions Without Protections*

Auction houses never seem to take any steps to protect their customers or give them anonymity. This results in young masters getting offended when others outbid them, and then they go and hunt down whomever made the winning bid and rob them of their winnings - which would just cause the auction house to develop a reputation as a deathtrap, and cause a chilling effect on bids since no one would dare to bid against the young masters, and no one would go unless they were sure they were the most powerful guy in town. Which means fewer customers for the auction house, poorer bids, and less profit.


** All your points are valid except number 3. Privatisation of knowledge is the basis of hegemony. You don't need money from the weak because with a strong technique you can just take what you want. You cannot do that if other are as strong as you. Thus you limit the amount of people you teach to those you are sure will remain allies (your sect or clan). And there is also the question of talent requirement to practice said technique. All in all I think it makes sense.

What doesn't however is those god-tier technique that completly ignore power scale and world building. Fuck those.

So what's the point of the army of weaklings again?

Army is supposed to defend the nation from inner and outer threats.

We've established that masses aren't a threat in xianxia novel - their rebellion means nothing, and it can easily be suppressed by a local mayor/ruler who is usually the strongest in the region. So no inner threats to defend from by using masses.

There are no outer threats that'd require an army either, I mean those other countries in poorly thought out xianxia novels also have an army of weaklings for some reason - but it's not rational for either side to have them if in the end the war will be decided by the skirmishes/duels of the rulers/strongest generals of the nation.

What'd make more sense is to have highly trained, elite spec ops with above average cultivation and with high utility/support skills to aid the generals in their skirmishes against the enemy generals.

What laws? The setting stars with this is "a dog eat dog world", individual power is the only law that matters - there's no government in the modern sense of it.

There's need in police to regulate, organize, and manage masses for sure, but that's not the job for an army. We're speaking about millions of soldiers here, who are soldiers for no reason, and who don't act as police.

Even the masses, in contrast to our world, in this one there will be almost no rebellions that aren't led by the cultivator because there's no chance for success. In xianxia world ultimately there's an unsurpassable difference in their power so no sane peasant would join a rebellion that is doomed to fail from the beginning. Again masses are no threat, and not even an inconvenience.

(Which any government would necessarily have in order to stay in power.) Sending an army of weak soldiers is a terrible military move even if there's a reasonable explanation for that army existing.

There are threats of different levels. Some are internal too. Army of certain level can take care of certain level of threats and the stronger people would only need to bother doing shit when it's really bad.

This is because not everyone always acts perfectly in their own self interest, and people near the end of their lifespan have no incentive towards further economic profit. So occasionally the best techniques would get published, then rapidly copied everywhere and there would be many copies.

Even if there /was/ a copyright system, without some mystical means of hunting down pirate copies there would be many copies of the most famous techniques everywhere.

It's like this. Some guy invents a martial arts technique. He gets strong and advances. Will he now sell his major advantage to his competitors? Fuck no. He'll keep it to himself and maybe give it to his kid or a single promising disciple. And they in turn will try to keep their technique as secret as possible, and murder anyone who either tries to leak it or has the unfortunate bad luck to learn it by mistake.

Nobody sells techniques unless they are so garbage that nobody powerful would bother with it. If the technique is actually useful, the second someone powerful gets it, he'll murder everyone else who might have knowledge of it.

You're still thinking from the point of view of a world with law and order. But these aren't. You basically have two scenarios. Either the buyer us weaker, in which case, why sell your better technique to him when he's naturally weaker and you can beat him and take his money. Or he's stronger, so why the hell is he going to bother paying you when he can just kill you and take the technique? Especially when the less people with good martial arts techniques around, the less competition there is. Why would anyone be dumb enough to teach other people how to murder them?

A handful of users who are all in the same clan and have very strict rules about inheritance. There is literally not a single cultivation novel where high level techniques relative to the current environment are not rare. Also, I think you are mistaking "I know what skill is" with "I have the in depth knowledge and training required to perform said skill".

Sure, everyone might know that when the white robed swordsage whips his sword super fast and it turns into a giant dragon its the Dragon Breath Ultimate Super Attack. But they don't know how it actually works. Especially the self created techniques that are basically a signature move, which also tend to be the most powerful.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

First, trading occurs with people of relatively equal strength. You have a high level axe, but you use swords, I have a pill that can save your kid from dying of poison, so we trade. If one side is stronger, they wouldn't bother trading.

Second, why else do you think so many cultivation currencies also double as cultivation resources? It's not worthless gold and silver, it's actually useful in itself. Which also helps with not getting your shit robbed because people who are so strong they can steamroll everyone generally no longer need that level of cultivation resource, so they won't bother.

It's a central theme of these novels that anyone who has a treasure and doesn't have the strength to protect it is begging to be fucked over. It's a basic premise of the culture. Time and time again its repeated in the novels that "a weak man's sin is holding a treasure".

Publishing the secret behind your clan's unbeatable righteous thunder fist cultivation technique is going to absolutely demolish their competitive advantage among other clans, so why would you do that?

Especially since there's no real way to tell the difference between a true copy of a secret manual, and a copy of a secret manual that's been intentionally manipulated by someone who's two realms ahead of you and basically has godlike mental capabilities.

I imagine that in a rational cultivating world, you'd be able to find pirated copies of any famous technique you'd care to name - and a hundred out of a hundred copies would be subtly incorrect, in a way that serves a transcendent cultivator somewhere.

** The way I've rationalized Xianxia is that the world is huge and the protagonist story is incredibly incredibly rare. Xianxia doesn't tell the story of a random person, it tells the story of the most powerful being in the universe and how they got there. Of the billions of worlds that exist, they're the one who found a rare technique, insulted a young master and didn't get squashed, found a weak organisation they could take down for their own gain and ect. Everything they do is by incredible strokes of fortunes. And meeting people on higher levels of cultivation they have had similar strokes of fortunes, eventually someone's luck runs dry and they die. But not the protagonist.

*** This is basically it. All xianxia MCs are one in a billion level lucky, and have basically Anthropic Principle'd their way to power (they got there because we're reading the story about the one that made it).

This is why they often talk about the "will of the heavens" or being "blessed by the heavens", they literally have luck of such a high level it looks like divine intervention from the outside.

The worlds in xianxia are, even when you adjust for the massive over-exaggeration that is a feature of the genre ("It wasn't too far, a mere 500,000 km away" [1.3 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon]) mind bogglingly huge - there are often nested multiverses of worlds, each with billions on billions of inhabitants. In the vast majority of cases, someone with the level of status of a young master of a chosen clan can do whatever they want without any repercussions, and so can their son and his son unto the tenth generation. Because the world is so huge and cultivators live so long, power blocs can last tens of thousands of years without interruption. They have literally a hundred generations of power to fall back on.

It's just their luck the MC is lucky enough to be the 1/1,000,000,000 person that can stand up to that through an escalatingly hilarious set of coincidental powerups.

Similarly, because the world is usually organized in tiers, while a Deva Tier cultivator could destroy an entire nation of Foundation Establishment cultivators, they would have no reason to do so, as that whole nation wouldn't have anything worth the Deva's time. Any magical reagents they need would be in the more spiritually powerful tier of nations in which the Deva lives, and naturally they are competing with other Devas for those resources.

Information control is also key. clans protect their bloodline abilities, and after 10,000 years of dominating the local area, most of the younger generations don't know their techniques are sub-par. After all, they have dominated all their opponents forever. Even if overall they have a D tier technique, everyone around them is using Fs or lower. How could they know this one ancient legacy had an A rank technique which the MC just happened to stumble upon?

While, fine, that can be an interesting story, doesn't actually contradict the OP's point. If we wanted to read stories driven by strange coincidences, we wouldn't be on [[/r/rational]].

*** I like this explanation because it sort of maps onto real life; if you took the most successful/powerful person in the world and tried to reverse engineer their method for success, a good chunk of it would be "be in the right place at the right time, take a lot of bets that are probably positive-EV, but also highly risky and happen to pay off due to factors and circumstances that are largely out of your control." In that respect, reading the story of a cultivator may not be so different from reading a biography of a successful entrepreneur.

Certainly, there are things that they could do to influence their chances of success within a certain range, but even if you're always making positive-EV bets, ultimately the difference between a person who takes a bet with 60/40 odds and wins everything versus someone who takes the same bet and loses everything comes down to the luck of the draw, to some extent. One would think that the person who's best at making positive-EV bets would always win in a sufficiently-iterated bet, but as the number of bets approaches infinity, the probability of complete [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin][ruin]] approaches 1.

****** I'd have to disagree there, there's so much disconfirming evidence to that statement it's crazy. Basically that's a comforting excuse people use to rationalize their situations even. While saying everybody that is rich has been born that way is flawed, so is denying nobody ever got rich without being born rich.

​

The rundown of how you get rich by normal means is: You take risks and open a business, it's a risk of money, time, status, health etc. With a business you can profit from other people's time as well as yours, then you as you grow you trade more overhaul labor for more money. You have extra money you can invest, some of those investments are successful things compound and snowball..

​

The thing is most businesses won't succeed, most people aren't willing to risk it, and many don't know it's possible because their 'map of reality' is incomplete or flawed.

******* If you look at the statistics (for the U.S.) it depends partially on how you define rich. There are a significant number of people making one or two hundred thousand a year who are self made, with parents who were merely middle class or less. It's possible to go to school and work hard and make that kind of money.

But once you start getting into serious wealth, the percentages of people who weren't born into wealth go down. Only about a third or so. (Meaning two thirds were born into the wealth.) This is because doing things like starting businesses costs a lot of money, money that the vast majority of the population simply does not have and cannot realistically obtain loans for because they don't have millions of dollars in collateral or wealthy connections willing to take a risk on them.

Wealth makes it easy to accumulate more wealth, which is why most of the wealthy in the U.S. didn't actually earn it. It takes strong progressive taxation to keep down the generational wealth accumulation to a point where most of the wealthy are first generation. It's something seen in some European countries.

******** When we are talking about hundred million dollar plus businesses and people I agree. Otherwise not really. The number of millionaires is relatively high, most above average businesses you see around town are worth more than a million.

​

Being a millionaire is not *that* difficult, people tend to not pay attention to the large numbers of people that are millionaires and focus only on the ultra rich billionaire and 100 million plus crowd they see on the media, when there are plenty of average intelligence people with million dollar plus networths everywhere.

Being ultra rich is unlikely, making and keeping few millions before you're 60 is somewhat reasonable, if you are not in the "employee / trading time for money paradigm" long term.

I'm not sure what sort of business you're imagining starting for less than $1,000, but that sounds like self employment, not something that is going to make anyone wealthy. To get wealthy in business (rather than as a skilled professional like a physician) you need people working for you whose work you skim profit from, making money parasitically from others without doing the work yourself. People can't realistically start things like that without already having wealth and the skills (and often connections) that come from a privileged upbringing.

The whole 'anyone who works hard can start a business and get rich' thing is a myth in the modern era. There are many obstacles in the way that ensure people with wealth and privilege succeed and people without those things never get the opportunity to try.

Yes, and no I didn't read it. I'm sorry this discussion doesn't really interest me that much. To make up for it let me tell you one of the intended uses for business loans you might not have thought of..

It can obviously be used to cover starting costs and the like, but also be used to help new business owners pay themselves for the first year or so while the business is unlikely to be profitable, allowing them to work on it full time.

BTW I said you could start a business with less 1000$ to get started with. There are obviously better options available if you're not broke and or have a good credit rating. And I'm sure you can google several stories of people starting profitable businesses without much starting capital.

The discussion started because it was stated / implied 'it's not possible', there is evidence against it, disconfirming evidence, therefore it is 'possible'.

​

It's a simple point I'm trying to make. You might argue the evidence is not ideal, and I'd agree, but it happens with enough frequency to be imho enough evidence to prove it is not 'impossible'.

The survivorship bias itself shows that the probability isn't 0.

It's an encouraging positive message, you'd generally expect a positive or neutral response from reasonable people, but that's not what tends to happen.

​

The response you generally get from some people is: No it's IMPOSSIBLE, only XYZ people could ever do it, that evidence is worthless, no amount of evidence you can ever provide will be enough to change my mind ever.

And often a fair bit of ad hominems and straw man attacks. Both of which you might or might not have just attempted..

It's been at least 2 days, probably more, and some people are still bothered enough to be messaging me about this. It's not even a topic I particularly care about, as I've repeatedly stated..

This is why people are insulted.

You're appealing to emotion and semantics in order to prop up an argument which, in the wider context, is used to justify why we shouldn't give help to those who need it. You're not the only cool head in the room, you're just paying more attention to the splinter in your neighbors eye than the plank in your own.

Pretending there isn't context to what you're saying, interpreting someone's words in the worst way possible rather than the most likely meaning, appealing to emotion... you're making invalid, deceptive arguments on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. If you're wondering why you're being downvoted it's because of that, not because we're too emotionally tied to this. We know these tricks, most of us had to unlearn them. You're not fooling anyone but yourself.

That's not all you implied and you should know it! Your "evidence" is invalid, it's anecdotal (which is technically bayesian evidence, but in most cases it's so marginal it's not worth taking into account). You're saying that our disagreement with you means we're unreasonable, not that your argument is flawed. Which, of course, is the actual reason. That's ad hominem, and you should know better. I promise you we'd respond better if you weren't constantly trying to pull shit like that. I don't think you realize this is what you're doing, but you need to do some introspection into the way you argue. Don't base your writing style on Yudkowsky, his sequences are literally a manifesto. They're not debate, and you should not debate in that way.

The jargon you use, the focus on the metaphor of a reality map, and the incomplete understanding/application of concepts makes me think you've read the LW sequences and stopped there. You need to do and learn more if you want to be better. For one thing, pay more attention to other people instead of dismissing them. Your first post in this chain is about you saying people don't try to start a business because they don't think it's possible. It's this sort of looking down on the "unenlightened" that makes me dislike LW. It's not that they're uninformed, it's that they're informed enough to know trying to start a business in their position is probably economic suicide. LW won't teach you real humility, and knowing every bias and game theory theorem in the world won't help you without it.

** 6: I notice this a lot in Chinese fiction in various guises, morality asymmetry/inconsistency: "I approve of your methods, but the moment I learn any recipients had any relationship to me you will have my undying hate and we cannot live under the same sky."

This seems to be linked to the cultural imperative to 'be filial'--you must side with your parents/master, you must side with your country, you must side with your childen/disciples, anything else is being a contemptible traitor. If you don't side with those above you, then you're an "ungrateful white-eyed wolf". If you don't side with those below you, then "Even tigers don't eat their young!".

That said, in the minds of protagonists there is often hypocrisy--any relation who isn't partial in favor of a protagonist will be demonised as heartless/disloyal, whereas any non-relation who is partial in favor of one of their relations will be sneered at as being immoral.

One also sees protagonists using the same sorts of methods against others that they themselves have in the past sought vengeance for--"I feel the actions are appropriate, I feel hatred and vengeance is an appropriate response, now when I'm doing these same sorts of actions the important thing is to 'remove the roots' by thorough child-killing so that there's no appropriate hatred and vengeance towards me.". ...Hmm, Godfather rules.

I always feel a little mystified when the same character is completely unemotional when they're doing something to someone else, incredibly emotional when the same thing is (unrelatedly) done to them, and yet at no point seems to show any signs of cognitive dissonance.

*** This, pretty much. Went through point-by-point to indicate how this is true, in a hopefully non-spoiler-y way.

#+begin_quote
  *1. Picking a Fight Without Knowing Enemy Capabilities*
#+end_quote

In FMoC, anyone who isn't characterized as an idiot is extremely careful about this. Any faction worth mentioning has extensive intel capabilities, and even with that kind of information, experienced cultivators are still reluctant to casually feud with each other, just in case their intel is wrong. After all, hidden secret techniques and life-saving talismans are fairly abundant, so you can never be sure that you have the advantage in an 'even' fight... and if you were to bully a notably weaker party with your higher-realm skills, you'd probably incur the wrath of their allies.

#+begin_quote
  *2. Inexplicably Surviving Weakling Organizations*
#+end_quote

It's a less dog-eat-dog world than most cultivation stories, and the government of cultivators respond to a middling cultivator wiping out a small sect in much the same way modern governments respond to public mass murder (re: they send teams of highly-trained and well-equipped specialists to kill or capture the murderer). As such, this almost never happens, which means that weakling organizations have their niche.

#+begin_quote
  *3. The Worst Techniques are the Most Popular*
#+end_quote

Not true; in FMoC, there are plenty of good techniques offered freely by the government for the purpose of building the skills of young cultivators. At the same time, though, truly powerful techniques are the lifeline and primary income source of many sects. This might mean that they jealously guard their secrets (to make more money from their monopoly), but it often means that said high-end technique is a specialized one that requires a lot of lower-level training first before it becomes viable, and so can't be taught to everyone. 'Bad' techniques aren't in widespread use, but the 'best' techniques are viewed as the treasures they are, and the time of the experts willing and able to teach them is valued appropriately.

#+begin_quote
  *4. Armies of Useless Weaklings*
#+end_quote

Cultivators could fight lots of weaklings at once, and win... but FMoC notes that it costs them to fight on such a high level, and the spiritual energy they burn to do so can run out. Enough 'weaklings' can actually defeat a powerful cultivator through attrition, so it helps to have more of your own 'weaklings' to fight their 'weaklings', allowing your powerful cultivators to save their strength for the most important targets.

#+begin_quote
  *5. Unmanageably Worthless Currency*
#+end_quote

In FMoC, the credit chip has been invented. There are many ways of transferring wealth that don't involve handing over a literal mountain of low-grade spirit stones. That said, cultivators that have a need to work with large quantities of materials do in fact develop skills for quickly assessing the quantity and quality of those materials, and likely carry magic items that aid in storage and retrieval.

#+begin_quote
  *6. Misguided Masters Losing Face by Caring about Face*
#+end_quote

Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that sect masters in FMoC are well aware that the deeds of their disciples reflect upon them, and that there are multiple instances of them reacting appropriately to inappropriate behavior by a junior.

#+begin_quote
  *7. Auctions Without Protections*
#+end_quote

The existence of a strong central government helps to mitigate the "bitter and murderous loser" problem, but there are also plenty of magical items that promote anonymity, for the shadier sort of markets that would benefit from it. There is also at least one case in which an auction dispute is resolved amicably via mutually-beneficial trade.

***** The early part of FMoC is a rather deliberate deconstruction of a lot of xianxia tropes. e.g. what are the consequences for a society where all these cultivation tools are still lying around and accumulate in dumps, etc.

There are some good elements of this that survive throughout. The crystal suits and other high-tech fantasy elements are quite well grounded compared to most ideas in this literature, and for the most part the protagonist has to actually face hard challenges and situations in an oblique way to get ahead, rather than just fight someone one power-level above him in a tournament every 5 chapters like most of the genre.

Later on, it starts to drag in a lot of the standard escalation machinery out of the genre, and does a ton of setting-switching whenever the author gets bored and needs a larger stage. It is also not immune to the protagonist getting by on a metric ton of luck, but it actually lampshades this in the story and the fact that people have these special chances and society destroying calamities is explicitly built into the structure of the universe the story takes place.

It does however, seem to have more of an overall arc and "message" that most of the genre lacks, but the delivery of that message seems a bit non-rationalist, despite being enjoyed in rationalist circles.

*tl;dr* FMoC is somewhat refreshing if you've read a lot of xianxia, but if you haven't the tropes it tries to deconstruct aren't ones you'll have had much exposure to.

** I'm not especially familiar with the genre, are points 1, 3, and 6 presented positively? Finances I could see being purely an oversight, and military logistics probably should be thought through more thoroughly, but the rest of this sounds like the foolishness of the characters is intentional on the part of the author. 1 sounds like the most stock parable on kindness to strangers ever. Yeah it's stupid to make enemies when you don't know how powerful they might be, but making enemies of strangers is a thing people do in reality. The worst techniques being most commonly used sounds like a parable about innovation vs tradition. Yes, market forces would tend to encourage the better techniques to spread, but market forces do not act instantaneously and new innovations have to come from somewhere. Protagonists are by nature exceptional individuals, and sometimes that means that they're innovators, and can use whatever new technique they've found/discovered/invented for quite some time before their enemies are able to adapt. The people failing to search out more sophisticated techniques adequately are not being rational of course, but I don't think the story is claiming otherwise. Lazy traditionalism is a thing in real life too, and it isn't rational here either, but it still happens. And I can tell immediately from your description of point 6 that these masters are not people we're expected to be rooting for. They're the villains, they'll tend to do things that are wrong, sometimes even obviously wrong and foolish. The question isn't whether what they're doing is right, or even whether it's smart, it's whether it's realistic. I don't know enough about the honor culture involved, but just off the top of my head I can think of a few examples of people proving themselves hypocrites in the name of defending "their" people against outsiders without regard for justice. The Catholic Church does it all the time. As long as it's a thing real people sometimes do, I don't think you can call it unrealistic for a villain to do it.

To me it sounds like these stories are not especially more irrational than comparable Western fantasy settings. Most of your complaints seem to be about the behavior of the characters being irrational, when that isn't really a valid criticism of the work itself. The character is not the author, especially villain characters.

For the rest of it, with regard to the finances and military logistics being less well thought out than you'd like, I'm afraid that's just conservation of detail for you. The weak organizations and weak armies especially are obviously just canon fodder for the protagonist to pulp, and any further explanation just doesn't exist. So yeah, the stories are irrational in that sense.

But even though this sub is about rational fiction, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with some stories not being rational fiction. As long as nobody's claiming that it is or posting it here, it could get away with being far more irrational before it became unreadable for most people.

Xianxia authors LOVE to exaggerate, whether it is the size of something (medieval period cities that are the size of North America), how obscenely huge the damage spells & martial arts moves inflict to money.

In fact what regularly happens with money is the numbers become so vastly inflated (dealing in millions or billions of <currency>) that every few hundred chapters the author simply introduces a new currency that the next tier up of people deal exclusively in.

** You should read Immortal Mortal. There's a lot of aswers to such things there. Just beware the huge drop of quality near the end, and the unfinished feeling at the end.

But on your points:

Usually, good resources are monopolised ruthlessly by powerful entities, either cultivators, sects or countries. They control the access to such resources, but are somewhat kept in check by other rivals. Thus, they need to keep their best forces at hand to secure what they already have.

As such, they recruit and prop up subsidiary entities in order to obtain more resources, and if something good appears, they attempt to take over, either pacifically, through marriages and alliances, politically by sending elder and protectors to get control, or ruthlessly through killing. Meanwhile, the subsidiary sect benefits by getting any leftovers that the main sect can spare, or subpar/reliable techniques that don't require being a super genius to cultivate, even if they aren't as effective.

But not everyone wishes to become a subsidiary of a power. Some choose to go to areas considered as "wilderness", away from the main powers and the established, "civilized", cultivation world.

They tend to have some very outdated techniques, and most sects that atempt this fail and disband or die horribly. But sometimes, they prosper, finding some resource to trade with others. They have to balance their small sucess with avoiding the interest of stronger entities, like subsidiary sects or disciples of a decent power. Also, natural selection and enviroment tends to make the survivors improve their techniques somewhat.

This need of trading resources takes us to the Auctions. Those are usually established by a semi - independent power, but are deeply probed by the bigger powers all the time. Most transactions won't interest any of those entities, but MC's tend to deal with very interesting and rare resources.

The amount of currency traded on those auctions is usually resources obtained from several subsidiaries as tribute, acumulated for decades and centuries, or results of plunder between cultivators. Due to the nature of regular cultivation, outside MC's and geniuses, people tend to have difficulty advancing, and lesser resources often are very innefective at raising your power. So, it's better to trade them on a powerful weapon, or get better resources for improvement even at a extortionate rate of exchange. A vertical growth, if you consider.

On the other hand, some power prefere to raise horizontally, raising more disciples and sending them after renmants of previous civilizations after better techniques, or attempting to create new techniques from scratch by mass recruiting and teaching slightly different versions of the technique (that often cripples the disciples cultivations, cause madness, or make them explode).

So, the logic of the xianxia is an ultra captalistic, amoral setting. Pretty close to cyberpunk, really.

** Some of these complaints can be answered by appealing to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_analysis][logic of the situation]]. Not every decision should be done on a realpolitik, /homo economicus/ basis.

Look at it through the lens of "face" and some of these things cohere.

*Picking a fight without knowing their capability* -- well what is impressive about picking a fight only once you know you can win it? More important is showing a willingness to throw down, anytime, any place. No insult will be tolerated, even if it is likely you'll get your ass kicked.

*Inexplicable weakling organisations* -- perhaps these organisations have survived by virtue of having good face, i.e. seeming more powerful (or at least more troublesome) than they really are.

*Worst Techniques are Popular* - this is one of the key elements of face that seem irrational from the outside: the concept of "everybody knows". If "everybody knows" X martial art is the best, you open yourself up to scorn and humiliation if you don't practise it - even if you have firm proof that it actually sucks! Hell, this happens all the time in real-life. Look at the idea of "skeuomorphism" in design circles. It's fallen so much out of favour that even if a designer finds a good application of it today, they'll probably seek a different approach because "everybody knows..."

*Armies of Useless Weaklings* - in terms of actual usefulness, very dumb yes. In terms of face, a small-but-elite army "looks" pathetic. So it can't be done. An army of a million mooks "looks" mighty. So it's de rigueur.

*Losing Face by Caring about Face* - you have to /care/ about face, all the time! No matter what kind of stupid hole it gets you into. You can never admit error, withdraw a claim, voluntarily lower yourself by even /one/ rung on the ladder of esteem. You have to be always right and have always been right. It is illogical in a long-term sense - you'd ultimately gain more face if you nipped your mistakes in the bud, so to speak. But because face is so oriented around perception, specifically others' perception, you can never seem to show to look to not care about it. (If that makes sense.)

And yeah, you can totally say "well, face is a stupid concept". And yeah, by and large I'd agree. But at the same time, if that's how you feel...xianxia fiction is just not the genre for you.

*** The thorough answer to this question basically encompasses the answer to "What is Xianxia?", but trying to be concise:

Cultivators are a xianxia's settings magic users/martial artists/etc. They 'cultivate' by manipulating their ki/chakra/mana/chi/whatever to become stronger over time, learning new abilities and gaining power. A normal setting conceit is that cultivators keep on scaling up until the author gets bored and the story ends, usually after getting stronger by factors like 10x or 100x /dozens of times over/ - they start out at the level of 'badass humans' and eventually hit the level where individual punches destroy planets and then they /keep going/.

the common magic system is "cultivation."

there are 2 premises than i can think of: * one that there are impurities in the world in general and in humans in particular,

*two there is chi flowing in the world, that a awakened individual (cultivator) can draw inside its body through meditation and breathing techniques (cultivation), into chi channels called meridians and towards a nucleus caled dantian, behind the navel. the drawing of that chi can purify the body removing the impurities and strenghten the individual. once inside that chi can be used to power techniques from the sho ryu ken to naruto's rasengan.

eventualy a cultuvator has removed enough impurities to leave this planes of existence and finding more chi rich worlds, here most novels fall into idiotic power creep.

** Lol.

Part of the problem is that you are considering these things from a Western, modern perspective. And the while point of Xianxia is that it's very much NOT that.

1. Picking fights without knowing enemy capabilities.

The whole point of this trope is that the reader knows something the characters in the story don't. Either the MC is deliberately hiding his power, or he appears much weaker than he truly is. By the perspective of the idiot who is about to kick an iron plate, he thinks he knows the capability, he's just wrong. And that's perfectly rational. People make mistakes and misjudge others all the damn time. It's how human brains work, you see a pattern 1000 times and you assume 1001 is gonna be exactly the same.

1. Inexplicably surviving weak organizations.

They aren't actually weak though. In reference to their peers, they are fine. Sure, a big badass from far away could ruin them. But that's like saying Jeff Bezos could bankrupt some random local rich guy. He could, but why would he? Bezos is on a different level and his circle should normally never interact with the small fry. Also, a key theme in many xianxia is the idea of the circle of life and how that operates not just for individuals but also for organizations. So let's say some guy gets strong and starts a sect. The sect in his lifetime and maybe his kid's and grandkids' will stay strong and even grow stronger. But eventually a loser will become the heir or their rivals will in turn have a badass of their own, and then the sect begins its path to oblivion. Internal fights start, people care more for their own benefits than for helping the organization, until it collapses. And then some other group takes over and starts the cycle again. Xianxia just generally revolves around that inflection point where the balance of power is at a tipping point, because that's more interesting.

1. The worst techniques are the most popular.

Again, you have to remember that xianxia is generally set in a medieval style world. Where IP protection isn't a thing. If someone with a badass technique tell other people the details, they'll just pirate it and sell their own copies and he'd get diddly. Worse, then they'd come back and kill the first guy to reduce the competition, and since he just gave away his fighting secrets, they'd know his weaknesses and be able to kill him more easily. Only a strong government would able to prevent this, and these world are generally set in a chaotic anarchy where that government doesn't exist.

1. Armies of useless weaklings

First, a lot of novels have formations. Where basically multiple weaklings can join together and enhance their strength. Second, even in the novels where formations aren't a thing, it would be dumb to rely on the 1 strong guy to do literally everything. Sure, he'll be available when you need to fight your nation state rival. But its a waste of his time to call him just to arrest a thief. Or guard the front door. Or any number of minor things that needs a fighter to do. Especially since in cultivation, you need to spend lots of time in solitary meditation to get stronger. So if you waste your time on petty nonsense, whilw your rival has been contemplating the secrets of the universe, the next time you fight, he'll have leveled up and will straight up murder you and then kill or enslave everyone you love. Third, generally when weaklings get used in battle, it's because the top dogs are equally matched. So if the big guy is tied up, are you just gonna let the other side send a bunch of weaklings to rape burn and loot while he's too busy? No, you send your own weaklings to counter thier weaklings.

1. Unmanageably worthless currency

Yeah, this is just Xianxia inflation at its finest. Generally though I assume the author is glossing over the counting. Cause who wants to write about bookkeeping minutiae?

1. Misguided masters losing face by caring about face

Yeah, again the point here is that all these novels are set in worlds where might makes right. The point of face isn't just about being virtuous or having a good reputation. It's literally a deterrent to getting attacked because the other guy knows you will fuck his shit up if he does. And you know the best way to lose that deterrent? Be seen as weak because you didn't defend your property. Then every motherfucker thinks he can get a piece.

1. Auctions without Protections

Nah, most auctions in these novels have protections. They just tend to end that protection right at the door. Again, its face saving. You want to establish that people can't just rob blatantly, but you know you can't actually protect EVERYONE, especially from people just as strong as you. So there is an unspoken understanding that you protection ends at the door, so the strong folks won't be tempted to test your strength since they can simply wait a bit and rob when their target leaves.

*** well I can tell you that having read western fantasy, my pet peeves are:

1. Magic is almost always seen as dangerous or evil/bad (ie the entire supernatural / paranormal genre)
2. Magic is almost always low tier (not tons of magic being thrown around), most characters in these stories use little to no magic

And xianxia avoids that.

Anyway, the points you're stating, while valid, only shows that the series were intended for a power trip fun. In other words, they were made for boys. It's like criticizing Transformer movies for not making much sense. Which is silly. Boys want excitement of triumphing over their rival/opponent. Preferably leaving the loser forever subdued, never again fighting back. Little boys inside of us want that too. It's just exposure to more logically sound works made us see those wanton no longer satisfying. I'd say it's a call to leave the genre behind.

Agreed. I think this discussion relates to the concept of a [[https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27382][bent world]]. Just like comics have odd rules like how Batman can't kill the Joker no matter how bad he is, Xianxia has odd rules about how everything is bigger, stupider, crueler, etc. And since it evolved separately from Western fantasy, it is bent in different ways.

***** There are easily 100 million words worth of material translated with this phrasing in just xianxia literature. Before xianxia novels, Taoism has been talking about cultivation/xiuzhen (修真) of qi in some form for a much, much longer time.

Their conception around this is the desire to grow spirit to/from qi, qi into emptiness, emptiness into tao. Basically any way to attempt to turn health into spirituality and vice versa and grow (cultivate) both in the process.

The terminology of cultivation from taoism is well entrenched. Your personal objection seems unlikely to move folks for whom that analogy is exactly what is intended.

On top of that there is a penchant for describing creatures that either are 30km tall or are able to grow to that size when they want to, as an homage to the monkey king's proportions.

The units there aren't necessarily intended to be taken literally, but more as literary tropes, it is a rather different literary tradition.

I think the main thing to consider is when your characters get to be more powerful than superman a third of the way through the novel and there are quadrillions of them, the only thing you can reasonably do to get any form of stability is to expand the scale of the worlds your characters live in to give them room to exist.

*** Technically this could be a possibility for artificial worlds. You can take a star (or gas giant) and build a shell at the 1-gee point, which you could then walk on. Strong enough materials to build a static shell that wouldn't collapse don't exist, so it has to be a dynamic structure. The shell could either be held up by massively energetic orbital loops (large amounts of material moving faster than orbital velocity and transferring the momentum to the shell via magnetic field), or you could have the shell be reflective on the inner surface and be held up by radiation pressure.

For the Sun, a structure called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_bubble][Dyson bubble]] that balances radiation pressure against gravity would be extremely thin, about 0.78 grams per square meter, and would most likely be set up quite a bit further from the Sun than the 1-gee point (which is ridiculously hot and close). It would most likely serve as a power collector, not a habitat, and would be composed of many independent units rather than a single shell. However, a 1-gee habitat shell this has been suggested as being more feasible for [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04376][white dwarfs]].

**** Those worlds are often more akin to other dimensions, with different levels of power in those laws.

Often, in some novels I've read, when a cultivator becomes too powerful, he starts being constrained by the laws of his world and compelled to seek a new world or dimension where his power can grow. Otherwise, he risks falling to a tribulation of that lesser world rejecting him.

More or less like those Worlds have some innate power, and unless you are much more powerful than that world to suppress it's laws, they will limit your power severily, putting something like an effective cap on your power.

The other possibility is that, instead of being hard limited by the World, they have to go to another place because the laws of lesser worlds are imperfect, and keeping cultivating there will result in an incomplete development and loss of power in comparison to cultivators that moved away.

** 1 and 6 regularly happen IRL, that's not a worldbuilding problem. Those are mistakes people regularly make, it's only an issue if you're trying to write someone who would be the type to avoid this or has lasted long enough that they know better.

I... /kind/ of agree with 3, but a technique is powerful because it's stronger than what everyone else has, so when it becomes common it's no longer so useful. So, if you're expecting ever have to use it, you'd want to keep it to yourself. The only people selling techniques are those with a better one. Also:

#+begin_quote
  There's a reason why in the real world it's the best strategies and products that are the most widely used.
#+end_quote

This is wrong, the best products are typically the most expensive and rarely used. The /best/ strategies are usually nearly impossible to figure out due to the massive search space, so we settle for good.

5 is solved by having denominations of currency. If you mean they're bartering in an auction, that would be a problem. Any functioning civilization probably has some form of currency.

For 7 it seems like you're seeing a rare scenario happen for the sake of plot, most people aren't willing to kill over losing an auction and those who are would probably get themselves killed fairly soon from recklessness.

Only if you pick and choose what parts of the argument to take to their logical conclusion (and not even then, because archery has existed worldwide for a very long time). Here's a better example: until they got modern weaponry, the Chinese military was completely outclassed by the Japanese and European ones. Today they're not. A technological (or technique) advantage is only an advantage when you have that knowledge and your enemy doesn't. If everyone knows your fancy technique, if it's better than what they used before they'll use it and now everyone has an equally strong technique. You're no longer hitting harder or defending better than everyone else.

#+begin_quote
  well it depends what you're talking about.

In general you have to make some trade offs, and one of the things that is often traded off is cost to produce something. Most of the time you can get better quality for more cost up to a point. That point is usually beyond what most people can afford. You can always find some obscure counter-example to a "rule" like this, the point is that it holds often enough to be useful.

- Not doing anything about mental health is more popular than using effective/healthy strategies to maintain it/improve it
