  So the Arlesite prince, he walks up to her, and says ‘Good woman, I will duel you for this stew'. She refuses, because really fuck Arlesites.

** Did NOT see that coming on Malicia's end, awesome chapter!

Also loved Cat's “I would hope not" comeback to Cordelia. Damn, that feels good to have the same words flipped around to her this time around!

  Then, calmly, Dread Empress Malicia emerged from the bundle in her mind that was her impersonation of a Keteran servant and became herself again.

Ohhh shiiiiiit. I did not see that one coming.

Also, how did Cat know Malicia had won anyway?

ALSO, eating the baby is a reference to killing Cat, yeah?

*** I'm glad not only that Cat didnt murder Malicia but that Malicia out planned her. Malicia was set up as a supremely competent character and i was worried the story was going to have Cat wipe the floor with her in a way that didn't feel deserved. The kind of layered fail safe's we saw here are very much the Malicia i was hoping for.

*** I don't think it's a reference to killing Cat. Instead, its a note about how the Dead King is going to gain power. We remember that his rise came from him out playing the wandering bard, having to play war and politics perfectly to rise. This time, rather than try to gain power any of the normal ways, like the others in the bar do, he's going to eat the baby, satisfy his lust for power in a way that is utterly foreign to anyone else. I can only hope it will be worth the wait (and that the bard isn't lying)

Maybe something to do with that conversation with the dead king we skipped over? Felt a bit jarring that we jumped from his dramatic entrance straight to cat leaving. If it is that we'll probably learn about it when we swap back to cat's viewpoint.

**** It's another talk like the one between the Grey Pilgrim and Akua: all of Catherine's sentences can be interpreted both as ones directed at Athal and Malicia:

#+begin_quote
  “Negotiations can fail,” the dark-haired woman replied. “I knew it was one of the possible outcomes even before I learned there'd be opposition.”

  “Now you sound like him,” the Black Queen said, rolling her eyes. “I can realize when I've been outbid. Malicia was always going to be willing to go that extra mile I'd balk at. We'll see in a year whether the Dead King feels like riding a different horse.”

  “I'm freeing you as of right now,” the young woman said, and clapped his shoulder gently. “That should be within my rights, I think. And you're certainly welcome to tag along, if you want.”

  “Callow,” she said. “Back home.”

  That'd been a lie, he thought. The tells were there, though much harder to pick up on than before. There must have been more to her short conversation with the herald of the Crown than a mere dismissal.

  “I'm not going to make you, Athal,” she said patiently. “I genuinely think you'll be better off with us, but I can see why you wouldn't want to leave and I'm not going to force you. I meant it, when I said you're free. You can decide for yourself.”

  “I guessed that'd be your answer,” she said. “You were a kind and pleasant host, Athal. I hope you'll be treated as you deserve here.”

*** Honestly, does it matter?

We don't need it to be part of the secret conversation. It's only reasonable. Cat knows Malicia has a method of talking to the Dead King, and vice-versa. Even killing her 'meat puppet' wouldn't really ruin any deals. She could simply say "I agree to your terms" and, if necessary, send another representative or go herself to sign. Just being stopped *now* doesn't mean her plan would be stopped.

It's a curious game. The only winning move is not to play. So she flips the table and storms out before Malicia keeps letting him get away with more and more.

That would kind of defeat the entire purpose of the plan then, wouldn't it? (Not that it was a particularly good one even without that assumption). But Cat and co. actually /didn't/ believe this was pointless before or after they killed the puppet:

#+begin_quote
  Regardless, it'd been a priority to find out whether we were dealing with the actual Empress or a puppet. From a narrow perspective, it didn't matter which it was if we managed to slaughter them all anyway: the result would still be us with the only bidder at the Dead King's auction.
#+end_quote

/Chapter 37: Offing/

#+begin_quote
  “Indeed,” Hakram agreed. “We can only hope the Dead King will be not be too affected by that tragedy to resume negotiations.”

  I grunted in agreement, dropping into an iron chair on the other side of the table.
#+end_quote

/Chapter 47: Culmination/

So there was definitely a reveal sometime between this chapter and the last. Honestly I'm bummed we missed it, I think it's a moment that's going to lead to some character growth.

***** They killed the puppet to /end the bidding war/. The Dead King wasn't going to waste his time spending days talking to Malicia through the communication spells. IF they took her out, they could then offer better terms, she couldn't, and they could agree. But they decided that was too risky.

I'm pretty sure we'll get the reveal at some point. I'm banking on it being the 'bonus' at the beginning of the month.

** I find myself pondering again and again what Bard's story is a metaphor for. There are a few I can think of... the innkeeper represents the Gods, who basically say "You can fight for what you want." TDK is, well, TDK. But who do the rest represent?

First thought: The Princes are the sides of the war. Arlesite is proud and formal and not too bright - my first thought was that he represents Procer. Cordelia may be smart, but the Procerans in general seem pretty foolish and haughty, convinced they're stronger and that their enemies will play by the rules. Alamans is haughty, entitled, and snobbish; that's the Praesi to a T. And the Lycanoese is spiteful and wants to deny TDK even if it's not in his own interest. Callow loves them some grudges and spite. The soup in the metaphor is land - they're all fighting over claiming some ground and assume TDK wants it too. But no, TDK wants the baby - which represents people. More useful resources he can use for his future purposes.

Second thought: The Princes are all parts of the Crusade. Arlesite is none too bright and prepared to easily win a straight-up fight: this is the traditional blustering Procerans and the heroes convinced they can win honorably in frontal assaults. Alamans represents the entitled princes thinking they're owed their due for no reason other than that they're nobles. And Lycanoese is Cordelia (and possibly GP), who actually knows where the true threat lies and (thinks she knows) what it wants. Cat is the woman, the soup is Callow, and the baby... I don't know. It might represent the future, but of Procer alone or Calernia itself, I'm unsure.

  Agnes had been quite clear that doom was gathering south, and the League's intentions were damnably opaque.

#+begin_quote
  The darkness went away, and the First Prince of Procer was left with nothing but fury and fear. /Doom to the north/, Agnes had said.

  She was never wrong.
#+end_quote

​

Does this mean that Agne's power is (at least partially) to retroactively make others think that she was right?

​

I mean this cannot be the whole of her Name, for otherwise Assassin would have been able to take down Hasenbach.

​

What kind of shenanigans can one commit if others are convinced that you are infallible?

** While I am morally speaking on the side of Good, and Hasenbach is a competent ruler and a decent enough a person, I've come to dislike her intensely through these conversations with Cat.

She is so hypocritical and entiteled.

"you would let thousands die for petty arrogance?"

Seriously? To your enemy whose lands you are invading?
