** /tl;dr - In this post I entertain myself with extremely silly rules-lawyering./

So I was reading chapter 4 and I realized that the initiation rules--which are the same here as in canon--are written poorly.

The first person you make eye contact with is your partner, so what happens if Alice and Bob make eye contact followed by Bob and Charlie locking eyes? Using a hyper-literal reading of the rules, Alice would be Bob's partner, Bob would be Alice's partner, Bob would /also/ be Charlie's partner, and yet Charlie would /not/ be Bob's partner. This, of course, violates the symmetry property that the "is a partner to" relation is presumed to have, as well as what you might call the "exclusivity" property, i.e. each person can only be a partner to one other person (formally: for all x, y, and z such that x is a partner to y, x is a partner to z if and only if z = y). The rules should've said, "the first person you make eye contact with /who has not already made eye contact with anyone/."

And while I was writing this, it occurred to me that the rules as written would also allow you to look in a mirror and partner with /yourself/. It doesn't say, "the first /other/ person." XD

** He's not a good or engaging writer, but I suppose he at least deserves credit for putting a lot of effort into this.

*** It gets worse. The character becomes less likable and makes bad unilateral decisions for no apparent reason. I read to the end a couple weeks ago, but I'm glad it died, and irritated I wasted my time like that.

**** Yeah, it was ok until the Schnee Gala, afterwards it went down in quality.

** This was submitted a year ago, but it's had semiregular updates since then and I felt it might be worthwhile to get it back in the public eye. Expect a PTSD-filled SI with the attendant paranoia and shortsighted coldness, but s lot of intricate plotting and smart action. Does a good job of making the world of RWBY feel actually complete. Think of this as a slightly worse Shinobi: Team 7, but for RWBY and with an SI.

** Huh. I kinda thought I'd found most of the gems this fandom had to offer. Time to see if there's something worth reading in this that's not TGWP or Coeur Al'Aran

*** It's not at Coeur levels, but I think it's at around TGWP levels of enjoyability. (Also, /damn/ do I hope broken blades becomes one of those gems eventually :p)

**** Yea, BB is too new for me to judge yet. I'll wait until it hits 75 k and is past the first RWBY season (or the equivalent)

***** Whichever comes first, or when both of those are satisfied? If the former, it should be 6-8 more chapters. If the latter, I'll be almost through arc(season) 2 by then.

****** When both are satisfied. I'd like it to be long enough that I get a good feel for the story and its pacing. I'd also like to see how it handles canon events. RWBY season 1 is pretty short as far as most seasons of things go so it shouldn't take very long to go through it. Of course, this is fanfic, so things like length and pacing are subject to change.

So I'll be waiting until you're almost done arc 2 then, which is fine. :)
