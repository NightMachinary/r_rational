  Let's say you want to go to a recommendation thread, perhaps [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dy4bm2/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/][this one]]. And then, because you're in a particular mood for a particular type of story, you comment this:

  I would like anti-Nazi stories and/or fanfics. Methods has some of this, as there is within it the obvious allegory in that irrational hatred of the mudblood, but it would be nice if there were some rational stories where that theme is made more explicit, and the position of obvious evil deconstructed, for that happens all so rarely.

  [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dy4bm2/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f7ybj7a/][Here's the permalink to that]].

  What would you say if this particular comment were ... quietly removed? The mods make no fuss about it, you're not messaged, /no one's/ messaged, and yet the mods remove a comment asking for stories that have anti-Nazi themes in them.

  This seems disastrous. I believe this place is making a turn, one which cannot easily be undone. I do not say lightly that the things I have seen recently trend toward /evil/. I was content to lurk until I made my little test.

  And now it has been failed. Observations recorded. Evidence found. So /what conclusion should I make/?

That comment wasn't removed by human moderation. Instead, it quickly exceeded a report threshold, apparently by users who saw that this was a new account asking about things that have recently been creating Drama. You didn't get a message because Automod isn't configured to send messages; instead Automod sends a message to the mods for manual review, and since the mods aren't on all the time, sometimes it takes some time for a message to be reinstated.

In this case, since your account is approximately ten hours old, and since you admit that this was a test rather than being a good faith request, I'm going to give you an indefinite ban and leave your comment removed, because I don't like dealing with people deliberately attempting to stir shit. If your first resort wasn't to immediately make a meta post calling this subreddit evil, I would have reinstated it with a mod message about how no rules had been broken, but you've lost the benefit of the doubt here. If the context were different, I would feel differently.

Note that there are no rules in this subreddit against discussing themes of a work, even if those themes are political, so long as you're not using it as an excuse to talk about the normal tribal politics stuff. If a work is transphobic, you are perfectly able to discuss that. If there are fascist themes, we won't prohibit discussing them. Many works of fiction, especially speculative fiction, bring up moral and political questions, and to bar that discussion would be foolish and make this subreddit a worse place. What we /don't/ want is people using this place as yet another launching board for their own political opinions. If you're thinking about discussing a work using the words "the left" or "the right" or any named politician (unless they're actually in the work), reconsider what you're about to type, and be warned that there's a fair chance your comment will be removed, by automated processes or otherwise. (And we certainly aren't going to let anyone automate injection of their political opinion into posts, in case that was in question.)

If anyone has a question about moderation, note that it's much better to message the mods than make a meta post. Sometimes it's just Automod being garbage, sometimes something else.

(/This/ post was removed because new accounts aren't allowed to make top level posts, and it's staying removed for the above reasons.)
