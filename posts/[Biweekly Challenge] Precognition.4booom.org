*** <snerk> Amusing.

Thirty minutes after a simulation begins, when the present catches up to the start of a simulation, is she able to split her awareness attention between her actions in the simulation and her actions in the present without both suffering? (Or do the simulations not last longer than 30min generally?) In the first place, how accurately is she able to remember her words from subjectively thirty minutes ago, boredom aside?

Hmm. Why spend time playing poker and then bet the winnings on a single roulette number, rather than bring in money and make the same bet on the first winning number?

Also, do the slot machines not require an external electricity supply? Are jackpots frequent enough that she can 'steal' a jackpot that someone else would have gotten, or does she have to tediously try every slot machine a certain number of times to see if one gives a jackpot? (The 'two times': coincidence, or did she come because she already knew from a news report that someone was going to win there? --But how could she hear a news report inside the bounded simulation?)

#+end_quote

She cannot split her awareness, but she /can/ "fast-forward" through a vision - which amounts to experiencing 30min in an (objective) instant. Which is a ridiculously broken power, but she kind of needs it to make the story work (otherwise she's just a Coil variant).

#+begin_quote

Not very accurately. 1stVision!Mark was already dead by the point the story began. But on-screen!Mark didn't realize that, and Agatha doesn't really care.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Roulette doesn't work very well with her power. The slightest perturbation could make the ball fall somewhere different. Poker is a more reliable money-maker (she can just look at the cards while the other players are freaking out about the dark void). But that day, she just happened to walk past the roulette when, for some reason (e.g. a debris on the wheel) the outcome became predictable. So she jumped at the chance to multiply her winnings.

Same reasoning with the slot machines. Maybe she has a habit of trying out all the machines on her way in just in case.

And yeah, this is a pretty tedious way to make money. I'm sure Agatha's power can be munchkined /much/ more efficiently. Possibly she's just not very smart.

***** Thank you for the reply! (This has also been fun to continue to think about.)

A thought: In the Omega box-choosing thought experiment, by choosing a box you can effectively influence the well-informed prediction about which box you would pick. Here, however, if you're real then however much you try to wreck the conversation it will still end well for her. Trying to make the conversation end well only has the potential payoff of preventing a simulation after yours, if you're a simulation.

By the same reasoning, it's arguably in his interests to make a try for intercourse whether or not he's a simulation--it will only happen in reality if she wants it to, but in a simulation it could make a difference to how you spend your last minutes (and for how long, and whether you could build a favourable(?) emotional connection).

Going-well-for-her aside, it should set off warning bells when she's not telling both the simulation and the real that they're real from the beginning, as one would predict she'd try lots of different conversations and choose the one that gave the best results for her by, say, leaving the best impression (and not overly alarming the reporter). The lack of foreknowledge would seem to interfere with this, but that can mostly be handled by running a similar simulation (at least) twice: once for knowledge ('think of a number'), and once with knowledge ('I can tell you your number (and in reality copy how the rest of this conversation is going to go, if there are no problems)'). ((Expectations subject to insufficient-munchkining. Still, again, a conversation feeling.)) --Ah, right, the conversation feeling awkward with him mostly leading and her mostly responding is a warning sign in terms of flow, as the real version might be expected to have her in complete control of the conversation's direction, without unnecessary dead-ends.

The 'threat of making and doing bad things to lots of simulations' is interesting to think about. If there are three people no way to tell which two are copies and which one is real, all three including the real one will choose to kill the real one instead of the two copies in order to raise the subjective likelihood that that one survives. However, if you're the real one and are about to scan your brain, knowing that hour later the scans will be embodied in different planets and (new paragraph--)

A: The embodied copies will die after one day while the original continues living the whole time, or

B: Before the copies are embodied, the original will be killed while fully conscious, but both copies will continue to live, then

it looks as though the original, knowing it will continue to be the original after the brain scan, will prioritise its own survival over that of the copies who will only remember having been it. In that sense, threatening to make and torture copies of you is unwanted, but not as immediately frightening than if you didn't know whether you were real or a copy.

Agatha does have vulnerabilities, but only if you know what you're getting into. Marc is thoroughly screwed, yes.

(Set up a trap outside the space or time boundaries of her power that can't be escaped from within them. This is how Philip K. Dick's [[http://sickmyduck.narod.ru/pkd082-0.html][Golden Man]] gets nabbed, and that story heavily inspired mine. Thanks [[/u/alexanderwales]] for the recommendation!)

#+begin_quote

I'm modelling her as pissed off at the reporter for threatening her and forcing her to "out" herself. (Inspired by the recent [[http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html][outing of Lily Wachowski]].)

She's not so much trying to make a good impression as probing for ways to hurt real!Mark and get away with it. But then she stumbles upon vision!Mark's fear of annihilation and decides to exploit it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You may be correct. I don't know. I am confused about consciousness and identical copies. If you know you will be split off into a Heaven you and a Hell you, does it make any sense to say you have "50% chance to end up in Hell"? That's what Agatha's threat relies on. I'm not sure real!Marc can claim he will never find himself in a vision.

I know there's a bunch of articles about the sleeping beauty problem on LessWrong that I should probably get around to reading; maybe someone has successfully demystified this.

******* (--Huh. I misunderstood what you meant about what happened to the Golden Man, and when reading that expected them to make his visible paths 'run and flee gunshots for a few hours in direction A', 'run and flee gunshots for a few hours in direction B', 'unopposedly confidently stride to the euthanasia chamber and be treated like royalty (with the company of a beautiful woman?) for a few hours', with him only later seeing enough to realise that after spending several hours there they were then going to kill him (because he doesn't see or react to things already-planned for past his field of view).)

Ahh, I somehow missed that that was in reaction. In reality, then, she gets his ATM card somehow and with his PIN loots everything he has? That seems as though it would bring the police down on her quickly, however. (--Ahh, I see, or now she can threaten real!Mark with numerous copy annihilation, since she now knows he's scared of it.)

The 'split off' verb is important. A planarium or flatfish comes to mind, but we can think of this as the difference between 'change person to static data, change two copies of data to living matter' and 'take static-data copy of living matter, change one copy of data to living matter'. The first case can also be modelled as the original one dying, but is irrelevant if unavoidable; the decision falls down a level to deciding what happens to the copies, since the survival of the original embodied pattern isn't even on the table. (And, again, the entire thought exercise could be pointless if sleep meaningfully kills the original in the same way, rather than being a less serious state.)

Hmmmm. If it's a portion of the universe cut out as a temporary pocket dimension, it could be a splitting-off scenario. If it's all in wetware, then the physical neurons of real!Mark should never have a future in which they end up in a simulation, even if virtual neurons are later constructed in a configuration which mirrors them. (real!Mark cannot become virtual!Mark, but virtual!Mark is Mark as much as real!Mark is, and both of them will equally remember having been real!Mark. Before or after, though, real!Mark's qualia is reliant solely upon real!Mark, unless we abandon the idea of chonological existence.)

I remember the sleeping beauty problem! It was frustrating that it was much more difficult than it felt it should be. I think I vaguely remember arriving at a conclusion that satisfied me, but annoyingly I can't remember hat it was. <takes a look>

--I can't remember my exact chain of thought at the time, but I think I advocated the 1/2 answer. Sleeping Beauty is going to wake up and be asked the question either way, so only waking up doesn't give her any new information about the way the coin fell (unlike the Monty Hall problem).

To put it another way: In half of all possible universes she answers the question once, and in half she answers the question twice, but in the one where she answers the question twice she should give the same answer about both two days both times. She's answering about both two days whichever way the coin falls, but one coin fall direction she's answering twice...

***** How does the border work, though? If the border is permeable, why doesn't the ground fall down out of the simulation or the room become weightless, and why doesn't the air dissapate? If the border isn't permeable, what if the environment is moving relative to her - if she's on a train, do the railway tracks bounce off the border and wreak havoc inside the simulation, or are she and the train crushed against the side? Why is there a gravitational potential differential supplied across the simulation, but not an electrical potential differential? More relevant to the story, wouldn't the room run out of air with two people and a diesel generator running in a confined space?

Also, this seems very likely but particularly gruesome, so it bears mentioning: what happens to people on the edge of her range? Does she constantly see people get splinched in half and bleed out in her simulations?

I decided to just quietly ignore the gravity question (and did not think of the air pressure question). If you want an excuse: maybe the vision runs an extremely low-resolution simulation of everything outside the borders?

Her ability is all but useless in a moving vehicle, yes. The vehicles inside her vision would keep crashing.

Yup, if she's using it in a somewhat crowded area.

But at some point I'll just have to apologize. This was not written with enough care to make it true hard-sf-plus-magic.

*** That last paragraph is quite intriguing, in regards to the answer you've imagined.

With the 'willingly given', what was going to happen was easy to predict.

I was puzzled by the very first sentence; if Sam is inserting the Man into that common mental image (out of hatred), why is it 'a drowning Man clings' and not 'the drowning Man might cling'? 'a Man' (rather than 'the') implies others, and the lack of 'might' prompts the mistaken impression that Sam does not view himself as human.
