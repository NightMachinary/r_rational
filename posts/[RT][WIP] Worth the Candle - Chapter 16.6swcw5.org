** I've attempted a few litRPG's recommended here in the past but have never found them particularly enjoyable. In contrast this has been a delight to read! Looking forward to what you've got planned.

** It seems that watching two practitioners do their work and getting an overview of the process wasn't enough to kickstart the Bone Magic skill.

*** That does seem odd. He also had bone magic done on him directly which was enough to teach skin magic.

**** The author [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6scmnh/rtwip_worth_the_candle_chapter_15/dletcif/][explained]] this:

#+begin_quote
  Fool's Collar ties itself into the skin of the victim, as does most tattoo magic that moves from one person to another. In other words, it's using /your own skin/ and if you're paying close enough attention, you can feel it there.

  Conversely, all Juniper is feeling from the bone magic is its effect, not the root of the magic. You wouldn't get a first inkling of gem magic by getting blasted in the face by a laser, nor would you get an inkling of what blood magic was about if someone used Aarde's Touch to burn you on the arm.

  (Someone /could/ awaken your awareness of the magic in your blood through certain blood magic techniques, but it would be through a conmingling of blood. Someone could also awaken your awareness of the magic in your bones by, for example, sucking the power from one of them while it was still in your body.

  For most people that new awareness wouldn't be terribly helpful, since the awareness doesn't do anything without study and training, which needs direction and a lot of time if you want to gain power in an effective way.)

**** Not that I'm objecting, really. The Gamer power is so broken that I don't think a few hiccups along the path is going to slow things down much.
