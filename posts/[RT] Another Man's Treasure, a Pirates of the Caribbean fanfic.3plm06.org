*** No. I mostly posted this is lieu of posting a brainstorming thread, but this is about as far as I want to take the idea. If it kept going, it would follow one of the men suckered into having the curse placed on him as he engages in wetwork for the British government. Like a more violent James Bond but in the 1700s, with all his gadgets replaced by supernatural items, and unable to have his thirst slaked by any number of martinis. If I read the curse right, also incapable of having sex.

If that tickles me enough I'll write it, but I think the premise is more interesting than the execution would be.

**** The real problem would be fulfilling Yudkowsky's Law. If you've given James Bond the lightsaber of immortality and invulnerability, what is the Death Star that you give to Blofeld?

Actually, it could end up being something like the Laundry Files, where the bad guys are mostly Lovecraftian horrors.

***** Cthulhu Rae Jepsen's corollary to Yudkowsky's First Law is that you don't need to give Sauron a Death Star if Frodo's lightsaber comes with a dose of crippling illness (the longer version of the law already has that baked in, but I've always wanted to name a corollary). And we already took away Bond's women and martinis! :)

More seriously, the threats that our zombie Bond face are probably going to be people wielding the supernatural. If the British government has supernatural agents, then other countries probably do too. The later Pirates movies introduce a wacky amount of magic that can do all sorts of things, so it's not that much of a stretch to think that magic is everywhere. There's also the standby storyline of an agent disavowed by his government in the name of expedient amorality, which cuts the umbilical cord and sets him against the agency that made him everything he is.

***** Yeah based on this fic the protagonist would be undead or will be using undead. So they need something bigger to fight.

The original PotC already dealt with the problem of fighting undead so it wouldn't be as intresting.

Would you mind listing your ideas for supernatural 1700 gadgets? This sounds intresting.

** I liked the setting. Captian hook in PotC? Great.

Yet the story was too short. THe idea let's use the undead curse as an asset is pretty old. I would loved to see who would they use them to fight against.

*** The obvious answer is everybody. American Revolution is shut down by zombie redcoats. The saying is changed to the Moon never sets on the British Empire. The church will lead a crusade against them as practitioners of Sorcery Most Foul. This will either be like all other fights against nigh-invulnerable immortals and be an exercise in futility, or the divine power will smite the undead soldiers who have turned away from sound strategy in their empowered state.

A British Empire with a limited number of immortal soldiers against the Papacy and the Caliphate? They can have sound strategy and still be crushed in holy war. Magic in PotC in general seems to be limited in scope, not mass producible for anything. These would be special agents working behind the scenes; magic used for espionage and coutnerespionage.
