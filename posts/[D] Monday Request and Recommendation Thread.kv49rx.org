Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

Have a strong recommendation for playing [[https://ddlc.moe/][Doki Doki Literature Club]]!^{3} It's in my all-time top-five recommendation for its genre!^{4} Just be sure you have 4-6 hours to spare on the day you start playing, because this game is most effective^{5} when played through at a single stretch. And also best played without any spoilers! Just keep in mind the warning you'll see on every page offering to sell you DDLC and that you have to click through to start the game: DDLC is not suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed!^{6}

^{1} And horror.\\
^{2} Unless you count the destruction of their home Earths, but I expect that didn't have much of an impact on most readers.\\
^{3} Also available on [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/][Steam]]!\\
^{4} Namely horror.\\
^{5} Unless you /want/ to reduce its effectiveness, in which case you should not be playing Doki Doki Literature Club in the first place because it is /very effective./\\
^{6} The content warnings on DDLC are /understated./ Don't start playing it that day, or at all, unless you have mental stability to spare that day, and at all.

I'll add a note that you /really don't/ need to pay that much attention to the poetry minigames that regularly crop up, at least the first-time round. Just click anything; they all end up at the same endpoint and chasing particular 'routes' to it isn't worth the cognitive load until youre looking for the last 10% of content after the main story.

***** DDLC is considered very short by VN standards, like on vndb it's in the shortest length category which is 2-10 hours, wheras the longest category is 50+ hours. That's just the medium in general, proponents would say the length really allows the ability to delve into its subject matter more deeply. You could compare it to the difference between what you can explore in a 2 minute short versus a feature length movie or multiple season TV show, or a 5000 word short story versus a full novel or series of novels.

DDLC had a lot of pretty low quality "poetry" and meandering dialogue, though that might have been intentional to create the purposefully bland atmosphere of the first route before the gut punch hits.

**** I don't think anything happened in DDLC that I'd call a jumpscare in the sense of it not being quite thoroughly foreshadowed, but even if it was a jumpscare, I've enjoyed a number of jumpscares in some of my favorite horror movies? Calling that "cheap material" especially in a work of art as fine as DDLC, but also just in the horror movies I happen to have sometimes enjoyed, seems to run afoul of what I understood to be [[/r/rational]]'s injunction against [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvkv41/meta_reducing_negativity_on_rrational/][excess negativity]] or trying to convince somebody who liked a thing to not like it. (Which, as anybody who's read Erogamer could guess, is a point very near to my heart: to your own you be true.) Any further discussion of specifics should obviously be spoilered.

***** It's fine if you like jumpscares, it's not like they don't work for a lot of people. "Cheap" in this case is just referring to the fact that they don't require very much setup and are often perceived as a much easier way to scare people than other methods. Just looking at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_scare][wikipedia]] page, it's described as "basic" and "lazy" before you even get to the contents box, if you want to get an idea as to how they're generally perceived.

As for the negativity, although I don't really agree with the policy anyway, I don't believe I'm being particularly negative in this instance in the first place. If someone liked DDLC but thought some of it was cheap or gauche then I've provided another potentially interesting rec. If not then the rec doesn't have to interest them. The purpose isn't to hate on DDLC, which I like a lot, but provide context for the rec. By the way, Yud was pretty clear about why he wasn't keen on people to be running around showing off policing negativity in your posted link, and I think he makes a good point in there. Might be worth reading that bit again.

****** If jumpscares are by definition basic and lazy, then DDLC contains no jumpscares. If you didn't enjoy it yourself, that's fine. I really would not expect DDLC to be everybody's cuppatea. But DDLC is incredibly short for the incredible impact that it has, and as an author of some minor acclaim myself, I have some idea of the incredible amount of work that takes. I didn't notice a single paragraph, a single sentence, that didn't contribute to the structure of DDLC. As an author, I guarantee you that somebody put in an incredible amount of work to remove every little bit that didn't need to be there, and polish what was left.

I would not have reacted to your original comment the way I did, if I hadn't read it and visualized a reader getting to one of the powerful-hitting moments in DDLC... and remembering you calling it a "jumpscare" and "cheap material", which is an instruction to the reader that they not feel the hit, that only somebody naive would feel that impact, that if they were wise and sophisticated they wouldn't feel as hard-hit by this "cheap material" "jumpscare". It is something that would tend to reduce the enjoyment of somebody who hasn't played DDLC yet.

You don't have to like DDLC. But if you think that it didn't take an incredible amount of labor to put it together, or that the hard-hitting moments didn't require a lot of careful setup, you're almost certainly wrong on a point of objective truth: in the sense that it's almost certain that the author put a huge amount of work into polishing the hardest-hitting parts, and I can point to the earlier setup work. And even if none of that was true, it is, I understand, the policy of [[/r/rational]], that you should be careful to work around talking in a way that will cause some people to enjoy the work less, especially when many people did enjoy it. This Earth does not have a great surplus of enjoyment.

You should read what I said again, I do like DDLC. That doesn't mean it's therefore totally above all criticism and any discussion of it must be only in tones of effusive praise. I even acknowledged that it's fine to like jumpscares, but that doesn't mean they're for everyone. People have preferences, and that's okay, and it's okay to acknowledge that.

** I've just finished reading [[https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/platinum-end][Platinum End]], the latest and recently completed manga by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, better known as the duo who created Death Note.

Non spoiler review: is this a recommendation? Eh, conditional. The manga's not as good overall as DN in my opinion, mostly because its central conceit is more vague and contrived, and its ambition is higher and harder to live up to. The key concept is very similar: there's a high schooler who suddenly receives from a supernatural entity some special powers whose use is ethically very questionable. The main difference is that unlike Light Yagami, the MC is unequivocally a good guy here, and in fact a very principled person, to the point of almost unrealistic idealism. The powers in question have rigid rules and sophisticated applications, which leads to keeping track of them getting more and more complicated as the story goes on. The first half of the manga is default mind games action, not unlike DN. Is it rational? From the viewpoint of the actions of the characters, kinda; their motivations are simple but consistent enough, and the way they use their powers to maximise progress towards their goals while staying consistent with their own intelligence and morals is believable. There is however at least /one/ character who is utterly ridiculous and over the top and has technology that makes no sense, but thankfully, they don't matter much beyond a few chapters.

The second half is considerably weirder, as the conflict stops being about fighting and devolves into a philosophical debate. That's right, the /entire second half of this 58 chapters shonen manga is basically just people talking/. This is actually an interesting turn, in and of itself. I feel like the authors are not sophisticated enough to make these debates deep or satisfying enough, but then again, they /are/ writing for a very mainstream audience of teenagers, so I think it stands to reason they'd dumb it down a little anyway. I don't feel like they really missed any key point - sometimes I felt like that only for the relevant point to be brought up a few chapters later, suggesting that maybe they simply didn't have space to cram it in before. Regardless, though, this often reads as a very "edgy teenager" approach to philosophy (and in particular the nature and existence of God, which is the key topic of the manga), so be wary if you're easy to cringe. Also, the ending has left many people disappointed, and to me too it felt like it was very poorly foreshadowed. So, be warned of that. Though it's nothing but bold, I'll say.

It still entertained me, and it's certainly a peculiar story. I also think that potentially it could be a starting point for a great rational story - with some adjustments. Or you could already consider it rational-ish in itself. If you feel like reading some slightly shlocky shonen story about superpowers, suicide (yes, that's a major theme too) and philosophy, do check it out. By the way, avoid it instead if you feel like you're depressed or suicidal yourself. It really won't do you any favours.

** So I just watched the recent episode of Attack on Titan yesterday, and it blew my mind. That episode was a masterpiece on all fronts, from the voice acting to the dialogue, from the OST to the cinematography and the story, and from the themes and action. AoT really handles the themes of war well, both sides understand just how terrible it is and just how wrong they are/were, but they are still forced to do it. One of them even acknowledges that his people and those of his enemy, from those in the walls to the ones across the ocean, are the same. He even understands why the other character did everything he did, and sympathizes with him. And the reactions of the other character... I'd say this was one of the most powerful episodes in any show I've seen ever.

I'd really recommend this series to anyone here, although do be warned the MC can be a bit “generic angry shouty kid” at the beginning, although it pays off phenomenally in the latest season. The way it all builds up and interconnects is fantastic too, and really shows the growth of the MC and just out of depth he was in the beginning and was a prisoner to the progression and plot.

Anybody else have thoughts on this?

Only one: Read the manga. Kidding, but you should, I honestly wouldn't risk getting ANYTHING spoiled.

The few times I have seen AoT recommended on this sub there's always been a lot of nitpicking about it, but honestly it's probably as rational or rational-adjacent as anime can get. It's a story where everything has been well thought out in advance, 64 episodes (12 years of manga publication) in and the very beginning chapters of the series keep on being recontextualized. There's a bit of a long way to go before the end and yet if you start a rewatch with what you know now a lot of the events in the first two seasons hit differently, hell even the stuff that seems to be fairly unrelated to what is currently happening (like some of the character development in S3) is still highly relevant because that's simply how consistent some of the themes are.

Not much else to say without getting into spoilers, but I really hope this series inspires other manga authors to give this much thought to their worldbuilding and characters, anime as a whole could certainly stand to be a lot less 2d than it is.

*** There's [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333324-ancillary-justice][/Ancillary Justice/]] and the sequels which aren't bad. Feature an AI protagonist who sometimes controls multiple bodies which is fun. Interesting world-building here and I like the narrator who did the audiobooks.

Then there's [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat][/Quod Olim Erat/]] which is completed and it's sequel [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23614/the-scuu-paradox][/The Scuu Paradox/]] which also very recently completed which focus on a main character who retired after serving as a battleship AI but decades later, decided to reenlist, this time as a crew member. Interesting stuff here, and very well written by RR standards. A bit confusing at times though because the narrator can be unreliable as her memories are purged or classified occasionally but great suspense and some big mysteries. The author recently started writing the sequel, and has a decently active update schedule.

In a completely different direction, there's /[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion][Prophecy Approved Companion]]/ which is a comedy-ish story about an NPC in a VR-game gaining sapience(?). Very funny, particularly if you're into videogames. This had me legitimately cracking up multiple times through reading it.

Finally, there's [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper][/The Cosmic Interloper/]] (self-shill alert!) which has an AI/transhuman main character who gets portal'ed into a fantasy world. On hiatus now, but there's a decent chunk online ~55k words and I'm still planning on getting around to finish it /eventually/.

*** For something looking at the more sociological knock-on effects of ubiquitous psychic powers, Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) puts forward an interesting take. Not a lot of delving into the powers themselves, though, as they're deliberately open-ended in strength. It's more about "what kind of society can survive when any unchecked member can easily kill everyone else around them?"

I'd go with either the novel or the anime rather than the manga though, as the latter was more interested in the sex than the plot.

Whispers is mental and external. It involves influencing the senses or minds of others.

Physical is concrete and external. It involves affecting the world; projecting heat, forces, affecting chemical reactions, and so on.

Joining is concrete and internal. It involves enhancing one's own body- strengthening skin, bones, senses, with the power of your mind.

Praxis is mental and internal. It involves influencing your own mind: skill-stitching, memory enhancements, calculation, various forms of extrasensory perception.

#+end_quote

Wait, isn't the manga completed?

About recommendations featuring psychic powers... well, Katsuhiro Otomo is kind of a classic there. "Akira" is well known, but a much lesser known little gem is "Domu", which is about a very childish, murderous old man and a little girl, both with esper powers, fighting out a secret battle within a Japanese apartment building. Not especially rational from what I remember but it doesn't really need to be, besides the premise of "random people have esper powers for reasons". I get the impression Mob Psycho 100 really drew inspiration from Otomo's work.

You could describe the complex power system in Hunter X Hunter as psychic powers, though that would be pretty reductive. Also you probably know of it already. But it's definitely very deep and rational in how it's fleshed out.

Others that I've read include "Hinamatsuri" and "Spy X Family" - both great, but neither very rational or interested in the psychic powers themselves at all. Hinamatsuri is a comedy about an esper little girl being dropped in the lap of a yakuza and disrupting his life and a host of other characters surrounding them. It's pretty absurdist and wildly funny. Spy X Family is about a spy in a Cold War Berlin-like alternative world setting getting a fake family for the purpose of an undercover job; except the woman he randomly meets in a shop and asks to be his wife happens to be an assassin looking for cover herself, and the child he picks up from an orphanage happens to be a telepath. Hilarity and spy-thriller adventures ensue.

So now that you make me notice it, yes, there is a significant lack of overlap between "anime and manga I know" and "works exploring in depth the concepts of telepathy and telekinesis with a consistent power system". Huh. I do support the rec for "From the New World", by the way, that one is really great. Also, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxke2YUjBcM][it has this beautiful piece of music]].

Yeah I was thinking the same thing about myself. Although in the Kekkaishi manga there was this bit where a psychic, Sazanami, shows a younger psychic how to extract slightly more than surface thoughts when reading someone's mind. It was quite expository and I found it really cool. I was hoping I'd get reccs along that vein.

I've gotten quite a few reccs for FTNW and it might scratch my itch, I think; but that sound track is real dope, ominous too though.

Lost Legacy (1941) is a novella by science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein. Originally published in the November, 1941 issue of Super Science Stories, it was collected in the book Assignment in Eternity (1953). The novella is an exploration of the possibilities that humans, with the proper training, have the potential to make use of a wide range of telepathic and telekinetic abilities.

With the novelty of industrial FTL tele-kenetics established these series are more character driven and dynastic. There are some significant conflicts, some coming out of the blue, some well set up, but they are fun reads. The worldbuilding is fun, but there are also frustrating questions that are not explored but will seem like things you should see discussed if you are looking from a Hard Sci-Fi angle. Of all of Anne McCaffery's series they are not one I'd expect to recommend here but they are fun fluff reads, and you can usually find them at your larger used book stores.

*** I think a decent chunk of people dislike it simply because the overall tone is somewhat grim. Ar'Kendrithyst is basically the novel equivalent of 'absolute power corrupts absolutely,' and a lot of people go into LitRPG looking for more of the classic heroic cycle type story.

*** It's probably one of my favorite stories, but I also like most things. I liked that it has a fallible mc with great power in a death world. People either found him really naive or really murderhobo, I agree with both. I like the back and forth the mc has throughout the novels. He gets very murderhobo after his daughter almost dies, then loosens a bit, then again goes murderhobo after something else terrible happens, then loosens up.

I especially like the slice of life. It's very nice to sit back with a chapter of mostly cooking, growing new plants, magic creation, and so on, and it never felt like fluff to me. There's always some tidbits of plot development even in the more heavily slice of life chapters. Later on it also has some of the best father/daughter relationships I've seen in royalroad.

I did think the dialogue and characters were stilted in the beginning, but the author finds his style and improves on it. Sometimes the prose is even pretty good! It emphasises the vibrant feel of the world, even though it's pretty terrible overall.

Erick is definitely an op mc. He gains power through seemingly no significant effort. There are story reasons for it, at least according to the author, but maybe I haven't looked deeply enough. I don't really care though. Erick is an mc that sticks to his morals even through the most terrible shit, and that's admirable to me, even if he makes a bunch of pretty shit choices. I'd rather read about a rational world rather than a rational mc, the latter tends to be dry among most rational fics I've read. And the world of Ar'kendrithyst is definitely rational. It feels lived in. The lore is great and fantastic, and the people of the world have their own set of morals and superstitions and beliefs. It all feels like an actual world, rather than a setup or backdrop.

If you couldn't tell, I really like this story. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone though, it's just in the right spot for scratching all my itches.

***** Which parts were you miffed by? I don't really care about the magic bits, since Erick's is obviously the best of the best when it comes to magic creation. His "wins" in the last two books definitely felt more pyrrhic than not imo. They always came at some significant cost, or setback. The cost to Erick isn't that much, since his personal power generally increases, but the people around him suffer.

*** Summary of my findings from this thread and elsewhere:

- The MC is dumb because he's not a murderhobo / is too naive
- The MC is dumb because he drifts towards becoming a murderhobo
- The MC is dumb because he cares too much about people
- The MC is dumb because he doesn't care enough about people

This is absolutely hilarious to me.

**** I enjoyed it but it felt very irrational. Somethings that repeatedly irked me are:

The MC basically becomes an archmage (whatever that means...) with barely any effort. He just has scientific knowledge plus some kind of innate talent. His daughter who is supposed to be a badass seems to put in significantly more work but is also much weaker. He lets spurious allies send people to spy on him and then treats them as his close comrades despite knowing nothing about them. Then he's surprised when they act contrary to him.

I think the core of the complaints is that he acts inconsistently.

Also, he doesn't cleanly fit into any stereotypical story. He's not trying to change anything, acquiesces to many commands, and puts himself at the mercy of “allies”. The bad guys are much stronger than the good guys, but it's unclear what they want other than just maybe being mysterious and crazy.

There was an explanation for this in the last 20 chapters or so, and personally, I found it a satisfying one.

The Old Universe suffered a catastrophe and the Gods fled to create a new one. The Old God of Magic, the Big Bad, is a particular brand of solipsistic crazy and thinks all the other Gods and people are figments of his imagination. And also that by destroying the New Universe he can be freed from its prison. That crazy bleeds through to his high priests, who mainline his power in order to cheat the LitRPG system the New Universe runs on, and makes them mostly murder-y and insane.

But when the Big Bad met the MC in the first couple chapters, he got jolted towards sanity by the novelty of meeting an isekai/earth-person, and that plotline is finally coming to fruition in the latest chapters.

**** Hardly rational, though. Watched it just the other day and it only made me think about how hard it is to do something like "people getting shrunk" /consistently/. For example, what would happen to their mass? In HISTK, they clearly become proportionally lighter, which... well... violates a lot of laws, but I guess that was always going to be a thing. What about their other senses? For example now their eardrums are smaller, which should change their resonance frequency, which should mean they would have trouble hearing normal voices and should hear in the ultrasound range instead. /However/, if the shrinking affects their atoms themselves - which is necessary, otherwise they'd just lose cells and complexity and not be humans any more - then the elastic constant of the material making up their eardrums should have changed too, because an elastic constant is nothing but the second derivative of an energy with respect to a length. I haven't worked out yet what that ultimately means for resonance frequencies.

A few more things - they fear falls, but falls should be entirely innocuous for them, as they would reach terminal velocity and hit the ground at entirely survivable speeds. They should also have super strength, unless they don't because their atoms got smaller too... again, more complicated calculations. How are they even breathing ordinary-sized oxygen and eating ordinary-sized food? They should suffocate instantly as their haemoglobin now can't bind with regular air, nor can those big molecules pass through their semipermeable capillaries membranes.

***** At that level of reasoning, surely there just isn't any such thing as a hard-SF shrink story? Unless you assume the characters are being wrapped in a field of Minovsky particles that changes their apparent size and mass relative to the external world without affecting things internally... and who's to say that's not how the Honey I Shrunk The Kids machine works?

****** Egan had uploads using human form, but maximally miniaturized robot avatars on space craft in at least one story, for reasons of mass economy. It was a throw-away bit, since the characters mostly spent their time in virtualities, but as a general idea, very small robot bodies for uploads or telepresence do not break any laws of physics.

***** Jup, and you've forgetting an even BIGGER effect: Time. Muscles provide an acceleration, the speed of your thoughts depend on the speed the signal travels between neurons, etc.

In fact, this all turns out to fit together REALLY elegantly in general relativity, treating your current scale as another thing you cant figure out in a closed system and keeping the speed of light the same, if you're in a spaceship and it's shrunk to 1/100 the size you cant tell, and if you're bouncing a laser back and forth between two mirrors you're experiencing the same subjective time between bounces, and the laser still travel at lightspeed but it has 1/100 the distance to travel, so you must be experiencing time 100x faster.

This is roughly what we observe in actual machines and animals: A shrew will have a far faster heartbeat, faster reaction time, faster metabolism, and shorter lifespan than an element. If you take a system of bodies orbiting each other and shrink all the distances and radiuses you get a faster but otherwise identical behavior, a computer with smaller transistors has a higher clock speed, etc.
