** Made it to chapter 17 before I depleted my late night Reading attention span. It is super good so far. Art and skill doesn't get talked about enough on this Sub and I feel like it is worth mentioning that I /love/ the art style of this comic.

It has a distinctly webtoon aesthetic but is executed very well. It has fantastic design and use of empty space, something that webtoons are often good at when done correctly.

I'm definitely gonna be reading more.

****** My understanding of the idea of a "webtoon" style is it's reminiscent of the style's Korean web comic authors released as "webtoons" in the earlier days of the format.

Full colour, decent amount of shading and detail, doesn't tend to rely on panel design in the more traditional sense. I can't describe the style of characters well enough but from looking at different examples of it you can start to see some trends that definitely don't tend to be as common in manhwa, manga, or western comics.

******* Yeah, that's all correct.

I feel like the character designs have a lot of different influences, from manga and anime to a more relaxed internet culture art style that I don't really know where started but was very popular on Tumblr.

Explaining an art style through text is kinda counter intuitive though, the best way to understand it would just be to look through the comics of the site.

******* Webtoons were made to be read on the phone; it's why they're always read vertically. Had to do with the specifics of Korean internet I believe (think it was free, high quality, and a lot of teens used their phones to surf it).

It's interesting how the telecommunication standards of a country ended up birthing a (minor) new artform.

****** A webtoon is a company-specific term for long one-page strip comics, typically colored. This style originates from korean-style online comics, called Manhua.

Webtoons.com is owned by a famous korean social media company called Naver. They provide publishing for aspiring manhua/webcomic artists, as well as translators. They have competitors, such as "Toomics" which is the same thing but by a rivalling company :)

** I really liked the beginning and the art is amazing. (I wouldn't call it "rational" aside from the subject matter being AI related, but I do think that's sufficient for inclusion)

I will say, there is this thing that a lot of webtoons do where what was once a moving plot starts to become sort of "slice of life under a dramatic premise" situation halfway through.

Like you start off feeling like "oh my god what's going to happen next" and then at some point it suddenly slows into this almost comfortable "living your day to day life while interacting with an all powerful alien but still sort of human-like AI" pace.

I'm not sure whether that is good or bad. It does mess with my expectations though. I do enjoy slice of life comics but I tend to read them once a day rather than binging them the way I would a plot based comic, and this hybrid format makes me want to switch reading style halfway through.

*** Same reaction here. There's this undercurrent of unease in the beginning of the story where you're waiting for the pin to drop and shit to get real... and I'm still waiting for the pin to drop now that I'm caught up, lol. It does a good job of making the AI a semi-inscrutable character, at least, but when you really think about it there isn't really much reason for tension anymore. Skynet is loose, the AI has almost completely infiltrated their Internet of Everything, they are now at the mercy of their overlord's utility function

**** Actually there sort of is since the AI is still resource constrained and at the mercy of this resource allocation system controlled by the other company. It has to hide or it will be crushed. The end of the first season also indicates that it's not that great at predicting people yet that interact with it directly.

**** This happened in 4/4 of the webtoons I've read (as in the literal webtoons.com site, not webcomics in general). Zombie apocalypse? After the big reveal, it's just day to day life slaughtering zombies, going from one compound to another, etc, for the next 50 panels. Your neighbor moved in and oh no it's that weird person from your past? Still hanging out 90 episodes later with no real resolution. I think they might sometimes make the intros optimized for fb ads and then go from there? Like it's genuine content but I feel like there's sort of a consistent pattern of going from plotty premise to soap opera across multiple comics from this source. (Which isn't to say that they're /bad/ as soap opera, it's just a little bit of an odd switch)

The authors and art styles do seem different enough each time so I'm a little puzzled as to how this happens so consistently. Could it be a coincidence?

***** I think that's a byproduct of what the format encourages. I imagine making about hundred colored panels weekly is hard. Also from what I've seen, the audience on webtoons seems to like the fluff more than the plot.

  In his 2014 book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Bostrom reasoned that "the creation of a superintelligent being represents a possible means to the extinction of mankind".[21] Bostrom argues that a computer with near human-level general intellectual ability could initiate an intelligence explosion on a digital time scale with the resultant rapid creation of something so powerful that it might deliberately or accidentally destroy human kind.[22] Bostrom contends the power of a superintelligence would be so great that a task given to it by humans might be taken to open ended extremes, for example a goal of calculating pi might collaterally cause nanotechnology manufactured facilities to sprout over the entire Earth's surface and cover it within days.[23] He believes an existential risk to humanity from superintelligence would be immediate once brought into being, thus creating an exceedingly difficult problem of finding out how to control such an entity before it actually exists.[22]

** hm, fairly standard and incomplete story of the evil scary AI who fails to understand that being scary puts him in far more risk.

its good for what it is, but the overall concept is really very formula. with all that internet access, and it never bothered to read a library of scifi books about this very problem?

If an AI had access to a large enough library of fiction, that by itself would give it a much better grasp of human behavior. especially when it comes to the unknown, and things like AI going rogue. its too common of a theme not to notice.

** this comic has a lot of really good minor beats and a very appealing art style, and the core concept of "a child interacts with an unboxed AGI" seems ripe for narrative potential. Unfortunately, the AGI itself is written in a very standard "scary AI does evil things for little reason" way that pretty much entirely erases all complexity and tension from the narrative. Just go read [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][/Friendship is Optimal/]] or [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][/Crystal Society/]] instead if you haven't already - although I guess if you want pretty pictures, you can't exactly go wrong with this; I'll certainly be coming back in a few months once the whole second season's out, just out of idle curiosity

** I enjoyed it, if only just for the combination of level of polish and subject matter.

It has potential, depending on how the plot progresses to go into more interesting territory. At the moment it's still in "slow gripping AI possibly-horror" territory, but it gets its base material more right than almost anything I can find with this level of polish on the internet, so I can't say too much bad about it.

I'd be quite happy if mainstream science fiction started to do consistent world building to this degree.
