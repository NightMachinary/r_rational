** Wait.

Why is Draco whining about having lost anything? His sacrifice is trust; Rarity is the one sacrificing her magic.

**** Yeah, but at /that/ moment?

It's pretty much a word-for-word copy of what Lucius/Mr. White replied at the same time to the same question... but Lucius was sacrificing magic in the ritual, and Draco was sacrificing trust. Mr. Grim, who was in Draco's position in HPMOR, /laughed/ when he found out that the ritual was going to be redundant in a few minutes.

I'm just saying that it's odd that Draco would pick /that exact moment/ to break down, when all he'd lost in /that/ moment was his trust of Harry.

****** To be blunt, this all seems like post-hoc justification for keeping a line from the original that no longer quite fits. Yes, he has lost quite a bit in the past few minutes, it's true; I went too far in my initial post, suggesting otherwise. But if this had been a less derivative work, I don't believe that's what you would have written Draco to say in that moment. Which is fine, for a lot of the other stuff you've been lifting from HPMOR these past few chapters, because the circumstances haven't changed /that/ much from the original. In this case, though, the circumstances of why that line is supposedly being said have changed /massively/ (and little of what you use to justify the line remaining unchanged is actually made clear in the text), so it undercuts the emotional impact of the moment.

I'd argue that's where the true failure lies; if the intent isn't clear from the text, then it didn't do its job.

Originally I had a much longer section describing Draco's feelings towards the matter; basically just a more wordy version of the explanation above, with a little bit more of a deep dive into drawing parallels between Draco and his father, with Draco thinking "What would Father do", along with a brief lecture / internal monologue on why trying to mimic what smarter people is silly; a sort of cargo cult approach to intelligence.

It dragged on for about five hundred words and I wound up cutting the whole thing because I felt like it detracted from the action of the scene with unnecessary pedagogy. But it's pretty clear in hindsight that the "I've lost so much" line doesn't really play outside of that context (especially since you're not the only one to point out the issues), and really what I should have done was cut that line as well.

After talking through this, I may wind up editing that line out.
