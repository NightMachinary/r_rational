*** Its a quest like Marked for death,so you don't make a character ,all the players make one character and vote what the character will do that update.

You can just enter and propose a plan ,or vote current ones (though right now not because I'm still writing next chapter).

So far there is few people and the adventure just started, so your votes can actually change a lot.\\
Wining plans so far had only 2 or 3 votes .

** There's only one chapter posted so far. Why does the title of this post say 'Chapter 4'?

**** I see! My mistake was that I only was looking at Informational which is also the very first post when I thought it was meant to be the first Threadmark. Thanks!

***** You scared me for a moment and I started to doubt if I had accidentally posted a link to the wrong quest or something.

Btw next chapter is probably going to take a while , since I procrastinated on it and still haven't started writing yet but It will be finished before Thursday(I hope, planing fallacy might disagre though)
