** Great to see the payoff to all the buildup :) On the one hand it's unusual to see a villain in a rational fic be so absurdly and straightforwardly Evil Overlord, but on the other it makes sense given Piccolo's origin and it works for him given how enormously powerful he is compared to everyone else right now. I'm also glad this chapter brought up the inconsistency with the "Maestro"; I thought it strange that the Dragon made Piccolo appear not long after imprisonment, since it makes it impossible for him to have guided Piano meanwhile, and am looking forward to seeing who the hidden mastermind really is.

This fic continues to impress. Looking forward to the next chapter!

**** [[/u/SimoneNonvelodico][u/SimoneNonvelodico]] , this comment made me think, can you explain one thing?

We know that Dragon retrieved Piccolo container in the state as if mere seconds passed from his imprisonment. We also know that this container had to exist for the whole time before the dragon summoning, so the time had to pass for this container before the Wish was granted.

So basically... what exacly has Dragon did? Did he: a) turn back time for the container and left it with only few seconds passed? b) removed the current real life container instance, and brought back the one from the past? c) well, idk?

and let's make the question more interesting.

Let's keep with your story assumptions, but say that Piccolo was able to communicate all the time from his container, by, for example, inducing dreams.

Would he remember it after being summoned by the wish?

***** The Dragon compressed time within the container. In real world terms, imagine it as if he just dropped the container temporarily close to a black hole to give it a time dilation factor, so that in practice inside the container only a few instants passed when outside 300 years did. This is "skirting the line" w.r.t. divine time travel rules because it does send information backwards in time (the Dragon triggers a past occurrence) but does NOT create any self consistent loops, as the container was perfectly isolated from the outside world - the effect only applied to Piccolo himself, who was magically trapped within it, not to the actual matter of the container - and it was set to be open only after the wish was granted, so that information was not effectively sent to the past of the world line for all practical purposes.

******** Very hpmorish approach, altough there is also a time travel in canon db (but maybe it's working in a slightly different way, it has no consistent time loops)

still, if it were up to me, I'd solve the dragon wish issue without time travel, I'd say that he has simple puffed out of existence the current 100-years(orso) old container and recreated it in brand-new (just after catching Piccolo) version. This would also create some moral issues, like, could we say that Dragon killed Piccolo in this case?

oh well, it was discussed before. Because basically he crated Dragon. But... couldn't dragon do the same trick in reverse and bring back Piccolo as an old geezer who could be easily single-handedly knocked out by the likes like Ninja Murasaki? I think it could be a good loophole, and blocking it would require your universe to be literally self-conscious about character actions.

*********** First: the whole point of the gods is that they're basically laws of nature personified. See the discussion between Baba and Korin. And what Shenlong fears is retaliation from one specific god (the one whose name sounds like... etc. etc. you may have guesses for who that is if you're up to date with the Dragon Ball franchise). So, sure, anything that feels too much like a smartass trick might still draw punishment.

Second: are you asking if Bulma can precommit to summoning the Dragon again in one year, asking him to speed up the flow of time within the sealed container by a factor of 10^{14,} then see how Piccolo emerges as a husk? No, she can't. Because Piccolo already came out, and the change was already enacted. Doing /that/ would require a straight up timeline split, not a self-consistent loop, which is exactly what is frowned upon by the gods. This by the way isn't something I'm making up, it's DB Super canon. The whole mess with Trunks creating a split timeline by saving Goku is not appreciated by the higher ups. The main story from the Android Saga onward takes place in a "pathological" timeline that was not supposed to exist. Shenlong would not agree to doing that, even if it were within his power.

what if she was lucky and smart enough to do this wish for the first time when they met dragon? After the May sniping Goku action, somehow? Would that work as a Piccolo killing method? Note that the Dragon wish itself wouldn't do the killing, it would just speed up the time...

*************** You know, I haven't given enough thought to the question to decide whether antimatter /exists/ in this universe. I know and have already stated it's not a relativistic universe. There's no universal speed limit; the speed of light is just another speed (in fact, different frequencies of light don't necessarily move at the same speed). Now normally antimatter emerges as a prediction from a relativistic treatment of quantum mechanics (e.g. Dirac equation and then QFT), but that doesn't mean relativity is strictly speaking /required/ to justify its existence, and you can imagine non-relativistic QFT, so... I guess it should in theory exist, potentially. But probably can't be created from the straightforward photon => particle + antiparticle reaction.

Anyway. I hope you'll forgive my shoddy worldbuilding for not having worked out a fully consistent Theory of Everything in the DBZ universe.

About the dragon not knowing what antimatter does though... if it can create it, it can know what it does. It's a nearly all-powerful, all-knowing, transcendent wish-granting being. Knowing stuff is part of the job requirements.

** I wonder how long it will take for people to start trying to defect from the Instruments now that they're seeing what Piccolo's really like. It's something you'd have to be very careful not to get caught doing (because Piccolo will fucking murder you), but there's no indication that Piccolo would be any better at noticing people trying to sneak away than the army's previous leaders. If anything, he might be worse at it, since his overwhelming strength means he doesn't need to be terribly vigilant, and his overwhelming hatred means he's not very in tune with his men.

Speaking of defections, I like that Mai's turned tail here. It makes me curious what's in store for her. I doubt she's actually going to be able to hurt Piccolo in any meaningful way, but her desire to do so might bring her to join Goku's crew. I can see a path for her that's similar to Vegeta, Piccolo Jr, or the Androids in canon, where she goes from bitter foe to begrudging ally and then becomes an actual friend as the years pass. Don't know if that's what's actually in store, but I think it's a definite possibility.

** This and The Reckoning both updating by dawn? About a month late for my birthday, but I'll take it. <3

On one hand, I'm a little sad that Snow isn't around to try and fail to assassinate Piccolo like she did in the Anime. On the other, there's no way the Piccolo depicted here would have not just leveled the 10km^{2} in the general direction in response, so that's probably for the best.

... This is about where Yajirobe showed up in canon, and we've barely been introduced to T'en and Chaozu. This is clearly going a different direction, and I look forward to discovering it.

*** I'll be upfront and say I don't really know what to do with Yajirobe, if anything. He might or might not pop up. He's never been a favourite of mine, and besides his brief role in the early Piccolo arc he's never had a significant role (really, it seems like Toriyama brought him forth as a way to pull Goku out of his pickle, then randomly parked him at Korin Tower for lack of a better role for him). Well, I guess he cut Vegeta's tail too, can't forget that.

So he might come up or not. While I have the story planned out there still might be room for the occasional character to pop up and fill in some role - but he won't be a key player by any stretch of the imagination.

By Snow you mean the little girl Goku meets in Jingle Village? I don't remember anything about her trying to assassinate Piccolo, but then again I remember the manga much more clearly than the anime for that part. Was it an anime original scene?

**** Snow is barely in the manga at all, yeah, mostly just pulling Goku out of his planewreck and occasionally getting a reaction scene while Goku is in Muscle Tower, and I think there was one for Piccolo. The anime added a lot to the Piccolo arc, that imo helped show Goku's journey and Piccolo's impact on the world (this being way before Freeza set the standard for filler to destroy the watchability of the anime). They went with Snow as the primary PoV character for experiencing Piccolo's effects on the general public, but let her have #8 around as protection so she didn't immediately get swept up in the chaos.

Yeah, Yajirobe feels like a character who showed up just because. It seems like he was probably an apology to Krillin's voice actor (Goku even comments at one point in the manga that he sounds kinda like Krillin). How he got so strong is never really hinted at. He's clearly not the most honorable person from his village (they kicked him out after all). Does that mean there's a village somewhere run by Samurai stronger than Yajirobe, who never do anything, and could have competed with the Turtle and Crane but never bothered? Yajirobe somehow heard of Piccolo, too... which seems a huge coincidence when the Sen'nin were treated as some of the only remaining memory of him. It raises a ton of questions, none of which are ever addressed, because there's no room / it's not important to the story / Yajirobe is just a replacement character for Goku to have someone to interact with while everyone else is unavailable.

That, and if Yajirobe had been anywhere near a way to hear about Bulma's call for magic / ki users, he probably would have gone for it. He's profit oriented like that. Maybe he showed up among the unmentioned martial artists, and just wasn't interesting enough to get listed?

**** The girl from Jingle Village, who the anime did more with than the manga, but whose only major role in either was to save Goku when his stolen plane crashed near Muscle Tower. She didn't even get named in the manga, iirc. Hangs out with Hatchan / [android/artificial human/cyborg/jinzouningen] #8.

IIRC, they also used Snow in [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uHPdgsaE7qc][Goku's Traffic Safety special]] (because that's a thing that exists). I think Toei was hoping she'd be a bigger character than she turned out to be (Panzie from the first movie is basically Snow with a little bit of Chichi thrown in). I've heard some joke that Chrono from Chronotrigger is what Gohan would look like if Goku married Snow instead of Chichi.

Great chapter as usual, there were some points where it was hard to follow what's happening, but the all other is great.

I really hope for Mai redemption and I also wonder if you're going to jump straight to Goku vs Piccolo fight. It would make more sense to insert some training chapter like they do in anime, the sacred water thing (as I remember, the dead-now Tao Pai also tried the water), etc....

hmm maybe the next part is Turtle Master telling Goku to go Korin Tower...
