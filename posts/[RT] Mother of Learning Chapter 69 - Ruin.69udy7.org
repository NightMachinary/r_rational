*** I expected the hydra fight and resolution to take the bulk of the chapter with only a hint of what was to come next in the remainder. I was surprised by how much he tried to cover here. The whole privacy ward discussion as a quick solution to the mutiny is surely another setup, but I struggle to imagine why we'll return to those jungles until some future iteration where this mutiny won't matter.

******** Ok I concede, maybe they would get him. To your point, while it took them almost the entire restart this time to get the orb, the next time should be much easier since they know where it is, the protections around it and get reinforcements for the hydra. Maybe even start the encounter with the final trap in place.

The reason why I was opposed to them getting Damien was that he wouldn't leave without the orb and it is a waste of time to try and get the orb if it takes the entire month to do so. But if it takes less than half the month it might help having his experience. That being said, having him on wastes as much as half a restart (lots of foreplay with convincing him, his future in-laws, his team, then hiring reinforcements, then getting the actual orb), so his experience at least better reduce their search time by more than half, if he is going to be useful.

******* I think you're somewhat misreading the situation.

It's Daimen who should be offering help. I believe the reason why he is grumpy in this chapter is that he realizes that the Orb is found and Zorian has no use for him in the future, where he loses all memories. He needs to continue to be useful to Zorian in the future restarts, or he is screwed in the real world. "Best" case scenario Zorian gets out of the loop and ignores the orb in real world. That would leave real!Daimen still stuck with nigh impossible mission. Middle case (for Daimen) is that real!Zach snatches the orb for himself. Worst case is that the red robe succeeds (still no orb for Daimen, plus a shitty possible world to live in)

** Ah, the classic D&D Wightpocalypse.

Back then you did it by virtue of the "Locate City" spell.\\
You see, most /dangerous/ spells strictly limit the number and range of targets, for obvious balance reasons. You Magic Missile a specified number of people, you Grease a small area in front of you. And so on.

Locate City is a harmless Level 1 spell available to most spellcasting classes; its innocuous purpose is spelt out in its name - it locates a city. That's all it does. But its purpose perforce means that it /targets an entire city/. This presents a loophole in the limited targetting rules that can be exploited using two otherwise unrelated rules:

1. Dungeons and Dragons includes "metamagic" skills. Rather than learning /new/ spells, you can increase your general spellcasting ability such that the spells you've already learned are empowered. These skills might let you increase your spells' duration, or their strength...or add additional effects.

2. Certain evil-flavoured effects reduce character levels rather than cause physical damage. When a character's level is reduced to zero by an an outside effect, they die, and they are reanimated as a type of undead called a "wight". Wights are intelligent, evil, and can drain living beings by touch, turning them into more wights. Wights are nasty low-level threats, but necromancy is limited in range and targets, as mentioned above, so you tend to only encounter one or two at a time.

The so-called "Locate City Bomb" uses metamagic skills to add a level-draining effect to the otherwise harmless but immensely wide-target Locate City spell. This causes every commoner within the targetted city to lose levels, with no "saving throw" to prevent it. As a result, *thousands* of wights are spawned, all of which immediately leave the city and begin turning every living being in the surrounding countryside into more wights, which spread out further and...you get the idea.

The starting population of several thousand wights increases exponentially. It soon becomes a continent-spanning existential crisis that even epic-level parties struggle to bring under control without divine or GM intervention. All from an innocuous Level 1 spell that any beginner spellcaster can learn, a few mostly-useless metamagic skills, and a basic life-drain effect that several races get as a /free bonus/.

#+begin_quote
  Hsan is not set to appear in the story, so I guess I can expand on it a little. Hsan was kind of inspired by China and India, though they are neither. The continent has a history of being unified by a single large nation and that is currently the case as well. That is not to say that Hsan lacks other states as well -- it has plenty of them, it's just that they're smaller and lived under the shadow of the Grand Dynasty. However, the last few emperors of the Grand Dynasty have been very underwhelming and the empire is slowly stagnating and rotting from the inside. Rebellions are starting to get more common and some of the empire's vassal lords are not paying their taxes as they should. Meanwhile, the smaller states that live in the Grand Dynasty's shadow have been more open about trading with Altazia and are rolling out new technologies and mage academies received by their trading partners. Blasphemous voices have started to whisper if it might not be the time for the current Grand Dynasty to fall and a new one to rise from its ashes...

  Hsan has two main forms of magic. The first one is the Ikosian casting system, which they have imported during the height of Ikosian Empire. Since contact with Altazia and Miasina has been sparse since then, and because Hsan mages have never been as numerous or as supported by their states as mages on other two continents, Hsan mages are a somewhat worse than their counterparts in Altazia and Miasina. Their training methods lag in effectiveness, and their spellcasting necessarily suffers accordingly. This is being rapidly corrected now that Altazia merchants are making a big push in the area... outside the Grand Dynasty territory, at least.

  The second form is something I have not really nailed down, and probably won't for a long while. If ever. I was originally thinking of something inspired by martial arts and the like, but the various Xianxia I have checked out since them have inspired me to think in new directions. In setting, the mages tell all kind of wild stories about exotic spellcasters living in Hsan, but little is confirmed and the whole place is a giant mystery aside from a couple of port towns.

  The basic idea was that Hsanic mages are more focused on specialized long-term shaping regimens that give them non-structured magical abilities. This gives them a handful of really flexible abilities, but they can't just pick up new spells like Altazian mages do. But as I said, nothing is really set in stone here, and probably never will be. All that is really important is that native Hsanic mages are Different, with a capital D, but not really superior to Ikosian-style mages.

** So Sudomir's building the equivalent of a nuke. I wonder what the odds are that Zorian ends up using it himself? On the one hand, it would definitely be a culmination of his knowledge of necromancy. On the other hand, I think (character-wise) it's completely out of the question.

The one thing that does worry me about all this dangerous knowledge that Zorian's effectively gathering is that his duplicates have been slowly becoming more and more independent, and that seems like it could be leading up to one of them going rogue.

This is more what I mean by 'going rogue' - Zorian's very dangerous if he's not constrained by his morals. If one of his duplicates decides that nuking a city will make it easier for him to (for example) steal an item from the royal treasury, it just might go ahead and do it.

That makes /slightly/ more sense, but sounds very inefficient and unreliable. What if it results in the capital assuming the country is under assault and beefing up security? And there's no point in drawing away any "special countermeasures" for wraiths, because priests were not the obstacle to robbing the treasury in the first place.

Plus the moral implications, because souls are indestructible, so this will have eternal implications despite the time loop.

Unless the difficulty of creating big time-dilation rooms is an intrinsic issue of space-time magic in general, not just 3D-spatial magic. In which case trying to bring the orb into the room in an effort to cheat the system will only show that the experimenter doesn't understand the principles on which the spatial magic works in general.

Would depend on a word of god though.

Maybe the way pocket dimensions work is that they create a gate into a completely different space, not space folded inside actual space. This way it wouldn't matter where the pocket dimension is created since it's only a gate to a completely separate space.

******* I felt slightly compelled to figure out the grammatical rule at play on the first one. The best answer I found came from [[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/29843/types-of-followed-by-singular-or-plural][here]].

For the phrase "a certain type of artifact(s)", whether artifact is singular or plural depends on if we're using it in an uncountable or countable sense.

If Zorian means that he can sense a single type of the set of things which can be described as artifact-like (referring to the /idea/ of an artifact), he should be using singular artifact.

If Zorian is referring to a single type of a well-known, countable list of specific artifacts, then the current plural usage is correct. In this case, I'd argue that the set /should be/ qualified (e.g. "a certain type of /Imperial Artifacts/"), but that detail might be left out if it's sufficiently implied by the context.

Again - the Guardian listed the ways to obtain a marker, and that wasn't one. And the Guardian isn't in the habit of silently concealing information; either it tells them what they ask for, or it tells them that they're not allowed to know.

*********** Won't rule it out, but I'm betting against it. Sure, the Guardian said it didn't know what criteria were used to choose a particular Controller, so that's not impossible, but why would it need to say that if choosing a Controller based on fixed criteria (inheritance) is built into the Key?

**** I think all the keys are controlled by a soul marker while in the time loop. The marker probably allows its users to get the keys no matter what. In this case it can force the orb out of its activated state so loopers can actually retrieve it. The gate is designed very well and it wouldn't make sense for the keys to be unobtainable. The actual control for them in the real world is probably something else.

*** Daimen probably took the opportunity to inform him that Zorian is, in his own way, just as dangerous as Zach. And remind him that they still need Zorian's help in finding the orb. And point out that Alachi was lashing out emotionally instead of logically; Zorian's actions were reasonable and helpful, the presence of the hydra wasn't his fault, he saved some of their lives during the fight, and Alachi is just understandably upset about the loss of his friend.

I'm not sure I'd go that far; so long as you ignore the whole "everything I do and think is perfectly controlled by the mentalist" possibility (because you would be helpless in that case, so it's pointless to consider), then you can still reason about the presence or absence of mental tampering based on your current thoughts.

** I'm curious how Zorian would be able to kill the hydra on his own given enough time, training, and attempts.

My guess is a group of specialized golems plus some mind control. Maybe he could learn that slicing spell Zach used in combination with an anti-teleportation field.

I'm also curious what abilities or insights could be gained by making potions out of the corpse. I hope these questions get explored later!

Nah, that's Zach's thing. Zorian fights for practice, to keep himself alive; I've yet to see him fight for fun. Studying its corpse, maybe. Or its mind, if they can somehow incapacitate a creature with that level of regeneration.
