Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I've been trying to create a scheduled sit-down-and-write habit for myself for the past month, in preparation for NaNoWriMo. I found a good cue at the same time every evening, and it gets me into hands-on-keyboard position with near perfect accuracy. The problem is that this only works when I am on base, because this cue is a part of my larger schedule. I have off every other week, though, and I know that when I get home next Monday, sitting down to write my 1,667 words every day is going to be about a gazillion times harder.

Any suggestions? Anything that works for you that I should try?

*** I assume that 1667 words is the 50,000 words divided by 30 days?

My suggestion would be write more than that, say 2000, so that way if you happen to miss a day once or twice a week, you'll still be on track. You don't want it to be November 27th, something unavoidable happen for a couple days, and then have to write 5000 words on November 30th.

Doing even a little bit extra will build in a buffer so that things like that can't happen.

**** Yes, that is a correct assumption.

That's the best plan so far, yeah. I wrote 2,275 yesterday, and am almost at 2,000 today, and I'm planning on writing over the limit whenever I can. The consistency of it is what makes it doable, though. At home, I don't have much of a schedule - if I miss a day, I'm likely to opt-out the next day as well. That avoidance-inertia...

***** CFAR calls this "Trigger-Action Planning": find a recurring trigger and associate the action with it. You clearly have one that works on base, no create one for off base. This could be as simple as "set an alarm for the same time every day, or "right after I put my breakfast dishes in the sink."

****** Yes, this is definitely something that works. On base, the trigger (I was just reading /The Power of Habit/ by Charles Duhigg, which uses the term 'cue') is getting off of work for the day, which is impossible to ignore because it involves walking across the base for fifteen minutes, and then I just go sit at the cafe (and reward myself with a drink or something) instead of continuing on to my room.

At home, there's nothing quite like that in my schedule, and an alarm is far too easy to ignore. I don't even have to ignore it - I just acknowledge it, and tap it off, like I would if I were about to go get my laptop and start writing. And then I just wouldn't go get my laptop and start writing.

"Right after I clean my dishes" sounds like something that could be pretty effective, especially since I'll already be standing up, and having just done something that my brain counts as being productive. Thanks for the ideas!

If you want to make something a habit, make it rewarding. I noticed this when I actually made myself a sandwich to take to work today, /just because I had a sandwich grill to toast it on/.

A tiny increase in the rewardingness made it appealing enough to do the work of carrying out a good habit I always know I should have.

****** I've been doing this by buying myself something to drink as soon as I get to the cafe where I do my writing, as further incentive not to go straight to my room once I leave my office at the end of the day. I'll have to figure out what to use as a reward at home...

*** If at all possible, get some accountability going. One of the reasons that I like writing serials is knowing that if I end up late on a chapter, someone is going to come along and poke me about it. Without that, it's pretty easy to just let a project linger, begin avoiding it, and then never finish.

Options for this:

- Find a NaNo buddy who will call you on not getting anything done
- Set up a deposit with some internet stranger which you won't get back unless you e-mail them your words every night
- Rope in a friend or family member who will check your work

The idea is that if there's a social or monetary penalty for failure, you're more likely to find the time to continue on.

***** Yeah ... that didn't happen. Clearly. Partly because I tried writing it in the style of an in-universe scholar, which I think just turned out more wanky than an explanation of a magic system already is. I will try to get that out by this weekend, then split time on the second appendix and National Novel Writing Month, which I think is doable.

**** This is definitely a good idea. I'd noted this effect when I was on the official NaNo site a few weeks ago, and reciprocated a buddy-add from someone. I just realized that, although I have people who know I am doing NaNo, and friends who I have added on the site, I highly doubt they'd actually check my word-count. I'll have to try and get someone to stalk my word-count and bug me about it.

Thanks muchly.

*** What worked for me is the following:

- Use the Workspace feature of my computer to put the Google Docs window over in Workspace 2, with /nothing/ else there, or at least, nothing there but the writing and writing-related stuff (eg: tabs for research or whatever).

- Write dialectically. Sometimes I've got a particular line of rhetoric or narrative "burning", sitting around in my active working memory and asking to be put on the page. Most of the time, hell no. So instead I start by just writing down the /questions/ relevant to each section, and working out the answers via a dialectic with my own brain. Only once I've thoroughly worked out the actual core content do I then start writing things out with narrative or rhetorical /style/.

This has actually been especially helpful for fiction, as it lets me separate a character's perspective from the "objective" events I'm inventing in the "third-person" view.

**** Generally, I don't have much of a problem writing once I'm sitting down at my computer with the document open in front of me - it's just getting to that position each day that's like trying to cross a violent river while hefting a boulder over my head and stepping only in time with music I can barely hear over the rushing water.

I don't have my laptop connected to wifi while I write - I used to use this Chrome addon that let you shut off your own internet access for a set amount of time with no take-backs, though I haven't needed to use it this year. I love how absolute the Google Docs fullscreen is, when you make the window fullscreen as well as hide the toolbar. Pristine.

Dialogue is always what really gets me itching to put words to paper- or screen - and I often end up with White Room scenes because of this. Sometimes I let it run its natural course and then go back and add in description after, and sometimes I say screw it and let it sit until post-NaNo editing. Rarely, I will actually remember to add description of the room/area while writing, but after reading your points I'm thinking I should maybe set up the visuals before going into a scene, as a sort of bullet-point format right on the page, then add each point in where appropriate.

Thanks for the helpful response.

** I've been trying to figure out whether there's a game theory approach to Cutthroat Kitchen. Basically, it works like this:

- Four chefs compete.
- There are three rounds of cooking.
- One chef is eliminated at the end of each round.
- Chefs are given $25,000 at the start of the competition with which to bid on sabotages against each other.
- At the end of the game, you walk away with only the money you have remaining (and only if you're the last one standing).

No one wants to spend the money they've been given, because that's money that they don't get at the end of the competition (and money they can't spend on future sabotages). No one wants to get the sabotage, because that lowers the chance of moving on to the next round (or winning).

Basically, this adds in a few extra wrinkles to the game theory approach to open ascending-bid auctions. /There/ I believe the equilibrium strategy is to set a price you're willing to pay and then don't go past that, unless it's an iterative auction in which case there's a strategy of "bidding up" your opponents so you can more easily win future auctions. In Cutthroat Kitchen, the primary wrinkle is that if you lose the auction, you're less likely to make it to future rounds but more likely to win future auctions.

I've been trying to figure out whether there's a particular strategy that you'd pursue if you found yourself facing down three of your clones, or a strategy that you could quickly convince the other three of prior to the start of the show.

*** The first (actually the third, but never mind the first two) thing which comes to mind is for the chefs to precommit--either by Consequences or by mutually trustworthy agreement, as with clones--not to use sabotage.

On one end, for maximum motivation and authenticity for viewers/show/future-reputation, winner takes all. On the other end, for maximum safety, winner splits between all. Different ratios of splitting are possible, potentially calculated according to estimated chances of winning.

--Here's another way of looking at it. If you /don't/ think you can win, then maximising the expected money for all chefs is much better than any sabotage (unless no money at all goes to losing chefs). If you DO think you can win, then nothing's better than 'winner takes all without sabotage', and a quarter of the money is better than losing and getting nothing due to sabotage (assuming that at least two chefs will notice how good you are and be willing to spend up to three quarters of their money on sabotaging you).

For it to be worth accepting sabotage, you have to think that you can win somehow while spending less than 3/4 of the month on sabotage, but that you can't win without sabotage. I haven't checked the numbers, but this can perhaps been addressed by the concept of people with more likelihood of winning getting a bigger share, so that they have potentially less they would be willing to spend on sabotage.

Now, if the rules are enforced and there's no way to split it or agree on no-sabotage... hmm. Well, for one thing try to toe the line so as to stay in the running while not being seen as a threat, until the end. That case, now... not sure whether there's any better approach than 'refuse to sabotage and hope opponent does the same', if imagining two people with equal skills for which magnitude of sabotage determines victory (and for which no agreement or precommitment is possible).

*** So, assuming nobody bids on sabotage and equal cooking skill, the EV of this competition is $6,250. Therefore, if you can collude with your opponents, the correct strategy is to decide ahead of time for one player to deliberately flub their dish per round in return for $6,250 from the player who is chosen to win. If someone defects in the first round, the player chosen to lose the next round bids $25,000 on sabotaging that player. This strategy only falls apart in the last round, as there is no player left to enforce the concession.

That's the best I have.

**** If they had the funds, all players could collude by depositing $25,000 with a trusted third party which would be paid back in the event of either a loss or evenly dividing the full amount of loot following a win. Then the expected value for anyone attempting to buy a sabotage would be a net loss and all parties would evenly split the winnings following the conclusion of the competition.

There are a few problems with this. Realistically, most contestants don't have that much capital, most contestants would imagine themselves as more skilled than their competition and thus willing to forgo entering into the scheme because their EV is highly than $6,250 (which would mean that there would have to be extra pressure applied to anyone who didn't opt-in), the producers would probably cotton on and take action, etc.

***** Actually, I just came up with a much better plan.

Have the guy who draws the shortest straw really ham it up on camera about how he will easily crush all opposition. When sabotage bidding comes, have him bid $1 to sabotage /himself/ as a "show of dominance." This will simultaneously knock him out of the running in a believable way and produce a compelling narrative for the producers to sell, decreasing the likelihood that the show gets stopped by suspicious producers. In the second round, have the guy who is supposed to lose third bid $20,000 (reducing his EV to below what complying would get him) to sabotage the guy who's supposed to lose in the second round, saying something like "I feel like he's the only threat left, now that Large Ham has been knocked out." In the last round, the guy who's supposed to win wins because his winning increases everyone's EV.

If the first guy defects, the second guy has his entire pool to work with to take him out. If the third guy defects, the second guy still has a large pool to work with. This only really falls apart if both 1 and 3 defect.
