Players once trapped in a video game world find a way to connect it to the original world... but since the video game world is a real world in its own right, they get to keep their powers, and people back on earth can figure out how to use them as well. Politics ensue.

Log Horizon fans will get the most out of this, but it's written so as to be relatively understandable by people not familiar with the source material.

Still looking for a beta! PM me for details.

Had another deleted scene in here, but didn't replace it with anything, so this chapter's shorter than normal. I've decided to put deleted scenes and side stories in chapter ten, though, so you'll see them eventually.

Incidentally, because I have two of these threads on the front page (which is sort of a waste) I've decided to post the threads for two chapters at once at the same time, although my actual update schedule will remain the same.

** Interesting chapter, I'm curious to see what will Tetra do now. Changing gender and appearance back to his original one would be easy and would help with interacting with her parents, but on another side it would be also interesting if she went as Tetra, as she's a very food proof of that world's capability in gender switch.

Interesting that they are now mass producing the sex change potions, that could be a great resource to trade with the Earthlings, assuming it does work on normal humans.

I found it neat how Tetra is comfy in their own gender in the 'whichever body I am, I'm me' sense, rather than the 'only a male/female body is me' it commonly seems to take the form of. To my understanding, anyway, which is admittedly rather tiny.

Agreed that genderswap potions are gonna be a sought-after trade commodity, though, right alongside health and possibly poison-cure potions (provided stuff like 'cancer' reads as poison).

*My Thoughts on the chapter*

Oh my, what a cliffhanger. Love the casualness of the statement, too, as well as showing how the non-human races have been adjusting to their enhanced senses and new features. The fact a human race also has a new sense to adjust to is quite good worldbuilding; wonder what its like for the races on other servers?
