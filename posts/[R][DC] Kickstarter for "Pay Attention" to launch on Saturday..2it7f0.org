Hey everyone,

A few days ago, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ie329/questions_about_a_kickstarter_to_fund_a_story/][I mentioned]] that I would be doing a Kickstarter to fund the rational horror story that [[/u/Timewinders]] wanted.

That Kickstarter launches noon the day after tomorrow -- Saturday, October 11, 12pm Pacific time. I'd really appreciate it if y'all would mention it to a few friends. This is a test run for me; if Kickstarter works well for this project, I will be doing a lot more writing and funding it through Kickstarter. I'm quite happy to write requests, so making this one work is a good way to ensure there's more rational stuff out there that you want to read. (Or irrational stuff. Or kinda-rational-but-not-entirely. Or whatever; I'm not fussy.)
