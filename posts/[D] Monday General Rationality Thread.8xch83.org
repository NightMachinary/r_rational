Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** TLDR: I've been reading too much Practical Guide to Evil. Politics is undead, blue-eyed spiders.

I had a conversation with my father about gerrymandering, specifically the lately topical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote#Efficiency_gap][efficiency gap]], and he expressed the opinion that the ideal vote percentage is 100%. In other words, the best possible candidate would be a perfect representative respected by all and thus receive the whole of the vote.

Indeed, he was of the opinion that the larger the percentage of the vote a candidate receives, the more effective they have campaigned or (indeed) the more effective their district has been shaped to allow that their political views should match those of the overwhelming majority.

To me that seemed vaguely horrifying. Every complex (broadly) political situation I've been in where everybody agrees has made me a little nervous. I've always gotten a sinking feeling that there hasn't been enough discussion, argument even, to justify whatever it is we're doing. So I'd rather prefer an unstable candidate with 30% of the vote in a field of five or six, forming local coalitions and thinking carefully about every decisions and how it might look to everybody who might elect somebody else next time around.

At the same time, I don't think my father is /wrong/ even if I doubt there are many who could truly represent so large a coalition as any district in a nation of millions. Except in times of crisis, of course, when a common concern is at the front of every mind as they listen to campaign speeches and assess ballot options. Things get simpler then.

Nor am I /right/ to prefer things complicated, especially when there are decisions that need to be made and acts to be performed instead of analyzed or inspected or discussed. When times are hard, it's frequently more profitable to be fast than to be careful. They who act first /act/, and as much as I might argue with their results at least they've got them. Right out there in the open. Results.

Makes me feel like my opinion is in the minority rather than the plurality.

Authoritarians are loyal to a fault, naturally arrange into hierarchies, and can be convinced of just about anything that the ends justify. States like we have today never could have formed without them, and the whole of the modern world depends on their foot soldiers. In fat times of peace and safety things can get multi-polar for a while, but if there's winning to be had then some authoritarian faction or other always wins... until the next one shows up.

*** I'm reminded that [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PeSzc9JTBxhaYRp9b/policy-debates-should-not-appear-one-sided][policy debates should not appear one-sided.]] If someone wins with 100% of the vote, they can't be making difficult decisions on policy: the hard decisions won't be universally supported.

Beyond that, your intuition that everyone agreeing 100% isn't a good situation seems reasonable to me. If everyone is of a single mind... it's likely that everyone has literally lost their minds. Single mindedness is concerning in large groups.

It's only natural that times of peace and safety afford argumentation. It's at those times that the difficult problems that no-one knows what to do about can be addressed. If there's a war on, that has to be dealt with first. In some sense, emergencies are simpler and easier to address than optimization. However, if your house almost burned down last week, that doesn't mean it isn't important to carefully choose new furniture this week.

Still, sometimes it's "It would be best to knuckle down and just buy a couch already: we've been standing around for too long."

*** Hmmmm. There are two ways to think about this discussion here.

The first way, and the way that I suspect that you are thinking about it: /First/ the districts are divided up by some or other method; and /then/ the voters select their chosen candidate. In this circumstance, I do agree with you, a 100% vote percentage would be a cause for nonspecific existential horror.

The /second/ way to look at it is to invert that; /first/ have the citizens vote, and /then/ split them into districts depending (more or less) on that vote. With this ordering, it is no longer horrifying to suggest that district 1 had close to 100% votes for party A or that district 2 had close to 100% votes for party B - because the /districts/ were specifically chosen in such a way as to make that happen, and pretty near everyone gets the candidate for which they voted to be in charge of them. So, in this ordering, it's not that people have failed to discuss, or have been forced into agreement; on the contrary, they have picked their sides and /then/ those sides have been segregated and each given their chosen leader.

Now, I can't say for sure, especially since I'm only hearing your report on the original discussion, but is it possible that your father was thinking in terms of the second option, instead of the first?

*** /Warning: Major Spiders/

You should tell your father that the point of gerrymandering is to create 100/0 districts /only for the opposition,/ while your own party has a greater number of 60/40 districts. If he truly cares about his claimed principles he should still be against gerrymandering, as it means you are literally disenfranchising that 40% in every district they can't win, and effectively disenfranchise them in the 100/0 districts because they won't get enough representation to matter.

If he actually cares about his argument and isn't just trying to defend a corrupt practice which benefits his tribal interests, he needs to know that current gerrymandering practices don't accomplish his claimed goals. They don't put all Rs and all Ds into separate districts, they slice people up to make every district as unfair as possible. Of course, even without knowing you or your father, I can predict that he will deflect or shut down when this is pointed out to him. The Republican Party is Evil, and Evil corrupts even those who are otherwise good.

(It is important to note that, when I say the Republican Party is Evil, I mean that its ideology and leadership are evil. Republican voters are only evil if they realize that what they are voting for hurts people and still vote Republican. Remember that propaganda attacks known security flaws in human cognition, and you can't really blame individuals for failing to defend against those most of the time.)

  (It is important to note that, when I say the Democratic Party is Evil, I mean that its ideology and leadership are evil. Democratic voters are only evil if they realize that what they are voting for hurts people and still vote Democrat. Remember that propaganda attacks known security flaws in human cognition, and you can't really blame individuals for failing to defend against those most of the time.)

  I call the Democrat Party and its leadership evil because every single one of their platform positions and nearly all of their recent legislative agendas have been focused on serving the powerful over the powerless, or because they outright cause massive, provable harm.

  The strongest example of this is climate change fearmongering. There is zero reason, from an evidence-based perspective, to believe anthropogenic climate change is harmful. The evidence is meagre for both its size and its consequences. The Democratic Party, however, denies this. They do not do it because they are Saturday morning cartoon villains, but because they stand to gain -in the short term- from advancing antiscientific policies and because they are willing to sacrifice the future of the entire fucking human race to line their pocketbooks now. The evidence for this interpretation of their motives is also staggering, as numerous reports show that green-energy initiatives and subsidies have had zero impact on the environment and Democratic leaders have chosen to ignore this in favor of greed.

GTFO. This is exactly what the "No politics" rule was imposed to prevent.

If you want to be taken seriously, you need to consider that maybe, just maybe, your own "cognitive security flaws" have been exploited, causing you to think irrationally about certain topics. I don't blame you for failing to defend against them.

***** I understand perfectly why the No Spiders rule exists. However, the topic came up, and now I wish to defend my position.

What I said could be a template only if any of the things I said were untrue, which we both know is not the case. On the pro-life issue, I concede that they could potentially have a point if one accepts the premise that provably consciousnessless possible-future-humans deserve the same civil rights as an adult human. However, their actions on other topics show that Republican ideology doesn't actually believe this, and their actions on the topic of female reproductive rights show that the only goal they could really have is a return to the times when women were completely dependent upon men. We can see this in their opposition to birth control, which is the single greatest means of preventing unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Though it is absolutely true that some Republicans do believe that abortion is murder, they do not rationally examine their other beliefs to determine what the best course of action is given this belief. They vote for the people who ban abortion, even though the other actions of those people have been shown countless times to /maximize/ abortion, legal or not.

Again, I am sorry for the spiders. But I needed to explain my positions on these topics because I honestly think the Republican Party is an existential threat to humanity.

Everything you say reads like you haven't actually studied opposing positions. It sounds like a leftist manifesto which purports to reveal what the enemy is actually thinking. I recommend that you actually stop and listen for a moment. But this is not the forum for it.

**** Saying that any specific ideology is evil, means you'll never understand why people would follow it. That way, you'll just just call anybody who follows that ideology as evil, because you can't understand why anyone would support something like that, and'evil' does not require a logical reason.

***** Other people may not do this, but when I say that something is evil, it describes a certain category of behavior which is highly rational, but predicated upon selfishness or bad information, and which results in significant harm to self or others. I understand perfectly well why people choose to engange with ideologies and in activities which I categorize as evil, and I do not use it as a nebulous othering label meant to dismiss people out of hand.

I call the Republican Party and its leadership evil because every single one of their platform positions and nearly all of their recent legislative agendas have been focused on serving the powerful over the powerless, or because they outright cause massive, provable harm.

The evidence for this interpretation of their motives is also staggering, as numerous reports show that oil executives have known about anthropogenic climate change since the 70s and have chosen to ignore this in favor of greed.

I do not have a better word to describe behavior that self-centered, callous, greedy, malicious, and downright /existentially risky/ than Evil. If that behavior is not Evil, then the word Evil has no meaning or purpose. Therefore, I strongly disagree with your assessment of my nomenclature. Evil is a perfectly acceptable descriptor of the Republican Party, and for those who have the power to know and act better and still choose not to.

** A friend of mine has to write his bachelor's thesis.

He has to compare two countries education system using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle][hermeneutic circle]]

Now the philosophy behind the idea when it was developed, seems kind of pseudoscience-y. I know, just because the explanation is allegedly BS, doesn't mean the method is wrong. And the method got changed since it's beginning. It claims to help interpret textes.

But still, it looks wrong. And I don't know if it has any advantages over just trying to interpret the school system.

So my question:

Does anyone know that methodic? Anything someone used it for? Is it useful in general? Is it useful for my friend?

(btw The countries are very similar. Both in the EU.)

*** Hermeneutics is a thing, but not really a methodology per se. I sort of think of it as using brute force g (the general intelligence factor) on an object of study. That's not entirely true though, because it's also a discipline that can be trained. It's trained more by repeated applications of g to similar subjects, though, rather than by learning specific methodologies, as in science.

A problem with hermeneutics is that it's tied to rhetoric, because you need to be a decent rhetorician to get across any ideas you arrive at through hermeneutics. Though hermaneutics is probably the most powerful single way to draw insights about the world, and is kind of the only way to draw insights about the epistomological hall of mirrors that is individual human psychology and the products of individual human minds, the difficulty of transferring conclusions to others means that it doesn't leave us with the same kind of dramatic generational accretion as in science. However, it's applicable to every field of human endeavor, rather than the limited fields of endeavor to which science can reasonably be applied.
