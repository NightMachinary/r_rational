  The demons aren't even an army. They're a swarm. You try to resist them, and they just cover you, and *it feels like everything good is sucked out of the world*, and then you run.

And thusly it was proved that Ngo is a demon.

***** Ngo has to be similar to Jane (at least in terms of the amount of trouble Scott was /really/ in when she captured him) because that's how the vanishing name works.

******* Oh. i saw it as "held hostage by Ngo" vs "held hostage by jane"

But i guess "saved by Anna from Ngo" vs "Saved by Jane from military forces" works too

** I am updating the wiki, specifically the chapter pages. My current plan is to include the following sections:

- Title (eg. Dark Satanic Mills is from William Blake's /And did those feet in ancient time/, and is a reference to the industiral revolution destroying relationships.)
- Characters (both main viewpoint, and others mentioned)
- Time/chronology.
- Plot summary.

Anything I should add or remove?

I made a post in [[/r/UNSONG]] over [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unsong/comments/4suxo7/updating_the_wiki/][here]] to keep the comments consolidated.

  I was...actually kind of shocked at how militarized [the NYPD] were already.

  I was...actually kind of surprised how many guns there were.

  We've rigged all the bridges to explode. I was surprised how close some of them already were to...

*** Am not totally knowledgeable on this, but it kind of bothered me because I thought the militarization of the police was a primarily post-9/11 thing.

**** Arguably started in the 60s with the creation of SWAT, but also arguably didn't start until the 80s and the war on drugs. 9/11 didn't help, nor did postwar military surplus being sold to police departments.

It did feel a little anachronistic to me.

***** It could be that other events in their universe militarised them even more than in ours. Also there does seem to be some kind of weird convergence/yoking going on between their world and ours.

****** Especially with the slow disintegration of the Federal Government. The kind of thing the National Guard used to do probably became responsibility of the local and state police departments.

That is literally how the Unsongverse works. Nothing is ever a coincidence.
