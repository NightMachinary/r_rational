** I once posted this comic to here when it was finished, and 8 months later, the epilogues have just been posted. So here I am again reposting it to here.

It's a comic about time travel, eldritch monsters, clones, and lots of investigating and deduction to figure out confusing rules behind reality. Some romance and competency in dealing with emotions as well for those who are interested in that sort of thing.

Jack is planning to clean up and edit grammar errors as well as missing pictures, so if you want to wait a few more weeks, the quality should be improved, but it'll be minor stuff. The plot is set and there's no way he'll be rewriting anything into a second draft.

*** Holy cow man congrats, that comic has been going on for years now and I can't even imagine the relief you have to be done with it. Any future projects or will you be taking a break for now?

**** AHAHAHAHA!!!!!

I wish I was this creative, dedicated, or talented, but no I'm not the author.

Jack talks about his future plans in the author's notes if you want to know.

***** Oh, that makes sense, glad to find another reader also staying up late to read that last chapter with me, I'll miss having it to look forward to every day but it was a good ending.

**** The story has a certain momentum to it. I bounced off it more than a couple of times during the first third, but after a certain point it was hard to put down.

***** How far did you get before you started getting into it? I've tried it a couple times, and while I want to like it, it always just kind of drags on and I eventually put it aside and then don't end up going back.

I slogged my way through all of Homestuck, so I'm not sure why I lose focus with this, but I do for some reason.

****** Without getting into spoilers, there is this long extended dreary section that keeps going and going, and it feels mostly about getting past environmental obstacles in excruciatingly slow detail.

It didn't help that at that point of the story, the plot is a bit mysterious and it feels like Bina is just sorta fumbling blindly through with no real understanding of what is happening or why.

I can't exactly remember when I started getting engaged with it, but it was the section I described above that was frustrating enough to see me bounce of it multiple times, despite being rather intrigued.

After that, there was plenty that shined to the point where I can safely say that it ranks among some of my favorite things I've read online.

******* Ok, yeah, I think that was the bit I'm stuck at. It seems really long, and there was no clarity on where anything was going. I'll see if I can push past that next time I've got time to kill. Thanks.

** All Night Laundry is great. Someone recommended it here as it was wrapping up and I devoured it all in like a fortnight or something. A simple comparison would be its like Homestuck if 80% of the content was cut out, and thus not a giant clusterfuck and instead a much more digestible and engaging story about (similarly to Homestuck) averting a time travel related apocalypse from an innocuous beginning point, puzzling out everyone else's motivations and goals, and also hitting on notes of relationships, identity, family, dreams, and ambition. Please read it.

Also the intentional changing and evolution of the art and aesthetics over time is neat too.

*** So I'm up to page 80, and one thing I hope this has in common with Homestuck is that it eventually ditches the "interactive" concept. While I'm sure it was fun when the comic was still ongoing, as a new reader of the completed work, I find it really immersion-breaking.

**** The process of the comic being made is part of the experience of reading the story. However, the author does take fewer user suggestions over time, for reasons he explains in a high quality blog post. I found it fun to read the author comment at the end of each page.

** I've read a bit more than a third of the way through and I don't think I will be continuing.

I haven't found it to be particularly "rational". The mysteries are vaguely science themed, and they talk about pop quantum physics things like Schrodinger's cat and the double slit experiment, but that does not make a "rational" story.

The biggest sin is that a large number of scenes, perhaps even an actual majority of scenes (in what I've read so far), can be described as "character(s) are trapped while scary monster slowly approaches, then a deus ex machina rescues them after they suffer some severe injury". That's almost the polar opposite of "rational fiction".

Plus the characters are unrealistically psychologically resilient, but that's par for the course for horror.

*** This is a bit hard to respond to without getting into spoilers.

It'd be like talking about complaints about worm with someone who dropped it or was midway through the story, while not willing to talk about the Entities.

Even addressing that spoilers exist that might push against these points is a bit of a spoiler in and of itself, but I feel obligated to say /something/ having finished the story.

I've been staring at the screen for a while now, and erased a couple of attempts, but I can't think of a way to address your points without talking awkwardly around spoilers.

I dunno, maybe others who have also finished the story can chime in and agree or disagree with me that I feel like these issues are addressed by the end of the story.

**** I believe I'm aware of what you're alluding to (I was more than third of the way through, which is past a great deal of significant reveals), but that doesn't change the nature of my complaint in the slightest. Each situation is still filled with deus ex machinas.

***** Fair enough.

For me there were enough extenuating in-universe reasons for why it bothered me less, but you're right that I do remember it happening quite a few times.

The repetition was a bit eh even if ignoring the plausibility angle.

I did quite like a lot of the other stuff going on though.

*** It is definitely closer to "fun for fans of rational stories" than it is "in a similar style to HPMOR and the stories EY was inspired by."

But it has a conceit similar to the anime Steins;Gate, where crazy coincidences that seem like bad writing, are explained later by time travel or other shenanigans.

** It's really impossible to understate how well written this multimedia webcomic is. Its just so damn cool, the art is great, and the plot is tight as hell. It's also the only piece of fiction I've read with time travel where a)the time travel is done well b) the rules of time travel are consistent and well explained and c) the time travel shenanigans don't become incredibly tiresome.

Also, the webcomic makes use of the website format to do some really unique interactive things that I can't honestly say I've seen anywhere else.

** I tried to read this story, and I enjoyed it at first. A new character was introduced later on, and Bina and her companion were really annoying together, their sense of humor was just...ugh. It was a slog to get through those chapters and I eventually dropped it.

I'm still not entirely sure why Bina alone was likable, but Bina + companion was annoying. Weird, but I'm probably the only one who felt that way, lol.
