** *A/N*: Dun dun dunnnn! Probably quite a few of you were expecting it, but here we are. Everyone's favourite renegade lion king is back!

You might have noticed that the Lion King has some contemporary themes. I mean, hyenas which are not allowed to enter the Pridelands because they are foreigners who cannot be trusted? And then in the Lion Guard cartoon you have Kion who for the first time invites other species into his guard, one of them a girl, much to the chagrin of his traditionalist father.

On the other hand, Kion doesn't actually disagree when Zira tells him that lions are superior in her Lions Uber Alles speech (No really, the song is literally called "lions over all"). He just says that 'using fear and threat is no way to rule', and he never questions the fact that he is part of a monarchy. In Simba's Pride, Simba even literally says that not wanting to be a princess is 'like not wanting to be a lion; it's in your blood'. So that's a pretty interesting duality which I wanted to explore.

As for which viewpoint I agree with... well, what do you think? Who is less wrong here, Kion or Jasiri? Write a review and let me know!

** I just went through all 5 chapters, and I have to say, you really picked one of the most niche and obscure fanfic premises there is. Like, does the Lion Guard show even /have/ fans?

Personally, I hated that show, and I'm not a fan of the "talking carnivorous animals want to be vegetarians" types of plot (I didn't like the sharks in Finding Nemo that much), so I'm probably not the story's target audience.

It does make me want to read a fic about prey-predators social dynamics in Stargate Atlantis.

*** I know, I know. I wrote this story because I felt like writing it - I knew from the get go that it wouldn't be as popular as the others, because of the source material. People who don't like Lion Guard very much are the target audience though, as I don't expect anyone to have watched it or liked it. Part of the fun of rational fiction is to try and fix all of the issues with an existing story, of which the Lion Guard has many. Just see it as a stand-alone sequel to Scar's Samsara.

Btw, if it's annoying anyone I can stop posting every update here on reddit: Don't want to drown out the subreddit if bi-weekly posts if that's an issue.

**** It's not annoying me; I'm not really thinking "Oh my god, if this idiot Sophronius keeps drowning out this subreddit with his dumb story I might miss the next r!Animorphs update!"

I know you've already written your stuff and it's too late, but I don't think Lion Guard is good fanfic material.

It's bad, but it's not bad because the authors were misguided or limited by censorship or executing an interesting concept poorly. It's bad because it's a soulless cash-grab, with abysmal production values and unimaginative writing. I don't think there's anything redeeming about it; unlike a cartoon like, say, Star vs the Forces of Evil, which I also dislike, but at least has a personality and interesting ideas.

***** I'm not sure I follow. Why does the source material being bad mean it can't be good fanfic material?

****** This is my very subjective perspective as a guy who reads fanfic and has never written any, but I think good fanfic material is stuff that frustrates its readers, because they see great potential in it or its universe, or they like the franchise in general, but they're disappointed by the execution.

Stuff like Star Wars or Naruto or Harry Potter is great fanfic material because everybody loves them, but they all have parts that the fandom hates and wish were done differently. I don't think anyone loved or saw potential in the Lion Guard.
