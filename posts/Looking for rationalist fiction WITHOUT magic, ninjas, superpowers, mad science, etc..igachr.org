Hey, I'm interested in seeing examples of rationalist fiction that /doesn't/ have "supernatural" powers and the like. The closest example might be /The Steerswoman,/ by Rosemary Kirstein, though this still has an unusual setting. /The Goal/ by Eliyahu Goldratt might be another example, and while it has a real world setting it has an unusual genre ("business novel"). Anyone know of other examples of this sort of thing?


** At this point we're basically talking about "good writing." If there are no magic systems or superpowers to make consistent, rational writing is just a book where the characters act according to their motivations & capabilities.

With that said, here are a few of my favorite realistic-fiction novels I've read over the past few years.

- /Angle of Repose/ by Wallace Stegner: a severely disabled man moves into his grandparents' final home decades after their death and dedicates himself to researching their life on the American frontier. Extremely emotionally compelling, the character of the grandmother is lovingly crafted and relatable.

- /The Martian/ by Andy Weir. Hypercompetence porn & hard sci-fi at their best. A better title might be "The Engineer."

- /Ishmael/ by Daniel Quinn: if you can get over the telepathic gorilla, there's nothing magical or supernatural here--just a razor-sharp inquiry into the nature of human civilization & the root causes behind why it looks the way it does.

If you're interested in nonfiction, I highly recommend /Collapse/ by Jared Diamond. It features several case studies of civilizations that have either failed or survived to the present day, and discusses the reasons for their fates. Meticulously researched and fascinating. Hint: it's all about adaptability.

*** No, "rationalist writing" is a very different concept to "good writing"!

Rationalist writing aims to educate the reader, and to model real-world cognitive and emotional techniques.

Good writing is often not even rational: a well-written romantic comedy, or even farce, would very rarely be improved by the characteristic coherence of a rational setting and characters.

UNSONG, to name a specific example, is in my opinion an excellent but non-rational novel - well written, characterised, and plotted; but while it hangs together well it violates Sanderson's First Law (magic mechanics are relevant to the plot while also unpredictable to the reader). This isn't a bad thing, it's just a different genre!

***** I think there are two types of comedy being conflated:

1) laughing at someone because what they did was stupid, e.g. slapstick humor. I'm generally not a huge fan of this type of humor, especially when it veers into the mean-spirited, but if someone else enjoys it, fine. Humor is subjective.

2) laughing at situations that would not arise if the characters acted perfectly rationally. Or, more broadly, enjoying a situation that could have been avoided through perfectly rational decisions (calling the cops instead of following the creepy figure). Since people in real life often make irrational decisions, this strikes me as realistic and satisfying.

*** I anti-recommend Ishmael. It has weak reasoning and an overall smug tone, and really is just a long tract wrapped up in a little fiction to make it more palatable and avoid the need for citations. The case against civilization has been made better elsewhere.

Edit: Hmm, after saying this I realize one could also claim this applies to HPMOR. But Ishmael really is just pure preaching, HPMOR at least has plot.

**** If you read it as a case against civilization, I'd encourage you to give it another try. The purpose of the book is to make (presumably human) readers look critically at their status quo as if from the outside, something which requires a didactic approach. Your perception of smugness likely comes from the fact that Ishmael is always leading the narrator towards the conclusions he wants him to make. It's extremely effective at reframing a lot of issues that most people otherwise wouldn't think twice about.

***** It's been about a decade since I read it, but as I remember it the entire argument is based around group selectionism, which is thoroughly debunked pseudoscience. The idea was that all animals live in a balance with each other and their environment, except humans who are dysfunctional and need to rediscover that balance. This is completely untrue, there is no natural balance and humanity's (pretty meager) ability to self-regulate is already much better than other species'.

****** Yeah I mean it's not a scientific text. As I said above, its virtue is in reframing human civilization as something new & malleable rather than an inevitable/permanent condition of human life on Earth. I'm sure that many people on this sub are aware that human history comprises a tiny fraction of the history of life and that our current arrangement is the equivalent of a particularly fancy anthill, but I'm also sure that the folks here are at least one sigma more educated/introspective than your average person.

As to your last point, I have to disagree. No other species has self-regulated so poorly as to cause a mass extinction since algae started releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. "Second-wost self-regulation ever" isn't exactly stellar praise.

******* Ah, I can see that. That is definitely a useful concept to have, and the book does do a good job of explaining it as far as I remember it. Still, I'm not really comfortable with it also having so many false claims and ideas being presented as fact.

Re: self-regulation, I'd attribute our mass extinction to being way more powerful than other species, rather than self-regulating less. Imagine some predator species gained the ability to kill as easily as we can, say a supernatural ability to shoot magic bullets just by force of will. They would spread across the world and utterly devastate every ecosystem in existence. There would be no conservation efforts, no hunting quotas, no protected wilderness areas. They would simply hunt everything. Humans aren't doing a great job on that front, but we are self-regulating to some degree. Non-human animals simply are incapable of self-regulating on a species-wide or population-wide scale. At all. Ever. That's the whole idea behind group selectionism being wrong, evolution only works on individual families, and never does anything for the good of the species/population/ecosystem as a whole.

******** You don't even need to "imagine". We brought rabbits, goats and cats to islands in the Pacific where they'd never been, and where a much less harsh competition had led to life forms that weren't as used to defending themselves. The outcome was a complete slaughter. Fuck, cats kill /everything that's smaller than them/, and their main advantage is that thanks to us they managed to breed way more that they had any right to as predators, because they share our food supply. But that doesn't somehow make them happy with their luck; leave them free to roam, and they'll obliterate your local fauna of small mammals and birds. And often won't even eat their prey. They just kill for the fun of it.

No other species /needs/ to self-regulate. It's not that they philosophically accept being culled and eaten by predators as a necessary part of the Circle of Life. It's that they don't have spears, or bows, or guns. So they get eaten. They aren't wiser; they're just weaker. What happened with US is that we're sort of an evolutionary singularity. Our intellect allows us to improve and learn on a time scale that's orders of magnitude faster than anything evolution can keep up with, and increases exponentially. So we just broke the game, and even our awareness of it and desire to self-regulate aren't enough to fix that, because we still wouldn't be willing to literally accept /dying/ in order to restore the natural order.

******** There us no "natural order". Predators outcompete other predators to extinction if possible, until only those species are left in the ecosystem that can't outcompete each other either due to different primary food sources or for some other reason. Self-regulation doesn't play into it and wether anything or anyone ever "needs" to self-regulate isn't a thing either, except when they are at risk of hunting their own prey to extinction. Which is also not something other species arw capable of avoiding on purpose.

********* By "natural order" here I didn't mean anything mystical, just the pre-human equilibrium that was more or less stable - with all the unavoidable dynamical fluctuations - as long as the Earth's climate and other external conditions remained approximately constant. There is still change of course, but usually it's on MUCH longer timescales than what we do.

Which is exactly our situation. We've hunted many species to extinction, we indirectly destroyed many others, and we threaten the very climate conditions from which our own food supply depends. So, yes, we /do/ need to self regulate, because nothing can regulate us otherwise short of straight up global environmental collapse.

***** I'd say it's more a case against large scale social organisation. It suggests that humans are naturally evolved to best interact on a tribal scale, and thus should find a way to organise themselves on that level if they want a healthy society. Where a "tribe" doesn't need to be literal people wearing skins and hunting with spears; a commune of a hundred or so hippies living together would also be a "tribe". The key element is size and egalitarian, horizontal organization.

Which is a wonderful idea if then you can explain to me how to design a society in which from the interactions of these minimal units emerges all the complex, large scale behavior that's necessary for our continued survival, all while also being avoiding overexploitation of natural resources AND the appearance of overarching power structures such as kingdoms, countries, empires and the like.

I wouldn't call /Ishmael/ rationalist fiction. Or fiction at all, really. Remove the framing, and /Ishmael/ is just a pamphlet about a specific ideology (which while I do agree on some premises with, in the end boils down to some sort of primitivism that doesn't really feel very realistic or thought out. Like many critics of society, Quinn is better at pointing out its flaws than at suggesting believable solutions).

/Ishmael/ falls squarely within the tradition of philosophical dialogues, like Plato's /Symposium/ and Galileo's /Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems/. So basically just a series of philosophical ideas, presented by means of a fictional dialogue between two or more characters, such as a teacher and a pupil or two people debating. I wouldn't really consider it fiction, the fiction bit is just a framing device.
