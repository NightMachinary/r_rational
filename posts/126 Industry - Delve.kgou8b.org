** You know, when I joked back in summer that we won't see Rain level before the New Years, I didn't think it would be a reality.

Like holy shit, there is this tantalizing fruit that has been hanging over the head for half a year and yet there is absolutely NO sign of it ever becoming reality. This is our Hell of Tantalus.

****** Putting together the info from the passage set in the city of lights (chapter 82) and the val perspective stuff talking about unlocking his father's class, the light/illusion aspect of his power set etc (think after rain saves him in the sewer dungeon some of this was revealed) it seemed obvious to me that this was what was being foreshadowed the whole time. I would have to go back and reread stuff i first read months ago to properly cite the connections/inferences, but will leave that up to someone with more energy. Imo there is no other mysterious in-universe class or power set which has been revealed so far that fits val anywhere near this well. I disagree with the assertion made by the original comment i replied to, i think the world building IS there, it's just slow to be revealed/connected. Val gaining/having the powerset which enables the city of lights to function and exist within a ranked area would be very useful for the current cast of characters in their current location (in an area suffering the effects of a rank shift)

******* Val definitely does NOT have that class. The illuminators that allow the City of Light to function are a crafting class, its mentioned in that POV that they need help killing blues and are therefore usually sponsored by the city/nobility. Val is going for his father's class, and the Lightbringer is a terrifyingly power individual fighter. Val had to solo a blue to unlock his class, that is in direct contrast to a crafter who needs a sponsor to help kill blues.

******** While that may discount 'illuminator', the rumored 'light mage' mentioned in the same passage is a better fit and more likely to refer to Val imo. He also struggled to solo that blue to the point where he nearly died.. Maybe the only difference between the unlocks for those two classes is whether you get help for your blue?

** I'm not among the people that begrudges the pace of /words/, I think it can be really hard to keep a serial going strong. But there are definitely ways to shore up the problem of it seeming slow without actually writing a lot more.

I think the biggest issue is the constant perspective swaps. Ever since GoT on HBO, this has become really popular in all media, but it slows progression to a crawl and makes it harder to really get going. If you mix it with a serial pace, you get these munchkin 1000 word segments that leave you wanting more even if you get a couple of them at once. IMO you shouldn't be switching perspective if you don't plan to stay put for at least 10k words, but maybe I'm crazy.

*** This approach of giving a lot of different alt character view points has become popular in web serials. It lets the author flush out the word count when they're still planning the main plot, and I think it can also keeps thing interesting for the writer if they're feeling burnt out.

The situations where this works well are those where the alt viewpoints are for bonus chapters, though. When given as patreon awards, or as bonus content for meeting funding milestones, these view like a fun extra that you get to read about a world you're interested it. It doesn't work so well when it just takes the place of normal, already slow, updates...

**** Character POVs work well when they show a different aspect of the world, tell an interesting character arc that adds to the world or story, or is another viewpoint on progressing a certain plot in the story, which Worm excels in, with even interludes from Brutus, Sophia, and Blasto being interesting and meaningful, much less the plot-important ones like with Kevin Norton or Chevalier.

The problem with Delve is that these perspective changes are damn pointless. Like, half of them are from random tag-alongs in Rain's company and none of them are memorable or interesting or even unique, much less add anything meaningful through their perspective. Did we get anything meaningful through that Samson or whatever guy's POV? Or from that archer dude? Even Kettel's POV was meaningless, all it told us was another group of idiots being idiotic. Even the fucking dog interlude from Worm was more interesting, informative, and important than any of the Delve POVs we've seen.

Delve, more than any other web novel, confuses me with its pace. And I've read some reaalll shitty Chinese web novels. In this chapter alone we spent a page or so detailing the pointless monsters Rain's hunting, and there's countless more examples throughout the story. It drags on and on with a lot of trivial and pointless details and on uninteresting characters. I generally like fluff and more lore and knowledge on things, but Delve even fails on that front by expounding on completely minor and boring things like all the minutiae of getting supplies, and then talking about the intricacies of said supplies.

Thoroughly disappointing. But you know I'll be back next week.

** I don't see why everyone is complaining about Delve so much. The pacing slowed down, sure, it's slightly fillery, sure, the prose is mediocre, sure, but it was really only terrible around 115-123. The writing of the romance is fucking atrocious; that is definitely the worst thing. Rain being quirky is kind of annoying, but I don't find him to be out of character; he basically has severely magic-induced ADD due to having Clarity much higher than Focus.

It doesn't bother me that Rain hasn't leveled in a while: it makes sense that the resource that bottlenecks the entire setting also bottlenecks the protagonist. They're going to recruit a few more high level people in Ascension later, go caving, then level. It might take 20 chapters but that is reasonable considering the in-universe difficulty of the task. I think the problem people are having is the lack of feeling of progression; SenescentSoul could probably fix it by focusing less on slice of life writing and more on the other ways Rain is progressing: growing Ascension, travelling, building up resistance to soulstrain from his ring, doing technology, etc. But yeah, if you want to desub from his patreon, you probably should. 5k words per week way too little considering his current profit.

**** The thing he's using isn't democracy; it's collective pirate government. This is something the previous threads have mentioned. Rain's system is actually smart (especially the DKP system based on videogame raids) but his calling it "democracy" is misleading and makes him seem stupid.

The problem isn't that the romance is awkward. It's supposed to be awkward, due to Rain's brain damage and social awkwardness as well as Amelia's commitment problems. It's just BADLY awkward; Amelia's thoughts are told instead of shown and the whole thing feels very trite. Amelia and Rain are both fairly competent characters; at this point, one of them could have just said, "Hey, the level difference and consequent power different is difficult, and we might die soon. Wanna date though?" and then we could watch them deal with INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS instead of shitty pre-relationship problems.

I find this sort of dynamic very unrealistic; in my experience, romantic relationships are one of the easier domains in which to apply rationaly to change my own decision making in real life. However, this may different for other people who may easily use rationality on themselves to do chores (with which I struggle) but struggle to do it to overcome interpersonal fear, embarrassment, and status anxiety. YMMV.

I agree with this. There's a bit of a disconnect, because Rain is dealing with trauma and character growth from his mistakes. But it's not very meaningful to us because Rain doesn't lose out on any /resources/ which would make more of an impact, so it feels like Rain has too much plot armor.

That, and every threat Rain has faced has, by slim margins, not been quite focused or quick enough to kill him. Either the monster is just barely killed by some one else's effort immediately before finishing Rain off, or someone just happens to come along and save him in the nick of time. It was fine for the first few encounters of the book. At this point, though? It just highlights how few interactions actually have any semblance of planning and preparation by Rain.

********* A) deciding to go for a support build without understanding the local culture is ill-advised. Worst case, you're in a "I don't have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun the healer" area. Turns out, that's where Rain is.

B) Rain's build /isn't actually a support build/. Rain has, like, /one/ universally combat effective support aura (force ward), one debuff / buff if you've trained for it (velocity), and a probably not combat effective mana regen (essence well).

The rest of Rain's skills are either out of combat nice to haves, metamagic wankery or DPS skills that will literally kill him and everyone around him if he's not careful.

********** I will grant you that Rain should have looked more at the seasonal and imperial auras before some of his metamagic and a second attack aura. (And he should have gone for Darkness if he did take two combat auras because there's no mageburn from that).

That said you're significantly underestimating his party utility, because support skills matter outside of combat too. Rain's overcharged Winter comboed with essence well is not just a "nice to have", but completely frees a mage from having to conserve mana. It allows them to unload their strongest spells every fight, it's a huge advantage to a party.

Detection can foil ambushes (I believe the essence monster Val killed to unlock his class was foiled in this way). Which is a very useful support skill to have. Purify is also a counter to poison or gas attacks, more situational than the others, but a viable support skill that saved a life in the swamp lair they visited.

*********** The fact that people exist and adventure and level up and kill blues without utility auras means that, in the end, they're useful nice-to-haves. Everyone's accustomed to /not/ dumping their entire mana pool, or missing out on stuff, or just dealing with gas attacks - like, literally, the city was built around people dealing with that lair without purify.

Rain doesn't actually have a build or a skill that allows him or his party to do anything /new/, they're just somewhat more effective at the stuff they could already do. In TTRPG terms, that's a bad support build - good supports should allow the party to do things they otherwise couldn't, instead of just being a quality of life thing.

Really, the only enabling "skill" Rain has is the fact that his massive clarity allowed him to remember enough about the details of IRL technology to allow the creation of a steam generator, and even that was an accident.

If your criticism of Rain's build is that ultimately it just makes them more effective at stuff they can already do, then its quite simply a bad criticism. A build that multiplies a parties effectiveness at what they already do is a great build.

Heck, your criticism would apply to a typical RPG healer build. A pure healer doesn't let the party do anything new, but it is a must have for any good party.

************* My point is that he /doesn't/ multiply a party's effectiveness - his utility amounts to a quality of life improvement, not a combat multiplier.

Typical RPG healers do that as a /bare minimum/, while also unlocking more options - druids can talk to animals, clerics can hard-counter a specific set of nasties, both of them can also off-tank and cast situational save-or-die spells.

Rain, without Tallheart's equipment, can maybe tank one blow with force ward, or minorly inconvenience an enemy with velocity. Or, again, /kill himself and everyone around him/. Those are his options.

Allowing mages to unload their biggest spells to the limit of their mana every fight, rather than ration their mana across many fights /is/ a combat multiplier. Every mage becomes several times more effective.

Rain's build is exactly what you get when a numbers-obsessed munchkin is given free reign without consideration for reality. There's all sorts of things he /could/ do, but in practice he can't actually make use of any of it.

Should he went animus, he would not have leveled 3 times a day 100 chapters ago, but at this point he would have being multiple times stronger in fight. And with ring and winter his regen would still be ridiculous.
