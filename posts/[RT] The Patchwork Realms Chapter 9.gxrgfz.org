** Life got interesting and for a while there I fell off the wagon viz a viz writing, but I'm back and planning more regular updates.

** Hey, I notice you only post chapters to /r/ rational. This it might get better traction in [[/r/litrpg]]. I really think it would fit better there.

*** Thanks for the idea.

I did in fact post it over there and it got zero traction. That crowd is very different from this one, it seems -- if you aren't posting every day then you aren't worth reading. I would love to do that, but I simply don't have time.

**** Yeah, while quality of writing/plot matters, it sometimes feels like they care more about frequent updates instead.

** Those sneaky imps! They removed the 5 mana cap on the second version of the contract.

Not that Athos is likely to care about lost stats when returning home, but I hope the disappointment isn't too great if the location and time in spacetime end up completely wrong after Athos has to go through doggie hell first. (Is there even such a thing?)

*** Excuse me! Simon is a demon, not an imp. We all know that they all look alike to humans, but that's no reason to be racist. Er...speciesist? Whatever. Let's go with discriminatory. As to what was it wasn't in the contract, that's not on them. It was a perfectly legal and reasonable contract to which the customer agreed after having unrestricted time to read it and no pressure from the sales demon. If the customer chooses not to avail themselves of said time, that's hardly the fault of PortalCo or its representatives.

:>

And no. All dogs go to heaven, so there is no such thing as doggie hell.

Wait. Do bad dogs go to heaven? If you constantly pee in the house and bite your Peoples and chew up Mom's favorite strappy sandals...

Hm. I may need to revisit some worldbuilding. Thanks for the reminder.

**** LMAO I was just speculating on whether a path through the worlds demons inhabit can even exist for a dog, because as you said, all dogs go to heaven. I had assumed that that's where that was going.

Bad doggie heaven just has lots of grass and gives them a passive buff to self-control so they can be good dogs there.

Nice. I like that. :> I definitely have to have Simon say something disgusted about it... "Doggie hell? Ugh. No. Mary Sue little bastards all go to heaven. Even the bad ones just get a self-control buff and no other consequences."
