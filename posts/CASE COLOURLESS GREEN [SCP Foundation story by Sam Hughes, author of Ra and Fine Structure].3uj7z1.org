  This kind of Cognitohazard Containment Unit is also referred to as a Vegas Room, because what happens there stays there.

  Wheeler was privately hoping that it contained a secret spa for Antimemetics division chiefs.

** This reminded me a lot of that part in the webcomic Freefall when one of the main characters is trying to solve a mystery while suffering induced anterograde amnesia.

One of the primary Questions SCP makes me ask is, what is causing all those anomalies, and this is looking to be trying to be at least a partial answer to the question.

Is 3125 the same entity as the one in "Unforgettable"? They seemed to be extremely similar in theory, extradimensional entities which use memes as focal points for the human world, but in practice they behaved rather differently, one was creating tentacles and things, the other was just making meat puppets of anyone who had the wrong idea.

I also wonder, what evolutionary pressure could push for such antimemetic beings? Could a being have an antimemetic effect so strong that they forget their own existance, yet still function somehow?

#+end_quote

This is directly answered:

"Every competent antimemetics research project finds SCP-3125's fingerprints sooner or later. It manifests all over the world, in thousands of different forms. Most of them aren't even anomalous. Some of them we already have catalogued separately in the main database. A very small number of them are even in containment. Impossibly virulent cults, broken arithmetic, *invisible spiders as tall as skyscrapers*, people born with extra organs which nobody can see. That's the raw data. Those manifestations are troublesome enough to deal with in their own right..."

The "invisible spiders" links to Unforgettable. My interpretation is that, just like how a cube can cast a square or hexagonal shadow, the spiders are one of 3125's shadows.

** u/IWantUsToMerge:
#+begin_quote
  Asynchronous research --- whereby the research topic is forgotten entirely between iterations, and rediscovered over and over --- is a perfectly standard practice in the Antimemetics division
#+end_quote

Then why aren't there more amnesiac study rooms? One possible explanation: Anyone who gets that hardcore about antimemetics research eventually leaks information and gets eaten by SCP-3125.

One must also ask why there arn't cells in the foundation where permanent staff live and study infohazards continuously, where much information goes in but only very limited amounts come out. The containment protocols for SCP-3125 require that NO information can come out but I think this is excessive, clearly highly costly, and not even technically possible - every time an antimemetics staff member walks out of there they get quite a lot of information, information that the SCP does not kill everything it comes into contact with, that it does not leave marks, that it does not drain energy etc, even if that information is not recorded. A single bit to be transmitted by the visiting researcher stating whether the SCP is still active, or a uint8 setting the schedule for the next visit, would have been extremely useful and I believe it's possible to set solid but not overly restrictive limits on the amount of information that can be passed through such outputs over time.

** All of his Antimemetics stories so far have been excellent. One thing I didn't like is that he causally tied all the SCPs from previous stories together --- even if it seems to have been planned so from start.

On a semi-relevant note, what else would you recommend reading to people, who like(d) Hughes' take on antimemetics and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone][RetGone?]] I'd mention M.I.B. 110 [[http://meninblack.wikia.com/wiki/The_Head_Trip_Syndrome][/("The Head Trip Syndrome"),/]] and maybe /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dies_at_the_End][John Dies at the End.]]/

He does say in the comments that he doesn't want to do too much of that. (Emphasis in the original.)

#+begin_quote
  SCP-3125 itself /hasn't/ been directly mentioned before, but many of its manifestations have. However, *SCP-3125 is definitely not the source of /all/ antimemetic phenomena*, any more than the Earth is the source of all gravity. In my view this kind of catchall explanation shrinks the universe and makes it less interesting. It also constrains the storytelling possibilities as we move forward. There need to be other ways to get antimemes, otherwise that's just dull and it ties everybody's hands.

  (Did you notice that SCP-3125 is a monster which eats people who try to find a common origin for too many other SCPs? This is deliberate!)

** Initially, I didn't process the phrase immediately following /"Kim looks confused and worried for a second"/, and had a sudden thought that perhaps the page was self-editing.

Then I thought it would be super great to have some SCP entries/stories self-edit as you read them (e.g., as part of one paragraph, have a reference to a previous paragraph which has changed since you read it). You could check the currently-read position by looking at what words are being highlighted (I almost always highlight when I read on a device with a mouse), or what's not currently being displayed on screen (especially useful for a mobile device).
