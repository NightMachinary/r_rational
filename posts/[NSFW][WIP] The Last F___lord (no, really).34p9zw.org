*** OK I've only just started, but from the games introductory infodump:

#+begin_quote
  the incubus king came from across the ocean and assaulted the world with his hordes of horny ogres and succubi nymphomaniacs. Armies that attempted to oppose him quickly fell prey to their own lusts and joined his ranks of mindless sex-addicts.

  When the great powers of the world combined their forces, they succeeded only in fighting the Incubus King to a standoff. For decades, the world attained a kind of peace. Many nations grew complacent, failing to realize that the Incubus King was only gathering his powers to take control of the world once and for all. And then fuck it in the ass - definitely metaphorically, possibly literally.

  You are a young man born in this era of tenuous peace and granted a momentous destiny. You have been chosen by the goddess Ivala, granted special powers to fight the Incubus King and his evil.

  But power has a way of corrupting, and only time will tell if your power will be used for good or evil...

***** I just tried it out, and to my surprise I'm still playing an hour later. So to offer a counterpoint to the intro blurb above, the very introduction/beginning of the game was very misleading (and distasteful, really, IMO) but it quickly does a very unexpected and somewhat clever 180. I was just about to quit when that happened, too.

The combat itself is... fairly well done, if basic. It actually brings back a lot of old memories from playing similar RPGs on GBA back in the day (Golden Sun comes to mind as the primary example).

The plot is beginning to look a little more interesting and innovative where I'm at, after the initial plot setup is over (I suspect), but besides all the funny meta RPG genre jokes and the decent writing, I'm not sure exactly where the rational part comes in, to be honest. If you can't at least tolerate very explicit (and sometimes /weird/) sex scenes enough to scroll past them, then this isn't for you.

I'm not sure whether I'll continue it, but I /might./ It's been surprisingly not-bad so far. Without the whole sex angle, I'd definitely recommend it just for the interesting story angle (if perhaps not here, though I reserve my judgement on that point for later, if I continue).

On an aside note, [[#s][weak spoilers]]

**** I'm a couple hours in. Game-wise it's competent but ultimately just an RPG-maker rpg; good balance of skills and such, paced well so far. Very, /veeeery/ railroaded straight with no really solid sidequesting or anything so far. Monsters are finite, so presumably it's set to not require grinding. Don't know whether that will change or not.

Erotica-wise, it's /decent/ I suppose. It's all text (and a little sprite art that I don't really count) so far, and easy enough to skip if you don't like it. The couple of introductory sex scenes are almost funny they're so bad, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's being done on purpose, and it gets better soon enough.

/Writing and story-wise/? It's actually telling a really interesting take on classic rpg/heroism (and a few porn/erotica) tropes! What really stands out is the main character; he is pretty much pragmatism personified, but at the same time he does have a personality, and the conflict he has to face is solidly done so far (if a little angsty at first, but understandably so, and not unbearable) A fair deal of actually funny jokes thrown in to boot.

** Ah, this game. I also recommend it, and have been playing it every time it updates. It's quite good, explaining lore around the Demon King and why he behaves such as he does, as well as lots of other neat things. Like mercantile skill and poking fun at common RPG traits like rat-slaying or pail-collecting.

**** FYI, I'm attempting to make the game friendly to people who don't like power leveling. Enemies will always be finite, making grinding effectively impossible. And I always test the game balance with a minimum level party and tweak until there's a strategy to make it through.

It's still an old school RPG, so you know what you're getting, but I don't think grinding has to be part of that experience.

You really have made a game worth getting antsy over, in any case! I especially love the parts about rationally assembling resources and political allies to get an army. And all the worldbuilding you put into it pretty much tells everyone that you really do care about this setting (Though the library was maybe a bit too huge of a chunk of it all at once, but I enjoy reading anyway :P)

** Hey guys! This is Sierra, really glad to see some of you are enjoying my game! I'm new to Reddit, but I figured I'd pop in and answer some questions.

First up, FYI: if you are playing or thinking of playing, the next version of the game is going to release very soon. This will be the first and hopefully only time old save files are invalid between versions - this version of the game is an upgrade in a number of ways. So holding off would be in your best interest unless you want to replay.

Pleasure to featured on this subreddit. I consider rationality a worthwhile ideal and some of that comes out in what I create, but I don't know how many of your criteria the game meets. The items under "rational fiction" strike me as good guidelines for anything, but this game will only meet one or two of the "rationalist fiction" criteria.

Let me be perfectly honest and say they're fairly minor aspects of the story overall, however. I was more interested in deconstructing the adult game genre, as some have noted. People here might enjoy the game, but it'd probably be better suited to some kind of pragmatism subreddit... if they're into NSFW content there. If you guys have suggestions, I'd welcome them.
