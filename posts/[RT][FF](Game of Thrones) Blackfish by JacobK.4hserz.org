** In general I dislike self insert fics, although I can't recall ever reading one like this (were they take over the body of an existing character). So far it has been a great read! I'm enjoying the main character's thoughts/blackfish's instincts interaction and wondering if any conflict will arise from that. The knowing of technology but not being able to build it has also felt very realistic. I look forward to future chapters!

(Sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile)

** Brynden Tully wakes up with that worst of all possible curses, an unprepared self-insert. He knows a whole bunch of supernatural nonsense is about to wreck his kingdom. If he wants to do anything about it, he's going to need an army. Self-Insert, SI, no tech uplift or gunpowder

** Been following it on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blackfish-out-of-water-asoiaf-si.387956/][the SB thread]]. Looks like it's going to be good quality quasi-historical military fiction, similar to Sharpe or other books by Bernard Cornwell.
