Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** The Paradox-Proof Time Machine: A time traveler lands, with its occupant tied up in a straight-jacket with a timed lock, and announces its arrival with radio, flashing lights, and a loud-speaker system. The radio-burst, also includes a lot of data. The accompanying documentation - and the witness testimony of the hapless passenger, explains that you cannot travel to /your/ past, since your past did not include you arriving in a time machine, but, it is none-the-less possible to punt people into a past. From the point of view of the time-line you depart, you just disappear, never to be seen again, so timelines that invent timetravel independently do not tend to use it much, but the senders got a similar package centuries ago, and use copies of that machine very frequently to exile criminals, political opponents, and inconvenient paramours (The guy you got is this, last, category) because the cost of building one is less than keeping people in prison for years, and their government is not very nice.

Capabilities: Max load, 503 kilos, 3 cubic meters. Up to 3 jumps into the past on internal charge, (these were set to auto-trigger on hostile external environment on the exile ship) All jumps are irreversible. It can be recharged, but it eats a mega-watt hour per jump.

Now, obviously, it gets taken apart, and things like its batteries are a major industrial revolution.

Things to munchkin: A: What is this thing good for, other than getting rid of the inconvenient without explicitly getting blood on your hands?

B: You have been judicially sentenced to chrono-exile. You can pick the length of the initial jump, and you may bring anything that fits payload constraints, as long as you can pay for it out of your own resources. What do you bring?

*** A. If you decide being a ruler in the past is better than your present this is useful. Do research, get your tools, go back and conquer. You can also fix tragedies in a past by jumping back and changing them, but you will live in the aftermath not the longer term results.

B. Best case scenario: jump back to before my sentenced crime and prevent it. Letting you live in the most modern time without a problem. Unless the government would punish a future traveller for nonreal future crimes? Worst case: jump back to a lifetime before the forming of the government that sentenced you.

If you can jump geographic locations you can do other things, like a second in the past in another country, my primary goal would be staying as modern as possible without persecution.

Edit: You can use your other two jumps for do overs, the same time but now you've tried once or twice, or if you think you made a mistake picking your time.

*** the ultimate nuke-proof panic room! sure, your stuck in the past you went to, but you get to bring gold and aim for a pleasant decade. and its a LOT better than staying in a timeline where everyone dies. as a plus, you also bring news of what horrors the future could hold, so that it can be avoided.

also: waste disposal. this sounds like the easiest unethical way to dispose of nuclear waste. just drop it somewhere unpopulated... like a nuclear test sight on the day of the test. or far enough back in time that it will decay before it can matter. (SURPRISE! shouts the box, a moment before the asteroid kills the dinosaurs)

ultimately, this time machine is a way to effectively destroy matter/energy. start testing deep time, to see if there is a more distant point in time that can bypass the restriction (think billions of years).

*** I can just go back a few years in time to before the first time machine showed up, and I'd pack the machine full of economic datasets and cutting edge research material.

I have some contacts in the electricity distribution industry, and recharging the machine takes less energy than a typical household uses in a year, so it should be pretty easy to just use on repeat and make us super rich.

One application would be item duplication by sending the machine a short distance into the past.

Here's the idea:

Timeline A: You send Machine A 8 hours into the past with a bar of gold and a note at 3pm.

Timeline B: Machine A appears at 8:00. You send Machine B back 7 hours and 50 minutes.

Timeline C: Machine A appears at 8:00. Machine B appears at 8:10. You send Machine C 7 hours, 40 minutes back in time.

Timeline D: A appears at 8:00, B appears at 8:10, C appears at 8:20. Send Machine D back 7 hours, 30 minutes.

...

If the process stops at Z, then timeline Z has 26 time machines and 26 bars of gold.

The average timeline has 12.5 of each. Sure there's that one timeline that just loses the machine, but they have some valuable data, so they'll be fine. There are ways to give the final timeline arbitrarily large weight, but I don't want to get into that deep time cosmic horror stuff, so any iteration procedures we design will have finite cutoffs.

--------------

I could also duplicate myself by hopping in the initial Machine A. That way I wouldn't need to be held accountable for the lost gold. But if I do decide to duplicate myself, there's going to be at most 3 copies per universe. I've seen children's television; I know how clones can get out of hand.

In the process I described above, each successive jump is timed to 'split off' from a point /after/ the previous machine appeared, thus duplicating it across the set of timelines. So at the end, there are 25 separate timelines in which the machine from Timeline A spontaneously appears at 8:00. (and 24 with machine B, 23 with C, etc.)

However, they fail because it actively avoids timelines it (or its passengers!) exists in.

Ok, week twelve of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is electrum. As always we're interested in what a electrum twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, electrum allows you to see a tiny bit into your own future. As soon as you start burning electrum you see translucent image, called an atium shadow (atium is a different metal, don't worry about it) that is an exact duplicate of your body, except that the image moves ahead of your body. If you grab a cup, the image of your hand will reach the cup first and then your actual hand will follow behind it.

As a general rule in the cosmere, any method to retrieve information from the future does not take into account other information that will be retrieved from the future. That means that the initial shadow you see will be based on how you would act without having seen the shadow, but as soon as the image of the shadow reaches your brain that information exists in the present and your powers become able to use it. If this information would change what you're doing (say, you react in surprise instead of picking up the cup) a second atium shadow appears representing this new prediction.

Then of course this second prediction becomes part of the present and a third shadow pops up representing how you will act with the additional knowledge that the second shadow provides and so on and so on. You do not literally see infinite shadows because the magic has some concept of how similar shadows are to each other and if a new shadow would be too similar to an existing shadow it simply doesn't appear.

All of this happens immediately as the first image appears in the image processing part of your brain (before you've even had a chance to consciously become aware of the information) so for you the shadows all appear to spring into existence at the same time.

The allomancer can control how far ahead of the present the shadows move, but only up to an upper limit that depends on the allomancers power. Realistically you can't push them further than at most 2 or 3 seconds (and that is at the very upper limit of how powerful an allomancer can be).

The primary way electrum is used in the books is to throw of other people with precognition. The shadows that you see are the same shadows that others see if they use precognitive magic to predict your actions, so if you consistently act differently from what the shadows show you become effectively impossible to predict by others.

Another use case that is not much explored in the books (but confirmed to work by word of the author) is to use electrum to enhance your reaction time by immediately copying your shadows actions as soon as you see them happen. This takes a significant amount of practice and it doesn't work as well if your shadow leaves your field of vision (by, say, dodging backwards), but speeding up your reaction time by a full second or more is very significant.

*Precognition and Duralumin/Nicrosil*

Just to quickly adress this (major spoilers for Mistborn Era 1): There is a certain phenomena with atium shadows that if you push them far enough into the future the whole system breaks down and you get to see the future in the same way the gods themselves do, looking forward years or centuries instead of seconds. This only happened once under extremely unusual circumstances (the person in question was tied for second most powerful mistborn of all time and also had very strong ties with the person who just became the god powering allomancy and he still needed to burn a not-insignificant percentage of all remaining atium in the world alongside duralumin to get there) so I'm going to say that this is not something that can be replicated under normal circumstances. Nicrosil/duralumin enhanced electrum just lets you see a couple seconds further into the future at the cost of only being able to use your powers in short bursts.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, electrum stores determination. While storing determination, the allomancer becomes lethargic, unable to fight akrasia or motivate themselves to do much of anything.

When tapping the resulting metalmind the feruchemist gains superhuman persistence, becoming able to devote themselves fully to boring, unpleasant or even painful tasks if they think those tasks help them achieve their long term goals.

At the extreme high end, tapping determination even allows a person to endure torture or do things like deliberately hold their breath until they pass out.

*** Feruchemy: Stock and sleep: store all your determination prior to sleeping to stock up. This also might reduce your stress prior to sleeping? Risky if you might be attacked in the night or have a natural disasters happen.

10 minute abs: tap stores for short amounts of very high intensity workouts. Olympic athletes can never give 100%, but you can at will. (Maybe. Depending on willpower vs adrenaline etc.) There's solid research for "5 minute workouts", five minutes of hard intensity along with with 25 minutes of warm up and cool down, which would be perfect for this.

Is there a point where you can store so much that you can't muster the will to tap? If not you can store your determination when waiting for something into the "too lazy to leave" zone then tap when it's time.

Side note: holding your breath until you pass out is doable by a lot of college level swimmers and I assume free divers without too much mental stress. It has a lot more to do with what you get used to than sheer willpower, you get used to ignoring the burning and tightening sensations from training so taking it further is more of a fear/practicality problem than willpower.

*** Speculation notes: The underlying mechanics of how you end up with multiple atium shadows is speculation, the observed behaviour is canon and I think my interpretation is reasonable though. We've never seen feruchemic electrum used on page and there are very few author comments on it, so that bit is extrapolation from an in universe source that is known to be unreliable.

** I guess it's future-sight day in the Munchkinry thread, because I have a very /bizarre/ power to share as well.

Here's how the power works:

- When you activate the power, you experience a simulation of the immediate future.

- You can see the predicted paths of everything around you, moving in slow motion. Your own body is included in the simulation, and it moves as if it would have if you hadn't activated your power.

- You float around ghost-like within the simulation, moving your viewpoint wherever you like. (Top speed 10mph relative to your body.)

You then have two options:

- The first is to accept the predicted outcome. After ten seconds are predicted, the sim times out, and events happen exactly as foreseen. (Including your own predicted actions.)

- Alternatively, you can activate your secondary power, which imposes the state of the simulation onto the real world (within a kilometer), except that:\\
  a.) Memories aren't copied, and\\
  b.) Your body and anything on your person are teleported into the position of your observation viewpoint in the sim, rather than moving to their predicted positions.

- In either case, you can't activate your power until ten real-time seconds have passed since the previous activation.

--------------

Here's an example.

Let's say a mugger threatens you with a knife. You decide to try disarming them, and activate your power. You float outside of your body and watch yourself fail and get stabbed in slow motion. You don't like that outcome, so you float your perspective into a nearby building, and activate your secondary power.

You are now safe and sound inside the building. From the mugger's perspective, you just teleported away while they shifted position slightly. Everyone else within a kilometer has the experience of a few seconds of memory loss.

--------------

So:

How do you leverage this power for fun and profit?

(And for reverse munchkinry, say that you witness a criminal mastermind using this power in the act of committing attempted murder. You manage to escape, but the villain is now hunting you down. How do you defeat them or evade capture?)

*** This is basically just the power of teleportation with cooldown, with the additional benefits of precognition and omniscience (of the surroundings, for 10s). This could be used to easily rob goods of high value and sell them on a black market. It could also be used to easily assassinate targets without trace.

​

If a criminal had this power, the only solution would be to trap them in a 1 km radius zone so that they can't teleport out of the area. One solution might be to trap them underground (with no access shafts or anything similar), say by luring them with something they want (me?). Of course, I would want to be well-shielded if I was a target, to guard against surprise attacks. A full-body bulletproof armor should suffice. Every inch of the underground bunker needs to also be covered with turrets which can detect someone and shoot them on sight.

**** Yeah, without the memory loss, it would just appear to observers like teleportation which also erases your recent wounds. The show I based this on plays up the loss of memory as 'erasing time', but honestly it just seems like the biggest drawback of the power, because it broadcasts to everyone nearby that something supernatural is afoot.

Like suppose there was no memory loss. Then you can teleport into the fed's vault, shove a bar of gold down your pants, wait ten seconds, teleport out, and go melt down your haul.

But since everyone nearby had a mysterious bout of memory loss, they'll connect any future uses of your power to the gold thief and start tracking you down.

--------------

Luring the villain into a wide area death-trap is a good idea, albeit expensive to set up. The best I could come up with was somehow discretely planting a deadly device on the villain's person, then activating it right after they warp. But planting the device and surviving long enough to activate it is a difficult prospect.

In the show they do this, but instead of a bomb or something that would finish the fight, it's a magical turtle which sucks the villain into a pocket dimension. It buys them some time, but the villain is able to escape and come back within seconds.

*** You can get 44.7 meters away using the viewpoint to run, and you can travel through objects and fly. The intangibility and flying is huge in urban environments or anywhere with lots of cover.

Suicide sims: simulations don't need to survive, they can attack suicidally with explosives or just recklessness since the original will be appearing elsewhere. As long as it doesn't make where the original appears hazardous it's fine.

Infinite ammo: Your simulation can use limited resources for effect while you carry the real ones on for later. Expect very expensive and exotic weapons.

Memory theft: use your ability whenever possible so everyone around you only has 1/2 the time to figure out what's going on. Allies can further take advantage of the disorientation if prepared.

Secret A/B assasin: try to kill someone using A while in a sim, hide for 10s, have a sim try B... You don't even need to see it since the next sim can just come back if there last worked. The victim just gets damaged every 10s with no memory of the attacks.

Powers easy, stealing wealth is easy.

Countering: You need to be able to survive a 10s attack by this person, recognize the signs, then find and neutralize them during the downtimes while getting attacked by simulations every 10s without your knowledge. Without magic tracking or speed this seems impossible in cities unless you can cover the 45m teleport zone around them while surviving sim attacks.

An attack from outside a km works, but the mastermind should plan to avoid this. So they can't be bad enough that bombing 1045 meters all at once is worth killing them.

** How to munchkin Night Eye's quirk from My Hero Academia.

[[https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Foresight][Foresight]] (予知, Yochi?): Sir Nighteye's Quirk activates by first touching a target and then making eye contact with them. Once these conditions have been met, Sir Nighteye gains the ability to see the entirety of the target's future, second by second, for one whole hour. Sir Nighteye sees the future like frames of a film, and can only see the target from a third-person perspective and sometimes their surroundings. Sir Nighteye can only activate his Quirk once per 24 hours and has been shown that the future he sees is 100% accurate. However recent events seem to suggest that quirks that alter time in some way can affect the accuracy of his quirk, possibly rendering the predicted outcomes moot, and/or void.

EDIT: more info

His sees the future in which he sees the future. When he fought deku (the main character) he used his quirk and told Deku he would be on the ground at the end of the fight. He then used his quirk to dodge evey attack and at the end of the fight Deku was on the ground. It's the type of precognition where what you see is what will come to pass regardless of what you do.

What ways could this be used and abused in a rational MHA setting?

What are some uses for it that work within the standard MHA world?

*** The most obvious exploit to me is as simple as using it to win the lottery. I just looked it up and buying lottery tickets cuts off by 15 minutes or less before the lottery drawing in some states so you can look into someone's future who you've told to watch the lottery. You said you can see the person but only sometimes their surroundings, so just have the person communicate the lottery numbers back to you as they see them on the television.

If not the lottery, it seems like there are a lot of ways to make money off of it. Play a poker game or some other such game of chance and see how the next hour is going to play out and have a massive advantage. You just need to have a friend as a bystander who can communicate exactly what's happening in the game in a way you can utilize effectively. Doing that once a day would quickly bring large profits.

Although, I just looked it up and it seems that 20% of people in this world don't have quirks. This seems like a power that you would benefit from keeping a secret, so how hard would it be to just let people believe you are quirkless? You just need to win the lottery once and then I'm sure you could find other ways to make money that are less flashy and benefit from minor uses of the power.

*** Immediate exploits using the power before he goes into battle to see whether he'll lose or not. If he can't make eye contact with the enemy he could just do it with an ally for the same purpose.

It could be used for significant advantages in any negotiations, including business.

It could be used to learn the passwords/sensitive information of important people by using it just before they go to work.

It could be used to rat out suspected spies by telling them a piece of information that sounds really important, using the power, and if they don't pass the information on just say that it was a joke.

In general though, the possibility of doing something, seeing how people react to that, and then backtrack seems pretty powerful.

I guess that since you're getting a third person view you could walk all the way around a poker table and use the information to win money by knowing a certain number of future hands.

So yes, probably a youtube channel. I think the most efficient form is to run a talkshow where you invite experts on to help explain their work to a beginner audience. If you can give your expert any insights during the show, that sets the cap, then the broadcast gets you to the cap. You should be able to easily find insights to share once you've built up a few fields, especially if you learn widely cross-applicable skills like statistics or critical theory.

For bootstrapping the skill, being a TA for intro classes in a wide variety of fields is an easily obtainable way to do that in miniature.

*** YouTube channel is focused and potentially effective, but not the best method I think, particularly early as you'll need popularity. The focus of them normally will also make it harder to diversify and targeting the people who can learn the most is hard as they're the least likely to be looking. So start by playing the long game. Your first goal will be finding some people fairly skilled but enough that you can still teach them something in their own fields, this is likely best done through obscure information in their field. Teach a brilliant programmer some quirks in a programming language, a mathematician some maths trick or obscure theory, a teacher some mostly unused model of teaching, whatever. The primary point is you'll want to be gathering some higher cap in a huge range of fields, no need to aim for the tops, but aim for at least degree level probably.

Simultaneously, you start working towards becoming an actual qualified teacher. Primary schooling is where you want to target, easily teach large amounts of information on a huge breadth of subjects as you're teaching people who are essentially forced to try learning and don't know much for the cynical view. You're also likely to get really good at it so the kids should be well off. This will ensure you can easily hit caps in pretty much everything. Kids have relatively meteoric rises in skills due to low baselines so the amount of learning delivered is easy, so the prior cap gathering is mostly to help get started cause their caps will also be tiny. However you can just maintain it, make money on the side using your newfound skills, keep getting progress in practically every field because kids are building up everything. Then you hit the rapid gains, the longer game, or you've started making connections at some point probably because you're highly skilled in dozens of fields.

You've now taught hundreds or thousands of children as a master in many fields, and they've spread into the world and started learning which will start pushing your caps back up. It's a slow positive feedback loop but it is one. Plus even if it's more focused you hopefully get to feel good about yourself, using your skills to help inspire and teach new generations to push science, the arts, sport, and anything they set their mind on by giving them a foundation that nobody else in the world could. Better the world, and the more they better it the better you get. Are you likely to wind up really shaking things up? Well, maybe. Your free time around it will be well used hopefully, and you are an expert.

Don't forget the self focused skills too while doing all this, like the skill of self motivation is the single most valuable skill you can possibly acquire. Lots of somewhat inwards focused skills that wind up invaluable.

Is it the best approach? Maybe not. It seems an easy way to keep maxed however, in a way that can hopefully leave you feeling good about yourself, while offering great long and short term potential.

That way, they should hopefully alternate between strongly negative emotions of concern for their partner when the predator is distant and the relief of knowing they're the ones being targeted when it's close, causing it to bounce back and forth between them without reaching either.

*** Well Buddhist monks that are practiced in mindfulness meditation should be able to fight it while keeping it blind. Non judgemental observation is a core principle to them, and even pain has a hard time causing them emotional change.

More generally if there's ever a chance to fight back against the predator it would be blinded if they can empathize hope over anger/vengeance.

Drugs: Use mind altering drugs to blind it. Depending on the sensitivity this might not be too bad. I know people who happily go on runs while drunk or high so they could probably get away. Anti-anxiety IV drugs might be a good fit?

Death Acceptance: If you believe death isn't a bad thing you can take away the emotions brought on by the predator itself, meaning it can't follow you if it's the only problem. (Might not work if you realize there's going to be a lot of pain leading up to death) Even better you could start a predator worshipping cult, death isn't good but death specifically by the predator is an honor etc.

The Rite Of The Pentacle. Five people chain their souls together, magically. As long as at least one of them is still living, this permits accelerated healing (if only one member is hurt, that person heals at five times normal speed, if they all are, it helps not at all, except healing is complete - you can grow back limbs, for example), and the resurrection of the body, as long as the surviving members have physical possession of at least most of the corpse (raising someone from a corpse missing a leg means that person spends months crippled)

This rite is common knowledge, and while expensive, not any /more/ expensive than kitting people out in proper plate - The guards of a prosperous city would certainly be pentacle-bonded.

Hilarious Side Effects:

The bound loose all sexual interest in people not in their pentacle. This is /also/ common knowledge so any all male pentacle is assumed to be a Theban Band , and the most common setup (2 women - Chosen from the most heroically stature farm girls the recruiters could track down, and 3 men) still causes lots of purile speculation. Not usually to their faces, mind. 4-1 setups, in either direction cause lots, and lots of snickering.

Killing five of them is not something any plausible gang of thugs is going to pull off.) but as a general insurance policy this is /not/ done, because if you are up against a threat which presents a plausible TPK risk - in a war, a major monster hunt, then you would almost certainly be unable to recover the bodies of a partial group that got wiped out anyway, so you send the entire team for maximum chance of victory.

Why pack a massive store of food when you can just have your guards eat each other and heal back the meat. Thanks to the Pentacle healing you don't even have to worry about the I'llness cannibalism normally causes.

Dose the Pentacle heal damage you received before you under took the rite? What about inborn disabilitys, both mental and physical?

I think that the rite would be quite good as a binding marriage vow. It removes the desire to cheat as long as you make sure to geld the other three members of the Pentacle.

A little hack I see is over time chopping bits of a Pentacle member and assembling a second body with those bits. Then if that Pentacle member ever gets completely destroyed they can still be rased back to life useing the second corpse you created earlier.

The closest we have to that is organized religion, which gets to exploit a ton of cognitive biases. Authority bias, availability cascade, the bandwagon effect, confirmation bias, courtesy bias, the illusion of control, the illusory truth effect, etc. Nonbelievers don't tend to argue to avoid upsetting the bandwagon, and tend to hint that their views are closer if not identical to the believers than they really are to maintain courtesy. Organized religions use various types of holy men as authority figures, and the constant repetition of information as if it is fact makes it seem like it really is a fact. It gives you a sense of greater control over your life than you really have, and it offers simple and easy-to-understand explanations for life that seem like they must be true.

Even with all that, you still have people being raised in religious families, being sent to religious schools, going to church every week, and still somehow ending up as nonbelievers. Religion may be pretty powerful stuff, but there's just no reliable way to make people believe things.

As an example: Itachi Uchiha, a character from the Naruto manga/anime possesses the supernatural chakra-fueled power of the Sharingan (which is a sort of special Eye mutations that give their clan exceptional superocular prowess and other types of supernatural chakra-based powers).

Itachi also has the Mangekyo Sharingan, which is an even more bullshit powerup. One of the techniques it allows the user to perform is the [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukuyomi][Tsukuyomi]].

Some particularly noteworthy feats of that power are excerpted from the wiki:

"... After making eye contact with a target, Itachi Uchiha traps them in an illusion of his design. Through his unprecedented ability to alter targets' perception of time, he uses Tsukuyomi to subject victims to days' worth of torture in a matter of seconds; examples include continual stabbing or reliving traumatic events over and over..."

"... Itachi uses Tsukuyomi on Izumi Uchiha, causing her to live through decades of a happy life in the span of a few moments..."

(Start reading from the second scene cut.)

I don't know if the technique really is that powerful, whether it can be replicated in IRL, and whether there are any methods to preventing/blocking/avoiding/reversing such types of insidious 'natural' mind control/brainwashing.

***** On the topic of Tsukuyomi, you could potentially create illusionary loops modeled after reality, tweaked a bit every loop so they aren't predictable, and punish the victim every time they don't behave as desired in the simulation (or if they try to probe the illusion to check if it's reality or not). In canon, Tsukuyomi tends to lead to unconsciousness once it ends, but if it didn't, the victim might not be able to tell that the illusion ended and may comply with whatever they were tortured into (virtual reality torture is also probably leagues more effective than the traditional sort).

We could just imagine this as virtual reality brainwashing. For example, say part of the simulation is them "unplugging" from the VR interface to make them think they escaped or that seeking therapy to help them with the brainwashing is also part of the simulation. Basically any method that could be used to counter the brainwashing could be included as part of the brainwashing procedure.

*** I don't know of any empirical evidence of methods to subjugate the mind of adults. As [[/u/Norseman2]] points out we would expect the probability of seeing such a method in widespread use to be higher if it existed so the lack of such well-known methods to be weak evidence against their existence.

There's also little evidence that it's possible to completely subjugate the mind of even a child given with how many problems parents and juvenile detention facilities have with that exact problem. And given that neuroplasticity decreases over time I think you should start here before considering adults.

Various fictions have posed speculations about such a thing being possible but that doesn't mean that it actually exists.

**** Oh.

So it's basically nigh-improbable to make utterly loyal minions that obey your every whim and fantasy in IRL...

That does sound like good news!

***** I haven't done any research on the subject so I wouldn't make that bold a claim. It seems unlikely that you can completely overwrite the mind of people given that behaviour is based on genetics but you can probably heavily influence it. As shown by how gaming companies are making people addicted to games.

****** I suppose.

But as for the type of total mind control scenario I was thinking about, that type of scenario is too far-fetched and improbable for real life, right?

Then I suppose we can safely guess that it's a great thing it isn't realistic enough to matter.

Its not much but it's somewhat of a relief atleast.

** Continuing my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ehd4r18/?context=0][question from last week]], if you've got access to an Oracle who will give you one piece of binary information about the future or about reality, what is the highest value question you can ask?

If you want to discuss that overall question in this thread, feel free, but this is the aspect of it I'm most interested in.

*** Since I'm limited to that which I can later answer myself: "Which of these two research avenues should we shift more attention to?"
