I was thinking about this today and at first my thought is that it'd be impossible, since a rational Saitama would just run through the world while one-shotting every criminal he finds. It'd just be rational Flash all over again.

I got to thinking about the whole "If you give Frodo a lightsaber then Sauron needs a Death Star" scale afterwards. In this case, Saitama is the Death Star. He doesn't really need much else just because of how far above everyone else he is. So this means we'd give the villains a lightsaber right? Probably not. This would essentially just be writing fanfiction about Saitama either one-shotting people who try or Saitama meeting his match. Either way it's just the standard OPM formula.

But what if we made Saitama the villain? Of course, a rational villain Saitama would just one-shot the story, but we could have him stay irrational. After all, he's the Death Star. Rationality would just be giving him another Death Star, and since heroes aren't usually supposed to lose they should be the ones with rationality.

Here's a rough scale visualization of what I'm saying

Hero Saitama Rational Fic

Rational Saitama (2 Death Stars) > Rational Villains (1 Death Star)

Villain Saitama Rational Fic

Rational Heroes (1 Death Star) = Irrational Villain (1 Death Star)

I believe the main character of this villain AU would have to be Genos. Genos' creator, Dr. Kuseno, has shown himself easily capable of replicating biological functions in cybernetic parts, even with just combat data. I believe a rational!Genos would attempt to kill his opponents while damaging the body as little as possible. Dr. Kuseno, with the abilities he's shown, should be capable of replicating that with cybernetics to upgrade Genos, causing a recursive chain.

Genos fights villain. Villain has ability Genos does not. Genos takes body into Kuseno. Kuseno adds ability to Genos after a certain timeframe.

Most of these abilities would likely be strength related, so throughout the story Genos would need to outsmart the villain, as opposed to what he usually does (run in and die). As for how Genos would end up beating or at least removing Saitama as a threat... I'm not sure.

Perhaps Kuseno would learn about [[#s][Webcomic]] and that could be abused, but I don't think we know enough about it yet.


** The idea reminds me a lot of Metropolitan Man, where a highly resourceful, intelligent character attempts to overcome a seemingly invincible adversary. I only know the premise of One Punch Man, i.e, Saitama is bored because nothing and nobody can pose a challenge to him, but I think the idea shows promise.

I like the idea of OPM as a villain as well. If you take away the morality that made him a hero, becoming a villain is a much better way to give yourself a challenge than being a hero. If you show up, show your invincible strength by doing something horrifying, then give the entire world a year or so to come up with something to stop you, that'd be much more effective in drawing powerful foes to you than fighting whatever random villains happen to arise.

*** Your second paragraph is exactly what I was thinking of when I thought about what a villainous Saitama's motivation would be, I was just pretty tired at the time.

We know that Mysterious Beings (monsters) are appearing more often and seem to be getting stronger over time. We also know they can form organizations and cooperate to fight strong heroes. I was thinking that perhaps after a while the monsters would potentially work with the Hero Association, with the Association abusing the apparent unexplained growth in strength among monsters.

** How is Saitama not rational in the story?

In my opinion any change to Saitama from his current apathetic self would not be "stengthening" so much as just making a complete different character with non of his original essence. The series essentially explores one answer to the question of "what happens when you really reach the top", and the answer suggested in this case is effectively "Nihilism".

Although his attitude is perhaps rationalizable, his approach to it is not particularly so. There are clearly things he wants (eg. fame, money, dead mosquitoes) that he could get much more effectively by applying a smidgen of thought to his actions.

****** You seem to be missing the point.

First of all some of the actions are obviously for laughs, they don't fully represent S, but they are also insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

Second you are suggesting fighting big bad monsters is an end goal of his, which I strongly disagree with. Its obvious from all of his fights that he is not -really- expecting anything out of them. Sometimes -during- the fight he might get a little excited, but then the fight ends and he just gets disappointed, which of course just makes him less and less excited every time.

And finally, you don't seem to really be giving a thought to his situation, and to nihilism. Try to really understand it before you claim if he is doing or not doing it. Because what you seem to be thinking about nihilism is closer to straw nihilism than to actual nihilism. All I could say to try and convey this to suggest you imagine you were playing a game where you had infinite life, infinite strength, infinite speed etc. would you actually be trying to optimize your way to finishing it?

Having said all of this, I kind of stopped reading the manga around the point the anime stopped, and even that last fight was kind of [[#s][stretching some of the points]]. which I think is mostly because most people don't see Saitama this way and are using it as wish fulfillment to imagining how they would love to be that guy that just comes to that guy who thought he was a big deal and "putting him in his place". And accordingly I think the manga did shift more and more to playing it straight.

Disagree again; Saitama's struggle with recognition is a major theme of the anime and some of his later actions are definitely pertinent to his life. They might be insignificant in the I-just-saved-the-world-again scheme of things, but the fact he's able to do that without being rational about it is more plot armor than anything. [[#s][If Boros]]

--------------

That Saitama goes out of his way to find strong opponents is the main plot point of the most recent manga chapter. Trust me on this.

With regards to your comments on nihilism; /yes/ I would optimize it. I wouldn't optimize everything, for sure; no point optimizing for easy battles. But I'd definitely use my power to keep my companions safe, or to prevent myself getting stressed about living comfortably. I'll admit that my understanding of nihilism isn't backed up by much study, though, so I'll take the comment about my views being straw men in stride.

Your final paragraph suggests you missed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3xlalo/spoilers_one_punch_man_episode_12_final_discussion/cy5mz4c][certain important aspects of that last fight]].

#+end_quote

Basically all of the events which show him "seeking recognition" are played for laughs. And all of the rest of the series is showing him not actually trying to get recognition. He specifically says he isn't actually trying to get recognition in one part and has shown in plenty of cases not to really be bothered with it. Moreover he gave up on recognition in more than one case, and was willing to say other people did things when they were actually done by him.

I think assuming he did all of those things because he is practically retarded is being EXTEREMELY uncharitable in interpreting his actions. Don't assume that just because he is not doing what you would do in his situation it means he is stupid.

I should have probably been more specific in saying i was talking about a computer game. there are no other things that you actually care about, you just get a character which is so completely overpowered that there is no challenge. now imagine all games are like that. And no, suggesting you invent a new game is not an answer, its just a way to avoid it. but if you are not interested in understanding nihilism the thought experiment is pointless. if you are interested in "understanding" it just so you can "prove" it is wrong you will still probably find it very hard to comprehend it. and if you do want to understand it I am sure there are better texts on the subject than I could write, so I would suggest starting there.

#+begin_quote
  Your final paragraph suggests you missed certain important aspects of that last fight.
#+end_quote

you misunderstand, it is not that I was suggesting Saitama was weak, I meant that it was stretching a point by the author. Similarly to how having Saitama fight for like 20 chapters and look like he is having a hard time would still be stretching the point of the series, even if it was later explained that "he was actually not trying" would still be a problem. The dream was kind of an exception in the sense that I think it was meant to convey the emptiness and I could forgive it because it was short.

Though that is obviously opinion based, but i think the entire series until that point was very intentional in its anticlimactic nature.

#+end_quote

I was not giving nihilistic arguments because the nihilsm I mentioned is an interpretation to Saitama's behavior. which, outside of trying to explain in abstract, is only really relevant when talking about specific examples.

But the problem is that if we start talking about an example, and you say "i think saitama was being a gag character there\irrational" and I respond by "thats one interpretation, but I think that is a reasonable way a nihilitst may behave" then you would either need to just accept the fact that there is an interpratation of the events which makes sense if saitama is being nihilistic because I said so, or we will basically need to start discussing nihilism, what it means and how it can come into play. which is obviously a discussion outside of the scope. And to be honest its not even as though I am some philosophy professor, so there's no guarantee I could properly explain it in the first place.

Which is why I suggested you tried to read on the topic from better sources.

If he's nihilist, then nihilism is irrational. He has things he wants, and we know this because he says as much as acts in accordance to it, but doesn't approach things in such a way as to satisfy those goals.

If that's not irrational you're going to have to explain to me what you think rationality is.

[[#s][spoilers]] Its like if you see a bunch of ants losing a fight against a scorpion, and you just feel like 'saving' the ants so you step over and move\kill the scorpion. and then you get up and you see you stepped on like 20 times more ants then you 'saved' from the scorpion. Had you noticed the ants beforehand you probably would have avoided stepping on them, but its not like you -actually- care about the ants, you just went to save them because you haphazardly felt like it.

Thats a big topic as mentioned so I cannot really explain why it could be rational without us starting a huge discussion about nihilism which is out of scope.

#+begin_quote
  If that's not irrational you're going to have to explain to me what you think rationality is.
#+end_quote

In this context I would probably define it as logical and effective application of the resources you have the achieve your goals\values.

The problem is that in this context nihilism is a lack of values. Which is kind of like division by zero in the context of rationality.

And then comes the difficult part which is "how could he not have values if he 'wants'\'says he wants' to do X?", and the answer to it is complicated, but basically boils down to the fact that even if he is nihilistic it doesn't mean he can't randomly 'feel like' doing something because similar to how understanding cognitive bias doesn't make your mind stop falling to it, agreeing with nihilism does not mean your mind would become empty and you stopped existing.

And this is already going into philosophical areas, where as I mentioned I would seriously suggest you read works by people who are more versed in it then me.

Why? While it is obvious he has some tendencies he doesn't particularly make any plans, this is exactly what you were criticizing about him. beyond humoristic stuff like "wanting to go to the supermarket for the special sale" type of stuff he was never actually shown too much planning if at all.

#+begin_quote
  What you've hypothesized is basically unfalsifiable
#+end_quote

True, in the sense that I could claim about anyone that they are nihilistic, and anything other than actually hearing their thoughts will not actually be a definite proof of them not being nihilistic.

But nihilism is more of a model than a theory, similar to how psychology uses stuff like ego, id and superego to explain people's behavior.

#+begin_quote
  since you've basically said that any counterevidence just "randomly" occurs
#+end_quote

I didn't say that though, if he was shown to be planning and thinking how to save the world, or thinking how to make lots of money and then fail because he acted stupidly I would never suggest he was being nihilistic, and would completely agree he was being stupid. and if he was contradicting himself I would completely agree he was being irrational.

But he isn't. And you are suggesting that the explanation to all his actions is that he is stupid, while I think it was shown that he cares about the things about as much as how much you care about ants. In an abstract, would-be-nice kind of way.

#+begin_quote
  Saitama's emotional responses are strong enough for me to dismiss this.
#+end_quote

I may have missed something but I don't remember any strong emotional responses beyond mundane stuff and comedic sequences. He is shown not to care too much about morality, but instead just doing things because he feels like doing them.

He was impressed by mumen rider's actions and was 'on his side', but in reality this could just as well be the same kind of emotional response you would have to a fictional character. Not that he thinks its any more correct than anything else.

Why does a decision being involuntary mean it's not legitimate? I'd argue /most/ people's morals are largely emotional reflexes. Look at chapter 2, which has Saitama clearly /claims/ he's nihilistic but also clearly act against that claim. Back to the "wanting to be famous" thing, I might as well source my assertions.

I've already mentioned but there is no such thing as "act un-nihilisticly". you can be nihilistic and still rescue a family from a burning building. you can be nihilistic and give money for charity about as much as you can be nihilistic and murder a kid on the street.

- If it was shown that he was actively working towards achieving something. As in actually put time into it, not haphazardly do something when he felt like it.
- If he explicitly said he believes in some absolute moral
- If he explicitly said anything which implied another contradicting philosophy
- If he was shown to be sad because of people getting hurt
- If he was shown to be happy for saving people

Only the Sith deal in absolutes, but perhaps chapter 14, page 13? Basically a statement that some paths down life are wrong. You seem to like taking the most stretched meanings of things, though, so perhaps that's not literal enough.

Perhaps instead chapter 34.5, page 21. Talking about what it means to be a hero. Though he also does that in chapter 38, page 20 ("It's not about accomplishments. You are the hero everyone looks up to.") and it didn't sound like an absolute moral there. And then later, even more ambiguously, at chapter 42, pages 9-11.

Erm, what about chapter 48, page 10. "You know, asking old people for favors isn't the proper thing to do." Clearly Saitama has some traditionalist values.

This one's hard since Saitama's generally so disinterested about monsters as a whole, and hardly considers saving someone from them a big deal any more, but I found one which doesn't involve monsters.

In fact, this chapter is quite a clear display of Saitama's moral system. Very agency based but not without valuing life and its people.

Or maybe he'd realise that his life is unfulfilling and try to join a hero team in the hope of making friends.

#+end_quote

I don't think circular is the correct way to describe it, but you are correct in saying that applied this way it could explain anything, which is the same as explaining nothing. The thing is it is actually completely reasonable for a nihilist to be a gardener or deciding to open a bakery. Being a nihilist doesn't actually mean you have to do X, its more of an outlook.

Which obviously means nihilism alone would not "explain" anything, but I never claimed it would. Nihilism fits as a model when you factor in the rest of his actions and general behavior.

I am essentially suggesting a different way to interpret his actions, you can either assume he is as dumb as a brick and is simply not doing anything to further his goals, or you can assume that he is generally working towards his goals, and what you see in the series actually is the outcome.

But to model this in a way which makes sense I think nihilism works best as the philosophical foundation.

#+begin_quote
  Also, what you're describing sounds closer to crippling depression than nihilism.

Not exactly, though the two are regularly confused, because they sound kind of similar. But in reality nihilism does not actually imply any specific emotional state.

In the case it wasn't a joke though,I did some reading to see what would be a good starting point for discussion of the meaning of rationality and I found a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/][post on LW]] which I think is relevant in the sense probably it would be more effective to avoid using "rationality" as a thing entirely for the purpose of that discussion, and use actual descriptions instead.

so I will start, I don't think a trying to get his heir to grow by eating seaweed, while not knowing the fact that sceintists disproved it is showing any wrong application of knowledge or logic in that particular context, but instead just showing ignorance of better available knowledge.

On a bigger scale depending on his circumstances and values it is possible he is displaying some bad practices for thinking in the sense that they could possibly be done differently to better achieve his goals, but that would be extremely dependent on those goals, values, availability of information, and costs of acquiring said information.

I think it is wrong use that specific context as a proof for the large scale because it doesn't give any of the needed values, goals costs etc. mentioned in the prev paragraph.

If I were to use a metaphor for this it would be like saying that someone doesn't know math, and as a proof showing him calculating X+Y and coming with a wrong answer, because he got the values of X and Y from someone else and those values were wrong. While there possibly were other ways the person could have found the values of X and Y, and maybe the reason he didn't do so is indeed because his abilities in math are not too good, the actual example at best suggests that as a possibility, it is not any kind of proof.

** That'd be interesting. I admit I was toying with the idea of a Rational OPM fic before and thought, is Saitama immune to mind control? I think that could be one way to turn him into a threat that has to be neutralized before he destroys the entire world and would introduce the moral complications of stopping him without killing him.

Heck you could write it with Genos as protagonist trying to find a way to neutralize his master without killing him and competing against the other heroes that want to stop him at any cost. There's a point where the cost of killing him may be lower than the benefit of not doing so and that can lead to some great gray morality drama.

Then there's the fact that a villain with Saitama as thrall must be extremely smart and would be very dangerous. If he can take over Saitama, he could as well take over other heroes. Maybe it works on all but cyborns and espers though that may be too much for Genos and Tatsumaki to face.

That could also explore the morality of the Hero Association and how unregulated they seem to take in any crack like Puri Puri Prisoner (he's a guy that admits and relishes on the idea of raping other males) or unstable people like Tatsumaki/Metal Knight that could go rogue just based on power level. What level of control do they really have over the heroes and if one of them decides to go villain, do they really got any way to stop them?

In the OPM universe it's quite possible to kill everybody on the planet - you just have to do it before Saitama notices. Saitama wins because the antagonists are Big Bads who enjoy fighting, and/or lack imagination.

You could plant an explosive device on Genos, rig it to explode if you die, and tell Saitama about it. If you're an alien you can meteor-bomb Earth from afar. If you're a psychopath bent on killing everybody you can detonate dirty bombs all over.

The question of how to be rational with arbitrary strength is more along the lines of Rational Superman, I think. It'd be a story of how Saitama tries to use his power to enact lasting social change, or something - that doesn't sound like a sustainable longform plot, although I might be surprised.

Villains who can act on a large /scale/, rather than having great personal power in melee, could plausibly act as a threat to Saitama - he has difficulty getting to fights in time. Not to spoil anything, but the final battle involved far more time taken up with Saitama's attempts to track the villain down than with battling him.
