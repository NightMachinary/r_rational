** One of the things that's always bugged me about this show is how it contrives reasons to push the "immortality is inherently bad and inhuman" aesop. "oh no you'd better not try to be immortal or you'll turn into a scorpion monster and eat people for some goddamn reason"

It's hypocritical as fuck coming from the Doctor, too. He's always the one getting all upset at the slightest hint that humans might have found a way to not die. In this episode he set out to put a stop to it /even before he knew about the scorpion monster part./ Buddy, if being mortal is so great, maybe you should precommit to killing yourself in 80 years? No? Why not?

**** Pretty much, yet the Doctor always puts on this show of envying our mortality. "Oh, that's what makes you human, that's what makes you special, I hate myself and my eternal existence is a curse etc etc etc" But his words are so obviously hollow, since he has the option of dying at any time and chooses not to take it.

***** The interesting thing about this is that the 10th doctor *is* blindly attached to his own life. Unlike all the other doctors he's terrified that regeneration means real death and his last words are 'I don't want to go'. The War, 9th and 11th Doctors were serene or cheerful at the very end (as were most of the classic Doctors), while 10 was bitter and angry. He agonises to Wilf about how the next doctor won't really be him in End of Time. He's vain (according to his own words as 11), and thinks his personality is unique. He cheated regeneration, using up a remaining life to prolong his own in the S4 finale.

*Reading between the lines, the Doctor is probably as afraid of death as Lazarus and I can't help but think this scene is him trying to cover up his own cognitive dissonance.*

****** 10th was my favorite doctor for many reasons, and his flaws were one of them.

Also the actor is amazing. That scene you mentioned with Wilfred, when the 10th Doctor was sitting across from him in the diner, and explaining what being "immortal" is like for Time Lords:

#+begin_quote
  I can still die. If I'm killed before regeneration, then I'm dead. Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.

The look on his face, his tone of voice... David Tennant is such an amazing actor that he made me look at someone in his mid 30s sitting side by side someone in his 60s, and believe that the younger man was hundreds of years older.

Mind, it is canon that, "You spent a billion years evolving into downloads" /at some point/.

I could see the Doctor going full Culture and saying we need to achieve some level of enlightenment or sanity before being able to handle immortality.

Like it's not like most people have a deep seated prejudicial hatred of rationalists. Most people probably don't even know what a rationalist is.

Suppose there are a series of tropes. Some are rational, some are not. The rational ones are accepted by everyone. The irrational ones are accepted by non-rationalists, who non-critically accept tropes.

Since stories are based on conflict, when there are irrational tropes, they are assigned to the protagonist and the antagonist is assigned the contrary /rational/ point of view. We pay more attention to this because no one likes their ideas being associated with the bad guys.

When the trope is rational, it still gets assigned to the protagonist, and that's when we get irrational antagonists. People here are less bothered by irrational antagonists because, after all, they're the bad guys who lose in the end.

**** That seems like a lazy way to design an antagonist and a protagonist and make them fight. Wouldn't making them on more equal footing in their own kind of strength make more sense? A story about two supergeniuses or two superpowered warriors fighting each other is more entertaining than a story about a superpowered warrior fighting a supergenius with the help of his smart friend. Like for instance in the sonic the hedgehog franchise, it seems overwhelmingly obvious that either metal sonic should have been the main antagonist, or tails the fox should have been the main protagonist. Tails vs Robotnik and Sonic vs Metal Sonic would make for much more interesting stories then Sonic vs Robotnik with Metal Sonic as a minor antagonist and Tails as a sidekick. And yet no one ever notices this. /EVER/.

So why would the writers choose Sonic vs Robotnik over Sonic vs Metal Sonic or Tails vs Robotnik? Clearly this is some sort of pattern, the choice of conflict is too consistent across too many stories for it to be mere coincidence. I just don't know why they always get written like that. It shouldn't be any easier to think of Sonic vs Robotnik than Sonic vs Metal Sonic or Tails vs Robotnik. I'm pretty sure that if a random person who wasn't absorbing irrational warrior hero vs evil science guy stories all their life, who knew nothing about Sonic the Hedgehog at all was told that Robotnik was the main antagonist then they learned about all the other characters, they would think that Tails was the Protagaonist. Likewise with Sonic if they were told that Metal Sonic was the main antagonist.

Do writers think Sonic vs Robotnik will appeal more to readers for some reason? If so what is that reason, and if not why do writers keep choosing to make less interesting conflicts?

I did! Sonic Adventure DX claims that Eggman and Tails both have an IQ of 300. I didn't know about rationality yet at the time, but I definitely remember thinking that Sonic should be a side character and the main story should be about a conflict between Eggman and Tails if they're really that smart.

I think it's just in human nature to reject science, as frustrating as that is. It's not intuitively obviously, it takes too much time, effort and math to learn, it doesn't play nice with other belief systems, people see the knowledge as useless, they think we're "messing with nature" and that man made things are automatically bad, they see scientific knowledge as flaky because it can be updated at any time, they don't like the byproducts of scientific inquiry like nuclear bombs or GMO Foods, and clearly scientists are heartless, arrogant, terrible people that destroy the mystery and fun of the world by measuring and cataloging it. Or some think they're in the pocket of the government, developing things to harm the general population or to push the agenda of the day.

I think this general distrust of science is why you see so many stories with an anti-rational or anti-science message. They want their heroes to be humble and good, not arrogant like scientists that have the /nerve/ to say things like "you shouldn't believe in things without evidence", and then "there's no evidence for souls, the afterlife, or gods". Also people get really attached to ideas like "death must be good for something, since we can't avoid it. Anyone who says otherwise has to be wrong, it would be too terrifying if death was truly bad and we were powerless to stop it".

I agree, but sonic isn't popular as a story. It's popular as a video game. The story line is a thin pretext for the game. Whenever they try to make a series out of sonic, it doesn't last very long. The writers probably aren't very concerned with this, and are more concerned with just finishing the job and not doing something unexpected. Unexpected things that work get you a pat on the back. Ones that don't work can get you fired. It's rarely worth the risk.

***** I also noticed that, but I think I have an answer. It's motivation of beligerent parties that makes their conflict interesting. Eggman tries to take over the world, basically, for lulz and because he can. Sonic fights bad guys, similarily, for lulz and because he can. Tails, however, fights bad guys because he admires Sonic and wants to help his friends. He is actually more of a hero material even discounting his intelligence, but he just doesn't fit the story as a protagonist.

It's also frustratingly common in anime titles. It's like if they need to introduce a character that's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute][supposed]] to be clever they just look at the “How to produce a generic anime” flowchart and see that the next step should be making that character spew some random “philosophical” (and\or cynical) sounding nonsense.

1) In general, a rational character would be making at least some decisions that would not go well (or would be perceived as evil) with the general audience, because the audience itself isn't rational (or is even irrational --- which is often the case with Doctor Who, for example). And since the audience identifies itself as “the goodies”, the rat!char automatically slides into being the baddie.

**** So it's not an explicit prejudice against rationalists, the prejudice is implied by their not wanting to see themselves as the bad guys? That sounds like kind of a stretch. Surely the general audience understands the concept of a relatable or sympathetic villain, and knows that sometimes people in the ingroup can do bad things too. The idea that "someone who is like me but who isn't me can make these sorts of mistakes and end up as the bad guy of someone else's story" should be common knowledge among everyone, or at least all adults.

Then I usually wonder if that's a sign we're living in a dangerously reactionary, irrationalist culture and there's some horrific tragedy coming in which the sheer chaos of uncontrolled, undisciplined irrationality will vomit itself out as mass death.
