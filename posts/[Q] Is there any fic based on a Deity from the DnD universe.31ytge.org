I just finished reading Two Year Emperor and I found the second part incredibly unsatisfying. There was so much optimizational potential for a rational!god in that world for getting more worshipers, power etc that never got explored. Is there a rational fic out there that does this? So far my closest find was a fanfic for Taylor Hebert from worm as a Lolth altpower.


** I'm sorry to hear you didn't like it. It was intended as a different kind of story, so I understand why you wouldn't enjoy it if you went in expecting more of the same. It also had some flaws even within that new genre, because I tried out some new (to me) writing techniques, not all of which worked.

I don't know any D&D stories that fit what you're asking for, but the FFN D&D archive is here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/game/Dungeons-and-Dragons/]]

You might be able to find something with the "by character" filters, or else you'll just need to scroll and read summaries. I would check the filters myself, but I'm on my phone.

*** The author himself! I actually loved the story as a whole, it was just jarring to read part 2 with such a different tone. It seemed like Suze suddenly went from a smart, deliberate character to someone stumbling around with an idiot ball stuck in their hands. That change from part 1 where Jake was a rational, albeit flawed character was what left me scratching my head and feeling dissatisfied.

It was also my first DnD story, so I found the mechanics of the world very fun to read/imagine, and the whole deity system was quite unique. It would have been fun to read someone try break it.

  to read part 2 with such a different tone.

In fairness, there was an extensive A/N at the start of the second book (Chapter 72) that said "this is not going to be anything like the first one."

The entire point of book two was that Suze was crazy the entire time she was a goddess. The times when she pushed her godhood aside were the times that she behaved rationally. I really wasn't subtle about that, but perhaps it still wasn't as obvious as I intended it to be.

***** Oh no you were perfectly obvious! I just found that an unsatisfying read. Maybe most of it was because I never got to see Suze grow/battle past those flaws, instead the story just ended on a deus ex machina where she's left mortal but happy and the actual smart character (Lolth) got screwed.

** If you've read Homestuck, then [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/420086/chapters/700061][The Land of Dragons and Dungeons]] is very well written, and has a lot of fun with the divinity systems. It does not use TYE's "gods get power from worshipers" mechanic, but does quite a lot of fun with the D&D mechanics regardless.

Cheesy name, but it has good writing quality, large archive, and it's updating regularly.

Edit: Teaser (tiny-spoiler): the patron-god of Adventurers has temples built in the middle of nowhere. His priests amass wealth and sequester it in secret passages beneath the temple, behind deadly traps of all sorts. They do this constantly until the local sect dies out (partially due to on-the-job fatalities), and the temple falls into obscurity. This is, in fact, deliberate.

*** Ohhh that was a 2YE specific mechanic? i just assumed it was the canon explanation behind gods in DnD. Thanks for the recommendation!

**** I'm not positive whether it's a 2YE mechanic or not. I've played D&D, but only have a casual understanding of the lore - I wouldn't be surprised if it's a D&D mechanic, but I hadn't run across it before.

If you're looking for a videogame, there are several that use that mechanic. I'm pretty sure both Age of Mythology and "Black and White" both do. (Oh man, remember when Black and White was this super-hyped thing? I never heard of it afterwards.) Reus is an indie game that superficially does that too, but it wasn't my thing personally.

***** Upon doing some more googling:

I still can't find any official ways to gain divine ranks in 3.0/3.5. To quote [[http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?318362-Who-can-grant-Divine-Ranks-How-are-they-attained][an enlightening ENWorld discussion]]:

  #+begin_quote
    Can a God make someone else into a God? That seems a bit over the top. But how do things even get Divine Ranks? Who give the okay? The Supreme Being?
  #+end_quote

  Strictly speaking, I don't believe there are any (first-party) rules for this in 3.0/3.5 D&D. It's however you want it to work in your campaign.
#+end_quote

and,

#+begin_quote
  The Deities and Demigods book suggests that the nature of divinity is possibly gained from a number of different sources. The Greek gods were born into it, being descended from Titans. This is called "Innate Divinity". "Earned Divinity" is when a person does some great or unique deed and is granted divinity based on that right. "Stolen Divinity" suggests murdering an existing God and stealing his power for your own. "Imparted Divinity" is when a God gives a mortal a portion of their own power, giving them divine ranks at the cost of their own. Zeus does this for the newest of the Greek Gods. There is also "Surrendered Divinity", when a God willingly gives up their divinity (temporarily or permanently), for whatever personal reason.

  As the DM, you decide when or how to grant divinity. These are just easy suggestions. In the D&D Cosmology, all of the Gods except Vecna (who earned it) and St. Cuthbert (who was imparted with it) were born into it.
#+end_quote

The [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm][SRD]] implies that rank 1-5 deities have hundreds of worshipers, while rank 16-20 have millions, but it doesn't specify how the causality flows.

Lastly, there are many mythos for D&D - there's canon D&D, Forgotten Realms, Eberron, the Pathfinder universe, which may or may not be different from the official Pathfinder shared universe that would best be described as a pen-and-paper MMORPG...

Basically, I'm sure it exists somewhere.
