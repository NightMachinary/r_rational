This is a rational topic in terms of how I am attempting to write the story, as opposed to the actual story itself.

I am attempting to have the characters act sanely, and reasonably, but the rational discussion here should revolve around the use of story elements as opposed to the content of story elements.

** The Imp scene in the most recent chapter is /weird/.

*** It was also removed. I decided that the story would be entirely in the narrative voice of Vlad.

I'm probably going to have to re-read how Imp's power works in Worm, specifically in the last couple places where she shows up. I was not happy with it, and she's going to start showing up more.

EDIT - There was another change. The next scene will be narrated from the viewpoint of Imp, in the same manner as Vlad narration, but (hopefully) with an Imp feel to it.

**** I read the chapter after you removed the scene. I then proceeded to the comments below, found someone speaking about the Imp scene, and went "What Imp scene? ...oh."

***** I didn't intend to do that. Promise. Really.

If the above statement confuses you, [[#s][Imp has the power]]

** What's the best way of keeping up with this story, assuming I don't regularly visit this forum?

Is there a thread-specific rss feed or something? Email alerts?

*** If you reply to the post with the advanced options at the bottom right, there is an option on that advanced reply page to select email notifications of updates.

I think that's the best option for notification if you aren't a member of that forum community.

**** Mhm. I think unfortunately that would also send me emails if anyone else sends a comment. We'll see whether that works for me :P

***** You are correct. That's the best I can offer at this time though, I'm afraid. I really need to get a webpage created and start storing everything there. Even I'm starting to lose track of where everything is.
