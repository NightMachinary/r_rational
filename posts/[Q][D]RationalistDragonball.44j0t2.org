I'm wondering... Has anyone written any Rationalist versions of any of the Dragonball stories or shows or Mangas or anything? It's a series of stories whose entire premise is directed, intentional self improvement and then finding relevant, reliable tests to determine the level of self improvement. And it has a varied setting, with weird tech and weird magic in the background, and an exploitable ki system... and an intentionally dumb protagonist, and antagonists and secondary characters of varying intelligence... how come I haven't yet seen a 'bump everyone's intelligence and cleverness and creativity and ambition and knowledge' yet? And show a few more axes of self improvement and training? It seems like a shoe in! Does such a thing exist? I'd have to learn a LOT more about the setting before trying my hand at it...


** Funnily enough Dragonball actually totally passes the first tests for rational!literature: there are totally these awesome magical artifacts that grant wishes, like world domination and bringing back the dead, and everybody is looking for them...

** I feel like it could work, given a couple major themes added into the story. Nuclear deterrence and proportional macguffin difficulty.

Nuclear deterrence: As mentioned, one problem DBZ has is an abundance of individuals with enough power to easily destroy planets. If one were to write these characters as rationally self-interested, the fights could largely be replaced with careful negotiations based around a mutual desire to not die, or kill billions of people.

Macguffin difficulty: The dragonballs are a problem because they're too powerful and too easy to get. They can be made interesting with the addition of either clear power limits, a massively harder time finding them (like, say, make it so there's only one set active in the galaxy at a time), or both.

Plus, in DBZ-land, souls clearly exist, and the afterlife is a physical location. That's the kind of thing that practically begs for rationalist writing.

**** It seems like Toriyama was aware of this as far back as the arrival of Piccolo, since that's when the DB-gathering starts happening off panel. Namek almost feels like an attempt to make the search challenging and relevant again, but the next two arcs go back to being too easy for the original premise. (The Buu arc did at least make a big deal out of how important the dragon radar is, to the point of forcing Goku out of play for a little while.)

The chokepoint is Bulma. Until the most recent movies, she was the only one capable of building a radar precise enough to make things ridiculously easy. Considering that she's the heiress of the biggest tech giant in the world, this probably involves more than the radar itself--maybe it uses satellites or cell towers or something to help with the search?

Find some way to remove any of those important links from the chain, and the Dragon Radar gets nerfed until they're replaced.

**** The radar can be kept, I think, if it's qualified a bit better. Like only being able to narrow things down to a still-large search area, or the balls dispersing in a much wider area, into inherently difficult/complex situations.

One thing GT had that was actually interesting was the evil dragons. Perhaps making the balls guarded by their dragons, or something like that, would make the balls tougher to acquire.

This is another thing that seems munchkinnable on the surface, but IMO if you have a verifiable, reliable afterlife, the aforementioned short and boring rational path may simply be the inverse of what I implied earlier.

/Don't/ save the planet, and everyone awesome lives happily ever after in Heaven while everyone terrible plays nuke tag happily ever after in Hfil.

I mean, King Yemma won't be happy, so I guess there's a plot token there, but it still doesn't lend itself naturally to a particularly nuanced story that I can see.

**** I think the counter to that is the clearly sub-optimal nature of the afterlife. There's a Hell, and reincarnation results in people effectively 'dying' for real, since they lose their memories.

That could be the basis for an interesting arc in which the party has to conquer the whole system and fix it.

Just a possibility though.

It isn't exactly rational, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233371/1/About-Time][About Time]] has this as one of three interwoven plots. I found it impressive when I first read it, but that was many years ago and I'm not sure how well those impressions would hold up on reread.

** DBZ fanfiction actually has this weird tendency towards... smartness, or at least self-consistency. Honor Trip and Bringer of Death are a couple of the most popular ones and spend a /lot/ of time on that, though they're /completely/ in disagreement as to whatever the hell "2x as strong" means (Honor Trip thinks 2x is way too low to be a significant difference, Bringer of Death thinks that /1.1x/ is enough to make a fight require significant amounts of cunning and strategy to win), they're mostly self-consistent intentionally. Honor Trip notably contains /pages/ of discussions of moral relativism and free will due to its subject matter, almost to obnoxious levels.

**** Dim familiarity is enough, I'd say. Heck, Honor Trip cites the first Funimation dub /way/ too often, so dim familiarity is probably /better/, since intimate familiarity sorta clashes with a lot of the dubisms (E.G. Bulma Briefs).

Bringer of Death starts off pretty badly. It's excessively wordy early on, and the prose tends to be purpler than Freeza's head. It gets better, later, even as it introduces HK-47 and an Asari as characters. Challenges towards the characters tend towards the interesting and unique.

Break Through the Limit is also good, but doesn't care much for consistency. It's very DBZ in nature. I enjoy it, but I'm on [[/r/rational]], so I'm not going to recommend it by that standard.

** While munchkinning the mechanics of a setting with an extensive albeit poorly defined magic system (like Harry Potter) and especially one with Serial Escalation as a major theme (like Naruto) is immensely satisfying in a rational fic, it works as fanfic because it's a relatively* simple thing for an intelligent author to fill the blanks in canon, rank the ultimate techniques as they like, and generally have stuff interact in new and interesting ways.

The problem with Dragon Ball is that it runs on /so much/ *bullshit* that there's just no good way to translate what's shown into something that makes sense on an intellectual level, and whole swathes of the internet have been lost to exactly that sort of discussion already. With the sheer amount of mechanical worldbuilding you'd have to inject into the 'verse, you might as well just write an original story and cite Dragon Ball as inspiration.

I mean, I'm /still/ not clear on whether the so-called Androids were actually cyborgs, or what.

Essentially, if a rational agent has motive and power enough to blow up the earth with a wave of their hand, and can only be stopped by an handwave of equal or greater power, there's just no good way to focus on the /rationality aspect of the story/, since the rational path in-universe is, by default, pretty dang short and boring (unless you're animating it, of course)

Depends on which ones you're talking about. Andorids 17 and 18 were originally humans, a set of twins that were kidnapped and converted into the androids we know now. So was Dr. Gero (Android 20). Androids 16 and 19 were entirely mechanical, as were most of the preceding androids in the series.

Also it is total bullshit that Dr. Gero can build planet busting capable robots (considering they're canonically much stronger than Freeza, who was a planet buster) Whatever he discovered that made that possible could've been put to SO much better use.

*********** I expect a lot of the anime's popularity happened during the faster parts. It seems like everyone I know got into it around the Saiyan arc, when things were considerably faster paced than the temporal abomination that is the Freeza fight. (I got bored enough during the Freeza fight that I stopped watching and missed the SSJ transformation episode, because I wasn't expecting anything more interesting than "Goku wins somehow" to happen after the previous 10 episodes.)

(The manga being available online doesn't help me. Even when I could see well enough to get something out of the visuals in the anime, it wasn't enough for comics, never mind something in black and white where most of the detail is in the line-art. For reference, I could tell that Krillin was bald and wore a red/orange dougi, but had to be told that he lacks a nose, even after paying particular attention to a close-up from early Namek. I did notice Dende's enormous eyes? I didn't know Namekians had antennae until the Lord Slug movie.)

*** "Android" is just the translation from Japanese. The Japanese is "jinzo ningen" which means "artificial human", but may not carry exactly the same connotation that "Android" means in English.

The Dragonball wiki gives a reference to them being cyborgs as a Dragonball Q&A section in the manga. I don't think any character actually said it. However, one android is Dr. Gero's brain in an android body, which proves that "androids" include cyborgs.

It does seem like 17 and 18 are treated as robots in some ways. The story never treats them as people who have lost their parents and they have no other relatives. They don't need to eat and they don't emit any ki, and when you see in their body nothing organic is obvious.

** I personally think a rational Dragonball story would be a lot of work. It's also fairly illogical at the best of times. Like how an untrained 4(5?) year old Gohan gets a higher power level than his father (who's been fighting and training for over a decade) when he gets angry, ostensibly due to his half breed composition. Or like how the dragon balls are never utilized to their full potential and/or have stupidly inconsistent rules. I don't think the universe lends itself towards being rational without a LOT of legwork on the author's part.

That being said, it's still possible. And potentially amazing. Just hard. And I don't think those with the required skillset to produce such a thing are big enough fans to do it. Who knows though?
