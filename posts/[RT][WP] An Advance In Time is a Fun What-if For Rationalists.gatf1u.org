Ever dreamed of what you'd do if you were placed in the Middle Ages in a position of power? Reinventing the modern era is a much more complicated tech tree than you might think, but if you don't want to wipe with moss forever, you might want to try.

Oh, and the surrounding kingdoms might just want to take what you have by force.

Think you could survive and thrive?

Go to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time][An Advance in Time]] on RoyalRoad. Because you never know when it could happen to you. :) Fiction is at 55k+ words so far.
