** This is the new book; it's a sequel to The Two Year Emperor[1], although it's pretty much standalone -- there's backreferences for humor, but you don't need to know them.

I'm relaxing with this one and doing it just for fun, very much in the style of 2YE -- no planning ahead, just transcribe whatever the story tells me happens next. It's a fun way to write, although it tends to surprise me. Let me know what you think.

Also, I'm soliciting suggestions for a title.

It's not even the Naruto setting, actually. I started off thinking of doing another Naruto fanfic, then I decided that I like the whole "ninja + ninja magic" thing, but I'm not all that excited about the Naruto story itself. I already put a lot of effort into rationalizing it when I wrote Team Anko; I've been to that well and wanted to do something new.

In $YET_UNNAMED_STORY there are ninja and they punch through walls, teleport-substitute with other objects, conjure fire and rocks, etc. There's no hidden villages, no large organized nations, no tech much above a feudal level (most especially no wireless headsets and satellite dishes), no bloodlines, no bijuu, and it's a deathworld full of vaguely supernatural monsters, spirits, and demigods.

One thing I did have trouble with was what magic to let Jake bring from Flobovia. I ended up deciding that the only thing to give him was the healing ring. I cheated a little and didn't even bring the Earring of Intellect, which he really should have had on him even in the bath. It just isn't a big enough plot element to be worth mentioning.

If it is going to be revealed that he's a transplant, I'd recommend making it less obvious in a later edit; inserting it into a list of religions or religious figures would help (especially if more than one had bizarre names).

When he was in Flobovia he got permanent magical enhancements to all 6 stats (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma) -- enough to put him at professional athlete levels. That makes him impressive for a baseline but woefully inadequate compared to even a child ninja. (Also, the wisdom and charisma boosts didn't really take.) The ring lets him heal anything and means that he never gets tired or needs to sleep -- as long as he's wearing it he can literally run for weeks without stopping.

Oh, and I've been reminded that he has an intelligence-boosting earring that he really should have. I'm going to put it on him and then forget about it, at least for now.

Excellently coordinated juggling level dexterity, and lifting double your weight with minor effort being described as 'impressive for a baseline' might cover it all, but it makes me wonder specifically about our hero getting punted through the tent wall with a collapsed chest. Without the constitution boost, would he have just completely been torn in two? Would that have been the -expected- result of a ninja waking up startled and healthy, as viewed from the perspective of the chief and healer? Is it at all odd from their perspective that he was -only- staved in and sent skidding?

** Just realized an issue: the MC has been through the POPE's, and can casually bench-press boulders.

Here's an excerpt; "Still, this was why there was a granite boulder the size of a medicine ball sitting on the ground in front of the target, specifically so that people could test their newfound might. I hoisted it into the air with a grunt and a delighted smile; the thing weighed easily twice what I did, and before the enhancement I couldn't even do a chin up.

I dropped it and, with a faint tra-la-la, skipped off to the next POPE." - Chapter 68

That's the problem with re-using characters; they keep trying to keep their toys with them.

*** Nah, I remembered that bit. It hasn't come up yet, but it will.
