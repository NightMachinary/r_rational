** So I don't really know much about Hune, the only notable thing being that she's an ogre (don't know what ogres look like other than being large) and isn't part of Cat's inner circle (or what's left of it).

From what I do remember she wasn't too thrilled with dying for another woman's dream, and just wanted to finish her service in the imperial army and leave to do her own thing. This was back when cat was still with the empire, so I'm not what made her decide to continue following cat so loyally? Can anyone recap Hune's journey?

*** I think Hune was mostly just a general. She's intelligent, capable, and has roots with Cat going back to Legion training. She doesn't particularly like Cat and wasn't drawn into her band of followers, but she's a capable soldier and strategist. Pretty sure she's just doing her job regardless of who is in charge of the army.

*** Yeah, I've wondered about her for a while. I mean, the girl straight up told Cat she didn't think much of her and didn't care about her cause, and yet Cat trusted her enough to potentially appoint her as Marshall of Callow when she was mad at Juniper.

Maybe she's in it for the money? A general's pay has to be pretty good.

** Apparently I formatted the last entry incorrectly, so upon request I have updated it to match previous updates.

Personally, I like this update. The politics of the Terms and the Truce are already being explored, and there are some deeply personal moments for character building.

Edit: There is a bonus chapter as well; don't forget to click through to Kingfisher I.

** Kingfishers daddy is a real piece of work. Will be fun to see how he dealt with the man.

*** Did the Kingfisher Prince get his name when he charged the undead dragon? If DK had any part to play, I'm going to be extremely suspicious.

** All of the tension and life of this story had been drained out for me because of this two year time skip.

There were so many things set up to come to a head:

Heroes and villains finally getting started on working together. The grand alliance and dwarven and drow nations poised to strike at the dead king together. Malicia mind jacking the legions and setting a trap for black. Black heading to Praes as a claimant to the tower. The 3 month cease fire with the dead king coming to an end. Unstable politics in Procer, Callow, Praes, and the Free Cities. Twilight ways just got made and had yet to be used against the dead king in a major way. Cat is planning "something" for Akua.

CAT HAVING AN INCIPIENT NAME!!!

And so much more. But then we just skip... two... years? Two utterly unremarkable years of campaign against the dead king.

What happened to cat's Name? What did the drow and dwarves do for two whole years? Tombmaker promised to kick down Keters door by some deadline, and we're two years closer to that. Why hasn't Akua gotten her just deserts? Black went to Praes to do... politics?... for two years?

The dead king is supposed to be incredibly genre savvy. How is he bogged down in a two year stalemate as the only opponent of a grand alliance/crusade? Is malicia defeated so thoroughly that her only contribution is some barely mentioned lines about politics in the free cities?

And what about the Bard? Effectively gone from the story. She does absolutely nothing for two years, so she either works on a timescale that makes her no longer a relevant threat for the remainder of this story, or she's been doing background stuff this whole time and is going to Deus ex Machina her way cheaply back into the story.

Two entire years where it seems like none of the conflicts have progressed appreciably.

*** So, because I'd estimate that people who don't like something are more likely to write a comment than those who do, I'll say that APGtE still consistently makes some of my days a little bit brighter, and that I like the current book a lot.

**** I still like the story, but this time skip is bizarre. This section reads more like a sequel to the story than a finale. And the story didn't actually get a finale. All the tension building up was the mark of an incredible storyteller. We got satisfying conclusion after conclusion, always with the next threat already established on the horizon.

The dead king was the next uber threat and the hammer wss ready to fall. But then he just stalls out for two years. Doesn't seem like that big of a threat anymore. I was expecting a desperate struggle for survival with heroes and villains snatching pyrrhic victories from the jaws of utter defeat. The drow and/or dwarves revealing themselves in a critical moment to shift the momentum. I was excited for Cat to finally get a name, and for Akua to finally get her punishment.

Instead, we skip two years. Nothing got resolved in two whole years. Really takes the wind out of the sails of the supposed Hidden Horror that he doesn't make real progress for two years

*** I have to agree with this quite a bit.

I love Practical Guide, but this timeskip has been extreme. It was understandable when we skipped through bits like her being at Legion school to get to the important parts, but this entire war against the Dead King *is* the important part.

The story has mostly been continuous, going from major event to major event with plenty in between, up until the Empire Ever Dark, where we started having bigger skips. But it generally *showed* us major parts.

Now, it seems that many of the events we had been building up to in the previous book have just 'happened' and been glossed over and are back in the past now, along with a *lot* of interesting side treks and battles that we only find out after the fact.

Thanks for reminding me about the Bard. I hadn't even considered that. If there was no timeskip, it'd make sense as she is reeling from previous rejections and having to re-form her plans. But two *years* and nary a peep? Sure, she could be working behind the scenes, but Cat should at least have heard *rumors* and either made them a priority or at least be worried about them. Or, like you said, more direct contact with the Dread Empire of Praes or the Dead King using messengers and such to divide, taunt, or intimidate his enemies.

Honestly, it seems as if the author bit off more than he could chew. The series was supposed to end with the last Book, but it continued on and on. Now it seems he is determined to end it in this one, even if we have to leapfrog over things that the previous Book was building up to as being important events, but we still get things that are functional wastes of time (four chapters building up how important a new character is, only to kill him off and use him as a reason for Cat to be angry), important antagonists going completely ignored, and finding out that all that amazing work in the previous Book has only led to the "allied forces" achieving a stalemate.

**** Yeah this book feels like the start of a sequel more than the climax of the story we've followed this whole time.

And it's not like the climax happened and we missed it. It just utterly stalled for two entire years. That is an enormous amount of time to skip for the size of the threats they are up against. Really lowers the threat level of the dead king.
