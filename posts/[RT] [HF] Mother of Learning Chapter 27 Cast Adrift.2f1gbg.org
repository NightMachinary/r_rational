** FAQ from [[https://www.fictionpress.com/u/804592/nobody103][Nobody103's FictionPress Profile]]:

#+begin_quote
  /Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?/

  The story basically has 3 arcs, and I only finished one so far as of chapter 26. So nowhere near the end, basically.

  /Q: I love your spiders, by the way. No idea if they're from your own head or inspired by something. If they're inspired by something, I'd loove to hear what they're from./

  They're from my head, mostly, but they were inspired by the GIFTS (Giant Intelligent Friendly Talking Spiders) and Aranea from Exile/Avernum series of computer games. I sort of combined them into one species, changed the type of spider into jumping spiders (because they're cute), gave them psychic powers instead of simple magical prowess and then built a society around the concept. They have a lot of worldbuilding behind them, and I'm not sure how much I'll end up showing in the story proper, but I'll try to do them justice. I tried not to make them into a 'race of hats' like non-human species usually end up being in fantasy stories, but still make them relatable and understandable to humans.

  Generally speaking, Exile/Avernum games are a big influence on this story. Other influential inspirations are D&D (of course) and Fullmetal ALchemist (the Alteration discipline is basically FMA Alchemy and watching it made me aware I dislike medieval tech levels and prefer higher technology settings). Harry Potter and Naruto fandoms are a minor inspiration as well, as are a whole bunch of other works that I won't bother listing.

*** I'm surprised to see Naruto listed as a "minor" influence, since I'd taken this story as a reboot of Chuunin Exam Day/Time Braid. That is, a reboot that's been reskinned with D&D, better execution, and a decided lack of squicky underaged sex.

**** The only influence from Chuunin Exam Day/Time Braid is the 'month-long time loop' idea. Which is admittedly pretty crucial to the story, but is easily divorced from its Narutoverse trappings. Shaping exercises and Zach also inspired by the Naruto fandom, which is what I count as minor influences.

***** Thanks for the response!

I'd noticed those, as well as your tendency to refer to non-mages as "civilians", the Xvim/Ebisu parallels, and [[#s][the]] elements. Those combined gave me the impression it was a major influence, but I suppose different categorizations for what we consider minor or major aren't a huge deal.

Love the story, by the way. Discussed the latest chapter with my SO last night.

****** Xvim/Ebisu parallels aren't deliberate - I wasn't consciously inspired by Ebisu, though now that I think about it there may have been an unconscious influence.

There's probably a large number of such things throughout the story. I read a huge amount of Naruto fanfiction while I was still a fan.

***** I can see how shaping exercises can be inspired by Naruto, but to be completely honest, it took until this post for me to even make that connection. It just seems like such a logical extension for how the MoL magic system works.

Please keep up the great work, mate. I'm loving this story.

*** I thought Novelty felt a lot like Spider! I grew up on Exile and later Avernum and Geneforge. I love the worldbuilding and old-school RPG feel Jeff puts in his games.

There was an old Exile fanfic of the early days with the King and Erika and such trying to survive in lightless caves on their own, but I can't seem to find it and fanfiction.net doesn't have the exile or avernum area any longer for some reason.

** Knyazov Dveri is almost correct Ukrainian for "Prince's Doors". The author is listed as from Croatia and some names definetely have a slavic feel to them, but I don't think I've seen a name with such a clear bilingual bonus before. I wonder, If that's significant.

  The *Golden Gates of Kiev* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language][Ukrainian]]: Золоті ворота, /Zoloti vorota/, literally 'golden gates') is a major landmark of the Ancient Kiev and historic gateway in the ancient city fortress, located in the capital of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine][Ukraine]]. Currently it serves as a museum and can be found on the corner of Volodymyr street and Yaroslaviv Val Street (Yaroslav's Moat). The name /Zoloti Vorota/ is also used for a nearby [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre][theatre]] and a station of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_Metro][Kiev Metro]].
