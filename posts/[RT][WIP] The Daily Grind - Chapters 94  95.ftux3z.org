** This used to be updated here, but whomever did it stopped sometime around when I took a break. I don't think it's gotten /less/ rational in the intervening time, so I figured I'd share it myself as a reminder that I'm not dead.

*** I really enjoyed this when I read it a while back, but caught up to your pre break stuff. Glad you're still working on it! As a binge reader I'll hold off longer but I do look forward to it. Thanks!

**** Yeah, I started Book Two a couple (Few? Some? Time is weird) months ago, and I've mostly been keeping up the "one a week" chapter schedule.

** Oh goddamnit. I think royalroad just informs me about the last chapter and not that there are multiple. I think I missed 94 completely.

Also "Fuck Off This Is Art" would sell like hotcakes. I'd be more mad at you for not following through and becoming a wonka-esque candy billionaire if you hadnt posted the idea on the internet for me to steal.

Edit: do you know if anyones done any art of Secret that matches what you intended? I dont really have much of a mental image of his new body.

*** It's really hard to actually visually portray Secret's body, because he's larger than the space he occupies. Still, there's a sketch with him posted on the discord server, and I think someone else is working on a larger colored piece.

Also yes please steal my candy.
