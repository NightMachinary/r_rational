**** That scene--specifically the screenplay edit--also explains why the "new" Adam was unable to replicate his predecessor's talent. [[#s][Spoiler]]

As an aside, I liked the indirectness of the reveal. It felt very believable that the original would withhold the "obvious" reveals, but overlook seemingly innocuous memories that obliquely reference the event.

** Great story and character, but one glaring critique: most of the references were a little too rooted in present day (google, facebook, deep-learning algos, self-driving cars, drones, etc).

I understand only the mind-upload tech is central to the story, but it's as if the world froze in time around 2019 and /only/ the upload tech advanced.
