  Author's Note: So, when I write a reflective chapter like this, where it's very static and not much happens, I never know how it will be received. 
#+end_quote

I wouldn't worry. The quieter moments are where the characters have a chance to develop, without being caught up in "forced" actions to respond to urgently unfolding events.

*** Personally, I think reflective chapters like this are required to maintain story flow. They may be more boring, but without them, the story loses its pacing and feels frantic or unstructured.

  “You know,” said Davo, “whenever I experience an overwhelming sense of fear and trepidation about the demon you carry around with you, I remind myself how scary and unnerving /you/ are. The demon's probably sitting in a corner hoping you don't notice it.”
#+end_quote

It's hilarious how true that is. [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-25][Do you remember?]]

#+begin_quote
  Nic sat in the dark and smiled, and his smile turned into a soft laugh. He had feared he would be stuck behind the walls of his mind with a demon, but it was also true that the demon was stuck in here with him. Close enough to be studied. And Nic was a good student.

[[/u/mooderino][u/mooderino]], since you seem to be following this, do you have any estimates of the book's expected final length? Are we more than halfway to the end? (Unless revealing that would spoiling the story, of course.)

**** I see. And the total number of arcs isn't planned?

That is, the way I see it, the plot seems to have a clear ending condition: resolution of the demonic threat. I assume it would be resolved in finite time, with the conflict not being stretched on and on. If the number of arcs isn't limited by that... Oh, but that would be spoilers, I suppose.

** I am really enjoying seeing a magical school story where there are competent adults, and there is still reason to focus on studies and schoolwork.

The discussion was a really good show don't tell moment of what makes 'the good student's such an amazingly good student.

  The subtle differences in the work assumed to be plagiarised was his explanation for why they had been incorrectly deemed to be cheating.
#+end_quote

Just, wrong. Not only is "plagiarized" misspelled, but the sentence structure is difficult to follow, and appears to say the opposite of what I think it's supposed to say.

Maybe try:

#+begin_quote
  In his explanation, the plagiarism accusation had been dropped because of the subtle differences in the answers.

You don't have to be American to write on an American site. Most authors on GT aren't.

******** I'm quite aware. I was trying to point out that there was no way for me to know which version of English was in play. I didn't even notice the spelling until Chrome spell-checked it for me. My reason for commenting was that the sentence structure was immersion breaking to me. I hope that knowledge is useful.

** All this talk of money makes me wonder about the war between Ranvar and the demons. Arcanum seems to be metaphorical shavings and filings left behind during the minting of magic, so to speak... I wonder what Davo's thesis would be about the demon war?

I don't think we know enough about demons yet, but I imagine that the War over Value will play a role in the story to come.
