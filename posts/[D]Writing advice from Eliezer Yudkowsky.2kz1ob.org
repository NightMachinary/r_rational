  And as long as I'm on the subject: â€˜literary' stories about broken people becoming even more broken are not fun to read on grounds of pure hedonics. If you try to countersignal that your story must be very hip and contrarian because it offers so little merely pleasurable reward for reading it, don't expect to sucker anyone self-aware enough to have moved on past meta-contrarianism.

*** My view on this: This isn't a property of sad stories, it's more specific than that. The examples of the genre he mentions I think of are /Death of a Salesman/ and the collected works of J.D. Salinger, particularly /Catcher in the Rye/. They're about unsympathetic, stupid people, who make poor decisions and end up less sympathetic and just as stupid as they started.

It's OK to write stories where the challenges are insurmountable and the main characters lose, or where you make them suffer a lot. (Luminosity does the first, and nearly everything Alicorn writes does the second.) But if the characters aren't worthy of any respect and neither are the things they accomplished, and there isn't any pleasure from the resolution, there's nothing to draw in the reader.

Really? Batman is a normal man(*), but he competes on a pretty even footing with people like Superman and Wonder Woman, who are effectively gods. He's been shown able to one-shot the entire Justice League, and he does it purely through intelligence and good planning. Lots of people say "oh, he only wins because it's his book and PersonX would totally beat him", but even those people can't deny that he brings things to the League that they need and that no one else brings: planning, tactics, leadership, contacts, detective ability... the list goes on.

There's nothing interesting about that?

(*) I suppose "normal" is stretching it -- he's human max on every axis. Still within human possibilities, though.

Char dev doesn't have to mean massive life change, it can also mean deepening and enrichig.

**** /The Catcher in the Rye/ isn't about accomplishment. And I don't think that stories need to be about resolution either. Sometimes a story is just an exploration of how a person thinks, or how the world works, and I think that there can be an immense value in that. I watched a movie recently - though I can't recall the title - that was all about broken people being broken. And at the end of the movie, no one had gotten any less broken, and stupid decisions had been made, but those decisions were realistic ones, and those broken people were fully realized characters. I like reading stories about people making bad choices, because if they're well-written there's an enormous amount of complexity there - even if the character isn't sympathetic.

It sort of goes without saying that I heavily disagree with Yudkowsky on the topic of literary merit. Those essays are a great guide to writing stuff that Yudkowsky would like, but he seems to be betraying an enormous lack of empathy for people who aren't himself. The jab at "literary" works was probably the worst part of it.

But I'm an English major, so maybe I'm just showing my biases.

***** Data and Philosophy here: Yes. Yudkowsky is trashing a vast number of stories. I think that there are large classes of fiction that would be better if people followed his rules, including most mainstream SF&F, detective novels, and most other things that get called "genre". That's part of why I linked: I expect most of the things I see written this NaNoWriMo to be "genre" in this sense.

I agree with you that there's a lot of other good sorts of stories, that portray people and help one understand something different. It took me years of being exposed to "great books" to finally get my hands on All The King's Men, which showed me this alternate path. I imagine most people have a book like that. But those are a fairly small minority of what tends to get written, so I felt comfortable including his advice.

Taking Catcher in the Rye again: It's about a worthless person there's no reason to care about, and doesn't say anything interesting about anything else. That's a big part of the 'broken people' piece; there's nothing to engender any /respect/ for the worthless character. All Holden's problems are of his own making, he's not just an ass but a /stupid/ ass, and he's incredibly self-unaware about those things. Salinger doesn't give anyone who isn't a broken person themself (which, OK, Salinger was himself) a reason to care.

I'm not going to defend /The Catcher in the Rye/, because it's been a decade since I've read it, but you keep dismissing people who claim to like something that you don't like as trying to signal something or seeking status, and then you call them broken. Why on earth would anyone who liked the book want to have a conversation with you?

I've already explained why I like stories with broken characters in them, but you seem ready to dismiss this as a lie, or worse, as me being a broken person. Do you understand how I could find this to be insulting on a number of levels?

********** I like reading about broken characters because if they're written well, they're complex, and there's an intrigue that with understanding them, and seeing them do the (often stupid, selfish, etc.) things that they do. I believe that there's both interest and value in looking over a character's shoulder as they do stupid things, if only to realize what it is that they're thinking - whether it's a housewife who has an affair because she's bored and lonely, or a soldier who's suffering from PTSD and kills his wife, or yes, even a bratty teenager who thinks he knows everything. I may not care about the characters - I may even despise them - but I want to know what happens because they're fleshed out and in some way real, and I want to understand them even if I don't feel like I will ever sympathize with them. For me, at least, reading that gives me something to think about, and enhances the richness of the world by teaching me things that I didn't know before.

In other words, I like reading stories about people making bad choices, because if they're well-written there's an enormous amount of complexity there - even if the character isn't sympathetic. I can understand why someone would feel otherwise, but being called a liar and a broken person for enjoying a certain kind of literature is not something that I take kindly to.

************ Hm. I have that same feeling. I can't claim to speak for you or anyone else, but I'm going to try and articulate why I dislike broken characters.

In general, broken characters don't plan. They don't /do/ things. They don't /optimize/. You know that trope, "Villains Act, Heroes React"? Well, broken characters don't even really /react/. There's a reason stories aren't about your average Joe. I don't want to read a story about an average Joe. No wonder, then, that I don't like stories about /depressed/ Joes.

"But," someone else may say, "it is often the case that depressed characters have good /reason/ to be depressed. Isn't it fascinating to explore the psyche of a broken person? Broken people are /interesting/."

To which I reply:

It is entirely possible that a depressed character has an interesting backstory. However, unless the author writes that character /extremely well/ (and I do mean /extremely well/), I can't fathom how interesting that backstory is. As an non-depressed person, I cannot will myself into a depressed character's place. It's entirely possible that from whatever emotional perspective the /character/ is in, his/her actions make internal sense. But try as I might, /I can't place myself into that emotional perspective at will/, and not to sound callous, but I don't really want to, either. It's the /author's/ job to make the character interesting to me, not /my/ job.

And for some reason, writing a character that is simultaneously broken and sympathetic is /really hard to do/. Authors may do it to signal experience and cynicism and wisdom, but the end result is (to me) something that is neither enjoyable nor interesting to read. In Yudkowsky's essay on [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent Characters]], he wrote:

#+begin_quote
  The scriptwriter thought it would make a Dramatic Moment to leave Bilbo watching the side of the mountain alone. But the price of that Dramatic Moment was to populate the movie with strange, bizarre creatures who do not think like you or I; and so the Dramatic Moment fell flat, at least for me.
#+end_quote

He was referring, of course, to movie!Thorin's decision to throw down the key in a fit of anger, an act that caused Thorin to lack an "inner spark of optimization", making him an "H-Zombie". But I think it applies just as well here. Broken characters don't lack an "inner spark of optimization" because they /no longer want to optimize/. That may be a good way for an author to signal experience and cynicism and wisdom, but the price of that signal is to populate the work with strange, bizarre creatures who do not think like you are I; and so the attempt falls flat, at least for me.

How do you write an emotionally sympathetic character? I don't know. Writing /ideologically/ sympathetic characters is (relatively) easy; just look at Professor Quirrell as an example. Writing /emotionally/ sympathetic characters, on the other hand, especially /depressed/ ones, is damn hard. Maybe if the reader is allowed to follow the character from the beginning, when the character /isn't/ depressed, slowly tracing the long, winding path to depression, crossing each step of inferential distance individually... but to my knowledge, authors tend not to do that sort of thing. Instead, they want to present the depression of the characters /firsthand/, /without/ providing any inferential steps for the reader to trace. This may work for the /author/, because the /author/ is already there (Salinger experienced clinical depression while writing /The Catcher in the Rye/), but to assume that the reader will instantly be able to follow along is to commit an example of the Typical Mind Fallacy.

TL;DR: Writing broken characters that are nonetheless interesting is hard as heck. If not for my knowledge that the human memory is fallible, I'd say that I've never seen it done quite right.

Also, I have met certain teenagers who were as stunted and unsympathetic as Holden Caulfield or the Lomans (Linda excluded; she's the only remotely sane person in that story).
