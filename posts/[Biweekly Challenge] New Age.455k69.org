[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/430hg8/biweekly_challenge_star_wars/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Star Wars". [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/430hg8/biweekly_challenge_star_wars/czgkwyv][The Will of the Force]].

Next time, the challenge will be "New Age". Homeopathy, crystal healing, astrological signs, tarot readings, palm readings, spiritualism, etc. The term isn't a well-defined one, nor is it that easy to separate from its historical antecedants, but it's just a prompt; go cruising some new age websites ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Age_topics][or Wikipedia]]) and see what stories spring to mind. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, February 24th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be "First Contact". My first thought when I hear that phrase is /alien/ contact, but there's no reason that you couldn't do contact between pre-Industrial civilizations on the same planet, contact between parallel worlds, or contact between the past and future.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 2/24.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread for recommendations and discussion [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/459yn9/challenge_companion_new_age/][can be found here]].


** [[http://pastebin.com/0mczqtQr][Nuclear Rapture]], 1800 words, a rational new age chiliasm/reincarnation fic about what might happen if Edgar Cayce's channelings on where souls and consciousness came from were true. (And, I guess, looking over the encyclopedia, if the Platonic doctrine of recollection were true. Didn't realize Cayce had been borrowing from such an august source.)

** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17AMUJayxNM82ONn3YkTpw1FygvAyvIwHuRMgkPefSrs/edit?usp=sharing][Inconveniences]], 1050 words, in which we are reminded that healers can be assholes too.

Not super deep into the New Age stuff, but it was fun to write. I'm not used to writing bad guys who don't have geopolitical agendas.

*** Is the healer really an asshole here, though? I don't know if I misinterpreted it, but it seems as if he's only doing what he can to protect himself, as opposed to just dicking over people at random. He needs to blend in with the frauds so he doesn't become a government tool, right?

**** Nah, you got that right. Leaving the girl to die was rational given that he didn't want to be snatched up by Uncle Sam. What I also tried to show though was that he didn't /care/ that the girl would die. He considered the father an 'easy mark' to bleed dry, and at the end he thinks to himself that /he/ doesn't care, and is just annoyed he loses out on the money and word of mouth.

***** <nods> I'm put in mind of how, in practice, doctors and nurses tend to develop empathy exhaustion--enough suffering and dying people seen that they become unable to care about suffering and death any more, but keep at it lessening suffering and death where they can because they know in their heads it's the right things to do (or just for money, depending on the person). Still better than someone who increases suffering and death while feeling guilty about it!
