Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So the "So I'm a Spider, So What?" anime has just released episode 1, and it's looking quite optimistic, apart from the more egregious CGI frog. Especially the opening chock-full of light novel spoilers, oh my. Had me smiling like a buffoon after waiting for it for almost 3 years.

I'm a huge fan of the series, as it's essentially the only straightforward isekai that isn't a complete mess. Every element and plot device in the story has a purpose, sometimes even 8-9 volumes later, without feeling like an ass-pull or coming out of nowhere. It's what I consider the perfect isekai, although it requires a lot of knowledge and background in isekai to fully appreciate what it does. It's the most rational of all the isekais I've seen with a highly competent MC(comedy aside), although I will admit that is a very low bar to surpass.

There's a lot of other amazing and competent anime series coming out this season too like Re:Zero S2 Part 2 and Attack on Titan S4, all of which I'm excited for.

*** All I'm planning to watch this season is Spider and Mushoku tensei.. I enjoy spider, but I've only read the manga and I must say after that demon king and now this new arc, where it seems she'll be involving herself with human matters, have lowered my interest on it substantially.

​

Mushoku Tensei is a bit of a popcorn read I've done and eventually dropped years ago. The author is definitely a discovery writer that doesn't really have a plan. It's very much a 'this story isn't going anywhere, what should I do? ... Oh! I know I'll teleport everyone to a dangerous continent and see what happens'.

​

The author had to pull a portal fantasy inside a portal fantasy just to add a plot to his follow along story, how crazy is that? *inserts comments on lack of creativity, and plot formulation skills* And this is one of the most successful and highly rated webnovels from japan.

​

It's interesting as a study on how bad an author can be and still be successful. Although if you can't stand the usual loli harem nonsense commonly seen in japanese works it's a definite pass.

​

But I must say my overhaul impression and expectation for any japanese novel / manga have been fairly low in the last couple years. It annoys me how good novels on RR many made by amateurs are all virtually better than anything I've seen japan produce in a long time that isn't a comedy..

**** It seems to me the problem is that every webnovel or lightnovel or manga creator in japan is desperately trying to get picked up as an anime. So they're all replete with every single stupid, obnoxious trope that exists in popular works , like boob envy, cute critter companion, hair color== personality, incest tension, yanderes, tsunderes, non-emoting==cool, feckless harem lead, neet isekai, and so on and so on. It is basically the ultimate commercial pressure pitfall.

Of course it's also possible japan has a thriving indie webnovel/webcomic scene full of original, avant garde works which simply don't get translated because all the translators are pathetic loli obsessed incel weebs.

Anyway, it leads me to wonder if the western scene is less susceptible to commercial pitfall somehow, or if its going through something similar and I can't see it.

It's certainly possible but probably not likely. If they ever made something like MoL it'd be the best thing of the decade and be everywhere with hundreds of loop stories popping up for years afterwards.

​

IMHO One of the potential causes we see so little translated works be good is that people anywhere with a high enough intelligence level will given the chance choose to consume and create content in english.

​

This leads to a drop in the quality of the content produced there and a boost to the overhaul quality of EN works in general..

​

It could be me projecting, but take for instance my country. 200kk people, more than England and Germany combined and I've seen no good stories coming out of here virtually ever.

​

Why ? Because if you're intelligent enough you learn the current trade / intellectual language and use it instead.

By this logic you wouldn't have foreign literatures. It doesn't make much sense, each country is full of its own creators, some good, some bad. And writing in a language you're not a native speaker of doesn't come easily or natural to everyone (I should know...). If anything you could see light novels closer to fanfiction: in many cases, if you're good enough, you might start asking yourself if it wouldn't make more sense to go one step further, aim for a more "respectable" literary career and thus leave the art form to amateurs. The big difference is that fanfiction isn't publishable because of copyright issues and LNs are. But hey, we STILL got "50 shades of grey", which was fanfiction with just the names changed. Anime LN adaptations are like if TV networks made a really successful "50 shades" show and then decided to go dig into everything else and now we had a massive "My Immortal" serial.

******* Except statistically countries / languages with higher population are going to again 'statistically' have a higher number (not percentage) of highly intelligent or talented or whatever attribute you deem important to the creation of art.

Meaning we should, all things being equal, see languages that have a higher number of speakers produce a higher number of 'great works'.

Nations with higher populations produce a higher total number of scientific discoveries and innovations...

It's like the most beautiful women in a small town, in a big city she might just be considered pretty or cute, simply because of the total number of people involved. In a way the literature scenes of such small countries likely suffer the same fate.

In their home country it might be great to the 40kk people that live there and speak that language, but it might be just above average to an english speaker.

******** Yes, in the sense that if you're looking for someone world class in writing, then it's more likely that they'll emerge from a population of one billion than from one of ten million. But first, for something like this there's multiple cultural factors at play, because a small population might produce a disproportionate amount of writers if the environment is especially culturally fertile (consider how many writers and philosophers were produced in the space of a mere century in ancient Athens, which had only something like 40k male free citizens - slaves and women being ineligible for literary fame at the time). Second, there is no perfect objective metric of what constitutes "good writing", but even if we could establish that for example Writer A, English mothertongue, is overall better than Writer B, Italian, it is still entirely possible that B will be more appealing to other Italians due to writing e.g. things that are more relatable or relevant to their interests. By the way I'm not making the comparison by chance, as I'm Italian myself, and interestingly, I can tell you we have a lot more writers tackling that sort of realistic setting than we do fantasy or sci-fi writers, genres which indeed tend to be more easily "international".

In other words, it's wrong to paint this as a matter of who's better and who's worse, or what's more successful and what's not. It's instead a matter of niches. My objectives as a writer could be various, but there is no such thing as "wanting to be the Best Writer in the World". If I wanted to make a living with my writing, I'd consider my own strength and weaknesses; one might have better luck for example writing in their own mother tongue and aiming for a smaller but safer public than trying to strike it big worldwide but competing with a comparatively larger market.

********* I do agree that things are subjective and exceptions exist, if this was a doctorate thesis instead of a quick comment I would have brought those up..

I do have a few caveats though. Greece, and Athens in general was likely at the time one of, if not the area with the highest number of people that were literate. Meaning if there were good writers they'd very likely come from there.

Keep in mind the only real difference Greece had at the time from the rest of europe was the fact that it was the closest and therefore the first area to get exposed to the relatively new invention that was writing (and technically civilization in general). They were the ones that spread the alphabet to most of europe.

The Greek city states were also the first large city centers in europe, and it's safe to assume most farmers or hunter gatherers don't really have much free time to be doing thought experiments, recording events or to do math.

Fair comparisons using population numbers get more accurate as more people have access to education and in general similar starting points. It still works somewhat in strange scenarios like the planet +2k years ago but you tend to get weird results that require extra analysis. If we compare City state Greeks with hunter gatherer tribes in Germany there's an implicit understanding that things will be unfair as far as their artistic outputs will be.

It works now when most people are educated and literate. But if for instance tomorrow a country instated universal basic income they'd have an inherent advantage to their artistic output until other countries followed along.

PS. If you want to be a writer, I'd recommend reading War of Art. Recommended it yesterday on the rec thread. You can check my comment there if you're interested.

PPS. My ancestors were from Italy, from a region called 'Facio'. Hence my last name Fassina.

Well, at least in that part of the world. China says hi. But regardless of that, today pretty much EVERYONE is literate, and would you expect even just three major writers like Aeschilus, Sophocles and Euripides, AND three major philosophers like Socrates, Plato and Aristoteles, to all emerge from any average 40k inhabitants town in the space of 60 years? We're talking the kind of people we still talk about and study 2500 years later, though I guess one could argue that there was more low hanging fruit even in the arts at the time. The point I'm making is, your "brute force" argument of more people = more rolls of the dice = more chances of someone emerging from the long tail of the distribution would imply that today there should be literary geniuses born at a rate thousands of times higher than in a past in which not only the world was less populated, but most of it was illiterate. And while sure, the overall artistic production has much increased in volume, the proportional /quality/ of it doesn't really hold the comparison. We don't have today someone you could honestly say is a thousand times better than Homer, than Virgil or Dante Alighieri. By which I'm not saying that the arts are declining either; just that the best tend to be more or less as good as they were back then. And my point was, IMO what really matters is not some sort of talent you're born with and that follows a typical probability distribution, the bottleneck is the development of potential. It takes a lot of stars aligning to get an environment that fosters great art, but when that happens (Athens in the 5th century BC, Florence in the 15th century AD, Paris at the beginning of the 20th century, and so on), then a lot of people with potential get their chance to bloom. And for that reason, language isn't all that important and there's great writers all over the world. Because people /with the potential/ to be a great writer are common enough that even a country of ten million will have many every generation; all that matters is when and how that potential is unlocked and allowed to flourish.

You make some very strong conclusions from what less than two actual exceptions? Which btw I'll get to shortly.

To get to your points, there's a limit to how intelligent humans can get before it becomes counterproductive.

Most artists, philosophers and the like become famous or relevant posthumously.

Have you actually read many classic works? They aren't that good compared to what we have today (specially in writing). What we find good today is great when compared to things from even just one century ago, because people build on top of what others built before them. Meaning art gets better overtime.

This also implies that artists that aren't experiencing this innovation and development at an equal rate as those that are find themselves less likely to be able to innovate than those that do. Which BTW explains away ancient Athens, 15th century Italy and virtually any example you can come up with before consistent high speed communications were set up, but even still those that have to wait for translations get behind.

Of course authors in close proximity to the people that innovated would have the chance to build on top of what the best works at the time were. Specially when others far away would need to wait years to even hear about the innovations that were first made.

My problem is with reducing creativity in the arts to something like a single axis. I think it's way too reductive. An Ancient Greek would not enjoy /our/ art right off the bat because there's no better or worse, it's more about being in tune with your audience.

I've read a few, including extracts in their original language. I agree with your point about innovation, but I think that's not a matter of art getting “better” in an intrinsic manner. Rather, the modern writer has a vaster toolset that they know the modern reader will relate to. Modern art is more varied as a result. But about being better... If you could bring back in time a fully armed modern battalion, you'd win any war. If you could bring back your favourite modern novel, odds are no one would “get it”. That's why I say it's not a linear thing. Ancient art is simpler, but because it also existed for an overall simpler society.

Sure, that was my point too. That the rate at which great artists emerge isn't a function of population as much as of the formation of innovation hubs which reach past a critical mass (and said hubs today don't even have to be /physical/ anymore).

************* My points also include the fact that the hubs were a function of distance and communication delay, rather than culture or race. I guess you'd agree with that.

Ultimately my theory implies a more egalitarian distribution of art, explains it's absence / rarity in some areas without implying inherent superiorities or inferiorities in people or cultures. That's valuable imho, and likely more accurate at explaining reality than what's currently available.

I'm a bit of a reductionist, many people in this sub are. Our discussion breaks down if you reject the notion things can be better, it's what my initial point was.

If you're going to go 'all art is equally valuable just to different people' and 'there's no way of defining, rating or categorizing it by quality', then that's that. We've different base assumptions about reality, which interestingly it's also what political differences break down into.

I'm generally a reductionist too, but I don't see how can you possibly define "absolute" standards of any sort for art. Sciences deal with our understanding of the phenomena of nature; in that sense, nature is our impartial arbiter for any and all scientific discovery. That's why we perform experiments; any theory needs to be measured against how well it predicts the behaviour of nature.

With art, the aim is to communicate to other humans. Art in a vacuum - e.g., the Mona Lisa ejected in the interstellar void of a Universe without intelligent life - is meaningless. Art is a medium of communication. If you want to define a purpose to it, it is "to elicit emotions or transmit thoughts and ideas to certain humans". Possibly in a /majority/ of humans, but given the concept of a target audience, which can be a niche minority one (we should know well in this subreddit), not necessarily even that. So I have a model human in my mind that is "my audience", and my goal as an artist is to convey certain feelings to them as well as possible. And that's even discounting the possibility that instead my goal might be to simply /express/ myself, regardless of who understands me or not. At best, you could argue, a good artist is one who has a (conscious or intuitive) understanding of the interplay of human psychology, culture and so on that their works will mostly succeed at achieving exactly what they /want/ them to achieve - which may be to please as well as to disgust, anger, or bore, depending on one's objective, though the latter aren't that common.

Now, let's consider the issue of comparing art from very different historical eras. In 2020, a scriptwriter sets down with the objective of writing a movie script that will move, excite and enrapture people all around the world, and ultimately win him the Academy Awards. In 460 BC, Euripides sits down with the objective of writing a tragedy that will move, excite and enrapture the free citizens of Athens, and ultimately win him the Dionyisian games. Which one is the better artist?

We could take the movie, re-enact the tragedy, put them both in front of a modern audience, and see which one is most liked and appreciated. If we did it this way, it's all but guaranteed that if the movie isn't positively awful, and the audience isn't hand-picked among literature historians, the movie will win. But that's a bit unfair to Euripides. Euripides didn't set his skills to conveying his message to /us/ - he had a completely different audience in mind! It's like saying I'm a bad programmer because you can't run my software on your Windows PC, ignoring the fact that my software is a binary compiled for Linux. But then again, we can't go back in time to check Euripides' audience or show them the movie, because, well, they're all dead. And they would hate the movie anyway (possibly run in fear from it, in fact). All we can do is look up what we know about the reactions. In that sense, if Euripides consistently achieved victory in the Dionyisian games and gained great acclaim, we might consider him roughly an equal of the scriptwriter if he too consistently achieves victory in the Academy Awards. But it's a very rough comparison. It's unlikely they are orders of magnitude far apart from each other, because both are acknowledged by their peers as extremely skilled but neither's work produces supernaturally powerful effects - at best, it gets people moved to tears and clapping loudly, and that's about it. Would Euripides have been able to write for an audience of millions or billions rather than thousands? Well, who knows? But we don't have a good reason to rule it out; after all, modern culture is also overall more homogeneous, which is why people from very disparate lands can all watch the same superheroes beat up each other and have fun with them. We share a lot of tropes and codified knowledge.

So basically this is my point. I don't think it's contrary to the principles of reductionism. I think trying to establish a ranking between artists is a fool's errand not because there aren't objective differences, but because time erased all possibilities of drawing direct comparisons, and in general, not all artists are even trying to do the same thing, so it's an apple and oranges comparison more often than not. I would also note that the idea that there was an absolute canon of beauty to stick to was prevalent for a lot of the history of Western art - that canon being exactly the one set in antiquity - and if anything, it stifled creativity and vitality in the arts for a long time. Modernity was defined by the moment in which artists really went "you know what, fuck those Greeks/Romans" and started doing their own thing. While this has not necessarily always led to great results, it certainly has led to a lot of innovation.

*************** I believe everything can be quantified, and sorted by virtually any reasonable applicable metric.

If to rate art we need to rate it by it's individual components and give it than average that number out to get an overhaul score that's perfectly reasonable.

I wouldn't compare things by showing it to two audiences and gauging their reaction. I'd show it to a large number of people have them rate the subparts deemed most relevant to that particular type of art, then I'd average that number and sort it.

The authorial intent, target audience, and goals don't come into account. For instance a story, you'd rate the plot, characterization, pacing, prose, themes, execution etc. Average those numbers out with lot's of other 'reviewers', then average the overhaul score out and you'd get a rating for that work.

It might not be perfect, or objectively correct, but it's a good enough approximation of reality for most purposes. Meaning it's been sorted and ranked. This is something possible to do, so in my view art can be sorted, ranked and compared.

**************** That doesn't really make sense. If you're getting people to judge those things, you're involving audiences and gauging their reaction. You're just breaking it up in little pieces, now, but that's not removing the subjectivity, merely obfuscating it. Their judgement will /still/ be largely affected by their culture and expectations. It will still be biased towards things they understand and can relate to.

Of course, you can implement this system. It's what review sites do, after all, though more sophisticated. It will probably also give a good measure of something like the probability of a certain work gaining acclaim and success in the current culture - which /is/ a well defined quantity. But that's not a measure of the "quality" of art. It's merely a market research. The fundamental problem is that the "quality" of art is an ill-defined quantity; it doesn't mean anything at all! Everyone is going to have their own sense of what it is, that's what makes it impossible to measure objectively. Basically, it's like asking "give me a number for the mass of the proton" without specifying the unit of measure. I can say "43" and be right by definition, because in my system, I'm using units of mass that are each 1/43 of the mass of the proton.

Also, remember that the original post was about intelligence or skill of the authors themselves. But intelligence or skill do not correlate directly with your metric unless an artist sets out /specifically/ with the goal of being a crowd pleaser, in which case, sure, they'll maximise your metric to the greatest extent of their ability. But most artists don't set out to do that at all.

***************** At what point does it become a semantics discussion? To me it's measurable, humans can rate it and by their ratings we can fairly accurately tell it's quality as far as current human perceptions go.

If you think an average distribution of people isn't good enough to judge quality, then the test could be subdivided by level of education, specific degrees, income level etc. Then we could easily compare them and see if there are meaningful differences, what those are and decide whose opinions are the 'best' or most accurate.

An authors general intelligence level is, imho, very highly correlated to the quality of the content (s)he can produce. If you look at IQ research you'll see that in general it doesn't just apply to math or test scores, it tends to correlate to a lot of things we'd generally not expect like musical ability, language capacity, learning speed, painting ability etc.

You might say that then IQ doesn't measure intelligence, but then we get back to that semantics thing..

Intelligence may allow you to better achieve your objectives, but if your objective is not "produce a work of art that rates highly on the Fassina Scale of Art Quality", then it might rate very poorly even if the artist is perfectly satisfied with it and has achieved exactly what they set out to do.

But I think that is not just an exception, that is /regularly/ wrong. The most broadly appreciated movies - in terms of sheer numbers - are not high art movies, they're Marvel blockbusters. The most appreciated literature isn't Nobel Prize winning novels, it's stuff like Harry Potter. When it comes to the history of art, it's absolutely full of creators now considered geniuses who in their time were met with sneer or were ignored as too obscure or weird for the common taste. So either you make a serious argument that Harry Potter is a better novel than Joyce's Ulysses or even Dante's Divine Comedy (after all, today, more people read it and like it), or you decide to hand pick your jury, which is just an oblique way of putting your own bias and spin on the evaluation.

********************* That's what rating individual parts is supposed to fix. The plot in a marvel movie is likely simple and shallow so it'd get a low score on that, which would bring it's overhaul score down. Characterization isn't particularly strong either..

But yes no measurement is perfect or 100% accurate. The point of that silly measurement method was to show that quality is measurable, and comparable. You just did it. Accepting that means it can be quantified and measured, and that it'd likely follow some logical distribution formula.

We could with enough interest find a proper highly accurate method for measuring quality of art, but it's not really something to be done in a short comment.

I would be really curious to see what that looks like.

In the end, I see it as a foundational problem. "Measurement" always implies comparison of something to something else. If you are trying to measure a length, you are saying how that quantity compares to some standard - be it a platinum-iridium alloy bar stored at Sévres or the distance that light travels in the time it takes for half of a bunch of excited cesium nuclei to decay in your rest frame, it doesn't matter. It's a standard. Nature is one, and you are always comparing your results with nature. Because nature is consistent and singular, that provides an absolute reference.

Art is a human construct, made by humans, for humans. To nature, art is nothing; there is no special property in the pattern of atoms that make up a copy of "To Kill A Mockingbird" compared to the pattern that make up a copy of "Twilight". If there was, we'd have something like magic, where human words and symbols can summon up natural effects. To understand art, it takes a human. If you do pick a certain human, at a certain moment in their life, then certainly the amount of enjoyment or stimulation they would get from certain works of art should have a definite ranking. But even then, the measurement difficulties are intrinsic to the process; if you wanted to compare two works, A and B, reading A first would change the human, and thus affect their interpretation of B; vice versa if you had them read B before A. This sort of error is implicit in the process itself; to have even the same human in the same state rate two different works of art is a counterfactual. But admittedly similar problems exist with a lot of natural experiments too, so we can at least go and assume that reading them in sequence is a decent approximation.

But if you start trying to decree an /absolute/ value, then all this breaks down. Because unless you can give a good reason to explain why some humans are more special or better than others at defining this, any sort of ranking system, no matter how contrived, will still depend on /some/ degree of subjectivity. And while an average taken over the entirety of humanity is theoretically possible, if unfeasible, and could be replaced by a well enough chosen statistical sample, when it comes to comparing present and past works (and thus the skill of present and past artists), we can't even do that; the relevant information has been lost as everyone from that time is now dead and dust. To me it feels like you were saying "well, Heisenberg's indetermination principle notwithstanding, all we need to do is to measure position and momentum with more precision!". You're failing to see how these quantities aren't just difficult to measure for practical reasons, they are /intrinsically/ impossible to measure together, because in practice you're asking the wrong question to begin with.

*********************** The problem to me seems to be how we define measurements, and how correct they have to be before they start being useful. I'd recommend checking out the book 'How to Measure Anything', at least the initial parts where he defines measurements. How surprisingly accurate and able to predict outcomes they are.

We'll never know some specific things from the past, unless some insane technological development happens, so we can either measure how people feel about it know and reduce the weight on the accuracy in those reviews or just add an addendum like 'measurements unavailable for it's contemporary audience'.

It's the best we're ever going to have, as far as we know. If we don't measure now people in the future will have the same problem with our art.

We don't need 100% accuracy to start with. Our measurement methods can be optimized as we go. Your view would be like physicists going 'oh there's uncertainty in quantum mechanics as far as we know with our current equipment. No point in studying it further, trying to measure it with better equipment or using different methods. Our measurements will not be perfect, so why bother'.

PS. Just last year scientists were able to measure quantum leaps and surprise, surprise! Matter doesn't just teleport, it transitions from one energetic state to another gradually. Our previous methods simple weren't able to see it happen.

PPS. I believe in the future quantum mechanics will lose a large percentage of it's apparent randomness.

************************ Quantum mechanics isn't the best example, but the point is that Heisenberg's principle isn't just a measurement error, it's intrinsic to the maths of the theory. In order to surpass it you'd need to find some sort of deeper, "more true" theory than quantum mechanics that completely goes beyond it. With QM as it is, it's as unavoidable as the speed limit c in relativity.

(by the way I agree on the correct interpretation of QM probably being deterministic, but again, unless we go beyond QM altogether that can only be accomplished by postulating hidden variables, and the indetermination remains)

But regardless of this, you keep talking about it as if it were a matter of just making measurements better, when my point was that the question itself is ill-defined. Particles governed by Schroedinger's equation don't have distinct position and momentum /because they're not little balls/, the kind of thing that would have distinct position and momentum. And works of art don't have an absolute worth independent of people /because they don't work like that/; what we rate when we rate art is the /experience/ it produces, and the experience emerges from the interaction between the object-art (the book, the movie, the picture) and the subject-person who takes it in and interprets it. For an extreme example: if I wrote a novel, then encrypted it with a would-take-multiple-times-the-age-of-the-universe-to-crack strong algorithm and threw away the decryption key, would that novel be good or bad? You couldn't possibly tell, because no one could read it. It would be functionally indistinguishable from a random string of symbols.

************************* We can measure human experience, there are entire scientific fields built around that fact. I don't see how the experience humans have from art can't be measured, it's surely been done before with music and other mediums.

There's no need to measure everything that could be considered art ever. There's going to be a cut off, maybe it's published works or finished works, but it's going to exist. If some piece of art can't be measured because it's been made inaccessible then it doesn't get measured. For a measurement to be useful it doesn't need to account for 100% of things.

#+begin_quote
  Information theory recognises that all data are inexact and statistical in nature. Thus the definition of measurement is: "A set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity."[20] This definition is implied in what scientists actually do when they measure something and report both the mean and statistics of the measurements. In practical terms, one begins with an initial guess as to the expected value of a quantity, and then, using various methods and instruments, reduces the uncertainty in the value. Note that in this view, unlike the positivist representational theory, all measurements are uncertain, so instead of assigning one value, a range of values is assigned to a measurement. This also implies that there is not a clear or neat distinction between estimation and measurement.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#Information_theory]]

The book I talked about goes more in depth but the wiki page does a decent job. The goal of a measurement isn't necessarily to get to a perfect map of reality, an approximation is enough if it gives you an advantage at making predictions of future outcomes.

By measuring you could for instance predict what type of audience would like something, or what would be best to consume given the fact that time is limited, what would be best to consume depending on what your current goal is, for instance when having a date, dinner party, or spending time with friends..

That's a big JP site for indie works. 400,000 novels over less than 2 decades is decent, although I'm assuming its counting the 95% of works that are unfinished in that number.

To be honest, I'm assuming the onslaught of trashy publishrd novels coming out of Asia is just a product of what media formats are popular rather than any inherent result of capacity for quality. I mean how many shitty reality tv shows come out in Western countries? Between the economies of scale factors and people growing comfortable with a particularly accessible media format and/or genre, I figure its just how the avenues for creators have ended up.

Also there's probably a larger audience for "western"/English stuff than any specific Asian country's works, because language barriers and internet access, meaning there's more accumulated energy, money and refinement thrown at the Western stuff. The more feedback on and resources in a medium/community the faster that medium/community can grow past awkwardness.

***** I believe the commercial incentives are definitely poison. And there isn't anything inherently bad about cliches, just /do something/ with them. Or the characters. It's honestly criminal to me that I'm The Main Character Of A Harem Manga, But I'm Gay So Every Day Is Hell For Me didn't get picked up for a year or two.

The reclusive safe space where nothing bad ever happens to the MC, the MC is special, and everybody loves everybody else and gets along just great... *that* is the core poison in their scene. 100% conflict aversion. I get that "sad" thoughts aren't the kind people like to dwell on...

It's just weird that I can't think of anything non-shonen that's a huge franchise with a protagonist-shaped ball of mayonnaise as its lead or zero conflict. Evangelion was supposed to be a deconstruction of these old tropes, decades ago. Madoka Magica is nothing *but* suffering. Konosuba's protagonist is a wonderfully accurate and realistic reflection of the fans that like this stuff, an actual caricature of a person who actually exists, rather than an imaginary mayonnaise person that could never exist.

The Korean scene seems more aligned with our tastes on the whole.

****** As an avid watcher of harem garbage I have to offer some small resistance.

The charm of the "turn of your mind" atmosphere of these stories is not actually that you get to turn off your mind. Its that you /mostly/ get to turn off your mind. See, the trick of doing harem garbage successfully isn't to throw women at your protagonist in an appropriately light-toned color pallette. Its to shrink the pace to such an imperceptible extent that the viewer barely notices that things are happening.

Take the recent /Hensuki: Are You Willing to Fall in Love With a Pervert, As Long As She`s a Cutie?/ anime. Its quintessential harem garbage, with an entire episode devoted to repetitive gags of the girls visiting the protagonist's home to have him pet one like a dog or be tied up by the other. You can just waste hours of your life adoring the simplicity of it all. And yet before you know it the story suddenly becomes a well-told romance for the side character Koharu. Its not so much that its new or exceptional as that, /in relative terms/ the shift is so effective that it takes you along with it. Its an art form to softly lead your reader or viewer to see your characters at what feels like an apex of their potential. Its even better if you can succeed at that balancing act of making something beautiful or astonishing seem perfectly normal and unserious.

I don't think its an isolated phenomena. /OreShura/ is a classic in this strain which ended with an unusually passionate harem route. There's /HxH/, which morphed from being the cringiest pseudo-hentai into a low-key meditation on Aine's soul. Of course some do it explicitly with semi-serious stories, like /Maburaho/ which takes a whiplash change of pace, but its the same idea- its one of the best I've seen.

*** Assuming this is more complex than the likely "Microphone in a boombox" scenario:

- A hopefully intuitive understanding of internal biases and motivations. I'm imagining something like Paul's sense of his desires in With This Ring after he becomes enlightened

- With practice, an easier way to change your mind with evidence; It might not make it easy, but if you have a ladle stuck in a drawn it'll be easier to get it out if you a glass countertop.

- In a scenario with more fictional powers, like subtle mind control or other telepaths, being able to recognize foreign interference would be a big bonus
