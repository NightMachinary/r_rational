Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I'm currently reading [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]]. I have read quite my share but I think it's the first time I encounter a bad guy from a story that genuinely terrifies me. Jack Slash at the end of arc 14 gave me nightmares, the sort where you are running from a nondescript threat with abject fear.

Then there is this tirade of him:

"According to studies, clinically depressed individuals have a more accurate grasp of reality than the average person. We tell ourselves lies and layer falsehoods and self-assurances over one another in order to cope with a world colored by pain and suffering. We put blinders on. If we lose that illusion, we crumble into depression or we crack and go mad. So perhaps I'm crazy, but only because I see things too clearly?"

It had haunted me long enough that I asked a friend about it who provided [[http://i.imgur.com/KTvPLZB.jpg][this]] and [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356869/][that]] and I got over it but damn. To have have a character go as far as forgo his humanity, completely instrumentalize it like him... Maybe I'm over-sensitive or too uncultured but I feel like it's some genius-level of writing.

**** Oh man I really wanted to read it, but I give up every time I start.

It's just so relentlessly negative, the first few chapters are nothing but pointless misery. Also it's not that well written(in my opinion), and I can't get over some character names. Bitch and Clockblocker, seriously?

Does it get better? Is it worth sticking with? Or is it just not my thing?

I really love the idea of rationalist superheroes though...

***** Those two names in particular made sense, I felt. Bitch because a bitch is literally a female dog, and her power literally screwed with her ability to read human body language and social mores, replacing them with canine ones. She thus thinks of herself as being a female dog, and doesn't really care about how human people think about it.

Clockblocker's an irreverant little shit who announced his name choice before he could be stopped like any annoying joker you probably remember from your school days would. It's a dumb name, and it's treated as a dumb name, but it's dumb deliberately.

***** In the story universe, the cape names are supposed to be representative of the characters' personalities. Characters who want to be edgy choose edgy names. From outside the story universe, it was written in 2010, and social sensibilities have changed a lot since then. Another example of the dated writing was one description of a female teacher with mannish-looking features, later edited out for being transphobic.

  Does it get better?
#+end_quote

The tone of "one step forward, two steps back" doesn't change. It's not a happy story, because it wants to be a "realistic" one. And if it brings you down to read about traumatized people suffering and making unoptimal decisions, this probably isn't the story for you. It also doesn't help that the relentless pacing keeps injecting new conflicts with every arc, as soon as the last conflict was resolved, because it's serialized fiction and the nature of the format requires every episode to have some sort of action or plot progression.

I found it pretty depressing in the end, and delved into the fanfic scene to cleanse my palate. Honestly, if you're still in and finding it hard to go on at the halfway point (arc 20-ish) it's worth pushing yourself to the end just for the fanfic.

******* 75% of fanfics replay the first 10 arcs with a different superpower, and don't use much, if anything, of the latter arcs. But it's generally recommended to finish the original novel because the whole premise of the setting hinges on a mystery that isn't explained until the end, but is treated like expected knowledge in just about every fanfic.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpXPrYhQUPC-ULuz4mqbe3HM0JunwWWPK9t9czWrTZ4/edit][Here's a compilation of popular "good" fics.]] The reviews seem pretty fair and the "must read" category is in line with what I'd recommend to first time readers, so I'd say to start there if you want to get into the fanfic scene.

** [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/rmji][Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality]] is a Xianxia novel. It avoids the majority of the problems that I have seen in other Xianxia novels. Ex. I think it avoids 1-3 and 7 from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b6py6a/the_irrationality_of_xianxia_settings_even_when/][this thread]]. It partially subverts 4 and has way less of 6 than I see in other Xianxia. It is still Xianxia so enter at your own risk.

The Good:

The MC is careful about taking risks and tries to start fights only with overdetermined outcomes despite how weird Xianxia combat is.

The MC has one ability to start with that would plausibly give a huge advantage and manages it carefully to give himself other advantages.

The progression seems more meaningful than in other Xianxia stories. There is a big difference in how the MC behaves at each stage of cultivation and the problems he is facing.

The MC's world changes and involves many characters besides the MC with different objectives who rationally pursue their objectives.

The same techniques return multiple times. Things acquired earlier in the story are never dropped or forgotten later on.

The Bad:

Strange coincidences happen, but not as much as they do in some other Xianxia. I think the way [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b6py6a/the_irrationality_of_xianxia_settings_even_when/ejmg1uv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][this comment]] puts it is a good way to look at it. The anthropic principle is in play and we are reading about the character that was successful.

This story is really really long, and I don't think the story will ever end. The Chinese version is way longer than the currently translated part which is already 1042 chapters. It will take huge amounts of your time to read.

Translated from Chinese with all the problems that come with a translated novel.

Weird sex based cultivation methods play a small part in the story, but a small amount is enough to annoy me. The romance is also one dimensional, though I'm not sure if it counts as romance anymore since the character is basically a thousand year old shut in at this point...

The MC is making rational use of an irrational magic system. The fire mcguffin aureate jujube has the heaven defying power to increase one's fire origin qi many times! The mysterious blah element qi sword passed down from martial ancestor has injured the lion hawk with its swordlight!

1. Every Xianxia novel protagonist ends up immortal, so it's not a spoiler if you know the genre.

2. You can be on a journey to somewhere and not reach it. It's a goal, and if this weren't Xianxia I'd have given it even odds that the protagonist pulls a Gilgamesh and doesn't actually succeed. (But it's Xianxia, so I'm sure they do.)

*** The last book that honestly did that to me is Worm, but obvious answer is obvious.

​

Enjoyed, but with reservations, mostly notably that it's hard to call it "rational": Tim Zahn's Quadrail series. I picked it up because I liked his Thrawn books. It's what happened when Tim Zahn said to a friend, "Hey, what if I wrote an old-fashioned railway mystery, but in space?" Then Tim's friend said, "But Tim, that would be stupid. You can't have trains in space." And Tim said, "Why not?" Instead of getting around space via spaceships, they use trains. Space trains. The books play it completely straight. Zahn had fun making up a mix of weird alien cultures, notably the giant warrior chipmunks, and if you can ignore the part where the fundamental conceit is stupid he did a good job keeping the rules consistent and having the characters work around them. There's a lot of fun window dressing, a strong sense of place.

​

Other drawbacks: the "mystery" in book three is no mystery at all, and the very end of the book five is pretty weak IMO. I still liked them well enough to go back and read again.

- The Handmaid's Tale - now a Hulu series, but the book is absolutely excellent. If you've been living under a rock, dystopian near future fiction. (I remember one night I started reading it before bed at about 1am, and read through to dawn because I just couldn't put it down).

- The Martian - everyone's heard of this now but if you haven't read it, it's a must-read for anyone here. If you've been living under a rock, someone is stranded alone on Mars and has to survive for a very long time with very limited resources.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] is the story that, many* years ago, convinced me that fanfiction can be as fun as, or even /more fun than/, traditionally-published fiction (rather than comprising nothing but a mixture of romantic fluff, power fantasy, and bad English in varying proportions). When I first discovered it (coincidentally, just a few days or weeks before its completion, IIRC), I read it voraciously on my dumbphone during high-school bus trips and lunch periods. Since then, I've read it five more times. If you aren't well-acquainted with /Naruto/, however, you may not be too interested in it.

**** The Vlad Taltos books are great. Strongly recommend publication order rather than chronological, especially for a first read-through.

The books have a bunch of variance and the author experiments more between them than a lot of genre fiction does. So if you don't particularly like one book in the series, that is actually perfectly fine and not surprising at all. For me, Teckla was a very painful novels for a few plot/theme-spoilery reasons; if you react similarly, know that the series doesn't particularly stick with Teckla's themes.

*** As a teenager (decades ago, alas) I found book #8 of the urban fantasy 'Anita Blake' series, titled Blue Moon, by Laurell K Hamilton. After reading it, I overnighted and read books #1 - #7, devouring all of them in about a day and a half, and was excited enough to try and call a friend about them, only to realize, whoops, it's 2am, sorry Mr my-friend's-dad. I can recommend the series up through book #9.

I should however note that you MUST, for your sanity, stop reading after book #9. The fact that books exist that claim to continue the series is a vicious, filthy lie to try to trick you into paying Hamilton for the privilege of reading torturous drivel overwhelmingly interspersed with porn. Somewhere along the way, Hamilton got divorced (I think it was around book 5?) and her first husband was her plotline editor. And after she hooked up with whoever (in whatever quantity) came next, she apparently decided that the plot was pointless compared to the main character sleeping with literally every other character in the series. Hamilton wrapped up the longest running plot of the series, somewhere in book 11 or 12, out of nowhere, in three paragraphs, very much 'just because', and then went back to having the MC sleep around. So.....just stop at book #9, Obsidian Butterfly, where there was still plot.
