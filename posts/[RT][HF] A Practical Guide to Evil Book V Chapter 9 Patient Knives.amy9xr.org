*** In norse mythology Mimir demanded Odin to sacrifice something if he wanted to drink from his well, and Odin proceeded to take his own eye and throw it into the well, so Mimir let him drink from it and obtain its wisdom.

This does fit with Cat keeping mutilating herself for power, but I /really/ hoped it would be Larat that ended up as Odin stand-in, if only so he could go hang already.

What evidence/facts do you think are being ignored? Genuinely curious here. I feel like the characters are making plans that are logical based on the information they know. Catherine's working with stale info, but that doesn't mean her planning isn't rational. She doesn't know Warlock is dead or Masego is missing. But her building a well at the end seems like it'll be used to scry, which will likely let her find these things out.

*** From the sidebar -

  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Check.

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Mostly. If hidden, it's only to add a setup for a later reveal. Unspoken plan guarantee and all.

#+begin_quote
  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
#+end_quote

Hard to say what constitutes an "intelligent" solution, but most of the book endings have taken characters in situations to their logical conclusion, which is pretty rational.

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

This applies more to /rationalist/ fiction which, yeah this story is not (though we do spend a majority of the story in Catherine's headspace).

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

Check.

Gotta call BS on this one. This was the case for a lot of the early part of the story, but lately there's a lot of "make up a new power to make the plot more interesting" and "the protagonist is exactly as tough as necessary to defeat the foe of the week".

??? Cat got her ass kicked by Sve Nok or however you spell it and only survived by /not fighting/. She never once beat the Gray Pilgrim or Saint of Swords in a fight, only by outmaneuvering them politically and with her army.

Also: "make up a new power to make the plot more interesting"

Are you referring to Night? The stuff that we talked about during half of the last book? Or Hierarch? The guy who's been foreshadowed and talked about for the last /two/?

**** I like the part where Cat completely dismisses the idea of being able to kill the Hierarch because he could mindfuck a bunch of peasants. That's the kind of rational writing I can get behind, "He controls the peasants, he's unkillable!!" and then I kind of just imagine Cat screaming incoherently.

He has is an involuntary conceptual Aspect, which has mass suggestion as a *passive effect*. What happens to someone who actually tries to impede him?

******* Cat is basically mortal without night, Hierarch's very presence interferes with the Goddesses empowering her, he has two unknown aspects, and is surrounded by 12 thousand soldiers and the population of a small city, all of which are basically being passively mind controlled by him, along with one of the most cagey named characters in the story, who has already helped cause the death of one of the calamities and thwarted Black. Yes, let's have the wicked foreign oligarch approach alone under a banner of truce and try to stab him. I'm sure that'll work well, on both a narrative and practical level.

#+end_quote

Inability? No, she is very well aware that she could kill him right then. If you deign to read the passage, however, you'll notice she thinks 'it won't end well for me'.

It'd be the exact opposite of rational for Cat to stab the Hierarch while surrounded by thousands of people in the throes of 'enact trials for crimes committed'-flavored madness. This isn't counting the enemy soldiers watching the proceedings, any one of which could punch a hole in Cat's freshly-mortal frame.
