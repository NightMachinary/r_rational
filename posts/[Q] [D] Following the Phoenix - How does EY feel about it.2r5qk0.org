Question's pretty self explanatory. Just was curious on how EY, HPMOR's writer, feels about Following the Phoenix, the fanfic of his fanfic. I'm not asking if he's offended or anything, I would assume he's not. But does anyone know about his opinions on its conclusions, its logic, etc.? Does he feel it's a good AU, that's logically derivative?

I was going to just message EY directly, but figured this may have come up already in a forum or a post that I'm unaware of, so i figured I'd try here first. And if EY reads this, and responds himself, all the better!


** I'm wondering if he's sort of adopting a policy of "no comment", since it's covering events he himself is currently writing. Maybe he's not even reading it for that reason, actually.

** honestly, it's been ok. ...but it feels like the entire story could be solved by harry and quirrel having a 10-minute conversation.

I mean, their /core/ goals seem to run parallel, or at least not contradictory. Harry wants to create immortality and, while we can't say for sure what quirrel wants, it's clear it has /something/ to do with changing the way government wants.

from either perspective, achieving eachother's goals in return for their goals being achieved is a good deal- quirrel was probably going to shoot for immortality anyway, or at least the possibility of /someone/ aiming to destroy death during his regime hadn't escaped him and harry knows that whatever gov. is put in place wont last forever.

that is, think of harry's perspective like burning every book of or relating to polisci in exchange for immortality- he'd be pretty surprised if we haven't written better polisci books than we burned in a thousand years or so, so even if quirrel's goals plunge them into the political dark ages, it's worth it.

the only real issue is methods- harry does and should disagree with quirrel's methods for acheiving his goals. but that's the thing- that's negotiable, quirrel doesn't care /how/ he changes the gov, only /that/ he changes the gov, and changing the gov. slightly slower in return for a large amount of assistance is worth (especially if your ally makes you immortal)

**** except this is supposed to be /rationalist/ fiction. if your characters aren't talking just because the plot requires them not to, you're not doing the rationalist genre right.

***** Sure. I would say that is a sin in any genre though. Would probably want to read or watch a rational chick flick.

But I still would not say the lack of discussion is just the plot needing it. Author not seeing the possibility is often likely. We really don't have that much rational fiction that there is no best practices yet.

Yes, if voldie would have explained to harry early on what he wanted, that could have been helpful. Lack of communication is just everywhere and it might be hard to do that right with no examples.

Edit: the talk should have happened in hpmor though, instead of ftp

*** I think Quirrel is just maximizing the chance that he, personally, lives happily forever. Rational Sociopathic Human vs. Rational Human. Harry's goal contradicts with his because getting /everyone/ immortal and happy has a higher risk of destroying the world than just getting Quirrel alone to be immortal and happy...which Quirrel has already pulled off fairly well as long as no one destroys the world.

(Living in the Pioneer floating through nothing does not count as "happily". Quirrel doesn't care about people suffering, but sociopaths are still social animals that require other humans for stimulation, comfort, and happiness.)

I agree though - there is a troubling lack of /negotiations/ here.

**** I disagree with your estimation of quirrel's goals: what would releasing all dementors do to prevent an extinction-level event? eventually lead to superior muggle control to prevent WMDs? why not just impiruse the muggle gov, then- it's not like they're guarding against it. and that action eventually led to a bunch of civilian rioters getting their hands on WMDs- hardly controling them

no, that action was, and most of his actions were, designed to create a political impact. to what point and purpose, I'm not sure yet. but the only thing I know for certain is it involves some form of government restructure- otherwise there was no point to almost everything he did.

It would lead to a war where Wizards started controlling muggles - a plan which went foul.

exactly- a large-scale political change. if his own security was his only concern, then this action did very little to benefit it, and what it did do is easily achievable through other means

now that's just blatantly untrue. in official HP, they only assigned an auror (and I repeat: AN auror. that is /one/ auror to protect the /prime minister/ against /voldemort's army/) to the british PM after voldemort rose to power. it's clear that they don't routinely protect muggle heads of state. in FTP, the PM having ministry of magic protection is never mentioned. the queen is given protection, but more as temporary protection suitable for an ambassador than strict, round-the-clock security.
