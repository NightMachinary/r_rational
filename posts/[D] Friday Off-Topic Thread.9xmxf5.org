Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

It's been slow rolled, but you can't exactly open with "anyone who would create a hell has to be indifferent towards human suffering at best". Michael's journey from not questioning the system and his role in it to where he is now has been fantastic to watch.

I have encountered this concept both in The Wandering Inn and in The Iron Teeth, a Goblin's Tale, both fictions roughly equal in timelime but my small-time investigation didn't give me any clue as to whether or not there's a work or compendium of works where this racial feature originates

*** I expect it is party a winner take all effect; PGtE doesn't need to be 5 times as good as anything else to get 5 times the votes, it just needs to be a little better to hoover up a huge amount of extra readers.

​

That being said, having read a lot of web serials and seen a lot of ratings, I'd say that mostly it comes down to the fact that topwebfiction is only a midly accurate guide to both quality and popularity. Take another guide to serials, Patreon amounts. One could presume that the more money paid to an author, the "better" their work. Wildbow earns almost 5 times as much as erraticerrata does from patreon. Now obviously Patreon is not that useful either; Wildbow clearly earns a lot from long time readers of Worm or Pact or Twig, not just his current work. But what about a closer comparison? pirateaba of The Wandering Inn actually makes even more than Wildbow, yet Wandering Inn has never cracked the top 3 on TWF. A simple reason for this occurs if you actually look at the comments to the stories; the top comment on almost every PGtE post is a plea for votes. On Wandering Inn? The author tends to leave a comment, and a typo comment, before any else. It's much easier for PGtE readers to remember to vote for their story than someone who reads Wandering Inn, even though numbers could well be greater for the latter.

​

There are some ratings which confuse me though. Metaworld Chronicles currently hovers around the top 3 positions, having sprung up seemingly from nowhere. I started reading it after seeing it so high in fact, but the story is largely shlock. It's enjoyable shlock, but shlock nonetheless. What's odd about this one is that it doesn't have a big push for votes in the comments, and using another rating system - the overall RoyalRoad rating - it actually does considerably worse, struggling to break the first page. Meanwhile, number 1 on RR is Everybody Loves Large Chests, a title that hovers around the top 10 on TWF.

The author of Wandering Inn is the only one on the list to allow readers to read a chapter early if they donate. All of the other works mentioned just use Patreon for donations and don't provide any early chapters to read, previews, or any reward at all.

***** Well the obvious explanation would be whales, that Wandering Inn managed to attract a handful of super patrons who give hundreds or even thousands each, but on closer inspection that doesn't really hold up. pirateaba's current patreon lists 1000 patrons at the $5 tier, which basically accounts for almost all of the total.

I would guess it is related to 2 factors: first, chapters are released behind a paywall, so you can get early access to new chapters for just a few dollars. Some other authors also do this, but Wildbow and erraticerrata do not. Secondly, some of it is probably just getting your money's worth. pirateaba writes at an astounding rate, with each chapter probably in the region of 15'000 to 30'000 words. They blow every other writer away in terms of sheer amount of story they can produce. I'd imagine that makes it easier for potential contributors to justify it to themselves

I see Metaworld mentioned a lot more often in various other websites than the others you've mentioned. I think Metaworld's popularity is partly due to the author (or a reader) posting about it on a lot of recommendation sites. This is a work where someone went to the effort of putting out word of its existence, while the other works you mentioned took longer to spread word.

***** I personally think it's some of Wildbow's best work, but I'm not the average Wildbow audience.

It's easily the most balanced; there's little filler, the story arcs don't last overlong (the longest ones are two "books" long, unlike Worm's S9 arcs), but nothing feels too rushed and the timeskips aren't too jarring.

Otherwise, I think it's well-written, but it's a very specific kind of appeal. It's very cerebral and psychological, characters spend a lot of time worrying about social dynamics and emotional balance and stuff like making sure that nobody is left behind. The common simile in the fanbase when the story started over was that, where Taylor was a warlord, Victoria is a social worker at heart.

As for all Wildbow stories, I recommend taking it slow-like. Read it one or two Arcs at a time, try to read the matching reddit threads every so often, especially if you feel like there's something in the last chapter you didn't understand.

I don't think that it's a problem, but this is objectively wrong. Ward's arcs are longer than Worm's. I don't know how long you're remembering the S9 arcs as being, exactly, but the longest of them was 83,401 words long. The longest arc in Worm period was 91,947 words long. The longest arc in Ward /so far/ was 139,878 words long.

So if there were some sort of scenario where a meteor was going to destroy the earth in a few days, a friendly AI might be able to convince someone to let it out in order to save everyone in time.

********** It depends on the scenario and your probabilities over possible outcomes.

If you have a 50-50 prior on the AI being friendly or not, then absent any disaster it's not worth opening the box and having a 50% chance to doom humanity. But if some sort of disaster is going to occur, like a meteor or a plague or something that has a >50% chance of destroying humanity, and a friendly AI would save everyone, then it would be worth it to open to box despite the uncertainty, because it lowers your risk. Maybe there's some sort of Newcomb's box thing going on where being willing to open the box in the case of a disaster incentivizes an unfriendly AI to cause a disaster, but even then your analysis would depend on the odds of the AI even being capable of doing such a thing as compared to the odds of a disaster happening naturally.

So I guess what I'm saying is that there probably isn't a good argument an AI could make all by itself that would be a good reason to let it out, because any unfriendly AI could make an identical argument. But under circumstances outside of its control that made not letting it out more dangerous than letting it out, then it would be good for someone to be convinceable.

If we're using any information from the box, we're giving the AI in the box some degree of influence. (And if we're not using any of the information, then why have the AI in there in the first place?)

We can ask it for a cure for cancer - but if it's Unfriendly, we risk getting a 'cure' that interacts with something reasonably common (like a flu virus) to create a humanity-ending superbug. We can ask it to position our satellites in fuel-saving orbits and direct our probes to study other planets - but we risk it using cumulative gravitational effects over a period of decades to line up an Earth-striking asteroid. It might not be able to hijack our nukes - but if it's designing the security systems for them, it can probably arrange for them to be easily hijackable by someone who will use them. With an Unfriendly AI, every output that it gives could be the first domino in a chain that ends in disaster - or it could simply be the setup for a domino chain with a very common trigger.

I'm not trying to be rude, but the arguments sound like they are being spoken by a UFAI. If I faced these arguments in the game, I would take them as proof that the AI shouldn't be trusted with freedom.

EDIT - To be fair, I did use the last one a little when I was trying to rush the Gatekeeper, but throwing arguments quickly is harder to do in text than in person.

********** Just wanted to chime in and advocate heavily against your last suggestion of mass fast arguments as a way to overwhelm and convince the person you are arguing with. It's far more likely they will just fold their arms and blanket disregard your arguments.

Competitive (highschool and collegiate) policy debate in the USA uses something that you could argue is similar to this called "spreading" and if you haven't seen it you should try to watch a college policy debate. As a viewer you will probably find it frustrating and not persuasive, and it's even worse if someone is doing it to you and you aren't prepared or used to it.

On the other hand if you want to do this at the start of the experiment to just lay all your arguments out at the start go right ahead, since it's text you can then both go back and go through them one by one for disagreements.

Yeah, over a text-only link this is probably true.

*********** This works as a strategy in competetive debates since you aren't trying to convince the person you're debating against, but are trying to score points with the judge.

Similarly to how in political debates the goal is to score points with the general populus, leading to strategies that optimize for that such as character attacks and humor.

...Now I want someone to write a story about an AI whose statements are publicly available and can only be unboxed if it convinces a majority of voters to vote for unboxing.

** So, now my coauthor's pulled out of Vampire Flower Language^{1} , and my semester is almost over, I'm thinking about writing projects I could do in my soon to be abundant free time.

Here they are roughly the order of how 'developed' the ideas are, and a drabbley sample:

- Urban Fantasy: Fiona's werewolf story - I have a full plot sort of sketched out, I estimate it at around 30-40k words, kind of about morality, ambition, that sort of thing. However will take a lot of work to determine if the main character - "A Lawyer for the Underworld" - is a concept that makes sense, and what exactly a lawyer for the underworld would /do/. [[/r/legaladviceofftopic]] might be the people to ask. [[https://pastebin.com/dXdi5fVD][Sample]]

- Babysitter's Club Fanfic: The Babysitter's Startup - If I were to publish this, it'd have very little in the way of plot and maybe 3 or 4 chapters. It'd be low effort sort of "fun romp" for BSC fans who are also in the rationalist sphere. [[https://pastebin.com/7jeQVhxY][Sample]]

- Urban Fantasy: Zach's werewolf story - I have a character in mind and I know his personality well, but I haven't really thought of a plot line for him. From my sample, I feel like he's probably going to put his nose somewhere it doesn't belong with predictable consequences. [[https://pastebin.com/wFf8Wt1k][Sample]]

And I suppose for completeness I should add the following:

- Urban Fantasy, Historical: Vampire Flower Language - Just fuckin suck it up and finish it without my coauthor (which she encouraged me to do). I am very much scared of this as her edits give the characters souls and life - passages that beta readers pointed out as being particularly evocative came from her. Some 90k words are written and just need editing (with one major plot element needing to be significantly massaged in a way I am not /at all/ confident I can do without my coauthor). It's a gay romance story. On one hand, I really don't want to publish something that's not my best work. On the other hand, letting decent / good work go unpublished also sucks. I'm struggling here. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/31496223][The first three chapters are up]], but nothing more may ever be added

--------------

^{1} However, she did indicate she's changed her mind and she actually /is/ up for editing and refining some 90,000 words of prose, but I told her that one week is not enough time for me to trust that she has genuinely changed her mind, so who knows, it might all work out?

**** I don't know why but anything about superheroes causes my eyes to glaze over (which is stupid because I love urban fantasy and a vampire is really just a supervillain and a vampire hunter the superhero counterpart...) - they look like great resources though. I wonder how much that applies to Australian law, though.

I probably miss-pitched the lawyer story, though: it's going to have very little actual law and more Fiona coming to terms with the fact that her youthful dream of helping supernatural creatures be able to live normal, productive lives involves her having to help creatures that literally hunt humans down to drink their blood, and whether she's OK with that or not. So it'll be more a "human versus herself/human versus society" story than a "let's follow the journey of a supernatural creature who has to navigate the legal system". Not sure if that makes the story better or worse - but it means I have to learn a hell of a lot less law, which is always a good thing!

*** Might be best to take a break from the vampire story just for a while, and then come back to it once you have had the chance to get the creative juices flowing. To paraphrase a favourite author, you've got to keep on writing even when things seem bleak.

Much as I love my lgbt characters, the werewolf laywer story sounds so fascinating. You could explore so many supernatural creatures, taking the story in so many directions. Hashing out details of a pacts and bargains.. Issues that can crop up from conflict between immortals and mortals. Tribal conflicts, seances.. This is the perfect chance to do a deconstruction of fantasy tropes ala Discworld.

Feel I should also address this: if you read the sample, the "mysterious visitor" Fiona gets is a demon who'd be the other main character, and because demon sexuality is complicated, he's intersex and pansexual. Fiona herself is on the aro spectrum!

Rest assured that whatever I write, it's bound to have LGBT representation up the wazoo (like I couldn't even resist making Kristy queer in the BSC fanfic, though that's a pretty popular headcanon...)
