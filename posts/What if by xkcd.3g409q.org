** I guess this blows away that Poul Anderson (I think) story where a spaceship saves itself by reaching the level it floats in a gas-giant atmosphere.

I only recall one line in the story now, /"Like a bubble in a densitometer, the <name of ship> floated"/. Utterly ungoogle-able. Anyone remember this one?

That's a short story collection. What was the name of the particular story?

***** /Brake/.

I found a pdf of the book [[http://whatcanimake.noip.me:8000/mike/secdir/books/scifi/pdf/Poul%20Anderson/Poul%20Anderson%20-%20Cold%20Victory.pdf][here]].

****** Thanks!

Edit: and I found a typo in the very sentence that I was looking for:

#+begin_quote
  Like an old drop in a densitometer, like a free balloon over eighteenth-century France, like a small defiant bubble in the sky, the “Thunderbolt” floated.
#+end_quote

Should be "oil drop".

[obviously my memory compacted the sentence since I first read it]

******* The PDF is an OCR of the book. There are a lot of "typos" switching "i" for "l" and vice versa, and some o/a and some e/c as well.

*** It could still work so long as the spaceship was many, many times stronger and less meltable than a submarine. Being less dense would help too.

**** It was definitely less dense, particularly after they stripped it of all unnecessary mass to pull the trick off. It helps that it was made of improbably strong materials.

*** There are a few stories where ships descend into Jupiter's atmosphere and float with hot-hydrogen balloons before lifting back off using rockets.

** I love the what-if posts but Randall has clearly taken on more than he can chew since the update schedule has gotten completely bonkers. Even after a several month hiatus, he is apparently not doing regular weekly posts anymore.

I realize that as a consumer of his products (and one who doesn't even pay at that!) I have very little right to complain about scheduling, but I honestly wish he would go to a less frequent but more regular schedule.

All that being said, perhaps one of the best comics for rational fiction type stuff.

*** I'm not sure it's quite /fiction/, but this seems like a case to apply the spirit instead of the letter of the rules!
