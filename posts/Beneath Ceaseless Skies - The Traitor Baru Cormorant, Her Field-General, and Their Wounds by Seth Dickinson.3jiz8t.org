** I will upvote just about anything by Seth Dickinson, and this is one of his best works. IMHO, everyone should read it.

That being said, I don't know if this qualifies as a Rationalist fiction. It's really good, and it's written by a Rationalist author, but I'm not sure if that's enough to qualify? Can anyone else give opinions on why this would/wouldn't could as Rationalist, as opposed to just "smart" and "good"?

*** It's not Rationalist Fiction. Just Rational Fiction as defined in the sidebar.
