I'm currently working on a new draft of my story [[http://flickegon.wordpress.com/decagon/][Decagon]]. I have the first two chapters done, and intend to have the third chapter done before my planned posting date of the first chapter (this Sunday).

I already have a basic beta reader, who helps me in polishing the writing, but he is neither rational nor scientifically knowledgeable (sorry, [[/u/roosterhelmet]]). What I'm seeking now is a rational!beta reader (who doesn't necessarily have to be a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1w4llw/by_request_two_kinds_of_involved_responses_to/][Wise Reader]], though that would of course be appreciated), someone who is more scientifically and rationally knowledgeable than I am, to point out the flaws and inconsistencies in the story.

Note: I've read some of the Sequences (How To Actually Change Your Mind, A Human's Guide to Words, Map and Territory, Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions, and I'm making more progress in the rest as time goes along). Also, I have a better-than-average knowledge of the more scientific fields (that is, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and computer science), but nowhere near as much as quite a few people on this subreddit, I'm willing to bet.

Note:^{2} I'm taking all help that I can get, so if anyone wants to help me in any way (you don't have to be a rational!beta reader, or even a Wise Reader), I would appreciate it.

Note:^{3} If you want to be a rational!beta reader, either comment or send me a message, and I'll send you the file.

Note:^{4} A few people have volunteered now, but I'm still accepting help. Even if you just want to read it early, as long as you're willing to offer critique, I'm willing to take the help.

** I'm willing to help with scientific knowledge, particularly mathematics and computer science since I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in math. I don't know how well I can help with being a rational reader though. I've mostly read LessWrong sequences on How to Actually Change Your Mind and a lot of rational fiction and have some limited experience in being a Wise Reader.

Note: I'm not certain how much knowledge of mathematics or computer science is going to be required for the early parts, though it will be more useful later on (because plot reasons!).

Note: I'm kind of caught up with some tests and stuff in real life, but as soon as I finish up the rather tremendous amount of stuff I have going on, I'm intending to finish up chapter three, and edit chapter two, neither of which should take me long. So, just keep that in mind while reading.
