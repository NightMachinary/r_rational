** Thank you everyone for reading along so far! I'm blown away by all the attention and feedback this story is getting. As a little extra thank you (and because I'm getting too far ahead in the reserve chapters), here is an extra chapter for your Tuesday update!

Also, here are Haley's monster stats for Chapters 1-6. Obviously it would have helped if I'd had these out for CH 1, buuuut better late than never: [[https://urlzs.com/cKgh5]]

Final Also, this story now has a royalroad page, if you prefer to read it on there. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24751/marriage-and-monsters-an-eschatological-romance]]

*** You've overestimated Toughness, It's 1HP/HD, 3 at 1st and 1 more at each HD from 4+.

If you're going with PC equivalent HD, she should have 12 HP for her first HD, 7 for each of the other 7 (49) or 61+24 (2/HD for Con, 1/HD for Toughness) for 85 total.

**** Oof, I should have read that much more closely. Luckily it was balanced out by the terrible dice rolls I made! I'll correct with your suggestion- I'm /sure/ there won't be any situation later where she's hanging by a thread later and 1hp less is the difference between life or death, right?

Right?

*** Question. The girl in the asylum, she's a Keter-grade Alice? Or evil FiM EqG Screwball, she creates monsters, or just lets them out of her own imagination?

Why is there a Stranger effect on the rabbit?

**** One of many questions I do not have answers to. I can't even decide whose side the animals are on, or whether I think Not-Alice is a schizophrenic whose delusions are loose upon the world or a receptor/vector for some truly bizarre shit that has always been around just at the edges of our vision.

** Neat story so far. I like the latest twist a fair bit.

The next named category of d20PF Gold Dragon ("Very Young") comes with Change Shape, so presumably Haley will be able to turn into 'any animal or humanoid' 3x per day (indefinite duration each time). Being able to spend time as, well, her former self, should do wonders for the whole metamorphosis body horror thing and associated problems. Even if she spends a lot of time as a dragon, just /having the ability/ to do otherwise would reassure the heck out of me in the same situation.

*** From the looks of the rules:

"A creature cannot change shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. This ability functions as a /polymorph/ spell, the type of which is listed in the creature's description, but the creature does not adjust its ability scores (although it gains any other abilities of the creature it mimics)."

she'll only be able to change to her original shape until she's a young adult, at which point she'll be size category Huge. By Sean's estimate, that should only take just over a week or so. Good luck finding clothes in size giant! I can already see the looks in the tailors' eyes.

Dragons can explicitly change shape into human ignoring the size limitations of change shape. Generic change shape has your limitation; it's modified on the dragon's stat page.

** I'm curious on the inspiration for the infomorphs. I'd love it if we can get some more details on how their civilizations worked back in their world. Just the thought of it is quite delicious.

Haha "wait, was she mentally calculating in Pathfinder units?" Haley has a narrator now? At first I thought she was thinking to herself, but then realized the thoughts are in third person; maybe she has a habit of thinking of herself in third-person?... nope, now I'm reading this story in a Michael Kramer voice and it's all narrator-Haley's fault.
