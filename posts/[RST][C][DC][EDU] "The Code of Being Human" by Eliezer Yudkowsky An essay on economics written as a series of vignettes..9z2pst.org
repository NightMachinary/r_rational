(Incidentally, I had thought that the term Nice Guy was used for the pitiful-but-blameless male behaviour, and then was later appropriated for the bad/easily-criminal male behaviour for which it can only be used sarcastically (in reference to the actually-not-doing-anything-criminal pitiful-but-blameless male behaviour.)

​

I reflect that in V, a comparison is made with a fictional character who involuntarily because able to provide utility for that character's partner; the significance of the involuntary nature of that doesn't seem to be pointed out for that example. That is, the morality/ethicality of someone who leaves someone when something significant is forever lost (akin to a fairweather-friend or not-a-friend-in-need) versus someone who leaves someone when something significant is withheld.

Edit: I just realised to my amusement that this (the linked text) serves as a direct rebuttal of people who express dismay at spouses who are dismayed when their spouse uses that spouse's life insurance plan to pay for a cryonics plan instead. (For instance, "No! I'm not marrying you in the hope that you'll die and I'll get your life insurance! But the understanding was that if you die early, the life insurance would be insurance for when there's less income and more difficulty marrying again, and now this is being unilaterally changed!")

Second edit: A line of thought I had forgotten, a little silly: "Actually, all this time the barista across the road has been selling coffee for $1 a cup. So, we can hypothesise that your customers valued your conversations at greater than or equal than $3 and less than $4."

** (Copying one of my comments from there, in case anyone wants to discuss further)

Great essay. One possible faultline is that the carefully constructed examples do not map onto common experiences all that well, and thus the actual takeaway that people might try to apply to their lives ends up looking very different.

The examples of the coffee seller and professor are specifically designed to make them seem unreasonable in their strange expectation and lack of understanding of social norms. I understand that they're there to make a point, but their actual equivalent is a prostitute who offers friendship and companionship rather than sex... and oddly enough, she would probably NOT get 0 customers/students once she explicitly reneged on the expectations of her previous relationships with others. And I think it's important to consider why that is.

The rich guy is made somewhat less ridiculous, but there is a completely non-ridiculous version of him who /can/ exist: the one who stops spending money on his dates /for a romantic goal,/ rather than to just save money.

The obvious goal that's most likely is to find women who care about him rather than the rich lifestyle. In which case, seeing which girls stop dating him without the expensive dates is /exactly what he wants,/ and if he still feels upset about girls he was hoping would keep dating him stopping, that conversation would look very different.

The harem girl is much more aligned with this rich man than the one presented in the essay. What both are seeking is /mutual value/ from their relationships, for /equals./ If not in literal socioeconomic/sexual terms, than in expectation of the value of their worth as an individual, rather than their value as dispensers of coffee/credits/money/sex.

And as an expectation in society, for most people's actual experiences and lives, that's not just rose-tinted goggles or naivety. That's a valuable thing to be on the lookout for.

The rich man may someday not be as rich. He may in fact be much better served if he restricts his dating to women who fall for him before he shows off his wealth.

The harem girl may someday not be as attractive. She may in fact be much better served if she restricts her time to guys who care about her primarily as a friend.

For the vast majority of people, who cannot in fact try to downgrade a harem of sexual relationships into just friendships because they do not have a harem, or who do not get to choose between partners who want rich lifestyles and those who are okay with non-rich lifestyles because they are not rich, these dating preferences and expectations are in fact far more symmetrical and justified.

What the essay wants them to understand is that everyone's time and energy and opportunity and demand and preferences are not equal, and thus people should just seek what makes them happy and not be blamed for trying to optimize their interactions with others toward the best possible outcome for themselves.

But I would argue that in many cases, the people who believe that is what they are doing by seeking only-friendships-that-result-in-sex or only-relationships-that-afford-rich-lifestyles is in fact to their own self-detriment. They are seeking what they believe will make them happy, but realistically, they often fail, and make others unhappy along the way.

Transhumanism may be an /ideal/ answer to this problem, but I would assert that it is not the only one. People can in fact shift their values and understanding of themselves and their preferences to better align with a happiness that is achievable rather than a happiness that is, to avoid using any words that have negative connotations, simply unlikely.

** (Copying one of my comments from there, in case anyone wants to discuss further)

I also want to focus on the aspect of asymmetrical expectations here, because I suspect that any kind of virtue that might exists in this space might only exist from non-hypocritical expectations.

As of now, the reason there is so much angst in this area is that there are two different sets of expectations.

Guys will often approach girls that they want to date specifically to try to date them, and they understand that they have a better chance if they build up to that and explore a friendship first rather than simply asking out of nowhere. They do not wear Raikoth beads around their neck expressing that they are Single and Looking and Not Interested in Friendships Without Sex At the Moment, but I would argue that even if such beads existed, they would not likely wear that third one. It would be to their own detriment to do so unless society has evolved quite a bit further than the one we live in.

(I would like to note that while I've known many men to use the rationale of not being able to budget all the time and effort it would take to stay friends with every girl they have ever wanted to date, somehow I've never heard the cost of obtaining new male friends considered in quite the same way by most guys who argue this)

Girls on the other hand are often approached by guys who are signalling friendship, and then turn out to often only be interested in romantic relationships. There is not much that girls can do to avoid the loss of budding friendships that result from this, and the pain that results form that, other than to harden their hearts and become so cynical that any guy who approaches them in a friendly way is suspect of only wanting sex. Which is exactly what we see often happen. Even if the Raikoth beads existed, they would not actually be able to ward off such heartache by wearing a bead that said Not Single (some, perhaps, but not all: many guys will continue pursuing women even if they are expressly in a monogamous relationship). At best, they would need a bead that said Not Interested in Dating Anyone Who Does Not Commit to a Genuine Friendship First... but even this is flawed, because there is no way to accurately gauge what qualifies ahead of time. It's built on feelings that everyone will have a different standard and expectation of.

This is an asymmetric arena. There is no clean and perfect answer here, but there are worst-case scenarios that we would all probably like to see less of.

On the guy side, the commonly bad outcome will be those guys who do not just expect sex from women they put "friendship time/energy" into, but who then /blame the women/ for "friendzoning" them, insisting that they are "nice guys" and thus deserve better than just friendship.

On the girl side, the bad outcome will be to blame not just the above guys for "sexzoning" them, but to blame all guys for "just wanting sex."

The best avenue of attack to reduce both of these bad outcomes is to apply energy to educating men and women who express these stereotypes (or any people of any gender who apply either of them), but I would posit as a prediction is that you will see a 70%+ reduction in use of the phrase "Nice Guy" as a pejorative if the male behavior is what is reduced first and faster.

(I find the comparison of "people calling blameless men Nice Guys" to "people who laugh at the homeless" totally missing the point, by the way: yes, such cartoonishly cruel people exist, but that is not how this dynamic evolved or what sustains it in the majority of cases I have seen on both sides)

The fairest possible world in light of all this seems to me to be one where we enforce the norms that guys and girls are allowed to break off friendships at any time for any reason without being shamed for it, but where we /do/ shame guys and girls who either blame girls for "friendzoning" or blame guys for seeking romance.

The potential asymmetry is that, as a natural consequence of this, women will end up being hurt far more than men will. If a girl who complains about guys not wanting to be friends with her without sex needs to better understand the transactional costs of spending time on friends who cannot offer sex vs those who can, then surely the symmetrical step is to help guys understand that girls who do not want to include sex in the friendship package that they were offered are not unreasonable... like, say, a coffeeshop owner who expects to be paid for conversation without coffee is unreasonable.

The coffee shop owner set an expectation, then broke it. The stereotypical male who strikes up a friendship then abandons it when they hear that the girl has a boyfriend also set an expectation, then broke it. I don't want them shamed just for that behavior, but I think it has to be acknowledged that that this behavior has implicit harm attached to it.

We should console guys who feel sad that they can't find a single girl who's interested in them (without blaming women), and console girls who lose friendships they thought were based on "actual" friendship (without blaming men)... but these two things will not necessarily feel equivalent to everyone. Unfortunately I can't think of anything better that retains empathy for everyone involved, the world being as broken as it is.

(feel free to swap male and female words at any point in this comment as needed, since these behaviors are not exclusive to men and women)

*** I understand why girls don't like it when guys don't want to stay friends after finding out the girl is not available/doesn't want to date them.

But at the same time, one thing I think nobody seems to mention in these kind of 'friendzone' arguments, is that sometimes it just isn't healthy to stay friends with someone you really, really want to date, if those feelings are never going to be reciprocated. I had to sit by and watch one of my friends pine over the same girl for years, and nothing about that relationship was healthy. The emotional imbalance there translated into some pretty weird dynamics, and I'm almost absolutely certain that my friend would have been better off, emotionally, if he'd just nipped the friendship in the bud, and came back when he had his head in the right place.

I don't think staying friends is a particularly good way to get over a crush. I'm not saying people should just ghost each other, because ghosting is a pretty shitty behavior (and by ghosting I mean choosing to just blatantly ignore messages/calls instead of bringing the relationship (friendly or romantic) to a close), but at the same time I think we can't ignore that, whether or not the friend-zone is anybody's fault, for many it is an emotional reality that can be quite shitty, and I actually thinking that just moving on from the friendship can be better for both parties in the long run. Or at least, just moving on would have been a lot better for my boy in the long run.

**** I definitely agree that not everyone is emotionally/mentally able to handle that sort of friendship. It was certainly hellish in many ways for me at 17 to deal with it.

I do think it made me a better person, though. Wiser, more emotionally stable, more capable of understanding myself and wants and needs, more empathetic toward others. It also basically burned away 90% of my ability to feel jealous. And I made a lifelong friend because of it (two actually, counting her current husband).

I think a lot of that has to do with actually falling in love with someone, not just having a crush on them or finding them attractive. For those "lesser" feelings it's less of an excuse, in my view, to say "Well it makes you feel bad, so you should just do what's easiest for you."

I want people to challenge themselves more, and go through emotional hardship more, and grow more from it. I think a lot of the immaturity and stunted feelings people develop are the result of not knowing how to handle situations like that, and that's a problem. But I know not everyone has the tools or help they need to do so, and so not everyone can do it and emerge out the other side better for it. I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to help with that, and all I've done on it is write parts of a self-help book related to it that I think isn't sufficient.
