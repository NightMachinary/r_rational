**** It's a type of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture][Culture]] ship. (Honestly, I meant GSV and misremembered.)

Background: Somebody had set their Flair to "The Culture" and somebody else had complained that flairs ought to be more specific, you couldn't just say "The Culture". Hence my flair. (Culture shipnames have a reputation for whimsy.)

** Uhhhhm, covering the arctis with trees to combat climate change sounds like an extraordinarily bad idea. Trees absorb so much sunlight/warmth that this would probably accelerate melting the ice.

If Ivy is already messing with algae just use the much larger available area+energy of the oceans.

Changing the albedo of the planet that much would definitely absorb more heat and melt the ice. Not just in the Arctic, either. Covering the Arctic in trees would in fact solve climate change, but not in the direction we would prefer.

Still, it would be in the direction /Ivy/ would prefer. She seems to have a thing for "kill all the people because they hurt plants."

**** The smart goal-directed characters generally do a good job taking advantage of the tools they have available to accomplish their goals, so I'd call it highly rational (perhaps not /perfectly/ so, but people are flawed so I don't mind a few exceptions). One of the few sci-fi settings where revolutionary new technology gets introduced in a particular plot and then later on becomes a basic part of the background for subsequent plots.
