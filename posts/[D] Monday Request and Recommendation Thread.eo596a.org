Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I want to recommend the game Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher. It's this weird indie game about moral philosophy (2-3 hours long) where you play as an accountant who is sent to the underworld where in order to return to life he has to debate a series of (real historical) philosophers about their theories. It's structured like Phoenix Wright where the gameplay consists primarily of dictating the conversation and questioning the moral philosophers. The cool thing about it is that the game uses applicable (though admittedly relatively low level) conversation strategies for productive debate like asking for backup or questioning the relevance of a point and having a credibility bar which decreases if you challenge the other party meaninglessly without good backup.

I'm not sure that it is fully rational but it most likes would qualify as rationalist

*** Interesting in the beginning, but got very frustrating towards the second half. At several points it felt like I was trying guess what the creator was thinking instead finding a valid counter-argument.

I know they can't think up every counter-point people could make, but at least there should have been some relevant text for the more coherent but incorrect argument combinations instead of the generic "your argument made no sense" text.

** I'd like to recommend 'The book of the Ancestors' trilogy by Mark Lawrence. Not necessarily rational but a really good example of great writing and worldbuilding.

​

The author is a master at showing not telling, his worldbuilding is incredible and very creative, the combat is fantastic and I'm really picky about this, and the plot is out of this world. A female main character that's very powerful but also very much not a Mary Sue..

​

There's not much I can say without spoiling things, but it's that kind of book that makes you want to tell your non reader friends about the worldbuilding and think in the shower about how to best explain it so they'll appreciate it as much as you do..

** Hi, I am looking for engaging or comedic (both would be great) story or fanfiction with believable character decisions and dialogue. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Looking for something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12642859/1/Guitar-Huntsman][Guitar Huntsman (RWBY)]], it's funny and the characters decisions, knowledge, and dialogue is believable. I also enjoy his other work, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12625131/1/The-Shield-of-Vale][The Shield of Vale]], and most of Coeur Al'Aran's fanficitons.

I also enjoy novels like: Lord of the Mysteries, Overlord (LN), The Second Coming of Gluttony.

The Main Character does not need to be male or human.

Thank you.

*** I'd recommend the /Gentleman Bastards/ series, which is about a gang of thieves in a renaissance Italy styled fantasy world performing various heists. The dialogue is exceptionally funny, although a bit coarse.

Some relevant excerpts:

"I'm sure we can communicate. I speak fluent hatchet."

"It was strange, how readily authority could be conjured with nothing but a bit of strutting jackassery."

“I suspect that drink has made you impulsive.“ “Drink makes me see funny; the gods made me impulsive.“

It's a restart story, so you can expect the common tropes. The world itself is interesting, some quirky characters, nothing extremely out of character yet that has taken me out of the experience, it also has some mystery for the reader to take some guesses at.

**** I tried out Irrelevant Jack, not a huge fan. The way he got to the game world was not my cup of tea, but that part is easily skimmed over. The side characters don't act in a realistic way (but that could be because they are NPCs) and the main character just holds the idiot ball throughout the whole book. The "romance" is bad, really bad. But reviews on goodreads seemed to be positive, so maybe it's just me.

I liked The City and the Dungeon better, but it became repetitive and lacked a plot to get me invested in the book. I stopped reading about 70% of the way through.

***** The side characters in Irrelevant Jack are literally NPCs (and I don't think that's a spoiler). The thing is that they /look/ human, so Jack assumes they're going to act like people - which is what causes a lot of friction in the first book.

Convincing them to be proactive and to treat their world as a place they can control is a major theme of the novels, especially once Jack gets his feet under him.

***** It's a xianxia novel written by an American author. Xianxia as a category is generally about achieving enlightenment through violence, with ever-escalating degrees of violence needing higher levels of enlightenment. Should a xianxia series go on for long enough, a main character will inevitably punch out Cthulhu (or some other deity level entity).

The entire genre bears a striking resemblance to LitRPGs, because the different levels of enlightenment are rigidly stratified and it's generally a bad idea to fight someone at a different "level" from yourself (because you'll definitely lose if they're higher, and fighting someone at a lower level is like punching a puppy)

Cradle, specifically, is one of the better xianxia series; the author has put a lot of thought into the basis of the various paths so every fight is different and makes a lot of sense. He's also spent some time deconstructing and reconstructing a world in which pretty much everyone is some sort of superhero, from the lowliest janitor to the local nobility.

*** I'm gonna be recommending litrpg-adjacent stuff, like progression fantasy, fantasy with stats, etc.

Reborn: Apocalypse is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid with lots of planning and action, although the planning is more like Death Note than Worth the Candle. Still, it's very addictive if you can get into it.

The Scourged Earth is like litrpg horror almost. There are stats but they don't mean much, and humanity is beset by space viruses, except these viruses can be hive-mind soldiers, literal fungus, space warping hands, giant redwood trees, etc. Great creature design and variety, and the plotlines are pretty consistent.

Defiance of the Fall is another litrpg/xianxia hybrid with a barbarian main character. It's pretty standard fare in terms of story but at least no one holds the idiot ball too much.

The Zombie Knight Saga has the undead fight amongst each other with elemental powers and science! Death is also only a small setback here, so you have battles where the actual people are broken piles of mush or dismembered torsos, just flitting around.

He Who Fights Against Monsters has pretty good humor, although I find the protagonist to be kinda asshole-ish. Pretty good.

*** Do you mind Book recommendations? As in, not webnovels. Because I got one or two that I liked:

Euphoria Online (Trilogy) and; Forever Fantasy Online (Another Trilogy)

They are both pretty decent.

Euphoria: A Hyper realistic D&D-Style VR Multiplayer RPG created by the world's first True AI. It costs thousands of dollars to log in for a week's session, but each week is 6 months time while in the game due to Time perception/dilation shenanigans. It includes a mode that players can choose called "Death March" which I'm sure you can guess what it entails.

Forever Fantasy Online: Another VR MMORPG, but this time shit turns /real/ real, with NPCs turning sapient, menus/HUD disappearing and death becoming permanent. The change happens while people are playing and things turn for the worse. In my opinion, it depicts MMOs and the people who play them more realistically than many other stories i've watched/read (looking at you SAO). From the way they talk to how shitty some gamers can be.

If nothing else, read FFO for the dude who played as a big-breasted Catgirl for the lulz and now has to deal with people creeping on him. It's quite fun.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/774088.Difficult_Conversations][Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most]]

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15014.Crucial_Conversations][Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High]]

Insights I remember (but can't tell the books apart):

Show that you understand:

- Listen and ask relevant questions.

- Always restate the other person point of view (better than they did if you can - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning][steelmanning]]).

Identify their goal (a coworker on the same project may have a different goal then a higher up) and frame you disagreement within it (as a way to achieve it).

Don't share judgements ("it's naive") but facts ("we tried it, it failed").

The goal is to have *learning conversations*, not disagreements.

I don't have a good *what* (reference) book. Buster Benson of the [[https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18][Cognitive bias cheat sheet]] (Medium warning, try [[https://busterbenson.com/piles/cognitive-biases/][his site]] or [[https://pocket-biases.glideapp.io][app]]) fame has a book out [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279111-why-are-we-yelling][Why Are We Yelling?: The Art of Productive Disagreement]] but I haven't read it yet.

Bonus:

- Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson on [[https://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erhanson/deceive.pdf][Are Disagreements Honest?]] (PDF) Spoiler: no ;P

- John Nerst tries to jump-start [[https://everythingstudies.com/2016/01/12/erisology/][Erisology]] - the study of disagreement.

***** Interesting, any idea why or what is a better way of showing that one understands?

Maybe it depends on how one does it (I'm assuming the other person wasn't angry/frustrated before restating). As Ozy observes in [[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-highest-form-of-disagreement/531597/][Against Steelmanning]] don't strawman someone's views only to use their actual views as a steelman and don't steelman without understanding their argument at all.

Steelmanning is hard, but I'm yet to make someone angry by honestly restating their views ("Help me understand, do you think that...").

Here is Daniel Dennett on [[https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/][How to Criticize with Kindness]] :

#+begin_quote

  1. You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way.

  2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).

  3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target.

  4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

****** What I perceive as a stronger version of the argument isn't always what others will. For example, I might replace emotional fluff with more functional but analogous claims, and be rebuffed for it. The impression of arrogance or putting words in someone else's mouth can also occur - even if no tricks based on wording are planned, trust in that may not exist.

Phrasing summaries as questions can somewhat mitigate the problem, but it risks the same failures. If they think you're treating their answers as obvious or perfunctory, they may be offended. If you use language that's either vague or overly particular in unanticipated ways, it can arouse suspicion. So genuine questions should be interleaved between confirmatory ones - but it's sometimes difficult to ask genuine questions without veering away from the main point, itself potentially irritating.

******* I agree with you!

I probably made (and will make) all those mistakes. Still, I never experienced people being angry because of it.

Maybe it works for me because I don't do it only when disagreeing with someone, but also when I want to understand them (make sure I do what they expect me to do, get to know them etc.)

Or perhaps some of the other techniques I mentioned (like having a learning conversation instead of a disagreement) offset the (potential) negative effect.

****** (edited for length) I'm sequestering my negative comments in a separate reply, so people can more easily ignore them.

I started Haidt but put it down when I noticed a blind spot in the moral disgust studies he conducted (the stories about eating roadkill, burning a flag, etc.). He claims that the farther away you get from educated liberal westerners, the more moral disgust separates from any rational moral basis (the example I remember is the widowed woman eating fish, which was considered disgusting in India). This seems to support the hypothesis either that either only western liberals are /really/ moral, or else that rational morality is a mirage, and there is no objective difference between what disgusts one culture and another.

I disagree with both analyses. I think the problem is that Haidt's team didn't write stories that would get them in trouble in academia, so they're missing the stories that would irrationally disgust educated westerners.

I also had a lot of trouble with Benson. "Why are We Yelling" ruined my day when I tried to read it, which is part of the reason I'm asking these questions now. The problem is that he seems to suggest that certain conversations are impossible until one side makes ritual obeisance to the values of the other (the side that Benson happens to agree with).

Which isn't to say that Benson's strategies aren't useful in and of themselves. Strategies (like Steelmanning) can be useful or not depending on what you do with them. Steven Covey ([[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People][The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]] - much recommended) calls them "surface techniques" which need moral principles behind them if they are to do good.

*** "High output management", maybe. He doesn't explain it explicitly, but more hints at it by explaining how he talks with his managers and acts in meetings. The most he gets into it is explaining that you mostly nudge people's views by explaining your point of view.

In this specific example I'd ask a question that implies the work isn't good enough without implying the person is to blame for it.

ex. A had to write an article, but it's too short, B asks: Was the research material we gathered not enough ? Could you maybe squeeze a couple thousand more words out of it or do we need to get more research material? I don't think X (authority figure, boss, audience etc) would be ok with us publishing it with this many words..

But hey read intel's CEOs book. The first chapter is gold, he'll explain how to run a massive manufacturing business using making breakfast as an analogy.

re: asking a questions the focus on the work rather than the author. That's VERY helpful! I do a lot of beta-reading/critiquing, and I'm always worried I'm pissing off the author when I say I don't like their work.

*** And here's a theory that I've evolved this past week: what if debate is the wrong way to approach disagreement? What if negotiation is better? Rather than say "here is why I think you should abandon your ideas and switch to mine" you say "here is what we need to do in order to work together."

Which suggests I should look up some books on negotiation...

If you'd be interested in sources other than books, Wikipedia actually has an assortment of helpful meta articles in their conduct guidelines for editors. As you might expect, the largest and longest running online collaborative project has amassed a wealth of experience with interpersonal conflict and disagreeing productively.

For example, here are few guidelines which have been helpful to me in the past:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith][Wikipedia:Assume good faith]]
