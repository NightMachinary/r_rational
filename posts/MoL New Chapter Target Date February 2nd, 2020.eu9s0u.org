Sorry for anyone who woke up today looking forward to reading the final chapters of /Mother of Learning/!

You will have to console yourself with the news that it's only one more week of waiting instead of another month.

Updated information coming from RoyalRoad page: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning]]

Statistically speaking, unlikely. But oh well, can't act entitled over a free awesome story..

** Update from Patreon:

*1 Week Delay*

I think I can say with some certainty now that I work better with a concrete target date as my goal... even if I don't actually meet it. My writing went a lot better than it did previously - the chapter that had been giving me a great deal of headaches is half-way done and I have a solid plan so there should hopefully be less rewrites and discarded sections.

My dear readers are doubtlessly less pleased than me with this result, since they still don't get any new chapters and I've delayed things yet again... but what can I say? I'm glad I have such a patient audience, willing to wait literal months for me to finally wrap up the story.

The new target date is *February 2nd*, one week from now.

** i don't mind him pushing the date forward, i just wish he'd do it before the date in question, like a week ago or as soon as he realized he would not hit the target date, it's the only thing that annoy me a bit.
