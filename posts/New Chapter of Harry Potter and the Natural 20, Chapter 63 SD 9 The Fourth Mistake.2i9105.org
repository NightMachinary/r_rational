** Huh. Out of all the HP fanfictions on here, this was the one I least expected to start detailing the underpinnings of HP magic. It always seemed to revel in being gratuitously nonsensical. I guess that's what happens when a story matures.

*** I particularly like Lucius musing on Ritual Magic, and the ups and downs of it. The fact a 17th Century bunch of people could use a artificial language in their spells before it was even invented is quite curious.

** It's great to have more story, but this chapter felt awfully short. Most of it was exposition and unnamed characters reading off secrets that aren't relevant to the story...Milo didn't even get a mention until most of the way through.

Ah well. There will be more soon, and I'm looking forward to it.

*** I agree that it was short, but I liked the exposition /a lot/, it was great buildup to what we have had coming for a few chapters. Also, it didn't feel as short as the previous ones because those ones felt like they cut the action unnecessarily, whereas here something important happened.

*** It appears to be a [[http://dndtools.eu/classes/rainbow-servant/][prestige class]]. I cannot recall it ever being mentioned before now, but I see people mentioning it in reviews and stuff way before this chapter. Perhaps he demonstrated Rainbow Servant abilities a while ago but it wasn't explicitly stated?

**** It hasn't been mentioned in the text before, but Sir Poley keeps an up to date character sheet online (the current version of which can be [[http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheetview.php?sheetid=1026861][found here]]).

**** It's a prestige class with a huge payoff. When he hits level 10 of the class (15 overall), he will add every single cleric spell to his spell list.

** If he is a Wizard (Conjurer) 5/Rainbow Servant 4, shouldn't he have an effective Wizard level of 7 and only just now become able to cast 4th-level spells?

*** Nope. As per the text of the class, "When a new rainbow servant level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class in which she could cast 3rd-level arcane spells before she added the prestige class." The table indicates otherwise, but that's a mistake--text takes precedence.

*** Check [[http://dndtools.eu/classes/rainbow-servant/][the link]] that [[/u/Zephyr1011]] posted earlier. Depends on whether the spells castable count as being part of "spells per day" and "spells known".

** Something that really should have occurred to me as soon as Riddle revealed his sabotage of Milo's Amulets of Protection from Evil: all of the Amulets from before Milo's possession are clean. He only needs to borrow one, keep the other person under heavy protection long enough to create another clean one, and then he's effectively safe even if Riddle can re-possess him.

Of course, with trust in Milo eroded, he might have a hard time convincing any of his party to let him borrow theirs, never mind the possibility that Riddle might actively interfere in this sot of thing from a distance.
