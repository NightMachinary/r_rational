I was really into that one, and the author just stopped updating after being very consistent. Anybody know what happened to the author?


** The final author's note says:

#+begin_quote
  Apologies for the long delay. Important Life Events (nothing bad!) have eaten a tremendous amount of my free time, and will continue to do so for the next month or so. Please enjoy this interlude in the mean time.
#+end_quote

Sounds like the author got bitten by optimism bias. Too bad, I'd enjoyed the story.

*** Yeah, I read that, but unfortunately that was in May of last year. I was wondering if anybody knew more or if it will ever get finished.

*** It does start off kind of slow, and I had the same trouble getting into it. The name changes bugged me.

Read chapters six and seven and maybe even eight before you give up on it. It turns out to be really, really, really clever. It's Harry Potter, but if arithmancy was the most important subject instead of never even explored at all. Magic is more blockchain and cryptography than incantations and wand waving.

For some reason, one of the things I really prize in fiction is the dawning realization that the author is smarter than me, and, as much as I'm mad that I didn't think of the cool, smart ideas myself, if I'm honest, I could never have come up with them on my own. So fiction that makes me jealous of the author's brain, I guess. This one really pays off in that department.

**** I ready eleven chapters into it and didn't get it. Like, yes, there's some interesting concepts but nothing to really sink my teeth into.
