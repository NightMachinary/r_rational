****** They probably flagged it as market research. Litrpg gets a ton of writers trying to cash in on the genre while it's still hot.

******** I don't want to be mean, but the OP for this post did start quite a few threads one after another, most of which have been deleted one after another, so it kinda was spam.

â€‹

But to answer your question about market research being bad -- it almost always is a fairly simple question that requires extensive answers. It ends up as the poster trying to get the community to do their work for them. OP's original post before it was deleted was essentially asking readers to structure the race selection scene in their story.

That's the writer's job, not something to be crowdsourced on the forums.

********* If it is asked for free and given for free I don't see the problem. The world-building and munchkinry threads both already allow people to do exactly this if worded smartly. Also, just getting help with the setting/premise doesn't make a book on its own. They still have to write a book that is actually good enough to make them money. And if they were planning on posting it online for free and live off of donations then there is even less of a problem. In fact if a story ends up being written based on stuff the community thought of and finds cool then that's a good thing.

********** Yeah, but what if I'm doing 6 polls about how people feel about bow-wielding protagonists vs sword wielding protagonists. Or asking, "how would you construct your defensive settlement given earth magic and 2 weeks to prepare for a goblin horde. Give me 20 bullet points in a step by step process please."

It quickly becomes overwhelming. In the early days of the LitRPG subreddit there were dozens of people doing that every day, and most of them clearly had never read a LitRPG book before, they were just looking to get people to tell them what would sell so they could cash in on the trend.

As a result, you end up with a large quantity of low-quality discussion that's poor for the overall health of the subreddit.

*********** Which is why I said "if it doesn't lead to spam". If someone keeps posting these type of posts or if multiple people post enough of them to fill up the front page then it's time to moderate.
