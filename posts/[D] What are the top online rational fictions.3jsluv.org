Hi, new to this subreddit, I came from [[/r/novelupdates]] where we mainly discuss Japanese/Chinese/Korean translated novels and the occasional original English novel written in the style, from there I found Worm and Mother of Learning, I found that the writer of mother of learning post in this subreddit, so I'm interested if I can find more in that style, so I would like to see a discussion of which webnovels are the best


** More than half of the stuff we discuss here is fanfiction.

You can always look at the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/top/][top by all time]] sort as a good place to see the sort of things we tend to upvote.

I personally really like the stuff by [[/u/alexanderwales]] especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]] (superman) and his ongoing work with the Shadows of the Limelight which he has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsOfTheLimelight/][subreddit]] for.

Scott Alexander's fiction, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/fiction/][on his blog]], is almost all really weird but really really good, and also short/self contained.

There tends to be a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction, because one of the works that inspired the creation of the subreddit in the first place - Eliezer Yudkowsky's [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]. HPMoR tends to be extremely polarizing (people either love it or hate it, almost never feel ambivalent) so it's worth a shot. If you liked the HPMoR idea of a genius going to Hogwarts but felt that HPMoR was too mean-spirited and Harry in it was unlikeable, I'd recommend out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]]. The single funniest thing that's been posted to the subreddit so far is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]["Seventh Horcrux"]] by EmeraldAshes.

*** I recommend the ratings at [[http://rationalreads.com/][RationalReads]]. "Top all-time" for small/new subreddits is not as useful, especially here where a single work can get a bunch of threads.

**** Also, "top all-time" will naturally favor newer entries, given that the subreddit has grown over time.

*** I'd like to note when I shared Seventh Horcrux, it was in an attempt to win some kind of argument about good vs rational I think. It's the kind of fanfiction I use as a counterexample when people say "wait, by rational fiction do you just mean good fiction?" because it's the best Harry Potter fanfiction, but also clearly irrational.

Clearly you need another read-through of Harry the Hufflepuff.

Seconding everything by Alexanderwales (Metropolitan Man is outstanding) and Seventh Horcrux. I'm on my fourth reread and it's as funny as the first time I read it.

Also, [[http://rationalreads.com/][Rational Reads]] is a great collection of rational works.

*** I just rfinished HPMoR, it was pretty good, (good enough for me to take 4 days to go back on reddit) but I think I'll take a break from ff, thanks for the recommendations though.

Edit: Goal-Oriented is the only other good one though.
