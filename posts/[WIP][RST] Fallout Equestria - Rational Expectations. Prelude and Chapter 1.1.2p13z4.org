** Yay! I loved your story when you posted the prologue at the beginning of RaNaNoWriMo. I can't wait to read more of it.

** Warning: ponies tag needed.

Also, is this seriously a version of my little pony where everyone's been killed by nuclear weapons? I appreciate irony as much as the next guy, but.../why/?

*** The same answer applies here as with all human undertakings. "Because we can."

*** Well it's actually a fanfic of a fanfic. The original fallout equestria is actually one of the most famous my little pony fanfics and a really good read (though quite dark in places). If you're a big fan of the fallout games and MLP you will probably really enjoy it.

**** Righto right here.

The original Fallout: Equestria is responsible for me getting into fanfiction in the first place. And while this story's universe is /mostly/ the same as the original's, it /is/ a separate one, working under my rules and with my characters. Sorta in the same way Methods is separate from HP Canon.

**** How readable is it to someone who doesn't know Fallout?

***** Well knowing FiM is the important thing as all the characters, locations and backstory (revealed through flashbacks) are from the show but many story elements are from fallout.

Basically, it's perfectly readable as you pick up most things nd it isn't particularly hard to figure out the concepts of "raider" and "slaver".

***** Very readable. I've never played any Fallout games, but I didn't have any trouble understanding it.

***** Fallout backstory: There was a really bad nuclear war, robots are everywhere but so are cowboys, huge yellow evil mutants exist, radiation zombies exist but some are nice. Some people were locked in Vaults shortly before the war to live out the apocalypse, the Vaults were often secretly social experiments that involved putting people into terrible situations.

That's not spoilers, it's the premise.

You should play New Vegas though :)

*** Maybe people just aren't interested in reading about the vanilla Fallout world that they've seen only in video games, and need the extra emotional tie to the setting that a crossover into some other medium provides? There are a few vanilla-Fallout stories on FanFiction.net ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/game/Fallout/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&len=40][285 with at least 40,000 words]]), but certainly none of them has gained a following comparable to /Fallout: Equestria/'s, and video games in general [[https://www.fanfiction.net/game/][have a lot fewer stories written about them]] than do settings in other media.

*** It's exactly that irony that propels the story. FO:E is entirely about virtues and adversity. It's also like 620,000 words long, tightly-paced, and holy crap does it keep its details straight. A worthy read.
