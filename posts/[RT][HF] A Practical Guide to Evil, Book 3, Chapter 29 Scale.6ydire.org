**** It seems like she can only Take one power at a time, and that only lasts until she Takes something else. Extremely powerful, but a mixed bag. Using it offensively here was a good idea, but she'll probably Take the next thing that comes along that is more advantageous, and doesn't clash with her Winter title.

***** Crazy thought, what if she Takes an aspect from [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/regard/][Ranger]]. Learn, Perfect, or Transcend I think Cat takes the last.

****** Maybe eventually? I wouldn't want to mess with any of the Calamities, especially the one that I'd have to first pick a fight with (thus being on the losing side of the story arc from the beginning), who is also the one who hunts fae nobles for sport.

******* I don't know, I'm thinking either it would be a critical moment that causes ranger to stumble and that's most of the narrative payoff for someone who is always using her powers. I agree it might be streaky or completely useless without the other powers.

********** If she "refrained from killing Praesi for sport more out of courtesy for Black than any real fondness", then I doubt she would break that prohibition by going after his handpicked protege.

At least not fatally so. It is possible that she got curious and decided to see what was up with Squire firsthand.

***** Also, the strength of an aspect seems to depend a lot on how favorable the circumstances were. When Taking Rise, it was after a well earned victory against the heavens and meant stealing a ressurection she was owed. That gave her months worth of an OP healing ability.

Here, though, it was Taken from a force that opposed her winter connection, while having no circumstantial or thematic connection asside from the old trope about turning someone's power against them. That didn't even get her one full use of the ability, though the portion she got was enough for the moment. Had she tried to Take preemptively, rather than wait until the climactic moment where the power was already in play, I doubt she would have gotten anything.

***** I know it's near impossible but if Cat managed to indoctrinate the white knight and Co I would be so happy.

Maybe the fact that the dread empress let diabolist use the weapon would push cat to the other side.

*** If I recall correctly, they are released Monday and Wednesday.

In fact

As quoted from the wordpress site; "Updates every Monday and Wednesday, as of the latest Patreon goal."

 

And I agree! It is a pleasantly rapidly updated story, especially when compared to others on the web.

** Cat's taken a beating but it seemed to be a worthwhile exchange. Masego and Archer are both going to be useful.

Predictions for next chapter:

1. Juniper will make an impact.

2. The knights will make more of an impact.

3. Summer will finish with Winter.
