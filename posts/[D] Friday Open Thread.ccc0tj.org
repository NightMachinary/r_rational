Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I'm almost halfway through Neal Stephenson's newest book Fall; Or, Dodge in Hell. (Marked spoilers are minor to medium.)

This book is reminding me of how much I enjoy Stephenson's tangents. The main storyline is about the main character being virtually simulated after his death, but I've been much more interested in the parts of the story about current and future social tech.

Early on in the book, a small town in Ohio gets nuked. Everyone freaks out until it comes out that it didn't actually happen. The town was DDOS'd and the supporting evidence was all faked. It uses that initial event to get into the idea of how it's hard to discern truth and lies on the Internet, and how in the near future it's going to get much harder than it already is.

He offers technical solutions to the above, as well as other related problems like privacy and Internet dogpiling. I don't necessarily think that some of them would actually work (if I can prove that this women wrote this code, the people calling her a fake will surely leave her alone). I think he does understand that though, there are sections on extreme conspiracy theorists and how no amount of evidence will change their minds.

But regardless of how effective his proposed tech would actually be, I still like reading about it, and I'm hoping it continues to show up in the story. I'm not sure if any of this will end up being relevant to the main plot or not, but I'm liking the book as a whole either way.

*** I'm only about a sixth of the way through. It's fun, and I'm cautiously optimistic that he's got the magic back after the disappointment I felt with DODO and the last third of Seveneves. And yes, much of the fun in Stephenson is in the bizarre, insightful, are-you-shitting-me tangents.

*** I've noticed that lots of people like to talk about how many words they can read per minute. Saw it happen on a thread on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] just yesterday, the OP and two commenters all claimed to read over 1,000 words per minute, with one of the commenters claiming to know someone who reads at 1,600wpm.

Here's the thing, though. Anything less than full comprehension isn't actually reading, it's skimming. The fovea is only as wide as it is, fixation lasts as long as it lasts, and saccades take as long as they take, so it isn't /physically/ possible to read with full comprehension much faster than 250wpm. 300wpm is /pushing it/. People who claim otherwise are deluding themselves - if you're "reading" at "600wpm" then you're only actually /seeing/ (and there's a difference between seeing and /seeing/) about half of the words, if that.

Each word influences the meaning of all the rest of the words. Reading should be done mindfully, every word heard in the mind's ear, and skimming only employed with text that describes a subject you're already familiar with.

What good does it do to /devour/ a book if you don't actually retain anything?

**** ehhh... i play podcasts on 2.5x speed and i admit i probably only get 80% of the value out of them, but I get to consume more than twice the content, so really I'm getting ~200% the value per minute. I don't think there's anything wrong with making a quality/quantity trade off in whichever direction you want, and I assume that's what the boasters are doing whether it's conscious or not.

I do agree that boasting about reading speeds is weird, though, in light of this. In fact it makes about as much sense as boasting how much you dial up your podcast listening dial, so I should probably scuttle off in shame right now :)

***** I used to do 1.25x for like "informational" stuff but now I do 1.5x for that stuff because I've found it doesn't affect comprehension for the most part (sometimes I'll rewind 30 seconds and drop it down to 1.25x if I feel like I'm not paying close enough attention). I've tried 1.75x but it's just too much, your brain really /needs/ at least a little bit of time to linger on the words to absorb them and connect them to the surrounding words. For the most part, I play everything else at the speed it was recorded. I like language. I like listening to people speak. I'm tired, it's 3:12am, I'm having a hard time doing words good.

By the by, Stanford's got a bunch of courses uploaded to youtube. I'm easing myself back into it with one a day, but after I finish this, like, I guess this /course/ then I'm going to start watching 3 videos a day, one each from three different courses, sort of like school. Just because I feel like my brain is rotting from having consumed too much crap content. I abruptly stopped watching television in 2010, and I might be about to do the same with youtube (not like all videos stored on youtube because youtube is wider than TV was, like youtube-specific content like lets plays and podcasts and whatever). 3:22 now, definitely no do words good. I took my valerian root pills like 4 hours ago, I should've done been in bed by now.

This is the one I'm watching now, I'm on episode 14.

That's not really true though - human language was developed for use while speaking, which is a lossy medium. Most colloquial speech is quite redundant. For instance, only the first sentence of this paragraph was necessary; the rest of it only exists to provide for a smoother segue into the next point.

If you're not reading something particularly dense with meaning (like, say, the majority of fanfic, which is what the people in [[/r/fanfiction]] are probably reading), you're fine only reading every other word.

**** Do you have a cite or the math behind how you arrived at that 250-300wpm? Looking at the average wpm given by the app I use for offline reading has me at almost 500wpm (across 1300 reading hours).

Now, I do skim sometimes, so I've assumed my reading speed was more like 350-400 on average. When I look at the stats after reading a book I know I've read more carefully [usually because it's denser] it's as low as 275wpm. On other books I know I've read without skimming but that are lighter fare it's usually more like 400.

The source for that particular claim is an excerpt from a book called Language at the Speed of Sight: How We Read, Why So Many Can't, and What Can Be Done About It by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Seidenberg][Mark Seidenberg]]:

[[https://www.wired.com/2017/01/make-resolution-read-speed-reading-wont-help/]]

The relevant chunk:

#+begin_quote
  Reading speed is obviously going to depend on factors such as readers' skills and goals and whether they are reading Richard Feynman's lectures on physics or TMZ.com. But let's just do some cold, hard calculations based on facts about the properties of eyes and texts.

  - About 7 to 8 letters are read clearly on each fixation.

  - Fixation durations average around 200 to 250 milliseconds (4 to 5 per second).

  - Words in most texts are about five letters long on average. 4 fixations per second = 240 fixations per minute

  - 240 fixations × 7 letters per fixation = 1,680 letters per minute

  - 1,680 letters/6 (five letters per word plus a space) = 280 words per minute

  The exact number of words per minute is far less important than the fact that this value cannot be greatly increased without seriously compromising comprehension.

The other source is a nice beefy 31 page article, which I would be willing to discuss if you took the time to read it:

You're probably skimming a lot more than you think you are, even when you think you're taking care to slow down or when you think you aren't skimming at all. If your "mind's ear" isn't "hearing" each individual syllable of every word, you're doing /some/ amount of skimming.

Edit: Re-read your comment, I understand better what you're saying now. I still don't fully agree with the methodology involved, because it implies that your focus width is the same (7-8 letters) regardless of other factors such as font size.

Additionally, I literally cannot imagine reading anything other than a textbook as slow as 250 wpm. My base speed is ~1500 wpm, with 98% retention.

******* I wish there was some form of standardized tests about the contents of novels popular on this sub. With your numbers, you'd be able to read Worm in ~18 hours. That could be one day of heavy reading, if you don't have to work that day. Or moving away from novels talked about on this sub, the idea of only taking ~37 hours to completely finish Malazan Book of the Fallen seems unlikely to me. I'd be fascinated to see you read all of such an incredibly long piece of fiction test how well you absorbed the text.

I'm not calling you a liar, it's just that you claim to read ~7.5 times faster than the average adult while simultaneously having much better reading comprehension than people reading much slower than you. This isn't necessarily impossible obviously, as the average adult almost certainly hasn't put any significant effort into optimizing their reading speed, but I'm sure you can understand some of my skepticism.

That skepticism is fair. My guess for the reason I read so quickly is as a kid I read for 16 hours a day, every day. Social ostracization plus being friends with the librarians was a fun combo. I'd check out 10+ books every time I went to the library, and reread my favorites when I was done.

My first read of worm took the course of about a week, my second took two days. I'd also love to see how I fare with the book of the fallen but I just can't seem to get into it.

Yeah, each book starts painfully slow before getting interesting eventually. Once it gets going though, it's some of the best in my opinion. One part in Deadhouse Gates, which I won't go into detail for fear of spoiling it, was genuinely the most emotionally impactful moment I've experienced in fiction. Maybe it just hit me at the right time, but it was masterfully done.

Huh, that is interesting. However, I'm not sure if that's necessarily what your brain is actually doing as it's my understanding that human vision works by focusing on discrete points with the brain providing the illusion of movement between them, rather than actually seeing the movement like you would with a camera. If I'm correct with that understanding, you'd only be able to see the "bounce points" with this analogy, which obviously wouldn't allow you to read everything in between. This is outside of my area of expertise though, so I fully accept that I may be misinformed about the subject.

That's a hell of a claim. It's not an original claim, either. Lots of "speedreading" proponents have claimed to read entire lines or entire pages at once. The claims have been tested and shown to be false. I'm sure if you were tested, you would fail as well. Literally each and every single individual human in the history of history who made that claim before you? They failed when their "ability" was tested. You see a thousand apples in a row fall to the ground, you do the math and show that it's physically impossible for them to do anything besides fall to the ground, and you're perfectly in the right to ridicule any apple who claims to have floated up to the moon and back.

The fovea is only 2 degrees wide. That's 1 degree from the center of vision. Words presented at a distance of just 3 degrees from the center of vision are correctly identified at the same rate as guessing, pure chance. It isn't physically possible to perceive an entire line of text at once.

Even if it were, brains simply don't work that way. We could theoretically alter our visual acuity to be able to clearly perceive every single word on a page, but that wouldn't change the fact that the brain can't process all those words simultaneously, that isn't how language works.

None of this is a claim. You can read it for yourself, in pages 6 through 13 of this paper:

[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100615623267]]

Given that you claim to be able to perceive an entire sentence at once, in spite of the fact that it's been conclusively shown that it isn't physically possible to perceive an entire sentence at once, can you explain how it's /me/ who's rude for pointing out the fact that you're making false claims and it isn't /you/ who's rude for making the false claims?

Unless of course you're simply deluding yourself and you really, /truly/ believe your own bullshit.

If you only see a tenth of the text and you retain/comprehend everything you've seen, I'm sure that feels the same as 100% retention/comprehension, because you have literally zero idea what's going on in the 90% that you skipped over while "reading sentences the same way you normally read words." It's entirely possible that you have piss-poor reading comprehension when you "speed read" but have convinced yourself otherwise because you know that your reading comprehension is fine when you /actually/ read and you don't feel the difference because you haven't read what you haven't read while +skimming/skipping+ "speedreading."

Subject your belief to falsification. Go back and re-read a book that you've recently read with "speedreading," and purposefully slow yourself down. Subvocalize. Hear the words in your mind as though someone else were reading them to you. I bet you'll feel like you're reading a completely different book that you've never encountered before.

  Another study looked at two graduates of a speedreading program who were considered by program officials to have achieved such remarkable performance that the officials contacted a cognitive scientist to test them under controlled conditions in a laboratory (Homa, 1983).

  When so tested, each student read an entire college-level textbook in less than 6 minutes, achieving rates of 15,000wpm or higher.

  Although the students speed read the book three times, their performance on a multiple-choice test of comprehension was quite poor. Neither speed reader showed any extraordinary ability, as compared to average readers, in perceiving peripherally presented letters or identifying which words had appeared in a briefly presented paragraph.

  The extraordinary ability that they had achieved, the investigator concluded, was “a remarkable dexterity in page-turning” (Homa, 1983, p. 126).

Another one:

#+begin_quote
  Calef, Pieper, and Coffey (1999) recorded the eye movements of a group of adults both before and after they enrolled in a speed-reading class, comparing them to a group of people who did not take the class. In the pretest, both groups of readers read at about 280 wpm.

  After the speed-reading course, the speed readers read at about 400 wpm, making fewer fixations (and regressions) with shorter fixation durations (228 ms after compared with 241 ms before).

  Their comprehension score decreased from pretest (81% correct) to posttest (74%), indicating that the increased rate of speed was achieved at the expense of comprehension.
#+end_quote

Another one:

#+begin_quote
  Further evidence for comprehension difficulties among speed readers came from a study by Liddle (1965; reanalyzed by Carver, 1971, 1972), who tested graduates of Wood's speed-reading program and compared them to readers who had signed up for the program but had not yet taken the course.

  Both groups of people were tested for both speed and comprehension on fiction and nonfiction material. The reading rates were about 300 to 1,300 wpm faster for the graduates than the control group.

  While test scores revealed a significant decline in comprehension among the graduates on the fiction material, the two groups showed approximately the same level of comprehension for the nonfiction material (68% for the graduates and 72% for those who had not yet taken the course). But in nonfiction material, the content is based on the real world. Thus, it is possible that the speed readers could have answered the questions correctly by knowing the answers rather than actually having read them from the text.

  In fact, when Carver administered the same comprehension test to a group of people who had never seen the passage, they obtained an only slightly lower score (57%) through their use of common knowledge and guessing.
#+end_quote

And another one:

#+begin_quote
  The most complete study of the eye movements and comprehension of speed readers was carried out by Just, Masson, and Carpenter (1980; see also Just & Carpenter, 1987). They presented passages to speed readers (reading rates around 600--700 wpm), normal readers (reading rates around 250 wpm), and people who were asked to skim (producing rates around 600--700 wpm).

  The speed readers did better than skimmers on general comprehension questions about the gist of the passages but not quite as well as people reading at normal speed. Normal readers, who made many more fixations than the speed readers, were able to answer questions about details of the text relatively well, while skimmers and speed readers, who made many fewer fixations than normal readers, did not differ from each other on these items. They could not answer these questions if they had not fixated on the regions where the answers were located.

  *The data thus suggest that the students of speed-reading courses are essentially being taught to skim and not really read in the sense that we use the term “reading” here.* [emphasis mine]

  The advantage of trained speed readers over skimmers with respect to general comprehension of the text was ascribed by Just and colleagues to an improvement in what they called extended inferencing. Essentially, the speed readers had increased their ability to construct reasonably accurate inferences about text content on the basis of partial information and their preexisting knowledge.

  In fact, when the three groups of participants were given more technical texts (taken from Scientific American), for which background knowledge would be very sparse, the speed readers no longer showed an advantage over the skimmers, even on general questions.

It literally isn't reading. It's like someone saying they've discovered a way to swim indefinitely and then when probed they say their more efficient method of swimming is to /walk/ around the perimeter of the pool. "But that isn't swimming, you're literally not even interacting with the water at all?"

Have you read the rest of the comments I've made in this thread? Or the links to the work of cognitive scientists who specialize in psycholinguistics? There literally is /no such thing/ as speed reading. Brains and eyes just don't work like that. People who believe themselves to be "speed readers" are just skimming and depriving themselves of any real understanding of the text.

But hey, don't take /my/ word for it. You can start here:

[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100615623267]]

And then I swear to all the gods that if you continue researching this stuff in good faith that you'll see that literally zero legitimate sources support the assertions of people who claim to be able to "speed read."

They aren't just passively "having fun at the pool" and "enjoying themselves," minding their own business while swimmers heckle them. They're purposefully showing up at swim meets and actively bragging about how great they are at swimming to actual swimmers. Possibly worse, they sometimes try to poach from the swimming classes and convince people who still haven't worked their way up to making one full lap around the pool that they can quickly progress to being advanced swimmers by just getting out of the pool and walking around it instead of bothering with all that "actually interacting with the actual water" nonsense.

The strange nonhumans lower their longbows. One of them walks forward to greet the broomstick riders where it appears they mean to land.

They land.

 

"Um!!!" says Minor.

"Yes, I noticed," says Finis. "If they're nonhuman then it wouldn't make sense for them to be nearly human either, maybe their real shapes are very strange and they're inhabiting ones close to ours for some reason - or maybe there's some kind of time travel involved, or maybe the mysterious spell works by reaching into parallel worlds, or -"

"It's uncanny. He doesn't look quite real."

 

"Uh, hi," Minor says to the uncanny him.

/{You'll have to give me a few minutes for the language,}/ Curufin sends, and says aloud in Quenya as well. Finis lights up with delight. /{I am Curufinwë Atarinkë of the Noldor.}/

"/I am Finis Eleazar Way,/" Finis says immediately in Quenya.

"/I am Minor Finis Way,/" Minor says. "/Of the -/ British." And switching to English - "where are we -"

"/Where are we?/" Curufin repeats in Quenya. "/This is Lake Mistaringë - Mithrim in the local language - in Beleriand, which our tongue has no word for, not knowing the place until we met its people. I have never heard of the/ British."

 

"/Mistaringë,/" says Finis thoughtfully, "/Mithrim./" And then he guesses four more Thindarin words off the Quenya ones. He gets three right; Curufin corrects one.

(Curufin is staring at him a bit fixedly.)

 

And then, switching to English, "I think we are very far from Britain - and we shouldn't have miscalculated the size of the world so grossly that there were large landmasses we missed - we've circumnavigated it - not us personally, but I follow the march of progress -"

"Circumnavigated."

Finis conjures a globe, demonstrates. "Circumnavigate. Circumference. Circumstance, circumvent - from the Latin -"

"Latin?"

Finis repeats what has been said so far in Latin.

 

/{Please do not be too distracted to ask why he's got a sphere for the world,}/ Maitimo sends.

/{I'm getting to it,}/ Curufin sends back.

He's not; he's carefully repeating back the Latin.

 

"British, Latin - we have Thindarin, Quenya -"

"Oh, I also speak Swedish and Danish and Italian and French and Greek and Igbo and Mandarin -"

"We have - not as many -"

"In the whole world? How far have you explored -"

"Haven't - circumnavigated - can't circumnavigated, no circum -"

"Primitive people think that before they learn math."

"We learn math. Can't circumnavigated, no circum."

"Can't circumnavigate, it's not round," Minor offers him.

"It's not round."

"Can show you with the angles off the sun."

"By all means."

 

And a flurry of conversation later - "okay, yours isn't round. And your sun is close and dim -"

"Not that dim -"

"Ours is very very far, and very very bright, if it were closer everything would boil and die -"

"Ours is drawn on a chariot by a Maia."

"Primitive people think that before they learn math, too."

"Does your kind of math make you wrong."

 

"Our world works on math! Yours might not."

"Our world works on fate."

Finis and Minor look at each other and make a face.

"- my father felt that way about it too. He's dead."

" - is he me," Finis says.

"Yes. I think so. Yes. Only - moreso -"

"Well. I don't have resurrection yet."

** OK, I'm going to start booking flights for the Weasel European Tour, so who wants to recommend cities in Europe that are good to spend a weekend?

I'm not a drinking/night-life person; I'm all about getting good (vegan) food, wandering around on foot, museums, animal sancturaries (not zoos unless they have a heavy conservation focus), that sort of thing.

I speak English and my French isn't too bad, and I have "decent for a tourist" Italian. I'm a woman traveling alone so no recommendations that are too dodgy please!

My wishlist so far:

- Amsterdam (i saw pictures of a ridiculous milkshake on [[/r/vegan]] the other day so even though i am not a "coffee shop" person, i'm definitely going to go there)
- Berlin (as promised: the people who live there please reply so we can start talking dates)
- My hairdresser recommended Prague, how's Prague?
- I want to go somewhere in Eastern Europe: Slovakia or Moldova or IDK, somewhere like that, searching suggestions
- Italy: I've heard Pompeii is stunning; I've heard Turin has a lot of vegetarian food.
- I want to see the northern lights: I'm here 'til the middle of November. Are they are a reliable "every night" thing or would it be silly to plan a weekend trip to Finland or something because it's not a guarantee?

*** The probability of northern rights grows the further north you go. (Until it doesn't.) Just hopping over in Helsinki is probably not gonna give you anything. You'd have to go all the way to Lapland. There, in November, I think your chances are above flipping a coin + not having cloud cover. And you need to get away from light pollution.
