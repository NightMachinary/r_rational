** I just caught up and damn I love this series.

For the first few books I'm constantly aching for more action, at this point I'm wishing there was more slice of life.

I really love the exploration of valdemar here. Especially the exploration of the implications s of active divinity and the companions steering their heralds.

*** Aww, thank you :) The first couple of books do start out a lot slower, and lower-stakes (I like how it /slowly/ builds up to "the entire future humanity is at stake.") And, yeah, one of the things I've enjoyed most is taking the premise of a really super weird setting and exploring all the implications of it!

** I just want to drop in again and say that these are among my favourite stories, without qualification.

The stakes feel real. The characters feel /real/ (and like real adults, not real kids or teenagers). The trauma and loss... also feels pretty real. It's often both painful and cathartic to read, so I usually wait for a clear morning, but love it all the more for waiting.

Thanks again - I'm looking forward to more :-)
