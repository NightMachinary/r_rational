To jog your memory,the last line of 11.3 was "Strange spirits were approaching from the southwest." Shimrun has just revealed that the ensis inherit the memories of their predecessors, along with his belief that pyres inevitably become tyrannies of the ensis over the common folk or the lugals over the ensis. We also learned more about Shimrun's upbringing and what went wrong with his plan. Don't know if that helps people who just don't recall where exactly we left off, and always need to hop back and reread last week's installment.

Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial about power (of every kind), set in a Mesopotamian-themed world where everything goes wrong every four days. If that sounds interesting, it starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]].

*** Glad you liked it! Didn't have time to post an update notice here this morning when I put it up. I might have to delay the next update while I think about where this is headed and how I want to tell the story.

**** It's always nice when people write web serials that aren't massively padded in length and have an actual plot arc
