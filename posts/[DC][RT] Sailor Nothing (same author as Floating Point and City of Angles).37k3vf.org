** I love this story, it's one I've gone back and read every couple of years since I found it. I'm not sure if Sailor Nothing is a hundred percent rational but it definitely has it's moments. Sometimes well timed backup with a melee weapon is worth all the spiritual purity in the world.

** tl;dr:

- The setting is "magical girls". Not too much background knowledge of the genre is required, beyond perhaps skimming the TV Tropes pages for Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Kamen, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl from the original /Sailor Moon/ anime, so that you know what you're supposed to be picturing. I first read and enjoyed the story before knowing much of anything about /Sailor Moon/, but I did have a better time on my second read-through, after I'd watched several episodes of the original /Sailor Moon/ anime (free on Hulu).

- Shoutan Himei--made by the mysterious Magnificent Kamen into Sailor Salvation, years ago--has been worn down to the brink of suicide by repelling the incessant onslaught of monsters created out of ordinary people by the Dark Generals. She sees the endless war as pointless, now, despite the remonstrances of Magnificent Kamen and the help and reassurance of her talking cat, Dusty.

- Cobalt is by far the youngest of the Dark Generals created by and subservient to the Dark Queen. The Queen has given to him the special mission of restoring the Dark World to its former glory. He struggles to bring the wayward demons that he creates into line so that they may work on rebuilding the Dark World instead of succumbing to their base instincts and attacking Earth, while the other, older Generals, Xenon and Neon, send their soldiers to die against Magnificent Kamen's Sailors and gloat about how futile Cobalt's mission is.

More characters come into play later on. I've read it twice (and plan to read it for a third time very soon), and like it quite a lot (though I never got into /Floating Point/, /City of Angles/, etc.). I think Cobalt might maybe be slightly more rational than the other characters, but I'm not sure.

*** Is "magical girls" a genre aside from Sailor Moon? I haven't seen SM, but from the little I know of it this seems like a fanfic, despite the "this is not a fanfic" notice at the front. Maybe these are all standard tropes, though? (Talking cat, fuku, sailor, transform, calling your shots with things like "Pretty Sailor Transform".)

**** It is a genre, yes. Other large entries in the genre: Cardcaptor Sakura, Madoka Magica. The original entry was [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_the_Witch][Sally the Witch]].

Really, though, the tropes (transforming, called shots, etc.) are almost entirely inherited from the "super sentai" genre. Sailor Moon is essentially "Power Rangers for girls."

I would really phrase this story not so much as a fanfic, though, as a rebuttal/deconstruction to the sort of Utopian ideas of the magical girl genre that are epitomized in Sailor Moon. Sailor Nothing is to Sailor Moon as [[http://creative-survivalism.tumblr.com/post/120158176921/theubergrump-i-keep-seeing-stuff-about-lord-of][/Lord of the Flies/ is to /The Coral Island/]].

***** Ah, okay. Good.

What exactly is 'super sentai'? I have heard the term, I know it covers Power Rangers, but I don't know the details.

#+begin_quote
  Superheroes, Japanese style. The word can be translated as "Task Force" or "Squadron." Usually come in teams, with *color-keyed uniforms* and a range of personalities/roles that usually follows some variation on the Five-Man Band. Known for their synchronized posing; also, a Standard Powerup Pose is often used in many Sentai works during the *Transformation Sequence*. A key concept is that the collective team are more important than the individual, and that more can be achieved by working together.

  Although popular in anime, there have also been innumerable live action Sentai series in Japan, most notably Super Sentai, the series which was re-edited into *Power Rangers* in the United States, and 2003's *Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon*.

  A very western form of Sentai is to feature five teenagers receiving powers, with a transformation, i.e. it doesn't have to involve color-coding, or full body suits. They may not even transform at all, but have powers that combine to make a greater whole.

  Contrary to popular belief, "Sentai" ONLY denotes to shows that have a squad of nigh-identical, color-coded superheroes, not every transforming superhero that comes from Japan (the proper term for that would be Henshin Hero, that belongs in the Tokusatsu genre).

  Do not confuse with Hentai, please. Even though there's definitely some unholy overlap somewhere.

******* Aha. Thank you, that makes a lot of sense. Also, 'Synchronized Posing' made me laugh.

******** of Just to add to the discussion, /Sailor Moon/ is also the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier][Trope Codifier]] or the story which has had the largest influence on determining what tropes future writers and audience will come to accept as standard for the developing genre of magical girls. For us, the Trope Codifier in determining the characteristics of rational fiction was /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/.

*********** Very true. Very true indeed.

In point of fact, TvT has been really helpful for me as a writer. Having names to hang familiar ideas on helps to use / think about them, and I've become much more meta-aware about what I read and watch. It's interesting spotting when tropes are used well vs badly.

Anyone have suggestions? Maybe something that would translate the display? I'm just not a fan of reading stage/play style scripts as down time.
