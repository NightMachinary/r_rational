After reading Mother of Learning , my appetite for rational fiction has increased by a lot, I have been searching on the internet but did not find many choices. I like a story which hs rationality , might or might not have romance but it should not drive major portion

I have read and liked the following

MOL

Worm

Metropoliton man

Practical Guide to Evil

HPMOR

Sufficiently advanced magic

I recently started Void domain , it's been ok ok so far.

** /Significant Digits/ is a great fan-sequel of HPMoR.

Then there is /Pokemon: Origin of Species/, /Animorphs: The Reckoning/, /UNSONG/, and /Worth the Candle/.
