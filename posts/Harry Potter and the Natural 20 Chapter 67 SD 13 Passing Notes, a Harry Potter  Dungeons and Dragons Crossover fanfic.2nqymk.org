Did a cat fall asleep on the keyboard at an inopportune time?

Maybe he's taunting the Drama Maintainer deliberately in the hopes that the random encounter on the train will provide plot hooks.

** Amazing chapter as always. Still, I wonder how Dementors will react to Milo given I'm unsure if they should be treated like torture or mind magic, which Milo seems to be able to shrug of easily or more as living a "goodness" vacuums to be introduced to a good-aligned character with potentially disastrous, temporary alignment flipping results.

Any thoughts?

** This story is so much fun. I started reading it for all the hardcore munchkining, but when Fiona was introduced it took on a whole other life. It's like two fanfics in one!
