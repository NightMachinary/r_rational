*** Ah sorry, new to Reddit here, literally made my account yesterday. I was just following the format of the previous post on the new APGTE chapter. Do you know how to edit the title? I can't seem to change it.

** Hard to say what Malicia's planning. I saw someone mentioning her abdicate in favor of Black, but that seems unlikely given her character. Calling on the High Lords' household troops to retake Foramen seems more likely, or maybe even Callow. Maybe using her Rule trick to do something.

*** I'm guessing she plans to kill the highborn. She knows a concerted effort by Amadeus would see her dethroned, so her best route to maintaining her reign is getting him back on-side. The best way to do that is probably to fulfill Amadeus' old dream of killing all the highborn. Furthermore, right now the highborn are in a rough place. Several cities have fallen with all their nobles slaughtered, and they all know they're probably safer in Ater, as far from the lines as possible. Even those who don't trust her won't expect ruthless mass betrayal, given that hasn't been her style and mass execution was always in Black's wheelhouse. If she invites them all for a special session of court and poisons the wine with something they don't know about and something they do, they'll all come with the expected antidote and die dramatically as Malicia smiles coldly, overseeing the culmination of her best friend's dreams.

*** I imagine it will involve a clever play using a stolen/edited version of the Liesse accords.

** Is it weird that i'm kind of expecting an actual successful betrayal in order to take a position? I mean the closest we've seen upfront was when the guard captain gets knifed by the Scribe all the way back in Conspiracy II. We've seen a number of failures, but it's against my expectations that none of them have been successful.

Also Malicia is probably on the way out just from current losses, especially considering she's lost most if not all her Named support at this point. It stands to reason that a losing Dread Emperor/Empress doesn't stay in power for long. I mean she's lost two cities so far, and Praes have been pretty explicitly said to be unforgiving of any weakness. Do we know which legions are at least nominally under her command at this point?
