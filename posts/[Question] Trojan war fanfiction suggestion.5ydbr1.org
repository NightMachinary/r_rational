Hi, are there any entertaining fanfics about or related to the Trogan war, Illiad, and the Odyssey?

Thanks


** Not a fanfic, but the 'Troy' trilogy by David & Stella Gemmell is rather good. I wouldn't classify it as fully rational, but it's definitely got a few rational-style changes made to the original story. If you know the story of Troy, this shouldn't be a major spoiler, but it's an example of the sort of thing I mean: [[#s][Trojan Horse]]

It's been a few years since I last read it, but I remember enjoying it rather a lot.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(novel][Ilium]]: The Trojan War is being recreated by Greek gods that are actually hyper-advanced post-humans. Also lots of other stuff going on.

** David Gemmell's Troy series is the best Illiad fan fiction you'll ever read. First book is called Lord of the Silver Bow.

I'll see you in a month.

** Not quite what you've requested, but /The King Must Die/ by Mary Renault is a great novel about Theseus which sets his life in historical Ancient Greece. It takes all the magical elements of the myth and translates them into plausible real-world events. Really awesome portrait of Ancient Greece, and a great story to boot.
