** I think you underestimate how negatively the average person responds to murder. You might be interested in reading the book "On Killing." An ex-infantryman-turned-psychologist analyzes behavior surrounding death. Interestingly, it was a significant war problem throughout most of our history - he provides a fairly convincing amount of evidence showing that only a small fraction of any given soldiering force prior to the 1970s were actually firing /at/ their enemy. Most gunfight participants in history spent their time firing /near/ their enemies instead. It was a significant problem for generals on both sides of WW1, for example.

Given that, I don't find it hard to believe that being pulled out of math class and facing death might involve some suboptimal behavior. That being said, I suspect Joon is far more brutal than the average person might be when faced with those circumstances.

Joon gets desensitized over time, if that's your main concern.

*** Second the On Killing recommendation - the author does overstate his point, pulling data primarily from new recruits and extrapolating it to the mean soldier, but its still eye opening and in Joon's case "new recruit" overstating his abilities. His reactions to these situations are utterly normal, and I enjoyed these moments as a sign of good storytelling.

**** In fact, I definitely remember having the thought that Joon was unusually bloodthirsty. I explained it by way of the game layer conditioning him, personally.

And I agree that the author does exaggerate his case, but I followed up on a few of his sources (I'm also a veteran-turned-psychologist, and got curious). I would be surprised if he were wrong in an absolute sense, rather than just in terms of degree.

***** I agree that Joon seems unusually quick to adapt to frequent murder (it was my first thought when reading OP's question). I think the game layer conditioning him is a reasonable thought, given how it alters other aspects of his thinking. I also attributed it to Joon having been a hunter who regularly killed and dressed deer and other mammals, though I'm curious if the data (if it exists) would support that hunters would be less squeamish about killing humans.

****** Ah, I need to clarify. I wasn't suggesting that the game layer directly changed his brain function.

I meant that a combination of detachment ("clearly none of this is real"), positive reinforcement (orgasmic level up), and the vaguely positive soft language used (coterie "defeated"!) explained how he got into a gaming mentality of death being cheap. Honestly, I thought it was a really cleverly subtle way of justifying his behavior.

The conditioning programs implemented after WW2 definitely had a demonstrable effect, though, so this is less true today.

**** Pre-revolution was actually the most convincing to me. I remember him trotting out various war histories, pointing to times that two armies did the Napoleonic march-n-shoot from point blank range. The record time for those engagements was something like 8 fucking hours. I don't care how inaccurate a musket is, if you fire 480 times and miss a wall of dudes standing 30 feet away every single time - you aren't really trying to hit them.

I don't think he ever gave me a satisfying answer regarding pre-gun history, though.

EDIT: All these numbers are suspect, btw. This is a memory of a book I read about a decade ago.

The winning strategy in iterated prisoner's dilemma is to [[https://ncase.me/trust/][copycat-with-forgiveness]]. I'm pretty sure that strategy is baked into our genes.

We don't have actual metrics for how those line battles went, but I imagine it was something like this:

1. Everyone's happily shooting at the air, nobody's dying
2. Guy on side A is shot (mostly by mistake)
3. All of a sudden, the people next to him on side A are landing more bullets on side B
4. Side B responds, and they suddenly start landing more hits on side A
5. This wave of increased accuracy continues until either people get cycled out of the line, or the natural inaccuracy of musket fire makes people think we're back to the win-win PD equilibrium.

Tribal warfare casualties were quite low actually. Most deaths were likely wound and infection related rather than 'intentional'. They probably didn't feel bad per say, but killing wasn't exactly their goal either.

​

Looting tended to be expected and commanded. Part of the soldiers pay was expected to come from looting, it wasn't exactly random people stealing and stashing things away, more like organized looting ordered by commanders that was later pooled and distributed accordingly. The leaders kept most of it as you'd expect.

​

Mass rape was probably a loud minority type of occurrence rather than a majority participation event.

Lindybeige has a good video on the subject of soldiers shooting to kill.

Don't dies numbers, it can be really enjoyable when done right - it's like "here's a bunch of numbers and mechanics, find a way to break it and then get the payoff of it /actually happening/ when the character does exactly that next chapter!

This requires the character to do the obvious (or not?) exploitation, which requires a certain amount of intelligence/rationality of course.

***** In Worth the Candle, it usually seems more like numbers are the statistics measuring what reality is. Compare this to most LitRPGs, where the numbers are literal. They're the way the world works.

In WtC, let's say you tried to look at someone's stat sheet, who isn't Jun. You could do it (ie, via essentialism). But you can't really just change someone's number. Or, if you can, that's the game layer abstracting over a ton of info trying to figure out what that person would be like and what it means for that number to be something different.

The point is that those numbers reflect reality, just condensed. Normal statistics. Jun's just has that process going further.

In other LitRPGs, this is not the case. The game layer /is/ reality. There is no fancy set of calculations or anything, that person's number is literally how reality is.

Think of it like this: in games, we can't model everything as complexly as reality, so we simplify things. WtC treats reality as reality, like any good story might. There's just an interface showing some fancy stats. Other LitRPGs is reality literally being as simple as the game. Yeah, putting it like that, it doesn't make sense, but that's why most LitRPGs are bad! They try to treat reality as normal but at the same time they try to treat it as a strange simplified mess, which only works when you can you're playing an actual game to keep that Suspension of Disbelief. Thus, many LitRPGs end up feeling like Crack fics.

Funnily enough, that manhua manga which inspires so much fanfic actually did it pretty well. Reality wasn't that simple, instead there was a super power making things easier.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-act-1-naruto-si.36903/][Shinobi: The RPG]] is an interesting LitRPG fic because it tries its hardest to make it a simplified reality for the SI, but a normal reality for everyone else. It's the only fic I know that plays with this aspect.

In any case, my point was that good LitRPGs are like normal stories where reality makes sense and the game layer is just a superpower, rather than fucking with reality to make it more like a game.

I hope this helped. 😊

Then I read fanfic that just straight up copy its mechanics, like the instant dungeons. Though, nowadays, a lot of fanfics are just generic litrpgs.

I'm not entirely sure what's been up with the trend, but thinking back on it, there's no way The Gamer started the trend. It definitely did make it more prominent to some extent, though.
