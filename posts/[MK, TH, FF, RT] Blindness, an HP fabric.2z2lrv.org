** This is difficult to call truly rational, as the lead character is overpowered and has a number of things go belief-stretchingly well for them, but the overall themes are of understanding magic through science and experimentation, deciding what to do with power, and somewhat about consequences of actions.

It is well written in the sense that it is readable at minimum.

Not a wholehearted endorsement, but pretty good.

Story is WIP, forgot that tag. And it is a fanfic, not fabric. Auto complete fte.

Doesn't really begin to cover it. He seems to have power that equates to "win immediately in any conceivable situation"

And yet, it's quite enjoyable to read.

**** The redemption I see is that even going by canon, there is a reason he is unique. It has never ever happened before, so unlike munchkin eleven year olds who happen to bootstrap godpowers with sheer gumption despite many thousands of years of /people not doing that/, in this case the lack of precedent is internally consistent.

Enough so at least that I can run with it as an axiom of the setting and see how it plays out.

It is also true that I have a high tolerance to Mary Sue-ism and think that overpowered characters can be an exceptionally good way to explore a fictional setting.

***** What are the conflicts, and are they sufficiently difficult?

****** He occasionally gets in an argument with Hermione, usually solved with flowers.

If you want seat of your pants how-will-they-survive conflict, these aren't the droids you are looking for.

If you want an science-y take on HP, with what is shaping up to be some interesting moral questions and a transhumanist bent, then enjoy.

*** Yep, I agree with all of this - it's not exactly rational, but still worth reading while we wait on the explosion of post-HPMOR fics. I've been following for a while, actually :)

** Yeah, I enjoyed this. Can't wait for the continuation; it's clear the author is quite good at keeping a schedule, though, so I'm glad to be able to expect the end sometime in the next, say, three years. (Not gonna point any fingers.) Thanks for sharing!

** It seems to be following the opposite of Yudkowski's First Rule (If you make Frodo a Jedi, you have to give Sauron a Death Star). I /would/ be interested in reading an HP AU where Voldie [[#s][spoiler]]

That said, I still like this story. Any version where things actually presented a /challenge/ would be a favorite up there with HPMOR, but this story itself is pretty keen.

** I read the first chapter and found it boring (plus the narration style is weird). Does it get any better?

** Somewhat enjoyable, but the first chapter is nothing but exposition.
