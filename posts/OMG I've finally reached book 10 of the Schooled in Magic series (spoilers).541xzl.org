So just a recap of the 9th book: [[#s][Spoiler]]

I have a theory that [[#s][Spoiler]]

Now I'm reading book 10 and I'm so excited!

For those of you who haven't started reading Christopher Nutall's "Schooled in Magic" series, why aren't you reading it now? It's intelligent, rational, VERY well written, and very unique. I know it costs money, but not that much and it's totally worth it! (not the free version on spacebattles, that one is known to be crap).


** The problem with these books is the author doesn't want to kill his cash cow. He teases all these nifty things -- magic based computers and AI, magic based fusion bombs, etc, but they never come to much, because if they did that would end the series as formulated and he couldn't write more of the books.

The meat of the plot in each book seems to get slimmer and slimmer, with more and more dull phoned in filler, like even the author is getting bored with stretching it out. He should have brought the series to a bang up conclusion long ago.

Great books are made when the author creates a setting he loves, then takes a hammer and multiple atom bombs to it so we can appreciate the beauty and the horror as it shatters and dies and changes into something new. That's what Vernor Vinge does. When the author goes all Gilligan's Island/Lost like Christopher Nutall has with this series, and refuses to break or change his creation, then the interesting parts whither away to dry filler leavened with a little spark of teasing at the climax of each book, as time and book after book go by.

And the writing quality goes down because the author gets bored, too.

I honestly tried to read the first book, found it was not at all to my taste, and quit the series after finishing the first book. Does the story drastically & dramatically change in later books? If so, where?

**** No. The quality is consistently superb. The series is a masterpiece and you only read the crappy version on space battles as you would know if you actually read the OP. I wish you would all stop bashing the story when you haven't even read the real thing but only what was undoubtedly a crappy rough draft that really shouldn't have been posted online.

*** I've read until book 7 but I honestly would not qualify it as being rational. I've been frustrated more than once while reading the book because the characters make stupid decisions.

It can be fun to read as a guilty pleasure if you just want to pass time without thinking much but it's not great at all.

I know you really like those books (I read the previous books following a post you made on this subreddit) but no, there's no way I'd call them rational or even great books. They are a fun guilty pleasure kind of read though.

  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do )(or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

I've felt a few times that there's a few events that happens because the plot requires it... I read them in May and it'd take time to recall specific examples though.

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Shadye who is the antagonist for the first book is not much more defined beside being an evil necromancer. He's not a very interesting villain and the conflict is pretty manichean. The second book's faction has some reasons for trying to take power but it's not much more than the bog standard Coup trope. I'd guess an argument could be made for saying that it's more interesting in Wedding Hells and that in The School of Hard Knocks, the Headmaster from Mountaintop is a more interesting villain...

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Point for this, Emily does solve problems through the intelligent application of her knowledge and resources but only when she is not too emotional which happens often enough (and makes sense since she's a teenage girl) especially when the plot requires it.

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Yes, at least the magical system is sane and consistent as far as I remember...

So 2/4 if you make allowances for the fact that as a teenager she's allowed to hold the idiot ball every so often. That's not still not what I'd call rational.

Look, I know you love those books but you're very very defensive about them... You don't have to get into fights because people disagree with you.

******** I'm quite sure that no one has ever held the idiot ball in the entire series. An idiot ball is unnatural author-enforced temporary stupidity of a character, usually for the sake of advancing the plot. I'm quite certain that there are literally zero examples of this in the series.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall]]

Most of the characters are driven into conflicts by their beliefs and values, and never solely because the plot requires it. Even the necromancers! Those who become necromancers do so NOT for the evulz, but rather because they underestimate the risks of necromancy and overestimate the rewards, they don't listen when other people warn them of those dangers, and because they foolishly overestimate their own abilities and assume that they won't go mad from it like every other necromancer has.

Remember in HPMOR where Harry mentions the following possibility for how Voldermort became so evil?

>"Too many Dark rituals, maybe? In the beginning he thought he'd do just one, but it sacrificed part of his good side, and that made him less reluctant to perform other Dark rituals, so he did more and more rituals in a positive feedback cycle until he ended up as a tremendously powerful monster -"

That's very similar to how someone becomes a necromancer in the "Schooled in Magic" series. Except that the change happens a lot faster.

As for why I'm being defensive...I find a really amazing work of rational fiction and post it to the sub, then a bunch of people start misrepresenting it and not even bothering to criticize it for its real shortcomings, instead choosing to strawman it and make up shortcomings it doesn't have! You're actively discouraging other people on this sub from reading it for reasons that aren't even true! This is one of my favorite novel series ever, I like it almost as much as I like HPMOR, and you guys call it things like "a guilty pleasure" and "consistently poor writing" rather than acknowledging it as the great work of rational literature that it is! Why wouldn't I be a little ticked off?

********* Well, let's agree to disagree, I still stand by my opinion that the writing is not bad but it's not great either and that it's not a great work of rational literature (there's a lot of other work published on this subreddit that I think are much better).

I don't have the time to go back through the books to note down when I thought Emily behaved stupidly for the sake of advancing the plot but that's exactly one of the criticism I had about it. If I read the next books (which I don't really feel like reading them... ), I'll write them down as they come.

*** I'm guessing you read the free version on spacebattles right? I'm talking about the paid version which is MUCH better. The story is intelligent rational and very well written even in the first book. I encourage you to get the paid version of the first book and to stay away from the crappy version on spacebattles which I suspect is a very early draft.

*** Basically anything is possible if you can figure out how to do it and provide sufficient power. It is a neat one to day dream about but it doesn't give the reader much details. The environment provides some power, some places provide lots of power, each person has a varying amount of power.

In setting they learn a bunch of different methods and symbols to create spells, potions, and other stuff. Different materials provide different magical effects, potions, and so on.

It feels like in setting its very logical and knowledge based but to the reader it isn't because all of those details are glossed over. I like it because of its knowledge background but comes off too much as what ever is needed for the story will happen because the reader does not have any details to work with.

** You've got to be kidding me. The author did obviously take a setting he loves and take a metaphorical hammer and metaphorical atom bombs to smash into it just like what you're talking about! There are legitimate reasons that Emily didn't share the secret of magic atom bombs and didn't try to leverage that secret. Because it's REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS. The interesting content, the meat of the story actually does NOT slow down from book to book. I have no idea where you're getting the impression that the author is bored from. As for the idea that the series should have ended a long time ago, I don't know where you got that idea either. Keep in mind that Emily is transported to the Nameless World as a fairly intelligent but immature teenager with no credentials in science or engineering nor any rationality training. The mistakes she makes are totally believable for her and DON'T happen because of an idiot ball or because the plot requires it. Again, have you actually read the paid version of the series, and if you did how much were you actually paying attention to it and how much were you just skimming?

Also the writing quality does not go down. It stays very good throughout the series. Are we really talking about he same book series?
