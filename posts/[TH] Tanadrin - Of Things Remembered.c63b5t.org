** If I were Will Long myself, I would have asked about if any of my own friends or family would be recreated as well. They just said how there was difficulty in recreating him due to how little information of Will Long existing. Therefore, it's very unlikely for any of Will Long's memories of his peers (Brother Stephen, Laurence, and Hugh) to be correct. If they were, then that should be sufficient to recreate them as well.

** This fails for me because I don't buy the premise that the information is, somehow, not lost. Advanced mathematics my ass. Even though it's not long, I abandoned it halfway through. Not recommended.

*** Information isn't lost, except if it fall is in a black hole if I understand right.

Author makes a mistake thinking we would need historical writings and data to recreate Will, when the only thing we need is proper physics model and time to check if simulation fits with our world data. There was a Slate Star Codex blog post doign a similar story better, but not with intent to save people, rather just testing if simulation program works or something like that.

However even if information is lost, then all a computer really has to is recreate a full-blown simulation of a various humans, crosscheck them for paradoxes and functionality and put them back on line. sort like a computer model of multiverse only for sapisentient beings, eventually you would have all sorts of people, and if multiverse theory is right IRL then you would actually create real people who exist somewhere.

As for characters speech, I dont mind, this isnt a story, but rather an idea presented in story format for Tumblr and general normie audience (normie as mainstream who havent read a bunch of scifi books detailing similar concepts). Either that or Will is drugged up to keep him calm lol

**** A full-blown sim would definitely be better IMO, and solve a lot of the “but are you really that same person?” problems. Resource-intensive, absolutely, but entirely permitted within physical laws and probably within the reach of whatever far future civilization was resurrecting Will Long.

***** Am I the only one who's never been bothered by the "is it really me" nonsense? The only downside there could possibly be to having more of my mind in the world is that it increases the chance of me getting tortured, so as long as every copy has an off switch (something I think people should have anyway, provided it was effort-intensive to push so folks don't suicide on a whim) I'm ecstatic to have more of me running around pursuing my goals.

****** I'm not bothered by “is this duplicate really /me/?” per se, but I'm low-grade suicidal a fair amount of the time and that might be having an effect.

As for the simulation idea, that's a different flavor of “is this really me?” In that case, the problem which the sim would be meant to solve is not “is this duplicate a fake double that lacks Authenticity Quarks?” or whatever, but “does this duplicate's mind actually correspond to the mind of the person we are attempting to duplicate?” If we are trying to resurrect the dead, then it matters whether we are re-constructing old minds (through a laborious trial-and-error process, admittedly) or constructing new minds that remember writing some poetry but in all other respects don't correspond very well to the mind of a particular English monk.

*** I lost interest halfway through the story too. For me, the conversation between characters was not really realistic.

*** I understand that the expectation on this sub is usually that everything about the world should reconcile in some way with the world rationally, but at some point that kind of world building may just detract from the story.

You're judging it for it's perspective on how singularity was achieved, but I think the portrayal was more of an emotional ideal of the treatment of individuals in a world where everything is within human power. The civilization in the story has both power and the organizational power to choose to use that power only when appropriate.

I do find that this story is enjoyable and valuable. I don't want to get to the point where the only stories we like are the ones where we agree with the perspective of a character inside the story or find the world building meets our current understanding of physics.

Moreover, I think this does have value on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. I'll agree that those are the criteria we usually use to find common ground on this sub, but the philosophy of value that informs our rationality can be enriched by stories about our tropes.
