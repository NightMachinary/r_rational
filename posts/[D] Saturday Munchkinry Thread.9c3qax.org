Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Thought of this sub when I saw [[http://imgur.com/a/OgbVIht][this]]. Obviously 12 points is too much so let's ask what could be done with say...6 points or, better yet, 3.

*** I think my choice is greatly dependant on my goals, though there is one essential option: Infinite branching bypasses the limitations of having to reset all the way, effectively allowing you to set arbitrary checkpoints. This is useful regardless of objective: you can use it to repeat specific events over and over to brute force a solution and then save the result by branching.

Objective: progress humanity:

Essentials: Branching loop -1, more branching -1, branching loop+ -1, chaos loop -0 (you want variation between loops so that new developments are made), object permanence -3 (Heckin' OP if you can take technology to the past, especially to any savestate), anti-gambling +1, Time machine +4 (After we resolve legalities of having no identity, it doesn't really affect us, so free points) for a total of -1.

12 points:

We're going straight for immortality here, so Tree(3) years -10. locked loop +2 and cooldown +2 (no need to leave the loop as branches count as in-loop and the loop will last for eternity). Memory permanence -2, sound mind -1. The last two points are free choice.

6 points:

Tree(3) years -10, locked loop +2, cooldown +2, sound mind -1, [nothing odd here or limitless memory] -1 and Be careful +3. Make a ridiculous number of safety precautions and lots of save states, check twice before crossing the road. The extra points are necessary to achieve the immortal loop

3 points:

We can't afford looping eternally, so we'd likely develop until we are satisfied with the maximum achievable in 10 years and break out. 10 years -8 and One-time use +6. Plurality bypasses many of the weakness of one-time use, so its main limitation is <= 10 years. For additional risk we can take Be careful +3, Memory permanence -2 and sound mind -1

OR if we want to keep our ability to make multiple loops:

1 week -5 and Be Careful +3 is all we can afford. Not nearly as useful, as convincing people and making progress is only barely possible and will quickly hit a limit.

0 points:

10 years -8, One-time use +6, Be Careful +3. Losing sound mind is a bummer, but the rest are too useful together and no more maluses are acceptable

Conclusion: "There were starting points!?"

EDIT: added in cooldown (+2) so I rearranged the text and changed the set ups to match.

Can't we? Can't you take a very small number of total loops for points and then take infinite branching? 3 loops per branch with infinite branches sounds like looping forever to me.

***** My bad, I choose poor words. In all my options I chose grahams number of loops, what I meant by 'inifinite' is infinite length. With the goal of progressing humanity, it'd be nice to be able to live in that future humanity that is created. In the first two options I made sure I could get it, but the 10 point cost was too steep for the 3 point or 0 point challenge. Actually, we could get it with 3 points if we ditch object permanence, but then goals become much harder and we need to play the long game on every run

*** Yeah 12 points is too easy. With 6 points, I would take 100 year loop, repeat at most 100 times, and the one time use and anti gambling maluses. Perks would be digital permanence, sound mood, limitless memory, and memory permanence. I'll have to read the perks more to see if any are worth the cost.

Edit: can't take one time use with 100 years. I'll take locked loop and all the way, so that should put me at a balance of 0 points.

If I only had 3 points, I would go for 10 years instead and get one time use, not take locked loop or all the way, and invest any spare points into number of loops.

I feel like anti gambling might as well be a free point. There are tons of ways to make money that don't involve gambling or anything like that. You could easily sell tons of secrets that you get a decade or century in the future, and use that money to trade for other secrets that you sell in subsequent iterations.

Digital permanence is a must have, along with unlimited memory. You presumably want to gain something of value from those loops.

*** I'm going to call it "live my normal life but make money on roulette", since some of the bonuses look good in general.

Cooldown (+2)

No reset (+1)

Limitless Memory (-1)

Sound Mind (-1)

Nothing Odd Here (-1)

One minute time loop, win at roulette, net 0 points.

I can also use it if I end up in a dangerous situation to try to save my life (admittedly only for a minute). If I have to take 3 points I'll increase my max loop to 4 hours, and constantly have the loop "on" but just decline to reset it unless I die.

Yeah my thing isn't optimised to within an inch to its life, but with 0 points I can make money, not need to work again, and apparently none of the casino owners will realise I'm "cheating" at roulette.

*** Free points:

Always take 1 Iteration(+8) points and take Braching Loop(-1) and More Branches(-1). The two branches gives you in effect an infinite number of loops since time only passes in the branch you are currently in and gives you a net +6.

Take either Locket Loop(+2) or all the way+static length (+2). They do essentially the same, are a minor inconvinience but there's too much need for points if you start with 3. All the way+Static Length synergizes well with the branches since if you end up in a life threatening circumstance you can shift to another branch.

Anti Gambling(+1) is a must take. There's plenty of ways of gaining money that doesn't involve gamling or stocks.

Point taxes:

Sound mind(-1) is a point tax that you just have to take. Whatever your goals are they will be corrupted if you go insane.

Good choices:

Expanded years. 100(-9) gets you that immortality thing rolling

Digital performance(-1). Cheaper than Memory Performance and does the same and more after uploading. You want it to cause world domination or quicken the new enlightenment. Though you should probably also take Object Permanence(-3) so you don't have to go looking for your fancy USB or your friends brain upload.

Automation(-2) is pretty great if you are paranoid(which you should with this power). Set contingency plans for anyone tinkering with your brain and such.

And yet, that's how the rules stand as written; you have multiple branches and they're 'paused". Also: you're not necessarily just straightforwardly looping; a branch can be ahead or behind other branches or the main loop.

*** I think that any number of timelines (-2) with any number of loops within loops (-2) breaks the game in terms of loop iterations (+8), locked loop (+2), and reset control (+1) for a total of *+7*.

With an infinite number of loops of any length within the main loop, you can have an infinite number of loops /the length of the original loop/. You can repeat each one as many times as you like, hopping back and forth casually between those infinite tries, and while "only one can be made real" so far as continuing forward from that point, that's one /of each internally created loop/.

You can "reset" without resetting by simply abandoning one of your infinite timelines. The final, "real" iteration must be the full length but any other one is whatever length you need it to be. You can also go back to abandoned timelines if you change your mind, which is handy.

If you don't mind sacrificing some marginal flexibility, feel free to take static loops for an additional +1, and if you understand what All the Way means when it talks about loops in loops you can get +1 there too. Without knowing the rules, I wouldn't risk it.

Regardless, the three points is a minimum of ten with infinite repeats up to whatever maximum length you set.

*** Three points?

Take a one-minute loop length, but Graham's Number of loops. (0 points so far). Digital permanence (one point). Bubble loop (2 points). Outside the Loop (2 points) to allow me to create loops that I am not inside of. Since I don't actually plan to ever be inside these loops, I can take Locked Loop, All The Way, Static Length, No Reset Control and Be Careful (giving me eight extra points) without penalty.

Now, I've still got six points to spare (I've used -3 points out of 3 so far) and I already have my aim - near-infinite time computing. I can create a bubble that contains a computer and its near surroundings (and only those) and run a carefully designed piece of software that will have Graham's number of minutes of runtime (with no user interaction) within one minute of time (as far as anything outside the room is concerned). I can start out by finding large prime numbers using a desktop computer and claiming the prizes for said discoveries, and then put my incredible computing power to work solving other problems...

***** Hmm. In that case, aside from exploiting the magic nature of the ability for profit rather than any particular combination of items, maybe self defense? Always keep a knife on you, even when it looks like a pen.

I'm hesitant to pick any piece of technology, because it would become outdated fairly quickly, and I'm assuming that the items can still break through normal use. Because being able to swap a really nice laptop and my phone would be handy.

I suppose if you could convince the US government of your ability before ever using it, all the radioactive material that requires disposal could be fused into a single object, turned into a pebble or something, then be forgotten about.

For a boring answer, you could choose two objects of greatly differing volumes, and then use air displacement to run a generator.

People might complain if you turned the Earth into a grain of sand that collapses into a black hole.

You could make launching a really complicated satellite much easier by turning it into something that doesn't need to worry about surviving launch. The James Webb Space Telescope comes to mind. It's super complicated, and part of that is because it needs to unfold once launched into it's full configuration which is far too big to fit into a fairing. If a telescope was designed with the ability in mind, you could put a really fancy one into space, as the mass of the telescope would be the only thing constraining it's size.

I could buy as dense a storage medium as I can, and then save all the backups of my data on to it before storing it as a ring or something. It would be the ultimate form of loss prevention, because the data wouldn't be physically vulnerable to anything. I would probably wait on doing so, because hard drive space is continually increasing, so I wouldn't want to be stuck with the equivalent of a 256 MB flash drive in the era of terabyte hard drives.

****** Increased density marginally increases the durability for some materials, I think. I'm not sure though.

IIRC the earth still wouldn't be a black hole even if it were the size of a grain of sand.

Aiding in satellite launches sounds interesting, but it'd still be tricky since you need to be skin-contact with the object to switch its forms.

Secure storage of data also sounds reasonable. I wonder whether there's anything else you could extract disproportionate benefit from rendering functionally immune to outside wear and tear?

******* There's lots of things that can fail in electronics even if they are physically more durable. Processors wear out over time, and electrical shorts occasionally happen, for example.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius?wprov=sfla1][Schwarzschild radius of the Earth]] is ~9 millimeters across. It would form a black hole.

I think sending a single human on an orbital flight that should only last a few hours would be easier than designing a huge satellite that can survive launch. You wouldn't necessarily even need life support, just a space suit with maybe some extra air.

Not sure. Backups for data seem the logical choice for personal use. Various emergency supplies would have similar utility but be more boring and usually require non-replenishable resources stored with them.

*** I can see you attempting to prevent infinite energy shenanigans with gravity, but I think we can still get away with it via electrical charge or magnets.

Object 1: some sort of object that we can fill with positive charge and insulate to keep it charged.

Object 2: some sort of object that we can fill with negative charge and insulate to keep it charged

Then you fuse the objects, and stick them in a strong electrical field. It will apply force in one direction of the field or the other based on its current charge, which you can harness to generate energy, and then swap to the other charged object once it reaches the edge of the field.

**** Fair, the rules are a little hacky. I might say that, 'switching' the two objects is actually, like, a high-speed 4d rotation, and that switching costs you some small amount of energy. Under ordinary circumstances, that energy is just used to move air out of the way, but in this case that energy would also go into your generator, and if the charges are so great that energy cost of completing the rotation is greater than the 'strength' of your rotation, then the object counts as 'obstructed' and the switch fails.
