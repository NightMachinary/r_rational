She's such a wasteland villain she'd probably be offended if that wasn't on the table.

That could work though. More likely she'll do what she's asked and some sneaky shenanigans on the side.

** I've been wondering, does it matter that Thief and Archer have such simple Names? I understand that it's probably just a relic of when they were introduced into the story, but nearly every other Name since the start of Part 3 is at least /Adjective Noun/ or /Noun of Noun/ in construction. Like /Thief of Stars/ in this chapter, for example. Meanwhile, Vivienne is just "Thief" and Indrani is just "Archer".

*** Thief of Stars is a title, not a Name. I took Catherine's first card to imply that her Name is Spellblade. That Vivienne and Indrani aren't legendary yet is their own fault for underplaying their influence. Even Masego is /just/ "Heirophant". They're all young yet.

Give them as many years as the Grey Pilgrim has and nobody will know which of their storied titles was original.

**** I think the exact opposite: that the one-word Names are less specific, and so can draw on all related stories, while the Names with epithets have a story attached that narrows their scope. In [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/chapter-15-company/][chapter 15 of book one]] Black mentions Champion derivatives in early Praes, and Akua thinks about the common traits of the Bard family tree in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/villainous-interlude-coup-de-theatre/][interlude Coup de Th√©atre]] (even if she's wrong about the "tree" part). That seems to point that the core nown in the Name is a rough description of the Role, and the epithets get added if there's need to remove possible overlap with, say, other potential Champions around.

I wonder whether or not Names can be called the same words but in different languages, or in cultures isolated from each other.

***** I find it somewhat puzzling that he can Recall heroes whose souls are still bound on Creation. Dead King's whole deal with becoming a lich rests on an implication that a soul is this immaterial "object" that keeps the body moving, without any functional difference between natural connection and a binding. This, though, implies there's a fundamental divide.

Is that why the undead are less capable of learning? Is the afterlife just a point behind "now" on a temporal axis of a graph depicting a trajectory of a being, making the soul not able to evolve because the only way to progress is to be in Creation, in the "now"? In that case the necromancy is binding a corpse by magical puppet strigs to the past, and any development goes only as fa as the spell itself develops.

I'm coming up with all this four-dimensional bullshit because Pilgrim mentioned that any memories of the afterlife are sealed, which is strange given that classic mythology has its Heracles and Orpheus, but in the Guideverse anything regarding the afterlife is a matter of faith. My hypothesis is that the reason for it is that the afterlife doesn't exacly /happen/ here: from a dead person's perspective, their time ends with their death. The dead people are more or less fossils of their lifetimes beneath the surface of the Creation (or, at the very least, fossils with a Choice).

****** It does raise some questions about whether people are right in how they think undeath functions. do sentient undead actually contain souls of the formerly living or are they facsimiles? And if the Dead King is truly unchanging that means he was so boss to begin with he's maintained his power this log through sheer power and pre-death preparation.

*** Could be a language thing.

"Thief of Stars" might be a single word in the language the story comes from. And "Ranger" might translate to "Wandering Huntress" in some language(s) on Creation.

But, it's probably more that since there can be only one instance of any name at a time, and many names have overlapping concepts you get cases where the more general name is unavailable, or the individual fits a more specific name too precisely to be any otehr variation. I doubt there's a strong correlation between power, or even versatility of the Name itself, but there probably is a variance in how similar different holders of the same name are with the less specific names having more variance between individuals.

** As a reminder, "All according to" is the title of the first chapter of the Grand Melee in the first book. Now, will the next chapters follow the initial naming scheme and go "[X]'s plan"?
