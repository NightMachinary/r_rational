Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** On a bunch of these past posts I've been asking for tips and people to talk to, to help deal with my severe depression. I'd just like to update you all and say that for the first time in a while that things are looking up.

I am on a new medicinal regiment after taking a genomic sequence and it's really helped me out. Turns out I don't produce L-methylfolate, which was causing long term drop off in effectiveness on my meds.

I've been keeping up with a 5 day a week fitness program and have been able to delve into some hobbies that I had become apathetic about.

I just wanted to thank you all so much for being such a supportive community. I really appreciate you guys so much and I don't know how to express how much your replies have meant to me.

** This is a weird place for me to bring this up, but I have been having an /amazing/ time with tantric meditation.

I have a sort of mental script running that s/woo/sensation/; for example, "touch the sacral median and feel your second chakra" becomes "touch the spot between your tail bone and lower back and feel what happens in your pelvis". In other words, although I really don't buy any of the theories or explanations for the sensations, the sensations are /amazing/ and I'm really digging the exercises.

Overall my body, emotions, and energy levels are /massively/ improved, and there's a bunch of neat life advice to be gleaned. Ex: I've had golfer's elbow pretty bad for the last month or so, and after each meditation session I notice a marked improvement in the pain/stiffness/etc.

The core meditation pattern is to focus as absolutely and intensely as you can on [THING] - in the woo explanation, shoving energy in - and then relax and invert your focus, receiving/listening/feeling - in the woo explanation, accepting the energy being emitted. This feels like a really good pattern for life; oscillate between a balanced and reciprocal attention and reception.

Part of the idea is also, apparently, to get to know your sense of attention the same way movement yoga helps you to get to know your muscles/bones/etc.

Anyway! It's been really neat and full of information for me.

***** Thanks!

I've been trying some meditation (alone, without a teacher - I read some of the book The Mind Illuminated, and tried the techniques described there), and found it surprisingly useful. after a session, I did feel noticeably more calm and focused.

I also found it difficult... Sitting even for a relatively short time without doing anything but focusing on my breathing proved harder than I thought.

In general, I really don't like all the spiritual talk around it. In the back of my mind, I wonder if it is all just an elaborate placebo (I also think about it during a session - which is very distracting...)

I read a lot of people on the internet (yes, I know, a very reliable source) talking about new mind states they reached during meditation (see, for example [[/r/streamentry][r/streamentry]]), and I can't help but thinking that this doesn't strike me as a reasonable outcome, and is most likely just imagination.

I've tried searching for serious research on the topic - but there's so many articles that I can't decide what is true anymore...

**** It depends on what modules you're using and what models you're making. For example, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicuboctahedron][rhombicuboctahedron]] made with the module described in the linked image is rather fragile, because it's mostly squares and the module is based around 90-° angles, so there's barely any tension. However, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron][cuboctahedron]] is quite sturdy, because half of it is triangles, so the vertices are tight and there's lots of tension. (On the other hand, a model that's /too/ tight may be difficult to assemble. An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron][octahedron]], for example, simply cannot be constructed with the basic module, because the angles are too tight for the assembler to insert the tabs into the slots---there are /too many/ triangles.)

****** The simple "90-90-90-90" module obviously can't be used at all for pentagon- and hexagon-containing models (108 and 120 °, respectively)---but, in my experience, the analogous "120-120-120" module* works fairly well for the truncated icosahedron ("soccer ball"---all hexagons and pentagons). I folded one (years ago) and it certainly didn't "fall apart", though it /was/ (like a 90-90-90-90 rhombicuboctahedron) significantly more fragile than a smaller model made from the same module (a truncated tetrahedron or a truncated octahedron) would have been.

The integrity of a model depends /both/ on the model /and/ on the module.

*To make this module, [[https://nrich.maths.org/5372][convert your two squares of paper into equilateral triangles]], then follow more or less the same instructions as for the 90-90-90-90 module.
