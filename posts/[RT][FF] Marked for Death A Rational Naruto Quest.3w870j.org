  But beware, because the rational Narutoverse has no Plot Armour, and the shinobi world does not forgive mistakes.

To make that utterly blunt: *if you roll badly, you will die.*

Velorien is going to be doing an update every Thursday, I'm going to update every Sunday. Updates will likely be short, as both of us are pretty fully booked.

To expand on this a bit: the system is set up so that the rng will not play a huge role. The results are going to be determined chiefly by the preparation the players put in before the attempt. So don't worry about the rng fouling up a perfectly legitimate strategy: if you munchkin hard enough in preparation, then no rng will stop you. Conversely, if you fail to adequately prepare for a challenge, no rng will save you.

** Nice! I would love to participate in this, but I dare not make a character without a lot of thought put into it, and I don't have the time right now. I'll certainly follow this though.
