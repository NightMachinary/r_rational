** Since we're on the topic of TV shows, what's this subs opinion of Breaking Bad?

*** An utterly fantastic character piece. Walter White is one of the most fascinating villains of modern fiction. And he's well-written enough that, even to the last episode, a significant portion of the fanbase still believes that he's the hero. I firmly believe that the final season (and "Ozymandias" in particular) is the greatest piece of television ever produced. It beats out even /The Wire/ and /The Sopranos/ at their very best.

The first season is more of a black comedy than a drama, playing up the apparent ridiculousness of the situations that the still criminally-inept White keeps dropping himself into, but the tone keeps getting darker and darker until by the third series there's very little left to laugh about. It's also really, really easy to binge through the whole lot.

That said, none of the characters are strictly rational in the sense that this sub goes for. Walter is driven entirely by ego, despite his protestations to the contrary, and will make terrible decisions because he simply doesn't want to lose, or to look piteous. The chemistry uses more-or-less accurate terms but not in a way that anyone could hope to replicate without sitting down to study it for themselves (and there's a lot of dramatic licence thrown in too).

Given the topic, I'm happy to give them a pass on not making it easy to implement at home.

**** My main problem with Breaking Bad is that the protagonist, who is evil, ends up getting what he wants. He gets to, in his own eyes, undo anything bad, by saving Jesse and dying "heroically". I think it was a goddamn shame that the writers didn't force everyone to confront the fact that Walter White was a piece of arrogant shit (who was surprisingly lovable) by having everything he ever wanted torn away from him in a brutal and realistic manner (eg, going to jail, having his work exposed, not saving Jesse).

I feel like despite his very, very evil acts he still got what he wanted, and at that point it wasn't about the fact that we needed to still like him. I think the real coup de grace of the show would have been him, alone and broken, in jail, for the very real and horrible crimes he committed.

***** If that's what you want, just pretend that the show ended with the scene in the cabin. Treat everything afterwards as a meth-fueled delusion.

** I felt like the US House of Card's plot details and so forth was distinctly inferior to that in the UK original's. [[http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-943][Ferretbrain]] compared the two of them and liked the UK version better; having seen both I tend to agree.

** I agree on 'ruthless instrumentally rational', but not on utility maximizer.

Well I guess I do, for his very specific utility function.

**** Nah, judging by the first 4 episodes (the only ones I've seen) he could easily be much, much more evil. But I guess you could describe him as a power maximizer.

***** I agree. His utility function is, in D&D terms 'neutral'. I.e. it does not factor morality one way or the other
