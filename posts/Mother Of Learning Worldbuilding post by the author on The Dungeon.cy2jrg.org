** We're almost at the end so I don't imagine we'll be seeing a new plot thread about them going dungeon diving. Kind of a shame, could've been a cool adventure them going as deep as they could, finding out whats really down there.

*** While it would've been cool, it was also one of the few places that could have screwed up their minds or their souls.

**** Just send a simulacrum while chilling in a heavily warded room. Yeah there are still risks obviously. I am sure there are some monsters who can reach out from the simulacrum link to the original but I think the risk would be minimized. Time loop would have been perfect for that...

That is not safe. Simulacrums provide an avenue to attack the soul, and it's known that the deep Dungeon residents are extraordinarily magical. I would not be surprised at all if they have soul magic attacks that make the chrysanthemum look like a harmless little bunny rabbit.

I'm thinking an Eye Beast cranked up to 11 that straight up snuffs out the mind and soul just by looking at you.

***** Only Zorian would have been able to do that with any real benefit due to his soul relay. If any of Zach's simulcrum died, Zach would never learn how to avoid it the next time he tried.

*** You know there's story about ZZ exploring Ulquan Ibasa and many other stories. Original MoL was meant to have more story, specially about world building, but author cut those stories from main novel. If author write those as chapters MoL might be end years longer than the current one.
