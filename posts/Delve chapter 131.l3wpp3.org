** Pretty slow chapter with the usual padding, but it was more enjoyable than usual and there were some interesting new bits of info.

The situation with Dozer is really interesting. Despite being a monster that is assumed to be stupid or even lacking sentience, he is rapidly getting smarter and smarter. He can even sort of mind-talk with Rain through their connection, and is able to understand, carry out, and even verbalize orders. Very interesting. He's even targetable by monsters when Crystal Slimes normally aren't. The author is definitely setting something up big with Dozer, spending dozens of chapters on him and the mysteriousness of it all, just like with the soul-fuckery. I just wonder what's going to happen with it all. It would be disappointing if we get 50+ chapters of set up for these two elements just for them to be rather inconsequential. Either way, I do consider Dozer one of the more interesting and amusing parts of the story.

Brovose is surprisingly a good person despite his teammates. Hegar is a paranoid, violent, and selfish man, about to go off on Lana and the militia and laborers from just suspicions. Anton is a sociopath that loves killing and is clearly unhinged. Brovose seems to always be trying to defuse the two and protecting others from them, and he doesn't even get aggressive or tell Hegar when he notices Val spying. I wonder what's the deal with him, he definitely has a reason for hanging out with such people despite not being like them. Too bad he's probably going to die with them in their inevitable conflict and death against Ascension.

Do any Patreon readers know if the story is going to shift to actual Delving and uncapping, grinding, and leveling up in the Crack after they inevitably defeat the Crimson Gar? I'd love to get some more of that back.

*** If you want actual patreon spoilers:

The crew has decided that Tallheart, Ameliah, and Rain will delve with the goal of raising Rain's cap. That has not yet happened, but if patterns hold I suspect we'll get the first chapter of actual delving next week. I'm guessing it'll be at least a month of real-world time before Rain actually levels up again.

*** Dozer getting smarter is probably the perpetual winter effect, since that's what it did to dust, so non-sentient creatures seem to slowly work themself up to a baseline intelligence in the presence of rain.

** For anyone waiting to catch up with the story, keep waiting.

Nothing happens. The Dozer plot is pushed forward one micrometer.

This chapter could be purged from the story entirely and the story would be better off.

**** I disagree. This story could use 50-60% word count reduction, and become much better for it. For example, this entire chapter was flat, bland, and useless. If the character writing wasn't so bad, these chapters wouldn't be such a chore. If you can skip an entire massive chapter of a story and not even notice the difference, that chapter should not exist.

****** No. You saying 90% of the problem being update speed is personal preference. I'm saying that this story has multiple full chapters, as well as large chunks within chapters, that do not contribute anything to the story.

Slice of life chapters can be great. They can expand the world building, give insight into character development, foreshadow plot points, anything.

This chapter, for example, does nothing. The characters are flat, their interactions full of actual real world cringey memes. Nothing is expanded on or developed. Except what i mentioned earlier about the Dozer thing moving forward a micrometer, possibly.

With good character writing, these types of chapters can be sprinkled into a story to great effect. With bad character writing they are worse than useless. They are a chore to get through.

It seems like you consider your reading speed fast, so your argument sounds like you don't mind useless chapters because you don't spend a bunch of time on it. That's the definition of subjective criticism.

******** Practical guide to evil.

Tightly written, amazing character writing,

And I absolutely agree that the character writing in delve is cringe and always has been, from the start. But the thing is, in the early chapters there was more than just cringe character interaction, and the system in the story is interesting, well thought out, and fun to read about. When the only thing going in in the story is 40+ chapters of cringe character interaction, it's just bad story writing.

**** I'm convinced that if it uploaded 4 chapters worth of material once a month then there would be pretty much no complaints about pacing, other than the usual whining about levels

I am so tired of you people slandering anybody who wants to read progression in their progression fantasy as "whining about levels". This has to be breaking some of this sub's rules.

****** There also is literally nothing rational about this story, yet here it is, posted in the rational subreddit every week. I can see the tie in, when the story talks about rain and company min/maxing the system, but the VAST majority of the last 70 chapters had been flat, boring, one dimensional character interaction with cringey real world memes, and the author is frankly terrible at character writing.

The system is so interesting and the author steadfastly refuses to write about it.

******* I agree 100% with what you said. The problem is not so much with how it was written because is litRPG and this genre sucks, but the refusal of the author to not improve in what it is objectively the weak point of his story. In APGtE anyone can see how the author improves his (already decent) writing abilities and it took 3 books to reach his peak. Dont know how much word count delve has but the improvement is almost 0.

***** I dunno. I didn't mind when the story went slowly, but at this point it's just getting boring. It's not even that there's no progression. There's just nothing interesting happening with the plot or characters or anything, really. There's easily 4 filler chapters in a row of random meetings, and jumps to other character viewpoints and whatnot. I don't give a shit about the other characters, and it's not interesting seeing Rain mismanage meetings. The story itself just isn't going anywhere in particular at this point. It has nothing to do with a lack of numbers going up, at least for me.

*** What? This chapter:

- Furthers the Hegar/Lena conflict plotline by establishing that Rain's promise of protection to Lena is public knowledge among Ascension; that Ascension's plans for the Crack have been recognized by the Hegar's men; and that Hegar himself is aware of Rain's class, level and approximate capabilities. All of this sets the stage for the eventual confrontation between the two, both in terms of Rain not being able to back down (or appear to) without losing the trust of his followers and in terms of Hegar plausibly having a plan for taking down Rain in particular.

- Also establishes that the Rain/Ameliah relationship has become common knowledge among Ascension, laying the ground for future possibilities for Rain having to grapple with differing cultural expectations regarding of favoritism by leaders and relationship power disparities. Rain might have to deal with assumptions that he'd obviously manipulate the ledger system in his girl's favour, or get accused of hiding behind her power rather than being powerful in his own right, as local expectations of leadership expect he ought to be.

- Advances the Dozer plotline, like you said. But in the same scene, it also shows that even Ameliah (who is experienced with the ins and outs of a wide variety of skills) finds Rain's precise control and the interactions between Dozer and other monsters weird. Which reinforces a prior theme of the story, where rampant coordination problems have placed some pretty severe blinders on what even the more open-minded people in the setting think can be possible. Also shows us that this sort of system-manipulation isn't unique to Rain, as Jamus is also shown having disabled an automatic system message, calling back to a prior conversation between the two in which Rain gives Jamus the idea that this sort of thing is possible.

- Speaking of Jamus, it shows us what a normal Ascension patrol looks like, how said patrols normally interact with the militia, and how Jamus in particular is doing with regards to his family issues. I'm confident that all of these are going to come up again somewhere down the line, if only to show why the militia members (who clearly have mixed feelings about Ascension) might not be willing to involve themselves in a confrontation between Hegar and Rain, or why they might be willing to believe (like Val and Jamus believe of the Bank) that Ascension moving in on the Crack might represent them 'cutting and running' like the Mayor would be incentivized to spread rumours about after their conflict in the last chapter.

Yeah, it's all fuzzy and implicit. And yeah, in a serial like a Practical Guide to Evil, all of these plotlines would have been pared down to some gossip that Rain overhears rather than fully played out for the reader. But that's a stylistic choice and I honestly prefer this way of writing things - it's one of the reasons I check this out every Saturday but couldn't get into PGtE personally. Different strokes for different folks.

***** yeah I haven't even read the chapter yet and, except for the monster taming stuff, none of this is anything I didn't already know.

I get that "show don't tell" is something every author tries to do, but Delve just suffers way too much from the author trying to show every single goddamn thing. There's zero trust that the audience will pick up on subtext /at all/, so everything is just text. A hell of a lot of text.
