The new chapter is [[http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/138812496312/ch-8-fragile-things][here]]. Previous chapters are [[http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818575647/a-voice-across-the-void][here]].

This is a very short chapter, mostly because of pacing; the plot needs to inch along slightly before the start of chapter 9.


** To offer a counterpoint, I think that the focus on a single court's politics is the reason that I check this story for updates so frequently. One of the biggest flaws in the Star Wars EU is that politics happens only on the galactic scale. Exploring what it means for a planet to have a change of regime is really interesting to me.

(The specter of Kreia in the background is laughing at the idea that the planetary politics are somehow separate from galactic politics. But from my point of view, the scope of the plot doesn't have to escalate to cosmic-level-threats in order to be interesting. That is doubly true for stories where there's only 9 published chapters.)

I've been following the story since chapter one. Since the first couple of chapters, the plot has done little but inch.

That sounds terrible so I'll quickly point out that I do like the story, but not how it's happening. That's why I'm commenting. Hope I have your attention now, because chapters one and two hooked me, and chapters three through eight have almost lost me.

--------------

Maybe my thoughts are off and I'm totally off base. But this is my honest reaction so far to the story.

I'm not one to talk about a story having pacing issues. I'm really not. But I am here. Because you mentioned this latest chapter was /for that purpose/, and because I like the idea of what I thought this story was about when I first started reading it. And I'm still not sure I'm wrong about what the story /was/ about.

Author, please. Please make a story world that I care about, with characters for whom I wish either success or failure. This latest drama...does nothing for me. It is a moral issue and a test of character, sure, but I don't /care/ about the MC that much (yet) that it hold my interest whether he fucks up or not.

I care about the setting, because that's always what's interesting in Star Wars. I care about the effects of someone getting Sith training in the Old Republic. I care about the order at large dealing with the loser MC suddenly taking a level in Badass.

I don't care about his new master, the other students (how many of those are there again?), the problems of this planet, or even the MC's old or new crushes. (Take that, Valentine's Day.)

Hell, I cared about the holocron more than I have the MC and his problems so far. This tiny world's tiny problems are tiny. I crave big plots. This guy is going against the entire Jedi Order's teachings. I need that to mean something, soon.

What is the intended promise of this story meant to be? Is it being fulfilled? I don't know. But I do know that I want awesome, and tiny world's tiny court politics is Lucas'ing the awesome out of the story for me.

--------------

Hope that reader reaction helps you. Hope you keep writing, even if it isn't something I'll dig.

I understand where you are coming from, but, strange as this may sound, your request is unreasonable. I am writing about a world /I/ care about. This may be a world you care about, but maybe not. It really depends on whether we care about the same things.

I care about court politics and crushes old and new. I care about the experience of being torn apart, having your reason and emotion at odds. I do not care about "taking a level in Badass."

Let me turn your request around. Perhaps /you/ should be the one to write something about a world that you care about. You are the only one who can do it right.

**** I won't argue the validity of my opinions. That's pointless. They're just opinions. But I will point out that, based on your response, I think you misunderstood what I was actually saying.

I'm saying that your story has problems with thematic consistency and audience promises, especially at the start.

--------------

/Theme/ to me is what the setting and characters focus on, ideas that progress and change. This is one way a reader will choose a story, by seeing if it is about ideas or messages that interest them, or if they like they way the narrative style works overall on a totally new idea.

/Audience/ or /reader promises/ are things that are suggested will happen later by the narrative form and focus, or even outright stated by a character; in a skillful story, tropes and themes are played with at the start of a story to entice the reader to continue by promising them resolutions they'll like and a journey they'll enjoy.

--------------

By confirming what you meant to do with the story, you verified my opinion that the start of the story was misleading.

I'm not /just/ asking for my perfect story, with all the things I like--which I don't think is an unreasonable request. Why wouldn't I want that? And if someone doesn't point out what they felt was missing, maybe you don't realize what you were writing wasn't having the effect you thought it was. But let's put that aside.

I'm saying I /thought/ this was a different story. I expected Sith and Jedi Code to collide early and often. I expected a witch hunt for a heretic, a ideological struggle between students and Masters, or a growing Sith crisis and a test of faith between a system of order that hated change, and chaos, freedom, and truth offered by people driven mad by the same.

That was my expectation based on what I initially read. I felt big things were promised by someone being seduced by an ancient Sith device in the first chapter, breaking with the Jedi Code, and striking off with reason and a deeper understanding (maybe) of a part of the Force than anyone else but very skilled Masters of the Order--and that the story was being posted in [[/r/rational]].

I wasn't expecting six chapters of small-+town+ planet court intrigue, or other things you (and others, obviously) seem to like.

--------------

In short, I don't see this story so far as representing a good understanding of the audience you drew with the first two chapters, [[/r/rational]] linking, and this summary:

#+begin_quote
  A padawan comes across an ancient Sith holocron during an archaeological field trip and keeps the discovery secret from his masters.
#+end_quote

The secret hasn't come up /as a secret/ in six chapters. The Masters don't seem to be interacting with him at all anymore, what he did or learned doesn't seem to have mattered, and the holocron hasn't shown up again either. I feel I was promised something and am being given something else. I think, as an author myself, that it is important to give feedback on this sort of thing when public comment is sought.

It also isn't giving me the rational-fic buzz I want. I'm not getting why their plans are smart applications of their skill set. I'm not getting why they are in this situation, what they'll get out of it, and where they think they're ultimately going. I don't see a challenge to be defeated or an objective to be ultimately won. I don't see either the building tension around, or clues to, a larger plot. I feel I was just told /there isn't one/.

And that makes me sad. I thought you should know.

--------------

Write what you want, but please be aware of your audience and what effect your writing has on them.

This has been my story about what I've experienced reading your story. It is what I'd want someone to write about my writing. That's why I was careful to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding something, because I wanted my feedback to be based on the reality of what was actually being written, not my own ideas about a reality not well checked and verified.

Again, I hope you take this as evidence for what it is: an honest reader reaction. If I feel this way about the story, it is unlikely I'm alone. Do with this knowledge what you will.

You are not alone. I too feel like the story has yet to deliver on its implicit promises. That said, I still maintain enough of an interest to continue reading, and there is potential for the current plot to resolve in an interesting way.

Take for example the end of the previous chapter: I think that it can be classified as what [[/u/ZoltanBerrigomo]] calls "having your reason and emotion at odds", which fits with what I expect from a [[/r/rational]] fic about a Jedi having a crisis of faith (among other things). Of course that particular instance can more accurately be described as crushing victory of emotion over reason, but you can't deny that they're technically at odds in the scene.

Perhaps this whole current plot is building up to re-examination of Jedi stance on detachment and how the situation would have developed if the protagonist didn't have an attack of hormone-induced motivated cognition. Perhaps we will see a more thorough exploration of utilitarian ethics and consequentialism, and how actions that make one feel like a monstrous villain can still be the best course of action from a wider perspective, not to mention how the dark side of the Force factors into this. It looks to me like [[/u/ZoltanBerrigomo]] /is/ interested in all of that, so I'm mildly optimistic.

***** I hope you'll understand if I don't reply to all of the above.

An opening about a padawan who discovers forbidden teachings may be leading in to a story about using these teachings to grow in strength and overpower all who stand in his way; /or/ it may be leading in to a story about being conflicted about said teachings and having to make genuinely difficult choices to reconcile them; /or/ something else entirely.

It sounds like you became convinced one of these possibilities would take place and grew disappointed when the story turned out to be different than you expected. I'm sorry for it, but the fault is entirely yours for leaping to a conclusion that was not warranted.

I think that is a lot of (oddly specific) things to expect based on a beginning which can really go in multiple directions.

No, what I was saying wasn't specific items in an inclusive list, any of which I would miss if not included. I used the word "or," which indicates possibly exclusive or partial lists of items. I was attempting to strongly imply these were some of /many/ possible directions within a specific thematic area.

I was giving out tropes as examples of what your story told me was going to happen, based on the first two chapters. I wasn't saying those tropes were the ones I was personally expecting.

You are wrong about what I'm trying to say. You aren't reading what I'm writing. You're dismissing arguments I'm not making, and not echoing back my own arguments but making up your own and then dismissing them in confusing ways. And then there's this.

This is an incredibly rude way to react to detailed constructive criticism. Also, you appear to be making irrational assumptions as to my goals and motives.

Perhaps you are still reading into later dialog what I first wrote. I'll take one more shot at this, then I think I'm done. If this is a simple misunderstanding, fine. If this is yet another reading comprehension issue with someone on reddit, screw it. Talk to the void for all I care.

--------------

I was initially commenting on a work in progress and adding in my own hopes and fears as well as my reaction to what I'd read so far.

Once told it wasn't the sort of story that I was expecting, I explained my reasoning and reactions only, no longer asking for certain results. I explained why I subjectively felt what I did. I explained how, objectively, my experience was one that could and should be avoided by a writer.

You are failing to respond to that in a way that shows you've even read and understood what I've written, while acting like you have.

I'm not sure I can care any further how you deal with it, but please at least acknowledge to yourself that you can lose an audience because of the cultural context of your work, especially /this/ audience. Being aware of who your audience is and how they'll react is important, and should shape the way you write. I don't see any glimmer of understanding of that from how you're responding here.

Acknowledged! Losing a subset of my audience is something I actively desire.

A story is a very personal thing.

I have an ideal reader in mind when I write. Among other things, not only is my ideal reader predisposed to read a bildungsroman -- with its attendant smorgsabord of crushes old and new -- but he/she finds the inter-personal dynamics of a small community interesting. Based on what you wrote above, that reader is very much the opposite of you.

#+end_quote

My ideal reader would be sufficiently well-read to understand how ridiculous it is to say that a story *told* them something was going to happen in the opening chapters. This reader understands that fiction is complicated -- that stories can set up expectations to subvert them -- that stories can touch on a theme only to seemingly abandon it for a while, before coming back again to cast it in a new light.

Hopefully, the reader who is far from my ideal reader will quickly figure out my story isn't for them.

Occasionally, some such person will read on for a while before realizing they won't find much that interests them .

I make no effort to predict or avoid this. Every word is written with my ideal reader in mind.

It isn't that I want you to have a bad time, TimeLoopedPowerGamer -- I do not, honestly. But the quality of your experience is not in my utility function.
