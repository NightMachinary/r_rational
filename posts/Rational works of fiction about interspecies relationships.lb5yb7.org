So I know that there a lot of works of fiction that feature interspecies romance where members of two different species fall in love with each other. But one thing that I noticed is that most stories never explore the perils of an interspecies relationship. They never seem to take the time to explore how members of two different species are able to overcome their biological and psychological differences.

For example in Star Trek Vulcans go through a biological process called the pon farr, where they have to mate with another Vulcan otherwise they suffer from a violent nervous breakdown. Therefore the Vulcan government tries to encourage other Vulcans to mate with their own kind rather than with other species. However, Star Trek media has shown that a Vulcan can take up a non-Vulcan as their mate, but they never show how such a pairing is able to deal with biological issues like the pon farr and how such couples are able to meet each others emotional and physical needs.

That being said according to TV tropes there are a few works of fiction that explore how interspecies couples are able to meet each other's emotional needs and/or physical needs. Some examples include: Mass Effect (Tali/Shepard), Foreigner (Bren/Jago), Lost Girl (Bo/Lauren) and Gargoyles (Goliath/Elisa). There are also works of fiction that touches on the complications and perils that can arise from such relationships these include: Star Wars rogue squadron, and wraith squadron novels, the crystal star, Star Trek: Voyager: The Disease, Hyperdrive, and Mass Effect 2.

Does anyone else know of any other fictional media that explores the difficulties of an interspecies relationship and/or how said romantic partners are able to overcome these difficulties?

Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex.

There's actually quite a lot of SF literature that addresses alien sex and romance from a rational perspective, from the frivolous in Harlan Ellison's “How's the Night Life on Cissalda” to stories where people damage their health trying to live with nonhumans with diverse biochemistry.

** Octavia Butler's [[https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Xenogenesis-Trilogy-Book-1-ebook/dp/B008HALOEQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=octavia+butler+dawn&qid=1612314893&sr=8-1][Dawn]] fits the bill pretty well, though it's not purely a relationship story.

edit: minor spoilers for story (nothing past chapter 2): it has an explanation for why the fuck an alien species would want to mate (or even be able to mate) with a different alien species, but isn't a deconstruction of the trope.

I will also link [[https://www.xenothesis.com/][The Xenothesis podcast]] which is similar in format to We Want Worm, We Want MoR, and We Want MoR Superman but with Dawn instead of Worm, Methods of Rationality, or Metropolitan Man.

** You might check out Axiom's End by Lindsey Ellis. The human and alien kinda end up in the relationship by accident and are now trying to navigate through it. Plus it's really smart and set in 90s nostalgia.

As an older throwback, the Freedom trilogy by Anne McCaffrey does this, navigating the needs of a colony vs. the relationship vs. the distrust for the alien since he's part of the race that enslaved everyone.

** Interesting. For me the topic of interspecies relationships has always seemed off. Yea, okay, if all the alies look hot by human standards with big tits and dicks, but that's more like a racial thing, as 99% of aliens in SF are humanoid colored humans with minor cosmetic differences. But how many people do you see around shouting "damn, this goat is hot, would like to tap that" or "I hope to have babies with a shark"? That is interspecies for me.

*** Second for Homestuck, it was the first thing to come to mind on this topic. Although big disclaimer in it being a sprawling clusterfuck of a story that's hard to actually get into on account of both how dense it is, and how long the "introduction" segment is. Like it took me something like 3 or 4 attempts to push past enough of it to get to where it actually hits its stride when I read it the first time (followed by me spending weeks catching up to date with literal years of backlog). I'd make a joke here about prepping for a Homestuck read like a World of Warcraft player prepping for an expansion launch, cooked dishes ready, water bottles on hand, well rested, weekend stretching ahead of you, etc. But that would have a little bit of truth to it tbh

Also, tangent, but the majority of other sci-fi and fantasy media focusing on only couples in interspecies relationships, rather than a huge range of other possible relationship structures, some of which humans already do in polyamorous relationships and the like, always struck me as underwhelming. Like I understand writing relationship structure alongside an interspecies relationship is an exponential increase in workload, but at the same time, why can't Mass Effect let me romance all of the hot aliens at once?

ROMANTIC relationships are evolutionary traits. They are there so we have sex and reproduce (and raise offspring in stable enviroment), which is evolutionary purpouse of human beings. There are "fetishes" that makes individual attraced to different species but that is rare and unhealthy behavior.

Homosexuality got adopted by evolution because of cultures living and working together so they serve an evolutionary purpose. Vulkans did not evolve with us, so noone outside spefic "fetish" would be sexually attraced to them except if they looked like humans.

If you can reproduce without problem with an alien, then they are same species as us, as biology dictates, so NONE of the examples you mentioned are cross species sexual relationships. Can you imagine romantic relationship with an alien from "Arrival"? Or bugs from "Starship troopers" ?

My point is that sexual and romatic relationship is biological, not intelectual. And biology dictates reproduction. Any kind of relationship with those kind of aliens can be mearly friendship or a strange "fetish".

Evolution "likes" different things to see what works what doesnt so we get all sorts of sexualities, but in the end is still biological and human species survived for a reason, its because we are sexually attraced to those we can reproduce with.

That's one definition of “species,” and it's no more objectively correct than any other definition, because it's a label intended to assist categorization. There is no such actual thing as a “species,” in the same way that there is no such actual thing as “France.”
