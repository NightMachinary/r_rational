Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** What is the [[/r/rational]] response to the current reddit drama happening? It seems like a good chunk of reddit is currently striking against the admins and I want to know how this community feels on the issue.

*** First, for anyone who is out of the loop, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/][this post]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/][this post]].

I think the mods are generally justified in thinking that reddit as a company has gotten pretty awful about interacting with the community that makes up the lifeblood of this website.

The mods are engaging in a sort of brinksmanship with the admins, trying to get their demands met, but it's impossible to know whether this is going to work, because though the admins have responded, it was the same response that they give every time they fuck something up, which is part of the problem; lots of empty words and promises of vague action.

I think the average user doesn't care, except to the extent that it interferes with their ability to consume content or participate in discussion. It totally doesn't affect this subreddit, which has a low enough traffic volume that the concerns of the default mods are basically moot.

*** The main complaint is that the admins aren't communicating properly with the mod teams. A legitimate concern for the default mods (/especially/ [[/r/IAmA]], since it's the main subreddit that's known outside Reddit and the one that the admins should be taking responsibility for). But the mods of a small subreddit like [[/r/rational]] don't expect the admins to keep them informed anyway, and they're not in a position to judge whether they're doing a good job.

The rest is internal politics of a company that doesn't matter to us either.

*** Looks like reddit screwed up the handoff between their previous community liason and whoever the current one is. It's a mistake, but it's the kind of mistake companies make all the time. I've seen big sales fall through because a sales person (who gave two weeks notice!) who left wasn't asked the right questions or wasn't given a good procedure for handing off potential clients, or because someone was fired but the company wasn't smart enough about figuring out what the person was doing and wiped their computer or something and therefore lost contracts.

Seems like a major mistake since this person was basically providing the support to keep a few subreddits running. Doesn't impact me in the slightest so I don't care.

**** The argument is that this very poorly handled transition is a symptom of a larger problem, which is that reddit doesn't seem to care that much about the thousands of moderators that do the bulk of the work involved in running the site, and in general handle communication with the community (their primary commodity) in an asinine way.

***** Wow, that's pretty awful. Yeah, I could see how this shows there's an underlying problem with how reddit interacts with the users. I assume the way reddit makes money is by showing ads, which means that the "product" is reddit's userbase. You curate that product by making sure you meet the community's needs.

If you're gonna fire the person responsible for coordinating AMAs and not have someone ready to go, or a good transition in place, then the ensuing shitshow is pretty much predictable.

Edit: Again, yeah it doesn't impact me but it's a bad sign in general. I like reddit and hope they don't go out of business or go "dark" or something due to people leaving.

** I was thinking to grow the readership of [[/r/rational]] it might make sense to cross-post our stories to other places. The author (if they so choose) can link to [[/r/rational]] as a place where the author will engage in discussions. I've spent a little bit of time finding sites that might work and found out there are a huge amount of places to post. I have no idea what the quality of those places is like (though they often assure me they are the largest and best sites heh). Also, having to post to all those different sites would be a massive hassle (especially if you like to edit things after you post). So it might be necessary to develop a simple tool that could upload/edit on all these sites for us (may have to make sure that doesn't violate a EULA or something) in order to reasonably expect authors to go this route. If we go for a truly huge amount of sites, it might even be necessary to have some kind of automated sign up system. Also there may be annoyances involving character limitations.

Anyway here is a list (in no particular order) of places I've found after some searching:

** Rationality in real life.

I know a lot of us here know at least a little bit about rationality and themes associated with it. What I want to know is, beyond discussions and spitballing, can you guys give me some examples of where you've been able to use rationalist (and generally intelligent) methods in life to actually accomplish something, whether that's a Quirrellmort-esque manipulation of someone or figuring your way into your car after locking your keys inside with only a paperclip and 3 rubber bands.

So, anyone have any cool examples of when you've used these sorts of methods to actually accomplish something impressive? Something the layman may have not been able to, because they weren't armed with your way of thinking?

(also, unrelated question for [[/u/alexanderwales]], this isn't really the inaugural post anymore, right? :P)

*** personally, there have been a lot of times when i've repeated some-or-another mantra and acted differently in some minor way. for example, there have been many occasions where i've considered bringing one or another small object on a trip, but don't want to have to go through the trouble of finding it; reminding myself of my own time discounting has paid off more than a few times. the litany of gendlin has been useful in fixing several personality flaws, and i think i am generally a much better person now because of it. and so on.

probably more dramatically: i suffered from depression for about half a year, and i'd say that "rationality" -- or in general, the ability to think through consequences relatively dispassionately -- made it significantly easier to resist thoughts of suicide/self-harm. additionally it was various forms of algorithmic introspection that helped me realize that i /was/ depressed, and seek appropriate medication.

i've flitted between online communities before, fairly frequently, and this is the only one that i've felt any sort of real belonging with. it might not be as concrete as "rationality helped me in x way", but i do think that the social consequences are a part of this that's just as important/beneficial as the actual real-world effects. the enjoyment i gain from reading this sub, ssc, lw, and so on is non-trivial.

*** It helps me to get my butt in gear when I need something done.

I've used rationalist thinking (I hope it qualifies as rationalist) to plan out what I needed done and to use some Cognitive Science tricks to think of novel solutions and to properly discriminate between my options on their advantages and disadvantages. It's helped me to decide on what I actually want to do with my life (Cog Sci research since that's something easy for me that's actually worthwhile to do with a strong helping of Comp Sci as a secondary options if things fall through) and to improve myself (signing up for Cryo, exercising for better health, and being better at socializing).

I made having a good life my goal and used the rationality I've learned from here and other sources to achieve it.

***** Only technically yes and that's if you squint really hard as well. I'm a rising junior in college now and I'm doubling majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. So I plan on going into AI research in the future, but the only experience I have with actual AI is programming one to be a good player at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi][Reversi]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four][Connect-Four]], and other games which is as basic as you can possibly get with AI.

I think I'm ~70% likely to be involved with some sort of AI research after college because I am spending my summer right now coding a very basic language model processor/analyzer for /Cognitive Science/ and I'm joining a Computer Science AI research track group next semester.

What's it like to be in a research group? It's a lot like being a college student except you have no guarantee that the problems will be adjusted to your level of knowledge and you can 'cheat' by working with others. After all solving the problem by myself or by working with others are both perfectly acceptable things to do. It feels like being in a pass/fail class.

First I have to spend a large amount of my time learning more about the background knowledge which is relevant to the problem. Even people who already know a lot about their field have to do this too so they can summarize the relevant literature in their papers when appropriate and to keep current on any new research papers which relates to their project to avoid needless repetition (as opposed to when they are replicating other experiments deliberately).

Second I have to plan out in some detail with others how I intended to solve the problem. For my summer project the strategy ended up as coding up a lot of tests and building my [[https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture][language models]].

Finally I needed to collect a lot of data in the form of surveys and from a lot of online sources. All of the previous parts were fun, but this is the boring part where I repeat a lot of the same actions over and over and where I'm currently at for my project.

Even though I'm not actually working on an AI, I'm planning to and I hope this response helped you to get an idea of what research groups are like.

It's a nice, relaxing card game that sometimes feels like a more casual version of Magic: The Gathering (but online, obviously). Europa Universalis is my other go-to computer game, but I haven't touched it in a while. And I bought a season pass for Life is Strange when it came out, but haven't gotten around to playing the most recent episodes yet.

Something like Portal ... you're probably better off looking at indie games, which is where most of the cool, cerebral stuff is happening. Portal had the benefit of having a wicked cool concept, extremely high production values, and good writing, all assembled into a single game. There's not much that matches it, in my opinion. Braid is a wildly different game, but I would suggest it as being similar in the sense that it scratches the same itch.

What further struck me is that the organization was morally bankrupt within a few years of its inception.

There's a really good point made in [[https://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf][this MIRI paper]]:

#+begin_quote
  Viewing history through the lens of hindsight, we vastly underestimate the cost of preventing catastrophe. In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded for reasons eventually traced to an O-ring losing flexibility at low temperature (Rogers et al. 1986). There were warning signs of a problem with the O-rings. But preventing the Challenger disaster would have required, not attending to the problem with the O-rings, but attending to /every/ warning sign which seemed as severe as the O-ring problem, /without benefit of hindsight./
#+end_quote

In hindsight, the warning signs that the 9/11 attack was coming seem perfectly obvious. However, without hindsight, you have to sift through /every possible warning sign/, distinguishing signal from an enormous amount of noise.

As far as the efficacy of secret police, I point to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine's_laws#Celine.27s_First_Law][Celine's First Law.]] As any proponent of open source technology can tell you, the "security through obscurity" model is inherently flawed and hopelessly brittle.

**** Let me see, if I understand Celine's First Law correctly: 1. We want "national security", which means a defense against terrorism and foreign spies. 2. We create a secret police, which can use above-the-law methods to counter terrorists and spies. 3. This secret police naturally becomes the primary target of its enemies and quickly corrupt. 4. We need another secret police to police the first one. 5. Reductio ad paranoia.

My big question is if the first step is really necessary. Do you really need above-the-law methods to counter terrorism and spies? You could use a pure intelligence service, which only collects and analyses information but has no right to arrest anybody. The arresting and violent stuff can be left to the normal police. This is pretty much the situation in Germany, but we are in an "unnatural" position due to the second world war.

I would say that the answer is no, and that this is the point Celine's First Law was intended to illustrate: as soon as you subvert the principles of a system-- even with the intention of preserving that same system-- everything following from that subversion will also be inherently harmful to the system. Exceptions set precedents, cease to be exceptions, and become policy.

Secrecy is highly conducive to misbehavior. Secret misbehavior will lead to more misbehavior.

*** I think you first need to justify having a secret police in the first place. The big reason that all agencies like that go rogue is that they don't have accountability, and it's impossible to give them that accountability when secrecy is built into their foundations.

I somewhat suspect that a more open and transparent police would result in better results, even if it reduces the ability to actively protect the nation. But obviously all the data I'd need to reach a real conclusion is classified, so ...

**** President Roosevelt created it when ge needed an arm which could reach from Washington to a bunch of real-estate and mining moguls who were "raping the west". It's definitely true that sometimes the normal police are inadequate, and also true that a big nation /must/ have some form of counter-spy operations.

But a lot of the problems with the FBI are fixable-fundamental, not unfixable-fundamental, such as the highly localized organization of the regional offices or the shared hatred between them and the CIA. This before you get into incentives like "The intelligence agency never says the threat is over, because then their budget will be cut."

There has to be /a/ solution, some robust system or layout which keeps the agency on track with fredom to do its job.

  Instead of transparently enforcing the rule of law and being subject to public scrutiny as ordinary police agencies do, secret police organizations are specifically intended to operate beyond and above the law in order to suppress political dissent through clandestine acts of terror and intimidation (such as kidnapping, coercive interrogation, torture, internal exile, forced disappearance, and assassination) targeted against political enemies of the ruling authority.

** *Quick thought: Meta-Bayesian analysis?*

I've just realized I've been thinking about a problem in a way I don't recall seeing mentioned elsewhere: "I know that, given all the data I have and unlimited computing power, there is one particular best-guess I can make about how confident I should be that the answer is 'yes'. On the other hand, I don't have unlimited computing power. On the gripping hand, some quick analysis suggests that I can be more confident that a 5% confidence in the main question's 'yes' is the better answer than a 95% confidence."

Put another way: Instead of merely picking a confidence-level for the answer, such as 'I'm 5% sure this is true', pick confidence-levels for the confidence levels, such as "I'm 90% sure that I should be between 0 and 25% sure, 5% sure that I should be between 25% and 50% sure, and 5% sure that I should be between 50% and 100% sure."

Has such an approach been previously discussed, in the LW blogosphere or in probability reference texts? Does anyone else already use this approach? Is it a viable approach?

(If you're curious, it was the discussion of the Fermi Paradox in the Rational Horror thread that set my mind on the path to explicitly realizing what I've been implicitly thinking; and I'm considering adding some mention of this in the novel I'm almost back to writing daily again.)

*** Jaynes does a "probability of a probability" deal(chapter 18, PT:TLoS), but IIRC it was mostly about storing beliefs in a machine without storing the entire inference chain that produced them.

The first example he gives is that although you'd assign 1/2 probability to "this coin will come up heads" and "there is life on mars" absent other information, we have other information that tells us that we should change our beliefs much more drastically upon discovering a martian microbe than upon observing a heads result from a coin toss.

You could do it with a modal logic too. Suppose you don't know the bias of a coin, but you are aware that coins are usually close to fair. Then you believe that you should believe the bias of the coin is around 50%, but you also believe you might be correct in believing it is strongly biased.

*** I've read Timebraid a total of three times. I generally enjoy the story except for the badly written and frankly creepy relationship stuff.

The story would have been better if Naruto was eliminated and Sakura was the only one looping.

**** I was fine with Fall of Doc Future, but when the AI in Skybreaker's Call magically turned out to be an attractive female humanoid (with humanoid sexuality, really?) who wanted to join the menage I couldn't read another paragraph. The dual mutually-obsessive relationship was masturbatory enough.

I've only read Time Braid twice, but the looping Naruto and their weird-ass relationship is definitely the worst part of it. I also enjoyed the Yggdrasil setting details much more before I found out it was an A!MG crossover.

Edit: I forgot that in Time Braid, the characters are all twelve or so, which makes the weird sex stuff even weirder. Like, seriously creepy.

**** Every time I read the book again, I'm amazed anew at how awesome it is! Sakura vs. Sasuke in the Forest of Death--Sakura vs. Akatsuki at the City of the Gods--Sakura writing seals on her own soul--Sakura inventing lava-based ninjutsu--there's just no end to how much I love this story!

(Also, I tend to read books in general several times--I've read /The Three Musketeers/, /Robinson Crusoe/, and /Methods of Rationality/* four times each, for example.)

*Though three of those read-throughs were executed when the story wasn't yet complete, so I guess they don't count...
