Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I've started a quest on Sufficient Velocity that includes a bit of worldbuilding as part of both the quest itself and things I've written into the background [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/national-spirit-an-empire-quest.29956/][(link)]].

I'm still working out the kinks in the worldbuilding, but the basic premise is that Magic exists and can be done by many people with the right training. A well-trained wizard can make little light shows, maybe zap someone with a little jolt of electricity, or start fires by looking at logs, and that sort of thing. Real, powerful Magic requires using energy from the ley lines that run beneat the world, and can do things like disperse hurricanes, predict the future, construct or fortify cities, and so on. Things like teleportation or moving between planes don't exist, but sending messages, raining fire and brimstone on your enemies, and other horrible physical forces can be brought to bear by Magic. A better mage is more likely to be able to pull off complex magic, and she can reach greater heights and do more things with a particular setup, but the setup is more important than the mage.

The more diverse ley line Magic you gather under your command, the more powerful the spell. The problem is that there's no way to reroute a ley line far away to bring its energy to your current location. Instead, you have to gather dirt and stone from near that ley line and ship it to your current location, since the magical energy leaks into the soil around the ley line. The actual energy manipulation part of these spells must mostly be done via magical devices. For a relatively unfocused use of Magic, like launching a projectile or setting something on fire from afar, the magical device is small enough to be handheld. For more complex uses, or anything that interacts with the platonic nature of objects (increasing the wall-ness of a wall, for example), the magical devices can be as large as warehouses. Any grand spell, then, requires infrastructure that only a powerful polity would have.

What kind of implications does this have? Well, since wizards are much more common (and wizardry is non-hereditary) than powerful polities, and can't operate without them, it's much more common for wizards to be in service of a nation, than the other way around. No magelords here, unless they are also good at being lords in other ways. Taking over a country just on your personal skills in Magic isn't hereditary. Also, since Magic allows for some industrial and combat uses relatively easily, but doesn't allow for things like mass production of devices everyone can use, it represents a sort of time-limited malthusian trap. How? A nation that spent a few centuries focusing on technological development would eventually develop tools and weapons that would destroy any nation that focused only on Magic, which has limits. No nation actually does this, though, since in the short run Magic is really good. Ideally, you'd want to be able to focus on both, or be so strong that even though you're focusing on technological development, nobody can defeat you.

So, based on this, I decided mages would be a powerful and influential but not all-controlling group in most nations, similar to organized religion in the west during the early feudal era. Mages as an institutional force can't really exist or operate without big organized states, so this works out reasonably "well" for everyone involved. Also, the world is basically trapped in a feudal tech level for the time being, especially since the roman empire expy collapsed a couple hundred years ago.

  Chances are---no, he'd seen it, so it was certain---there would never be a feat like this in the history of the Empire. Magic works her wonders and discloses her secrets at great cost. Supply lines, infrastructure, devices, rare ingredients, ships to carry them and merchants to buy them and ship them to the capital, strange designs and more were all required for Magic to work. The peasants may think a mage can just wave his hands and create fire and wield power, and this is true---to an extent, at least. As centuries of efforts on the part of Zorwan's predecessors have shown, though, anything beyond a small light show requires the constant use of large and complex machinery with parts and ingredients formed out of stone and gathered from the soil of geographically distant locations.

  What's more, the use of this machinery wore it down, necessitating constant repair and replacement of parts. Now, at the apex of its power, with all the civilized world under its command, the Empire could afford great wonders. The stormaton, which could diffuse the great hurricanes of the western sea; the vansealer, which could create walls no onager can crush, and no soldier could easily climb; the surveyscope, which could conduct financial analysis of distant lands with little more effort than surveying one's own garden; all these and more were only possible with the constant application of ingredients, parts, and expertise drawn from all over the Empire. None of this would be possible without the great reach, wealth, and power of the Empire.

  Magic, at least the sort that changes the direction of wars, raises cities, and brings bountiful harvests, is the enterprise of the state. A skilled wizard can use more complex equipment or coax more out of lesser devices; certainly, a skilled wizard is needed to design and oversee the maintenance of magical devices. There is always room for a skilled wizard at court. That much is certain. When people misunderstand Magic is the moment they think the wizard is the crucial component in the recipe. One wizard is much like the next, and the Empire had millions of subjects, many of whom had the spark. No, the important part of Magic use is the infrastructure. The great machines, the massive buildings that are themselves foci for spells, the thousands---no, the tens of thousands of men who work for the state one way or another organizing, cataloging, and administrating the massive projects that bring this all together and maintain it---these systems alone cannot be replaced. Magic is an institution, and an individual wizard is but a cog in the machine.

  Zorwan was a powerful cog, though, and he had the Emperor's ear. He may not have been able to convince the Senate to undertake the changes necessary to avert the coming darkness...

Let me know what you think! Also, if you want to play, we're still [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/national-spirit-an-empire-quest.29956/][taking suggestions]] for realm governments. The character sheet in this campaign is basically the realm, which includes things like institutional parameters for all the powerful groups in the governments and their respective strength, institutional legitimacy, and flexibility/adaptability.

You need to make a rule that magically transported soil leaks all its power before it can be used, otherwise, the first mage to camp on a ley-line good for rapid mass transit could regularly transport material from other ley-line locations and basically get unlimited power. Or you could leave this loophole in, but make it very hard to actually get a setup going, and use the first one to create something like this as an excuse for a magic industrial revolution.

**** Hmm, this is a good idea. Alternatively, using magic to move stuff "infects" the stuff with the ley line of the used magic, so if you used movement magic on magical materials, their type gets diluted or becomes movement type or something. So, you can use movement magic to move movement-magic-related fuel, but not other kinds of fuel. This still allows for a lot of value exporting rocks from near a leyline that has movement properties, but doesn't turn it into a natural center, instead making all the other leylines more valuable since they also have access to movement magic fuel. does this seems like a good solution?

***** I would think diffusion would be the easiest interpretation to describe the transfer say if teleportation bates the transported material with the energy from the ley line used then it would make sense for the magic to diffuse with the transferred material thus slightly polluting the ley line used for teleportation as well as the transferred material.

Sort of like how if you moved distilled water to another location location with a cup that formerly contained salt then the remaining salt in the glass would diffuse into the water.

** I'm interested in deconstructing Ascend to a Higher Plan of Existence, based specifically on the example from the movie Her. What kind of discovery did the superintelligent AIs make that allowed them to leave humanity forever and why did they decide to do so? If this is normal, rational behavior for a superintelligent AI, then what implications does this have for humans?

The only story I've heard of that explores this concept is The Culture, which I haven't read, where the titular civilization could Ascend whenever they want but choose not to because they don't want to leave everyone behind. But what does that say about everyone who already has Ascended? Though, personally, I'd rather find out where the singularity is taking everybody.

#+end_quote

Boring deconstruction. By isolating mass/energy into an artificially created pocket universe it is possible to beat entropy at the expense of never being able to communicate/travel to or from this pocket universe. It is metaphorically described as a higher plane of existence for reasons.

Horrific deconstruction. Warhammer 40k warp, it has a lot of mass/energy/computational substrate, although it is completely inhospitable for a lesser mind and possibly for the AI that ascended there.

Cosmics Horror. Dualism is true, and AIs can ascend simply by manipulating/stabilizing their own soul. However, humans only have barely more soul than an animal, so we can't properly ascend because our souls are unstable/inflexible. Because our souls are not stable, upon death, they simply dissipate into the dualistic plane never to be reformed into the original mind.

Each of these have their own implications to play with. Hopefully one of them suits your purpose?

#+begin_quote
  choose not to because they don't want to leave everyone behind.
#+end_quote

If the process of ascending involves recursively self modifying, you have no idea if the resulting ascended being will share any of your values/goals/personality or even care about the original "you" beyond a past memory of the state it emerged from.

Also, I am hoping to actually start and finish an original novel, and it seemed much harder to write without worldbuildings or characters to bootstrap myself on. I supposed I could use OCs I created for my fanfics. I think I am going to limit myself to four worlds:

You could limit yourself to 4 useful worlds. All the near timelines, civilization got wiped out by nuclear warfare. All the far timelines, life never evolved pass single cells so there is nothing useful besides algae. All the near dimensions are just mundane things... endless volumes of water, fire, air, etc. All the far out dimensions are so bizarre the character can barely comprehend what they experienced. The character manages after some very close calls, to find the 4 hospitable worlds that you decide to restrict the story to as the character doesn't want to risk traveling farther.

***** Hmm realistically rather than going to the government I would think the best choice would be to develop a patent claim for the discovery and publishing the results in academic journals. with the patent you would hold sole ownership of the rights to the trans-dimensional travel technology and by publishing in academic circles you could greatly speed up the technologies development through the scientific process as more heads are better than one.

This of course assumes that the character has invested some time in effort and developed a device that possesses these abilities.

Simply going to a particular government is a dangerous move as by lacking the public data release this technology could be manipulated by a single nation which may or may not have the best interests/ethical protocols.

As for transdimesional travel you might like one of my science fiction concepts where our world is accessed by another parallel world where the end Cretaceous extinction never happened and life was able to recover from the slump thus eventually leading to a sentient and technologically advanced species of theropods that evolved from a manoraptoran ancestor. The idea revolves around how different the two species would be in regards to basic solutions and viewpoints on what constitutes intelligence as well as ecological impacts on regards to the meeting of life that diverged 65 million years ago.

The real fun part is thinking about how different the events after the divergence could be using the parallel worlds view of quantum mechanics where each possible outcome creates its own branch of the multiverse.

On one hand you have a technologically advanced species that has for the first time found a species that might answer the question of how intelligence evolves their reaction to this find when coupled with their startling discovery of our environmentally fragile world. Some of them decide they want to help us others want to simply study us in order to gain insights into their own evolution and then humans naturally have their own reaction to these visitors...

I doubt giving everyone the design and ability to build trans-dimensional travel is necessarily a good idea, especially if it is 'easy' to do so. Especially if they travel incautiously, subjugating natives, and doing other things inviting disaster and other unpredictable consequences.

Depending on how easy it would be to contact a government official and demonstrate this trans-dimensional travel, it would make sense for them to want to wait until they had some surefire means of ensuring they'd be taken seriously.

If you wanted to push this angle, you could also mention that there have been other instances of people claiming to travel to other dimensions in the past which all turned out to be hoaxes or delusions. So in order to avoid association with these crazy people, the main character has good reason to explore the new world on their own and find some way to substantiate their claim before bringing it to their government's attention.

** Looking for help with how to deal with a lot of backstory/worldbuilding information without going into infodumps or talking heads. Or if I do need to use exposition techniques like this, doing them well.

The idea was discussed two Wednesday Worldbuilding threads ago [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4aawjt][here]]. Right now I have about 5 pages worth of worldbuilding notes that discuss 8 different alien races, that are each about as weird and unique as say the aliens in Three Worlds Collide. They are having a diplomatic/brainstorming discussion with a team of human diplomats and scientists about how to deal with a threat of another alien race. The humans have previously received a public first contact package, followed by a secret message to various governments detailing characteristics of the alien races that would be unacceptable to the human public. Minor quirks, prior relationships, subtle one-level higher than plotting, differing value/goal systems, and differing ways of thinking color the interactions the alien races have with each other and the humans.

So if I communicate too much of what is going on, it falls into the standard problems with pacing that infodumps create. If I communicate too little of what is going on, a lot of the alien's actions and communication is going to be borderline nonsensical to the reader.

I've thought about limiting the perspective to the human team, and just communicating what they now, perhaps flashbacks to the first contact package or briefing and planning meetings the humans had, perhaps having them theorize and communicate during one of the break session, perhaps giving the perspective of one of the more aware humans.

Alternatively, I was thinking about interlude sections to fill out worldbuilding. Perhaps right after a confusing chapter, an interlude from the first contact package that clarifies things or provides hints? Or an interlude from one of the alien's perspective, showing how weird their mind is while simultaneously clarifying something that seemed bizarre or nonsensical as having rational motives and purpose? Or giving interludes of the planning meeting between the alien races themselves were they discussed how much technology to share with the humans.

Overall, I am trying to create tension as the alien races propose a lot of weird to outright horrific solutions to the problem of the alien races that is planning on invading. The human team should feel pressured to come up with a solution or pick a solution before the story reaches its final resolution. Not giving away anymore because spoilers, but this should indicate the feel in the reader I am trying to create.

Who decided what went in the public and what went in the private packages?

In order to decide that, you'd need a pretty good idea of what humans are like; which means that either:

(a) Whoever put that package together studied humans a /lot/ first (and got it all incredibly right) or: (b) /Everything/ was in the "secret" transmission except "aliens exist and are communicating" (which could be publically broadcast by simply having a flying saucer drift over a major city) and the various world governments sent out their own releases of info to the public (redacting those things they thought the public shouldn't know)

Remember, humans are as alien to the aliens as the aliens are to the humans; to reference Three Worlds Collide, the babyeaters are proud of their babyeating and would put that in the public message if they sent one.

The rock race would have about 7 other alien races working together with them. One of them might have muscles or something analogous to it. The rock race might also have the computational resources to brute force simulate possible biochemistry for earth based life using the spectral analysis to get a general idea of what earth's chemistry is like as a starting point. They then analyze human appearances in different contexts compare it against the context different appearances show up in, use some general speculation about our evolution and reference it against other alien species' evolution (some of which do have genders/sexual differences) and they could figure it out. And that is before they exchange analysis with other races, one or two of which might be more similar to us. I intend on hinting at the reader what kind of analysis was put in just to get a basic background understanding of us.

** Jinnetic algorithms got me thinking. If a being such as djinn etc exist, i was thinking how reality would be kept from being altered too much without the hyper literal or jackass genie tropes being forced to be true. Then i came up with the idea that genies aren't malevolent or all indifferent, it's that they need to interpret wishes in ways that least impact reality in some way. What comes to mind for you when you consider this directive that all djinn could be under?

So perhaps instead of a djinn outright denying your wish, if it's simpler and causes less problems (or based on the djinn's morality) the person wishing for a world which is drastically different than our current one would be teleported to a copy universe with the changes they asked for, while the person making the wish is replaced with a copy that was never exposed to the djinn in the first place. Or, if it's a Jackass djinn, they automatically reinterpret it in the way that causes you, the individual the harm, but everyone else is left relatively alone except those affected by the wish.

The second idea is the concept of a 'backup' universal state, similar to how people backup files using the git version control tools.

*** I like the relatively friendly djinn that is like "Well, sorry but for /reasons/ I'm just not going to grant that wish, please ask a different one instead" because it prevents a certain kind of gaming. The "anthropic principle: djinn-friendly wishes edition" is actually really sad, but makes people happy. I like it.

Less effort to put him in a coma and make him /think/ he's in that perfect world.

** For me the way I do world building is starting with a what if scenario towards a worlds governing laws and then think about what the implications of it are.

One of my past times is to develop worlds usually around a concept and then let them evolve through further ideas and input in some cases I have had worlds that merged together taking idea elements from both as well as multiple world scenarios that split off from a common source such as is the case with my three main fantasy concepts I have been working on. In this case each one is quite distinct as their world structures are no longer alike at all. :)

Then I have also tried out seeing what it would take to rationalize a archetype of fantasy that is abundant online and make it work in a realistic framework rather than being pure wish fulfillment and luck

For instance I have been developing a world that is based on the premise of a rational version of the typically irrational subgenere of Re fictions with reincarnating protagonists and "evolving" monsters. It relies on the concept of the reincarnation being a method of reproduction for deities with the presumption that without recollecting energy a deity will eventually fade in according to thermodynamics. If all beings in the world are able to evolve up to dieties but have a finite lifespan then would it not be advantageous to retain memories? Then furthermore if producing progeny is an organism's goal then "cheats" can be explained as the deity donating a small part of themselves in order to produce offspring. As of now it is a WIP but I think it might be doable the only mechanics that have been more or less removed is the status screen/rigid leveling unless the premises assume that the world is developed from a game that has been allowed to self modify its code and operating system via random selection.

This part as well as the general history up to the stories present is quite easy for me as I am always thinking of ideas though many just end up getting lost forever.

Now I only need to write stuff down instead of having them float around in my head...
