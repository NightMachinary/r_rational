** You may freely call me a bleeding-heart for it, but I really love that this story endorses Emma's desire for, so to speak, universal salvation.

I was worried that Lewis' death would be a "wake-up call" for Emma that no, you just gotta be a cold-hearted emmereffer to survive in this world, and it is really, really nice to see that this is not so and that, even in the face of Norman's plan and the logic of it all, Emma is still committed to a world where humans /and/ demons are saved.

*** I agree. My heart really warmed several chapters ago when Norman was describing his plan for the destruction of all demons and I could see the look of horror dawning on Emma's face.

*** Also agreed. I'm a sucker for messianic heroes, and Emma s compassion is her distinguishing trait in a cast full of geniuses. She's shaping up to be cattle children Moses - may she preserve that idealism when it'd be so easy to go grimdark

**** I actually like it. She has core values that she is unwilling to compromise. It's not necessarily irrational to take long odds to try and get a better outcome even if the EV is worse. It just means that she has a very specific value system.
