I recently registered the domain rationalfiction.com and plan to create a rational fiction forum/blog. I need from any creative authors stories that they are willing to share. I will not be profiteering or monetizing on these stories other than ad traffic. If you are interested in posting your story to this website as a first posts story please comment or message.


** You're welcome to repost The Two Year Emperor.

** I'm writing something over at flickegon.wordpress.com (Decagon, and I'm working on a new draft at the moment) that I would be up for reposting on your site. Though I'm not sure what you mean by "first posts story." Posting only the first chapter?

**** Alright, cool, thanks. Note: That was the first draft, which I stopped writing. I've since then majorly retooled the idea.

** I suggest making a thread here asking RaNaNoWriMo writers if they want to post the stories they have written on your site. A lot of them are fanfiction and are only being written for the pleasure of it, so some of them will want it online for public reading. Try asking a day or two into December when they are done with their stories, but are really eager to get people reading it.
