** Here's a question: do you plan on explaining how the weapons are built and how they work?

They obviously wouldn't be possible to construct in a real world, bar some hypothetical technology from the far future. Both here and in canon, Ruby says that she created her weapon herself, and apparently so did everyone at Signal. Which is breaking my mind every time I read a RWBY fanfiction.

I read first two chapters of your fic and skimmed the rest, but I don't see anything like that. It seems like you are taking the same approach as DaystarEld in Pokemon: Origin of Species, where you are taking the tech for granted and work your way up from there. Which is reasonable considering how broken RWBY world is, but still. Actual mechanics of it might be interesting to read.

Maybe something like limited Tinker powers from Worm, or maybe advanced 3D printers with a selection of already designed weapon parts that can be used like Legos?

*** I'll give a bit of explanation later on(especially about drones/AI, and some more on how dust works) but WoG: Because dust and skilled aura usage took care of a lot of the stuff people in our world needed to discover how to control naturally, and certain semblances make construction and design a lot easier, the discovery/invention of standardized parts happened early on(e.g. Jaune's shield is one of 'the classics' and even it has miniaturized mechanical parts. Because of that and the naturally accelerating pace of innovation(albeit slowed by grimm) at this point mechanical manufacture, particularly of aura-channeling/dust-based tech, is basically at the point where computational tech is in our society--i.e. nearing the vertical line of development.

**** Also, in terms of how they work: Aura cheats, and people build/modify their weapons to account for the particular way their aura cheats.

** Sorry for missing the past two weeks! Life appears to have quieted down a bit, thankfully(heading back from a year in israel took up a large amount of time)
