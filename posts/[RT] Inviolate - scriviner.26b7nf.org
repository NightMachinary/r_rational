** It doesn't do particularly well at the whole 'show process, not magical outcomes' part of rational!fic, and it falls into all the common pitfalls about writing for very intelligent characters; that said I still read the whole thing and enjoyed it.

I just think it's important to maintain a distinction between "Rational Fiction" as such, and stories about very smart characters.

**** I'd say we accept the reality and rename this sub to "literature which is stimulating to an aspiring rationalist's mind" ;)

***** Our sidebar'd characteristics of rational fiction are a /little/ more precise than that!

#+begin_quote
  The general characteristics of a rational fic:

  - The characters are not stupid. No one holds the Idiot Ball (or at least not the main heroes or main villains).

  - The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

  - The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

  - Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

  - The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

  Bonus points:

  - The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena.

  - The story teaches sound lessons about rationalist techniques, which can be applied to readers' lives.

  - The story hints at or embraces transhumanist ideals.

  - The story deals with the dangers and potential of powerful new technology.

Yeah, we'll probably clarify the submission guidelines. Don't worry about removing it though - nothing's /wrong/ with it, I'm just reflecting on the scope of the sub.

** I literally went looking for this through comments yesterday for a second read, as I had misplaced my bookmark.

It's a good story. It is hard to have rationality in the super hero style universes, and I think the writer seriously underestimates omniscience, but it is otherwise top notch.
