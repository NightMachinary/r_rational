Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You're Superman. Your superpowers are to be able to go at a max speed of 99% the speed of light. You can output at a maximum 10^{21} joules of energy before dying. Safe power outage of let's say 10^{18} Watts. Other powers are pretty much the same. Is there any possible way to move Venus into another orbit over a period of a year at most? He can't physically move the planet as he will go right through it. At most he can push a kilometer wide and thick asteroid. His goal is to move Venus to Earth's Lagrange point on the opposite side of the Sun. Thanks for reading.

Nope. At least, not if my understanding of physics is anywhere near correct.

Venus masses about 5x10^{24} kg.

Venus is travelling about 30,000 m/s.

One joule is equal to a Newton metre (exerting a force of one Newton over the distance of a metre).

Every second you're applying a force, you're exerting it over a distance of roughly 30 km.

So, the velocity change you can achieve is represented by the equation E= m*d*v*t, where:

- E= 10^{21} J
- m = 10^{24} kg
- d = 30,000 m/s x (t)s

So: 10^{21} = ~(5x10^{24)} * ((30,000) * (t)) * (v) / (t)

The time parameters cancel out, leaving: v =~ 10^{21} kg*m*m/s/s / (5x10^{24} kg * 3x10^{4} m/s)

v =~ 7 x 10^{-9} m/s

Congratulations, you've altered the velocity of Venus to speed its orbit up by about 7 micrometres each second, which is far, far less than the rounding errors I've made in its mass and orbital velocity.

How much of Venus do you need to be left with after the year is done?

I would imagine that converting a fraction of the planet's mass into energy would at some point move the planet.

*** Ok, so, there are a few options that jump to my mind immediately.

Dumb Superman:

I can push a kilometer wide and thick asteroid. Ok. I'll assume it's also a kilometer deep for simplicity's sake. So I can move on cubic kilometer of Venus at Superman speeds.

Google says Venus is 938,000,000,000 cubic kilometers.

Google kind of says it takes between 127 seconds and 870 seconds for light from Venus to reach Earth. Let's round that to 600 seconds, call it ten minutes.

So in twenty minutes I can move a cubic kilometer of venus to the target and be back on Venus ready to go again. So 3 trips per hour, 24 hours in a day means 72 trips a day.

365 days in a year times 72 trips a day means 26280 trips a year.

So the dumb Superman plan (moving Venus one rock at a time) fails.

Factorio Superman:

One thing Superman can do is create Superman robots. A superman Robot can do basically whatever Superman can do, except fight major villains. In particular, they can carry out the Dumb Superman plan.

Superman can make Y Superman Robots (SRs) per day, and the Superman Robots each do the Dumb Superman Plan. It would take 938 billion divided by 26280 (total task divided by how much one Dumb Superman can do) Dumb Supermen to accomplish the task.

So Factorio Superman needs 35,692,545 and change Dumb Supermen Robots to accomplish the task. He has 365 days in a year, so he needs to crank out 97,787 Superman Robots a day. Round it to a hundred thousand bots a day.

Sort of. Only the ones he finishes on the first day will get a whole year's work in. The ones he finishes on the last day will get just one days work in. Averaging the whole crew, we can simplify that each robot only gets a half year's work in (some more, some less, but it works out to about a half year productivity per bot). So he has to make two hundred thousand Superman robots a day.

Beyond that, Superman Robots aren't as good as Superman. Exactly how not as good as Superman they are is more or less up to you, but I feel like we should factor in that they aren't as good as Dumb Superman at the Dumb Superman plan. if you think half, then he needs 400,000 Superman robots a day, a fifth, then it's a million a day. The roundness of that number is a compelling argument.

So Factorio Superman succeeds if he can crank out a million Superman robots in a day, more or less the assumptions baked in above. Lightspeed is super fast, and he is very strong, but is he that fast/strong?

Paperclipper Superman:

Superman Robots, of course, can do more than just carry out Dumb Superman's plan. They can, one expects, carry out Factorio Superman's plan.

The math on this involves so many assumptions that it's almost not worth doing, but basically if there was any way that Factorio Superman could ever have succeeded then Paperclipper Superman crushes it. He builds a million on day one, they each create a million on day two, and then the trillion Superman Robots move Venus on day 3 in the first hour or so.

The recursion is essentially almighty. Even if Superman can't build a million, he can only build a thousand in a day, it very much doesn't matter. If each of those thousand build a hundred, and then each of those a hundred more...you get the picture.

Paperclipper Superman succeeds under almost any values you want to put in for how long they take to do stuff.

*** Since no one else has considered the fact that he can move at 99% the speed of light yet, I'll do that here.

Accelerating a 1 km^{3} asteroid (of average density 3 g/cm^{3}) to 99% c will result in it having a relativistic mass of 3 g/cm^{3} × 1 km^{3} × 1 / √(1 - 0.99c / c) = 3×10^{13} kg.

We can increase the orbital radius of Venus to Earth's by changing its velocity by Δv = √(GM☉ / [average radius of Earth's orbit]) - √(GM☉ / [average radius of Venus' orbit]) = -5240 m/s.

The most direct method would be to just throw the asteroid straight at Venus opposite to its direction of motion. Plugging in the numbers, we get the change in velocity of Venus to be Δv = ([mass of Venus] × [velocity of Venus] - 3×10^{13} × 0.99c) / [mass of Venus] - [velocity of Venus] = -1.829 mm/s. So, he'd just need to toss about 2.9 million cubic kilometres of asteroid at the planet for it to work. Since there's an estimated 3×10^{21} kg / 3 g/cm^{3} = 1×10^{15} km^{3} of asteroid just in the Asteroid Belt alone, it should be plenty. It's just a matter of how fast he can do it.

As an addendum, let's have a look at what the crater would look like if we threw a 99%-light-speed cubic kilometre of rock into Venus. According to [[http://www.convertalot.com/asteroid_impact_calculator.html][this calculator]] (multiplying density by √(1 - 0.99c / c) to account for the relativistic mass increase, and converting a 1x1x1km cube into a 1.24km-diameter sphere, and impacting at 90° to the horizontal), we get a crater that's about 6400 km wide and 1600 km deep, with a volume of 2.6×10^{10} km^{3.} The diameter of Venus is 12,104 km, and its volume 9.4×10^{11} km^{3.} So, really, in about 36 asteroid throws we've already annihilated Venus, and everything after that would just be adding fuel to the newly-forming asteroid belt.

So, yes. Superman might be able to move Venus into Earth's orbit, but it probably won't be intact enough to be of any use.

***** No, not really. Well, slingshotting asteroids around Venus /would/ change its angular velocity, though probably orders of magnitude less than throwing them directly at it. The latter would be transferring all its kinetic energy straight into the planet (barring energy lost through heat), while the latter would only transfer enough for the asteroid to just change direction.

Increasing the rotation of a planet wouldn't have much of an effect either - there's nothing for it to rub against to induce "friction", and an orbiting object's mass (and energy) doesn't have an effect on the orbit itself.

*** I can't really calculate it, but if you can output that much energy, then you can construct anything you'd like, almost instantly. The limitation that you'll go through the planet is easily mitigated by smashing a bunch of asteroids together to make a highly dense object, then pushing that. But then you have another problem: This object is also very dense. Its gravitational pull might be an issue.

You have a second issue to contend with: Earth and Venus cannot be on the same orbit because they have different mass. Of course, you could just add some mass from your asteroid construct, but if we're doing that, why not just destroy Venus and remake it?

**** I'm not sure why the different mass affects the orbit of the planets, could you explain? As I understand physics at this scale, everything falls at the same rate towards whatever it's orbiting, regardless of mass, so the orbits can be the same as long as the planets are far enough away from one another.

Using my understanding, Venus can be moved to a new, higher orbit through expenditure of lots of energy. Google gives me numbers that tell me Earth is about 18% faster than Venus, and assuming the change of velocity can be applied over long enough that the orbit changes just from that, would take (I think) about 3.4E52 Joules, or just over 10^{27} years at OP's safe power output of a billion billion watts.

I did use the equations for circles and not ellipses, but the eccentricity of the Terran and Venusian orbits are 0.006 and 0.007 respectively, so I feel reasonable in that regard.

******** The foundation of non-relativistic physics, especially orbits, is the three laws of motion and Newton's law of gravitational force. The second law is the one that comes into play here, but it says that F=ma, or better said here F/m=a, or the acceleration of an object is equal to the ratio between the net force acting on it and its mass. The law of gravitation is F=Gm1m2/r^{2,} where G is the universal gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of one object, m2 is the mass of the other, and r is the distance between them.

Using the equations together, we get that the acceleration of an object in free fall (that is, gravity is the only force acting on it) is equal to the product of G and the mass of the object it's falling towards, divided by the distance between them squared; the mass of the object itself cancels out.

On your last point, planets aren't really on the same scale as the sun. In terms of mass the earth is to the sun as two regulation FIFA balls are to a blue whale.

Newton's equations work marvelously to describe everything most humans do in their lives. They only really break down when something gets on the level of an atom or something gets close to the speed of light.

*** Unless your Superman either gets /way/ stronger or relies on technology and external sources of energy (which has it's own issues if you want things accomplished in less than centuries) I don't actually think in the scenario presented it's possible.

The problem with trying to use a gravity tractor is that you are greatly limited in how large an object you can use before it can't be physically pushed at a reasonable rate (without going through it), and you're trying to move an entire planet with this. So this can only happen on astronomical timescales. For an explanation of how you'd move a planet using technology (and why it can't happen that quickly) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oim7VvUURd8][I recommend this video.]]

There's also the issue that the staggering energy cost to move Venus /has to be paid somehow/. Given the total lifetime power output of your Superman can't even noticeably move Venus trying to use a gravity tractor isn't going to change that. Since you still need to be exerting the equal and opposite force needed to keep the massive object in the right constant position relative to Venus, which means you'd still be the one spending the energy to move it albeit indirectly.

Yes, that's the essence of the question. As a practical matter, humans have been a non-issue for millennia, so it's inefficient to spend too much time and resources worrying about something that just can't happen. The reason why it is that... basically something very very /very/ unlikely happened, and that's why the story takes place at all. So the idea is, what would be a reasonable way of cheating around those sort of precautions or exploiting them. Something as trivial as "breaking the antennas" seems only step one, since any kind of space debris would do that, and they'll obviously have contingencies in place.

The story isn't necessarily going to be /too/ strictly rational, I'm leaning towards a slightly different focus. But I'd still like to think it in a way that isn't completely unbelievable either, so I'm trying to think about ways in which this could work. Maybe sabotage the communication /and/ the system used to repair it? Or perhaps exploit the fact that the AI expects that it can not be damaged from the inside without undergoing outside damage first, and start creating /false/ faults by meddling with the sensor system's own outputs? This might fall again under "the humans might have a root password of sorts" idea, something that you can use to both alter the system's functioning, erase the logs of your activity, and exploit the surprise effect to its best.

*************** Hmmmm. A lot of that comes down to exactly what the criteria are that the computer systems have to fulfill, and exactly what the human wants to get from the system.

The computer's criteria might include any of the following:

- To make a safe living area for the species that originally built it;
- To investigate questions of science and improve its own technology to better fulfill its other aims;
- To more efficiently use the power output by the star it is orbiting;
- To hide from some other species of marauders (perhaps also long extinct, or perhaps not);
- To safeguard and keep alive the culture that originally built the place

And the human invader might want to:

- Find out more about the aliens who built this place
- Find out more about the place itself
- Simply stay alive
- Find a way to get back home with futuristic technology from this place
- Retroactively change history in some manner
- Use the resources here to live a life of hedonistic luxury

...and so on. Different aims need different methods to get there; some tricks the human might pull could include:

- Being a live organic creature (only helps for some possible AIs that value organic life)
- Persuading the AI that you have the equivalent of root access
- Using psychological attacks (to e.g. try to convince one core that the other cores are plotting against it)
- Taking advantage of poorly designed systems (likely not many of those around anymore)

**************** Ok, some of these apply to my setting, some don't, but it's good ideas nevertheless. Psychological attacks might in fact be an interesting avenue, if I can justify a communication channel being established at all.

***************** If the AI can observe the actions of the human in any way, then a form of communication is implicitly established. Possibly a very error-prone and difficult to understand form of communication, but a form nonetheless.

**** Note: this could be done in the style of a fantasy story, e.g. "find the lost artifact that's the key to all the magic of the world". Overt sci-fi elements optional.
