** Look up on YouTube "Team Starkid: Twisted". It's an Aladdin parody where the protagonist actually uses his head.

** I thought it was fairly understood that Aladdin realized his only chance to be with royalty was to become royalty.

PS This isn't rational thinking. This is psychotic reasoning. If you indulge in it you will injure yourself.

*** Psychotic reasoning? I don't quite understand what this is supposed to mean. Reasoning about things from a perspective of a psychopath?

**** Are we on the same board? This is [[/r/rational][r/rational]], not [[/r/lolchillaxbro][r/lolchillaxbro]]. We're supposed to analyze things for rational content, and when irrational content is posted to the board we're supposed to call it out. I have no idea why PL_TOC is being so heavily downvoted, or why you're being so heavily upvoted.

***** Because PL_TOC is being an asshole unnecessarily. He still hasn't explained his reasoning behind it being "Psychotic reasoning" for instance.

I agree the fan theory isn't a good fit for this sub, but SamPatrick15 is correct in that it's just a fun theory someone came up with. In addition, he's being polite, which generally gets a lot of upvotes by default.

****** I dunno, the upvote pattern is really sketchy. Usually, the further down a comment tree you get, the fewer upvotes turn up, because more people read the ones close to the bottom than close to the top. Here, though, the opposite is true; if we presume the usual scenario (one person per vote) rather a lot of people thought "Please enlighten me" deserved an upvote, but significantly fewer of them thought his earlier comment, in which he had an actual point, did.

However, if you track upvotes over time, you'll notice that, right after Sampatrick's initial comment, he got a whole bunch of upvotes, and PL_TOC got a whole bunch of downvotes - and, notably, the up and downvotes were uniform, not clustered at the roots. Over time, however, Sampatrick got more and more downvotes, this time clustered at the roots as they usually are, and PL_TOC got more and more upvotes, against clustered. This is consistent with one person with a bunch of votebots deciding to mass-upvote himself right after commenting, and mass-downvote the person he disagrees with, and then the usual voting gradually voicing the opposite opinion.

(Completely hypothetically, of course, I would /never/ accuse anyone of doing this. I'm sure Sampatrick "nah dude it's called having a good time" 15 is very respectful of the rules and conventions of this subreddit and would never violate them so grossly just to disparage someone who disagreed with him on the internet.)

******* Most likely because (as my comment suggested) OP was incorrect in posting it to this subreddit and Sampatrick was defending it. Later on however he was asking someone to explain their reasoning behind calling something 'psychotic,' and they just responded with a smartass comment instead of an explanation. In my interpretation, this made people want to downvote the guy's comments there more, because he was more clearly just being an asshole instead of bringing up valid points.

Most people don't go through an entire thread to downvote every single one of a person's comments, even in a short one like this, so to me it seems more likely that people had opinions than that someone used bots.

PL_TOC still hasn't explained his position, as a side note.

******** And yet the votes still massively spiked right and the beginning and are now in the middle of a complete reversal. That basically /never/ happens; if the users on this subreddit actually agreed with Sampatrick or felt PL_TOC was being unfair, you'd get a gradual progression towards one extreme for each, gradually tapering off as the traffic died down.

Also, the notion that Sampatrick's original comment, which more or less boils down to "take a chill pill d00d", would get so many upvotes in such a short time, on this of all subs, seems incredibly far-fetched. Ordinarily, comments along those lines get immediately downvoted into oblivion, on the rare occasions in which they even turn up. Given that this same comment got something in the area of 10 upvotes in an extremely short time, and then even more /down/votes over the following day, this seems consistent with numbers inflated with votebots or sockpuppets at the start and then gradually succumbing to the actual views of the community.

Of course, a prediction is the best way to settle this. I predict that PL_TOC's comments will continue to be upvoted, and Sampatrick's downvoted, until people stop visiting this thread. At present, the primary tree is:

+7 (PL_TOC) I thought it was...

-1 (Sampatrick) Nah dude...

-3 (PL_TOC) There's nothing wrong...

+6 (Sampatrick) Please enlighten me

-6 (PL_TOC) Sorry. There's no...

You have claimed something. You have the onus of explaining your reasoning.
