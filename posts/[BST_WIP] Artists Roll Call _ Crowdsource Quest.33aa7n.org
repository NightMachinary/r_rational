/Experienced GM seeks someone who can, y'know, actually hold a pen to draw for a [[http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6][Homestuck]] or [[http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6][Kill Six Billion Demons]] style quest; in whatever setting [[/r/Rational]] thinks would be fun./

I'm bored! I'm busy! I have a bunch of half-written fics I can't get around to working on!

There's been a lot of talk about someone maybe running a game where one person controls and designs the setting, and everyone else makes suggestions for the protagonist. Well, I'd love to do it.

I have exams, so I definitely don't have time to write up a full story, I think; but I /do/ have several outlines I could easily adapt to produce a well-defined set of behind-the-scenes mechanics, a cast of characters with unique abilities, and a *bunch* of plot hooks.

So:

- What setting would you lot like to play with?

  - /The Gothic Man/, where you play a rational Bruce Wayne in post-Metropolitan-Man Gotham; dealing with the post-Superman crimewave, suspicious breakthroughs from Lex Luthor, and some ... rumours.
  - An untitled thingie set in a slightly cleaned-up /Star Trek/ setting, on a survey mission on the edge of Federation space. You deal with, y'know, Star Trek. Might be able to add some new characters to this one if anyone has suggestions.
  - /Hermione Jean Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban/ - you control super-Hermione immediately after the end of HPMOR. Set in my own headcanon, obviously, so there's a ton of stuff that hasn't come up in the original story.
  - Maybe something set in the /Star Wars/ universe? I don't actually have any story outlines written in this setting, but ...
  - /The New Adventures of Squirrel Girl/. You are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel_Girl][Squirrel Girl]], a mutant with weak squirrel-themed powers (who, as a running gag, fights and beats "unbeatable" villains constantly.) Go nuts! Set in an AU of "standard" Marvel, so it makes more sense and OOC knowledge doesn't break everything - along the lines of /With This Ring/.

- Any talented or not-talented artists out there, willing to draw a picture every, oh, day or two to accompany a paragraph of text for this? Please? Pretty please?


** The Gothic Man. That sounds really, really awesome.

** Star Trek ;_;

Otherwise, The Gothic Man. But first and foremost Star Trek.

** Sounds good so far! if you get an artist in on it.

"Gothic Man" could be cool. Or the HPMOR one. Something I already know and love, basically, rather than going in blind.

** I would volunteer, except that I'm a perfectionist and super slow as a result. The best you could expect from me would be sketches.

*** I wonder if it's feasible to set up a pipeline where different volunteers sketch, ink and color. Is there any (web) software that supports setting up staged tasks like this in a visually appealing format? Maybe with an added bounty system?

*** Excellent. It looks like /The Gothic Man/ is winning out vote-wise; you want to PM me about it?

** I can't answer for the pen-holding part, but I cast my vote for Squirrel Girl. Winning off-screen is funny and all, but if you can /actually justify/ that then I will accept whatever you say and you will score /every/ point in the headcanon-generating category.
