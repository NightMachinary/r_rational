Are there any rational Voltron fanfics?


** I'd be surprised; at least on a setting level, Combining Mecha as a sci-fi element is /really difficult/ to harden.

As a counterexample, I've seen TTGL sometimes get a pass around here since, in-universe, Rule of Cool is literally a physical law expressed as a function of Determination. It's already rational, from a certain point of view.

Without something similar to justify the cool stuff (sentient energy field that likes cats for some reason? Does the resistance value the PR and merchandising benefits of a brightly-colored hero-bot more than the costs of sub-optimal battleship design?) Voltron's premise runs into a /lot/ of problems in the form of "why don't they just ____?" and to my knowledge no one's yet had the /actual/ Determination to backfill that worldbuilding to even superficial Methods standards, let alone those of Pok√©mon: Origin of Species or R!Animorphs.

*** this is one of those setting where an earlier age having a singularity, or at least a lot of lost tech, is a given. the lions are OLD, rediscovered technology. so rationally, they are using a weapon they dont fully understand and are unable to replicate. specifics depend on which version of the show we are talking about.

so you have a war with another planet, who can make giant monsters. and you have an old combining mecha in the basement that you can use... and oh hey, the princess is a replacement pilot for the 'dead' guy.

no, the least rational part is the mice. having their own episode.

from what i recall- the 5 lions get a force-field efect that makes it impossible to interrupt the combination sequence, but the activation of specific lions can be prevented (drain a lake). by comparison the 20+ vehicles version of voltron can have some parts prevented from combining, but the rest combined and the robot was missing that leg. the other version was 3 robots that make 1 robot... so yeah, version of voltron matters a lot.

What's that?

#+begin_quote
  Voltron's premise runs into a /lot/ of problems in the form of "why don't they just ____?"
#+end_quote

Indeed, one of the points of breaking something down into separate parts is to make them /less/ essential; interchangeable parts = replaceable parts.

**** TTGL = Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. It's a lot of fun, and the universe really does run on Hot-Bloodedness. I haven't finished it yet, but the parts I watched were fun. Lots of absurdity, but that's part of the setting premise.

It's like the author took all the Shonen anime tropes and said "how do we make these as over the top as possible, and still justified?"

*** ... and now I have ideas about how to rationally justify goLion Voltron. Darnit.

** (IIRC disclaimer)

At least in the American version, the disassembly of goLion Voltron was a curse by the witch Haggar. So originally it was just a powerful humanoid mech, and the lions were a way to stop the mech from working by requiring all the pieces to be activated and specially assembled.

The explanation that it's beggars-can't-be-choosers lost tech was my first thought, but it just shifts the question backwards to whenever Voltron was originally designed. I think PR is the canon answer: a lot of stock is put into the idea that the legend of Voltron "brought peace to the galaxy" for a long time.

But I am now wondering if a reason can be postulated for designing goLion Voltron with Zarkon and Haggar in mind. I have some ideas, although they are pretty far-fetched.
