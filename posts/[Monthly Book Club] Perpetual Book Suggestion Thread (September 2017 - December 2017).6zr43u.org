So, I've decided I'm going to commit to running the book club for the rest of the calendar year and then we can decide whether to continue based off interest / personal motivation / motivation of others to assist in curation.

Because the first book suggestion thread got so many comments, and a reddit thread can be commented on for 6 months, I've decided to try a "perpetual book suggestion thread". Suggest the book you want to... suggest in the comments. For 2017, I (MagicWeasel) will be the czar of book selection (unless overthrown) and will try to do so fairly (feedback welcome in meta sub thread of this post). So don't worry about upvotes/downvotes: if you have an opinion about a book (for or against), reply to the suggestion with your reasons - that would be very helpful for choosing books I haven't already read.

Anyway, here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6y53xc/monthly_book_club_september_2017_book_friendship/][past suggestion thread]] (feel free to copy past book suggestions over, though I'll probably use it anyway if nothing strikes my fancy in this thread).

Here's the format to post your own suggestions:

#+begin_example
  **Title**: 

  **Ebook cost**: 

  **Word count**: 

  **Genre**: 

  **Synopsis**:  

  **Reasons /r/rational would like it**:

  **Content warnings**:

*Title*: Cordyceps by Benedict_SC

*Ebook cost*: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][free on ao3]] (the Download button is at the right side of the page)

*Word count*: 64k

*Genre*: Sci-fi, Irrationalfic

*Synopsis*: An unnamed main character wakes up with amnesia, in a strange hospital they do not recognise. As they attempt to figure out how they got there, the mystery they face soon becomes far stranger than expected.

*Why [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would like it*: On a first glance, it conforms to the rules of rationalfic; characters take their time to figure things out and act according to their motivations to solve a mystery placed in a world with coherent rules. In some ways, it's also a clever whodunnit; an astute reader will figure out what is happening before the characters do.

That is what the work looks like on the surface, but soon enough, it becomes obvious that the work is an irrationalfic, in which rational thought is not the optimal route. I found this to be very interesting and would love to discuss both this work and the genre in general with this sub.

Also, the work is of course well-written.

There's a solution to the central problem (that doesn't require irrational action) it is just something none of the characters considered.

**** Thanks for your reply! I'm not sure I completely understand what you're getting at, which is why I'll have to speculate about your opinion.

Let's start with "I don't agree with the characterization of irrationalityfic" and try to offer a definition of what I think that genre is.

There's been a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/73eze4/d_irrational_fiction/][post]] about irrationalfic in this sub which had not been there at the time this comment was written. You might be interested in this; the top comment holds a position which might be similar to yours.

If you define rationality similarly to that top comment, i.e. "that behaviour which achieves results", Cordyceps isn't irrationalfic, but I'd say that nothing really is. In that sense, it's also correct to say that the character you call "designated rational" is not rational at all.

If we say that rational behaviour is methodical and analytic, that it relies on /understanding/ a system as a tool to make better decisions, which usually is the behaviour which produces good results, the concept of irrationalfics as fiction which turns this expectation on its head starts making sense.^{1} (If you dislike this definition of rational fiction, that's fine, but I fear that in that case, we don't have a genre to talk about.) The "designated rational character", though despite their mental illness, is trying to work through the problem in a rational manner. Of course, they aren't a perfect rationalist.

Maybe my reading of your comment was wrong in regards to "the designated rational character isn't". I'd be interested in a further elaboration.

Now to get to your central sentence: "there's a solution that doesn't require irrational action which none of the characters considered."

I don't think such a thing immediately qualifies something from being irrational fiction. If, for example, there's a better "irrational" solution (as per the terms defined above) in a rationalfic which none of the characters ever consider and the text doesn't even mention, would that make it an irrationalfic? I think it would just make it a flawed rationalfic, which is okay, because authors are only human beings and no one can reasonable be expected to find the best solution to the fictional situations they create.

Nonetheless, I'm interested in the solution you propose. Please tell me more :)

--------------

^{1} In that sense, the recently introduced druidic magic system in /Worth the Candle/ is an irrationalfic-esque element of the worldbuilding, which is very fascinating as the (rather rational) main character quickly realizes that he will never be able to properly learn it.

***** I'm not really trying to rely on some janky definition of rationality or what is or may be deemed as an irrationalfic. The character doesn't need to become Willy Wonka to prevail in this world or to succeed. He didn't fail because his actions were too orthodox-rational for the setting. He failed because he was chiefly irrational despite the techniques and methodology at his disposal.

As for the solution, I don't want to spoil the fic, which I think is worth reading for the entertainment value alone.

** *Title*: Anna Karenina

*Ebook cost:* Free. [[https://archive.org/stream/annakarenina11tols?ref=ol#page/n7/mode/2up][You can read and/or download it here.]] It's not the best translation, but it's easily accessible, which is convenient.

EDIT: [[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/free_ebooks/Anna_Karenina_NT.pdf][Here's a less attractive version]], but it's the full text, whereas the link above is not. I'm partial to the first one's introduction though, and it also has illustrations.

*Word count:* ~350,000

*Genre:* Literary Realism

*Synopsis:* (From Wikipedia) Anna Karenina is the tragic story of a married aristocrat/socialite and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizing - something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others.

The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time - politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* It's Tolstoy. It's just one of those books that you really ought to read at some point in your life.

**** Idk what Radiolab is. I started reading a book called /The Craft of Fiction/ by Percy Lubbock ([[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18961/18961-h/18961-h.htm][which you can read here if you feel so inclined]]) and it was mentioned in the first few pages, so I took a detour and read it before circling back to finish TCoF.

The quote from Lubbock that derailed me was "Of Richardson and Tolstoy and Flaubert we can say at once that their command of life, their grasp of character, *their knowledge of human affections and manners* [emphasis mine], had a certain range and strength and depth..."

I went looking through my mom's books for /Clarissa/ by Samuel Richardson, but I found Anna, so I read Anna instead. Probably for the best, since Clarissa has an estimated word count of 969,000 words. I'll make a point of reading that one after Christmas, but I don't have time for it until then, too many other books I /need/ to read, y'know?

***** Radiolab is a very popular podcast! Their most [[http://www.radiolab.org/story/radiolab-presents-rough-translation/][recent episode]] (that was released yesterday, hence me thinking you read it) was an episode of a new podcast /Rough Translation/ called "Anna in Somalia". It's about a man in solitary confinement in a Somali prison communicating with his neighbours by tapping on the walls in a home-grown version of morse code. Two years later, one manages to get the guards to let him pick a book out of his personal effects, which is /Anna Karenina/, and the 8 prisoners in the solitary confinement chain tap out the 350,000 words in morse code to each other. It tells the story of how one of the prisoners really related to Anna and her plight and how that affected his life. It was a really wonderful story, and spoke highly of Tolstoy's writing.

*** Very thoughtful of you to create a meta thread.\\
I have a few suggestions regarding the format.

#+begin_quote
  Ebook cost
#+end_quote

Perhaps "Availability" would be better: some books are free, and "$0.00" or "Ebook cost: Free" look rather silly, or even misleading.

Unless it's an attempt at subtle manipulation to discourage people from submitting books that aren't available on the Internet, in which case sure, leave it at that.

#+begin_quote
  Why [[/r/rational]] would like it
#+end_quote

"Reasons [[/r/rational]] would like it" would sound more formal.

#+begin_quote
  Any content warnings
#+end_quote

Is "any" necessary? With it dropped, the phrasing would be more formal.

(I also have a penchant for being annoyingly pedantic about some things.)

**** RE cost: one of the "conditions" is that the ebook is available, just because it's not feasible for someone to locate and read a book within a month, whereas ebooks are available immediately after purchase. Whether "has to have an ebook" is a good condition is worth discussing probably at the end of the "trial". I hope it doesn't discourage people from suggesting fiction that is available online for free, though!

It could also have a link to this thread, but to me at least it'd much more convenient and encourage more book discussion to have the actual discussion stickied rather than this meta thread.

** If you haven't read any of Christopher Nutall's "Schooled in Magic" series, go read it. I am fairly certain that most people on this sub would probably like it a lot. It is my favorite novel series, even more so than HPMOR. Yes it really is that good. The first book in the series only costs $1 as an ebook and there's an audio version too.

I suggested this here before, but iirc a bunch of people who had read the crappy space battles version of the first book jumped on to warn everyone (falsely I might add) that the SiM series sucks and they basically said it was my guilty pleasure or something, and when I tried to explain that the paid version of the series is actually REALLY good no one seemed to believe me and were all like, "I don't want to waste my money too risky" even though it's on Amazon and they should already have known they could try a free sample of the beginning of the book.

Seriously, go read it! :D

***** Most people didn't even read the free sample last time because iirc I didn't link it. Now could you please explain to me what exactly makes the sample read like bad fanfiction? I just took another look at it to try to see what you are talking about and I still don't understand how you could say that it is bad writing. I honestly do not believe that the whole sub besides myself would consider the SiM series that bad unless they were looking at the space battles version. It would be one thing if everyone was saying that it's not their cup of tea, but for basically everyone here who comments on it to say it's trash and that the writing quality is awful? I call bullshit. There is no way any sane person would look at SiM and say that it's as poorly written as bad fanfiction. So either you're crazy, or I'm crazy, or you are lying about having read the sample, or you're exaggerating about how badly written you thought it was. I know it's normally considered bad faith to say that, but sometimes there really is no other explanation that makes any sense.

*Edit: I just looked over the sample more carefully. It's not bad but it's not good either. It's been a long time since I read the beginning of the first book, and I forgot that it wasnt as good. Sorry for the stupid crap I said.*

** I'm going to be a blatant self pushing shill here! Yay! My book.

*Title*: Digital Me

*Ebook cost*: 2.99/ free on KU

*Word count*: 76,725

*Genre*: LitRPG Fantasy/Political Intrigue

*Synopsis*: Shawn Bradshaw has made a desperate gamble. To save his life he risked it all in an attempt to become digitized. Knowing almost nothing about the greater Digital community or if he will be allowed to join, how Digital existence is experienced, or even if he will be relegated to a Digital zoo.

Shawn's success in obtaining immortality is but the start of his journey. Thrust into the kingdom of Loson's political intrigue, friends become enemies, allies manipulate and control, Shawn must decide how much assistance he is willing to let his allies provide and if he wants to count them as enemies instead.

Oblivious and ignorant of the culture, manipulated, reveling in his new found freedom even as he is chained socially, Shawn must decide on his long term goals and what he is willing to give up to achieve them.

The Immortal Wizard must decide what kind of legend he will leave behind.

*Reasons [[/r/rational]] would like it*: I think the entry into the digital world and why the Digitals want people to enter the digital world is interesting. The different factions have reasons for what they do and why they do it, no 'evil for the sake of evil!' The main character has a pretty strong sense of reason and direction but not as clear a view as to how that works or what it will cause. One of the main themes of the book is the main character being exceedingly powerful but still being manipulated because of his ignorance and character flaws. An 'avalanche redirected by a tiny stream' type of deal.

*Content warnings*: Violence. I have some sexual themes but no sex.

In theory I'd be happy to post novels that were suggested by their authors, but I'd probably prefer it if the novel were offered up for free for a few days (or a coupon code was made available or however Amazon can send review copies) so it didn't look like a money grab, you know?

**** Fair enough, it is setup with kindle unlimited as well so if you have KU it's free (ok, not free, but if you have KU you all ready paid the subscription).

I just setup the price reduction deal so from the 11th to the 14th of October it will be listed at 99 cents. I can't set it up free or set up a coupon deal at the moment (other deals already effect this at the moment, I will when I can and then update). But, this is at least something!

***** I hope I didn't give you the wrong impression, I didn't mean that if you discounted your book I'd put it up or anything! But hey, you could always post it on the friday off-topic thread.

****** Oh no! I'm just pretty crummy at the whole 'self advertisement' thing and since I noticed this thread on a favourite subreddit I said 'hey, go for it!'

Your suggestion of adding a discount is perfectly reasonable and at least /something/ I can give back for the free advertisement.

******* If you haven't posted the book as a top-level post on this sub yet, you could always give it a go - though might want to see what the mods say about posting your own work that is "for sale" first.
