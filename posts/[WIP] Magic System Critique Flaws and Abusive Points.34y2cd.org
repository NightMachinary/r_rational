I have written a (very long) paper about my magic system. It would be fantastic if anyone would take the time to type below any flaws (contradictions, weirdness, etc.) and anything that can be abused (infinite energy, OP, etc.).

Here are the bullet points that basically describe the system:

-Energy is needed to cause the magic to begin

-You need rare runic stones to allow this energy to be used for work

-Runic stones are volatile by nature; contained by inscriptions that can be broken to release the stone, and so release the energy inside it

-Residue from runic stones attach to 'exit' points on a human, and act as 'turbines' to spin the energy in humans to create a sort of slingshot cycle for more work to be possible (energy creates more ability to do action) and allows energy to leave

-Gel is the natural substance of this energy created through the 'turbines' (you can actually touch the capability to do work!)

-The will and intention of the sorcerer changes the gel's physique

-Outside energy is added to the gel (fire, friction) to create an action. Amount of energy and amount of gel changes the intensity of action according to the will

-Catalysts decrease activation energy for more ambitious gels

-Magic is also used as a way to augment human ability

Here's the link to the full dissertation:

Ignore the racist scholar parts if you want, they are unimportant and were just something added on a whim (wrote this awhile ago).

Thank you for taking the time to read this! Please tell me anything I did wrong - either with this post itself or the writing.

Also, is this the right subreddit for this kind of thing? And is my tag correct? I really don't know how to do things on Reddit.

#+begin_quote
  through the countryside of what was known as Mother Huraedon
#+end_quote

of /who/ was known as? (reads) No, it looks like the name of a country. That's confusing. I suggest you either say "the country of Mother Huraedon" or rename it something else.

#+begin_quote
  temperatures of exactly 1.538 million Celsius
#+end_quote

How many significant figures counts as exact?

According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature][wikipedia]] this is about 1/10 the temperature of the core of the sun. It is more than enough to melt all rocks and minerals [[http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/Fundamentals/HardnessMeltingPlot06.pdf][plotted here]] by a few orders of magnitude. Unless the runes are made out of a material with an appallingly high melting temperature or the explosions happen under appallingly high pressure, this will melt the runes in question.

#+begin_quote
  runes can only be utilized if refined, and then broken after refinement
#+end_quote

Can a rune be broken more than once? Presumably no.

#+begin_quote
  this quick explosion is only logistically possible once a year
#+end_quote

World building inference: only governments can arrange it. This has many implications about availability to civilians and organized crime.

#+begin_quote
  nasty sunburns
#+end_quote

Suggests ultraviolet light in the explosion. Explained by black-body radiation of the runes. Later he says that there are no survivors because they are burned to a crisp. Unclear why the mages sent to do it cooperate and why sunburns are an issue to the ashes of a human body.

#+begin_quote
  left in the cavern to cool down
#+end_quote

This could be accelerated with water but since the latency is already a year on producing more, a few days are unlikely to make a difference.

#+begin_quote
  stones are carved into small pebbles
#+end_quote

Are these held in pockets?

#+begin_quote
  any Actions done from a rune is
#+end_quote

is -> are

If the spell to refine runes is easy to learn and cast, suicidal mages could use it to blow things up. Is this spell something other than a Rune?

When the rune vaporizes, does it literally turn into gas or does it simply vanish? I wouldn't want to breathe one.

#+begin_quote
  all runes with the same inscription are vaporized
#+end_quote

Even ones you don't own?

#+begin_quote
  The laser used to write the seal is constructed in such a way that they are tailor made to a magi's voice.
#+end_quote

The seals are tailored to a particular magi's voice or the lasers are tailored to a particular magi's voice?

#+begin_quote
  catch an utilize
#+end_quote

an -> and

Be careful about "utilize". It means "to make useful" and can pretty much always be replaced with "use".

#+begin_quote
  rps (rotations per second)
#+end_quote

If you have to say what the acronym stands for, don't bother with the acronym.

How exactly did they measure the rotation speed of the elemental traces?

Munchkin: if you chain the syllables, you can make it so that as you are speaking you can decide how many of your runes you want to activate: "AB" activates two, "ABC" activates three, "ABCD" activates four, etc.

Can you inscribe more than one trigger phrase on the same rune? It might be convenient to have an "all fire spells" command or whatever.

Must all Actions be immediate?

#+begin_quote
  us Magi are able to do
#+end_quote

us -> we

--------------

Overall it's unclear what can and cannot be done with an Action, which is seemingly the most important part for finding flaws. Can mages spin a turbine, harvesting soul/extrauniversal energy into electricity, or directly create current? Depending on the tech level that could have significant impact.

How simple must the actions be? Is matter creation possible?

Must runes be associated with particular spells or are runes just a source of mana?

If runes can do particular spells then you might do something fancy with making a rune automatically reproduce a recording of your voice giving the command for another rune, and if you can make it do so under useful conditions you've got the beginnings of a computer or a Contingency spell.

Is remote action impossible? Must the gel directly touch anything it affects and pass through all space in between the mage and the target?

Can spells be blocked in any way?

Do detection spells exist? What can they detect?

*** Oh, uh, wow, thanks for the response lol.

I actually fixed this (very) rough draft a bit. If you want to read another long (but shorter) paper I can link it.

All the world's historical context and bad sarcasm was removed. Some grammar mistakes were fixed (wrote the previous paper a bit quickly). As some parts are still a bit vague I'll pitch some ideas and see if you think they are worthy or not.

The high temperature is required to create the raw rune from the stone ore mined. The magi used are hardly willing and are convicts that have been forced into this situation (usually through some form of brainwashing).

The heat itself doesn't give sunburns, that was a bad joke. The stones are a bit on the ridiculous side of the required melting temperature. They are basically tiled across this cave, and with a very intense but small centre of heat in the middle of it all. The result is your refined rune. The side facing the heat is going to be very hot to the touch, but the other side is cool, and unmelted at all. What the magi want is the core, which is where you can get these semi-immaterial particles. The heat is needed to create this core due to properties of the original stone.

Runes, once broken, are impossible to use again. They disintegrate and cannot be recreated through magic. You must mine them again, but this means your key to infinite energy is finite.

The cavern with water is smart, don't know why I didn't think of that, thank you. Yes, this is all government run. And yes, the pre-blasted stones that are carved into small thumbnail pebbles are meant to be held in pouches. Also, suicidal mages are pretty rare, considering everything magic related is strictly controlled by the government, and only exists in the capital. Besides, it's easy enough to make a pipe bomb (I think) but most people won't do that anyways.

Only your voice specific rune vaporizes. And it is the seal that is tailored, gotta make that clear! The syllable thing would be fantastic, but I tried to curb that with only the full words of the Alkire language being able to be breakable seals.

Yes you can put the same word on as many runes as you want, and they are all used.

I think that answers most questions above the line. I'll post the link below, but what it doesn't answer: runes are just a source of mana, the 'gel' is synced with its magus creator, and so must be in a certain range (determined to be 70 centimetres) in order for the magus to use the energy to empower his will.

Spells are like miracles. Their creation is amazing and out of this world, but when put into this world they follow the norms. When fire is about to jump onto you from a building you take cover under heat resistant objects. For lightning you try not to get struck :P etc. etc.

Not sure what you mean by detection spells.

One of the largest problems in the original was that it was energy that spun the turbines, not particles, there was no need for spinning as it was just a process of energy has made the exact same type of energy! Kind of useless, so I changed the soul/planur stuff into actual particles with names (but not named yet since I haven't thought of them).

By the way, thank you very much for taking your time to do this!

Heres the link if you wanted to see a semi updated dissertation: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yXBK1H3nK-dZyaQ_Lyy0Yj089d-eg-ptoqzUNtfE8WU/edit?usp=sharing]]

**** Is there a range on rune voice activation? If global, is it instantaneous? Could be used as a fast and expensive method of communication.

By detection spells I meant: can a spell retrieve information for the caster in some way? Can you shoot a fireball around a corner, or some sort of heat-seeking missile?

Same question as before about defenses. If it's all the same (creating a wall to block a fireball) that's fine but magical defenses can get interesting.

Exponential cost curve will incentivize teams of wizards splitting the work into as many pieces as possible, as you said. That's interesting. Can a wizard only cast one spell at a time? Someone might try to split the work into two pieces ("lift left half of rock, lift right half of rock") in order to square root the resources required.

It seems like delayed-action spells aren't possible with the current configuration. Can a wizard make a spell that produces the sound of that wizard saying a particular word or phrase? That's an important component of metaspells.

Is there a time limit to saying the magic phrase? If my phrase is "ABCD" and I say "ABC" then wait for a long time and then say "D" will the rune break?

The syllable chaining can always work as long as there are two distinct one-syllable words in the language and the caster has a very good memory. It's possible with one but then you'd have to have much longer trigger phrases (O(n) instead of O(log n)).

Can you explode matter? Convert it to energy? Use the heat of a local object to further fuel a spell that's already being cast? Heal wounds? Violate entropy? Create safe food/water/tools? How about unskilled artists creating artwork the way they imagine it? Or making photographs of your memories. Mass production of tools, outpacing both craftsmen and even factories. It could lead to a post-scarcity society if there are enough resources.

Again, I think the most interesting part of the magic system isn't how it works, it's what you can (and, more importantly, can't) do with it. See [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/][Sanderson's Second Law]], and the others while you're at it.

***** So once again, thanks. The largest weakness of this system is that the runes (which are the only things that allow you to access this practically infinite power) are rare and will run out.

So you have the government controlled wizards never actually manufacturing or replacing the common craftsman. They are used to research and advance the mundane sciences so that when magic is impossible to do, humanity will then be sufficiently advanced enough that they won't need it.

Thanks for the well thought out responses. Weaknesses and possible conflicts (all that new energy in the world) will be kept in mind.

** Runic stones = unstable. Become inert unstable or explosive unstable? You said store them in vacuum chambers to keep them from touching any matter, I believe. So they're basically antimatter grenades? I see military applications. So would many people in your world, unless the energy released is low.

Define "will" and "intention". Specific mental states (i.e. patterns of activation of neurons across specific areas of the brain)? Language based, but telepathic? Loose and handwave-y?

If computers existed, could they give instructions to stones? Could sufficiently intelligent animals?

** Without reading the doc I would say the main thing would be using gel to get more gel or more/larger/improved runestones and if your "will" creates the effects and you can use gel to enhance your abilities then you could create a positive feedback loop that way.
