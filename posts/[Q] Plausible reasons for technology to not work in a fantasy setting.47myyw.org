Basically the title says it all. I've always had a lot of trouble understanding why technology wouldn't work in any world that mostly resembles our own. Why wouldn't a steam engine work in any world in which water can be boiled into pressurized steam? Electrical technology can be as simple as running a current through a filament to create light. I don't think there are any fantasy worlds which don't have steam or electrical phenomena of any kind.

A fantasy setting is still highly desirable for many reasons related to story-telling. But in order to pass basic plausibility tests, there needs to be a good reason why technology doesn't work.


** A lot of technology is invented when there is a problem that needs to be solved. However, this means that if magic can solve the problem more easily than through technology, then technology simply won't develop.

If a simple cantrip can make a floating ball of light, then you won't go through the 100+ failed attempts by Edison to make the light bulb.

In addition, a rarely noticed requirement for technology is mass production and intrastructure. A lot of times, people write stories about how someone from the present goes back in time and revolutionize society with their futuristic knowledge. *BUT* they often forget that most of technology is ruinously expensive unless it's common as dirt.

Building pipes for plumbing? Requires specialized skills to build it and maintain it.

Control of electricity for work? Requires a lot of equipment to harness it and convert it into something actually useful.

Plastic? Requires a highly refined and complicated process which is expensive unless you are producing plastic at the level of thousands of pounds.

Either way, most of common technology we see is only useful/profitable if it's implemented on a society-wide scale which is one of it's main strengths. Civilization requires technology to function and technology requires a civilization to implement it. It's a feedback loop which ensures actual technological development to maintain a civilization. Otherwise if it was easy for a small group to reproduce everything our society makes, then the world would be a lot more fractured into smaller groups and more anarchic in nature.

That's why there is so little technology in fantasy worlds. When there is magic which easily reproduces anything our modern-day society can make, we don't develop into a futuristic post-scarcity society but rather a medieval one where all of the power is concentrated into the hands of a few people (yeah we kinda have that today, but imagine a godlike warlord who can control your every action/thought as compared to a rich CEO).

I'm actually happy technology is so difficult to create and maintain on any scale other than that of a large society, because it either requires cooperation or extreme slavery to even function and we have eliminated slaves a long time ago.

It means that humans /need/ to work together for any hope of survival and it encourages cooperative personality traits to spread (go read [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZRPC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1][The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution]] if you don't believe me).

TL;DR - Yes technology may still work, but in a world where magic does the same thing more easily and cheaply, then there will be no motivation to create the technology. Even if technology can be more flexible and versatile than magic, it still needs to require a significant percentage of wealthy/influential people to agree that it's better than magic /and/ be willing use it when in the early stages it's going to be clearly shittier than magical alternatives.

It's the problem of convincing people to go for long-term potential on the order of generations over short-term benefits.

**** I sort of agree with you about pop science books, but I think that this book has a lot of pretty reliable references to back up most of what it finds. Because most of the book is about finding examples of how humans may have changed in the last 10,000 years such as lactose tolerance and an IQ shift among Ashkenazi Jews (they make up ~0.02% of the population, but over 25% of Nobel Prize winners are Ashkenazi Jews).

So I think the book has found pretty reliable changes that can be considered to be the result of a genetic mutation and the authors use these changes as proof to challenge the idea that humans has stopped evolving since we developed civilization.

***** I think they have a point, that civilization has impacted human evolution, and I always found it questionable that our brains have not changed since living in civilization. I am just skeptical of the finer details, especially considering the fields concerning the content are not reliable, and I find the information about Ashkenazi [the last for words... awkweeeeerd] Jews interesting.

My initial reaction is that it is convenient --- in a bad way, looking for differences to explain a difference and therefore finding a difference and concluding that difference is the cause --- but their IQ shift could also be used to argue against the notion of intelligence being fixed, and keeping in mind my link about the structure of the human brain being more sensitive to environment, a [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160225153817.htm][recent study]] suggests a link between brain structure and cognitive ability.

As for my gripe with pop science books, it is science reporting itself. One can read a book from a few years ago and think they are well informed (because of the way the information has been presented) but can be unaware of recent information that may challenge some of the claims in the book and/or provide a more nuanced perspective. That is why I prefer studies to pop science books.

*** Good explanation. I'd thought of this myself but it does require that magic be fairly ubiquitous, which rules out a fair number of fantasy worlds. I'd think that given the convenience factor and easy scalability of technology, some form of magic would have to be accessible to most households to prevent technology from being kickstarted.

Furthermore, if technology really does work but is repressed by the magic-using elite, so long as the world has a long enough history, it seems to me that technology vs. magic would necessarily have to be one of the major points of conflict. That's good for some storylines but doesn't thematically fit well in a story that wants to be pure fantasy but doesn't want to be stupid and irrational.

**** Think of it like this:

In our world, a rich mine owner has a problem: his mines keep filling up with water. He has lots of money to throw at the problem, so he looks around for someone he can pay to solve it. He hires an engineer who develops the first industrial steam engine to pump the water out of the mines. The engine is patented, and now access to steam power is limited only by one's ability to pay for the engine and it's fuel.

In a fantasy world, the mine owner looks around for someone he can pay to solve his flooding problem. He hires a wizard, who summons a water elemental to move the water out of the mine and binds it for a year and a day.

Most of the really world-changing inventions in our world, the ones that sparked things like the industrial revolution, were created by scholars of various sorts such as engineers and chemists, who were either rich themselves or were hired to solve problems by rich people. These inventions became commonplace and eventually reached the point of benefiting the common man because once invented they required no special ability to manufacture and operate, just training and resources. In a fantasy world it is wizards and alchemists (and priests and druids etc) that the rich go to for new solutions, and in contrast to the real world, the solutions those specialists come up with cannot trickle down to the common man because they require magical abilities at least to create, often to operate (or cast). Thus you tend not to get a magical revolution, because the "technology" of magic remains restricted to the elite.

If you want a technological revolution, though, it's fairly easy to justify in the form of a culture or subculture or even a powerful individual who distrusts magic and wizards and so spends the extra effort to create mundane solutions. Even better when those mundane solutions spread and are then improved upon by magical inventors, ex. "Ah, this clever fellow has invented a mechanical bellows device which an do work by heating water with fire. You know, I could get the same effect with an enchanted hot plate and a decanter of endless water and we'd never have to buy coal again."

***** Also worth noting that early technological progress was very slow for a number of reasons in the real world, most of which still apply in the typical fantasy world like lack of universal education, lack of demand, slow communication between the educated elite, lack of cooperation between rival countries.

Interesting things can happen in a fantasy world if you allow one or more of those restrictions to break down and start pushing into an age of thaumaturgical rather than technological progress. Most don't go that direction though because it means doing a lot of work to nail down scientific principles behind magic to define the limits of that progress.

****** One thing that REALLY bothers me regarding magic is how so few worlds have knowledge-sharing magic, that would allow, for example, to educate a layman to the level of a university professor with a single spell, or something like internet (but mind-to-mind).

******* You don't even have to go that extreme (which to be fair, would be pretty heavy, even Wish-level magic in most fantasy worlds) to have an extreme effect on society.

Most magic systems actually treat violating thermodynamics as a much easier problem than manipulating minds. Perpetual motion, or at least something practically indistinguishable from it, seems to be easy in most fantasy worlds, which should be HUGE. Getting easier access to more energy (human muscle, animal muscle, fire, coal, oil, nuclear) has been a major driver of technological progress, and magic undercuts a huge amount of that.

Communication is also a big deal. Even in the modern world getting messages to the other side of the world is a big deal. It requires high power transmitters and huge antenna arrays, laying thousands of miles of cable over land and sea, or expending gigajoules of energy putting satellites into orbit. In a magical world, it's as simple as casting Sending. Just the difference having a couple of magic mirrors in every university that can link to each other would be profound. The webcomic Dungeon Grind had a gag recently with a magical tome for dungeon delvers which was linked to hundreds of other tomes so that anything written in one appeared in all the others, and used it as a joke on Wikipedia and social networking. But just imagine if every magical library had a book like that. Imagine all the other ways a magical world could ape our modern information technology society.

Argh! I was tired when I typed that. I meant to say that it's now widely agreed that slavery is immoral despite the fact that we have children in far-off countries (or poor immigrants in America) working in sweatshops to make a lot of our goods. Still, there is progress (hopefully) to eliminate such practices.

If there is any other form of slavery that is considered to be legal, then I don't know of them and I would like to be told the harsh truth.

In the real world, basic steam-driven aeolipiles were described around 15 BCE, and static electricity has likely been known since before we were H. sapiens. We proceeded to do absolutely nothing with this knowledge until the 1700s. The simplest, most plausible, /true/ reason is that people don't have enough information to have thought of it yet, and their metallurgy and infrastructure isn't good enough to make reliable use of it anyway.

** First off, do /humans/ work in that setting? Humans are extremely complicated machines that can be destroyed by something as small as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water#Toxicity_in_humans][slightly increasing the weight of water]]. If they work, there's not much that will break. So if you want real-world humans to enter your fantasy world and not die, but then to find that their smart phones stopped working, that's not going to make a whole lot of sense.

If you're making the world out of whole cloth, with a race that physically resembles but is distinct from humans, then you can do a lot to justify it. Can water be boiled in your universe? Perhaps boiling it away requires far more energy than you're likely to get. Or maybe steam is extremely corrosive, and the machinery is likely to break down. Or maybe your world doesn't have a lot of metal, and can't spare enough to make trains.

And why do you say those fantasy universes have electrical phenomena? Because they have lightning? Maybe that's just Zeus throwing spears or something. Or maybe it's kind of like electricity, but there's no electromagnetism. Electricity stops looking as impressive if you can't send it through a coil and move stuff around with it.

But even then, any world with anything like people has self-repairing self-replicating technology.

It is fairly common for people to have magic resistance. You don't want someone to be able to kill people easily by causing aneurysms. It could be that magic keeps technology from working, but humans can live because they can keep the magic out, and they just haven't figured out how to keep the magic out of their steam engines.

** Alastair Reynolds wrote a pretty interesting explanation for this in his book Terminal world.

The basic premise is that there is a kind of 'space time tiling' shift that happens between various 'zones'.

humans and messy organics MOSTLY survive making these transitions if you go slow enough, don't go into really LETHAL places and take special drugs to help ease the metabolic shock of moving from one scale zone to another.

tolerance for traversing zones and even living in a particular zone comfortably seems to be hereditary or environmental in conditioning and thus people generally don't live their native zone if they can help it lest they become very ill.

It's not stated explicitly but I suspect cancers and genetic disruption is rather common for those that transit often in life and the symptoms of making too many zone shifts looks a lot like radiation poisoning (pretty much all the molecules in your body get shuffled over and over again very slightly).

higher precision machinery like microchips generally fail entirely unless their built explicitly to survive the transition (and generally need to be turned off when your crossing a boundary anyway). There is also a group which uses many different kinds of clocks with different precision requirements to function as early warning systems for when approaching boundaries that a human's physiology would not necessarily detect.

What I'm getting at here is that magic might have 'degrees of not like our physical reality' which a human/living body could survive slowly transitioning from one to another but are catastrophic to jump too quickly from one state to another.

** This is less about technology itself than the way wizardry normally works in fantasy worlds, which I feel is important to the question. Generally wizardry is a very intellectually challenging art that you can study for a lifetime without mastering more than a little of it, but clearly has huge benefits both to yourself and society. Therefore the intelligent members of these fantasy societies are more likely to study wizardry then say invent scientific fields. To put in terms that make sense for us. Why would you try to create a new field of study when you can became so useful to society by becoming a doctor, something that is guaranteed to be a useful skill. When the smartest members of your society are all becoming mages it is unsurprising that technological advances are stunted.

** What we consider science is our ability to discern the rules that govern our environment. What we consider technology is that which uses those rules efficiently to achieve some objective.

In a fantasy setting, the world can endlessly frustrate would-be scientists. The world might truly be governed by the whims of cosmic beings, or various observed forces might in fact be governed by machine elves. Scientists might need to take into account far more variables than in the real world (e.g. this light bulb will only function if you are a good person, except on days dedicated to the worship of the lord of darkness), which would at the very least slow development.
