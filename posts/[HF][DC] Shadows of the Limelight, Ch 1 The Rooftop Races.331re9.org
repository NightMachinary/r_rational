*** That's why it seemed so familiar! Yeah, it feels a lot like a Sanderson book. Effective prose, subtle characterization, awe-inspiring magic with hidden shades of complexity, and exquisite worldbuilding.

** I do have a subreddit set up for this over at [[/r/shadowsofthelimelight]], if anyone wants to use that. Also, [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][a Patreon campaign]] which (if nothing else) will let you see what I look like. Mirrored on [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3248665/1/Shadows-of-the-Limelight][FictionPress here]].

*** Nice start :-) I've pledged to Patreon. Now I'm also really looking forward to The Dark Wizard of Donkerk because I really liked the setting but Shadows of the Limelight will be very good too I think.

**** Thanks for the backing! And yes, I'll return to Donkerk again, possibly once this is over. There are already another two chapters beyond what's up on FictionPress, though I need to go back and edit/rewrite/polish everything before I can start it up as properly thought out fiction.

*** It might be better to make a subreddit for all your writings rather than creating a new subreddit for each new work. Otherwise, you would just end up with a bunch of dead and inactive subreddits.

Alternately, wait until you become popular enough until the mods start pestering you to start your own subreddit?

**** I'm squatting [[/r/alexanderwales]] (and have been for something like three years, because why wouldn't you take namespace that rightfully belongs to you?). If there's ever a need to, I'll switch over to that, but I need a bit more under my belt first, I think.

(Currently [[/r/alexanderwales]] contains a bunch of posts that I like to refer to, so I'd have to clean it up a bit.)

** Yes. This is good, and with sufficiently rational behavior it is even better. Enjoying Dominic's riskiness, for good or bad, and Welexi's near cynicism.

Are the World building tales canon? And are they needed for story understanding (great casual exposition btw am liking the small bits all over the place)

ALSO EDIT: What the heck is up with Lost City? [[#s][Spoiler]]

*** [[#s][Lost City]]

This was meant to be a puzzle story, where you could figure these things out, but I didn't have a sufficient pool of people to calibrate puzzle difficulty against. Also, it was written ages ago - I think I could probably do better now.

** This is incredibly good.

The idea of fame directly converting to raw power, but practice (and intelligence I assume) being used to 'finesse it' is very intriguing. Obviously as we've seen here, a little finesse and unexpected action can allow someone with no power to finish off someone at the height.

So, of course my next thought just based on the powers seen so far is "If Welexi can create one-shot kill lightsabers that work on the most powerful foes, and those can be wielded by relatively normal people, why doesn't he make 20 and have a set of Ionion Hetaroi style companions to wield them?"

While a famous person with one powerset is certainly strong, a famous /team/ who creatively uses their powers together is potentially unbeatable. Each strength to all, each weakness covered by a friend's strength.

That was what made Weaver so deadly in Worm, she knew how to combine people and powers creatively.

At any rate, I'll certainly be following this. I'm going to give you money as well.
