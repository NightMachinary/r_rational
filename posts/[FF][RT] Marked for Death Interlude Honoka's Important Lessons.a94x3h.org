** I was running a little empty this week, so here's an interlude instead of an actual chapter. Honoka is a first-year student at ninja school and Kagome is her tutor. Her somewhat crazy, paranoid, explosives-loving tutor.

*** So I just binged MfD, how does one join in the questing? Asking because I have ideas for measuring chakra. (The seals that vibrate when chakra is used near them. It's mentioned that you can change how much chakra needs to be used to set them off. You could set a standard like "one Hazon is equal to the amount of chakra measured when the transformation technique is used from one foot away". Units being Hazons, obviously)
