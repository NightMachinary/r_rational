** Finally getting some action. If frustratingly dragged out.

How long has it been since we actually saw Rain in a prepared party fighting against something that's actually a danger to him? Not since the original journey to the first lair right?

*** I've been letting chapters save up because this story moves so slow as a webserial.

I've got a month's worth of chapters saved up. Should I wait another month or just wait a year? Anyone on Patreon want to chime in?

**** You should probably wait like six months. You did pick a good stopping place though. But I'm confident this arc is going to get drawn out as much as the last one.

***** Is it worth starting the series now with that in mind? How good are the early chapters/arcs?

****** The first arc is great. That's why it's so popular. The second drags on if you're reading it one chapter a week, but I imagine it would flow a lot better if you read it all at once.

The only thing really frustrating about it is the slow pace of new chapters.

**** Just honestly forget about it for awhile. If you're checking these posts you'll find out when it's worth jumping back in. There will be 100+ comments on the chapter he raises his cap, or the chapter 8 before that one when people in here are all buying the patron to read it.

If you look there was a good run of early-mid chapters that all got 75+ comments, now we're sitting around like 25-40. Just watch these threads for the next few months.

**** Depends what you were looking for to restart reading. The story will still be here a few years from now though

** Seemed like the author making an effort to gimp Rain because we saw how bad detection trivializes dungeons before.

*** Or perhaps it's answering the question of why doesn't every delving party have detection?

Besides, we already knew it was unreliable since the previous lair, even more so in lairs.

** I'm a little bit miffed that Rain just completely writes off Ava. Like. She's Awakened. She's a better (and more experienced) mage than Kettle is at twice her age. She's a better shot than anybody in the company other than Amelia and Jamus. She's a /fire mage/ in an /ice dungeon/. And didn't she directly save Rain's bacon at least once during the Rank Shift? I distinctly remember her having a Big Damn Heroes moment. And Mlem is even also going.

But because she's a young person, he writes her off a even a possibility to go.

I know nobody is going to agree with me and I'll probably get downvoted to hell, but it makes me sad to see competent young people overlooked just for being young.

*** If you can avoid bringing a preteen (isn't she like 8??) into a combat situation, don't bring them. That's nearly always going to be true. You're saying "just for being young", but it's very much a relevant factor.

Less experienced, less reliable under pressure, and good odds of lifelong trauma from being a combatant at a young age. Rain is from our world, and I'm guessing his opinion of child soldiers is not high. It would super OoC to take her if nothing else.

**** Forget her experience and reliability and mental state.

She's physically incapable. She can't carry or even drag or maybe even roll over a downed party member. Cue all the reasons GI Jane "couldn't" be a Navy Seal, except accurate instead of gender bias bullshit.

** Aw yeah, time to see what a balanced party with defined roles can do. This reminds me of the feeling I used to get before a big cape fight in Worm.

Also, I'm really glad to see that Delve hit #1 by followers! All the whining about pacing/leveling in this sub gave me the false impression that the wider community didn't enjoy the story. Happy to see I'm in the majority that don't have that problem.
