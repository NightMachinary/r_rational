** How is this on topic? It seems like you're simply trolling, especially since you titled it in the positive, which you likely expected would be the more popular opinion, and reversed your position within.

*** My position is altruism is irrational.

The title was to get people to consider the topic.

I could have said the opposite for click bait, but then some mod might have rage closed, or I would have gotten a flood of downvotes.

Where is the right subreddit, for discussing rationality.

In other words, you knew that your actual opinion would get you downvoted or modded so you lied in your title as click bait.
