When he got soul damage, Zorian "figured out" that he hadn't woken up when Kiri jumped on him, because "she always does that."

Kiri's response was "Not always."

But no, she hasn't committed the exact instance of that he'd be retaliating for.

**** Did anyone find that both Daimen and Xvim sacrificing themselves to get Zorian out was too much of a coincidence? They were both mentioned as being in on Zorian's plan to get past Zach's mind blank.

My theory is that they got past Zach's defences and found out something really important to stopping Panaxeth. That's why they were both so determined to get Zorian out of the loop, even at the cost of their own lives. That information is probably something related to the angels which has been so heavily foreshadowed in recent chapters.

This line from Daimen particularly intrigued me:

“It's fine if I die, but you have to live. Don't let it all be in vain. It can't!”

******** I think the bigger impact is the information he retains, not the amount of time he spent in the loop (though those are tied together but not mutually exclusive in a hypothetical situation). That is the real reason he is the most important besides Zach. Even if he only retained his improvements in mind magic, he would still be the most important. The information he has is vital for convincing key allies, and has strategic information on how to counter the invaders.

Even if you had briefed any of the 6+ month loopers (time dilation chambers) it would be simply impossible for any of them to retain and retrieve the amount of information Zorian can hold.

Getting Zorian out achieves a lot more than anyone else, except perhaps Zach who has his own exit anyway.

There is so much value that they will get once Zorian brings them up to speed in the real world.

(Lore has it that the soul records a person's life so they can be judged once passed, though it doesn't say what happens after that.

See, shifters (Rania, cat shifters, et al) ARE two souls one body. And Zorian spent time figuring this out. And it is stated out openly: Even if the ritual is known, it is insanely hard to start a new shifter clan. One, because you NEED primordial blood for that; secondly, even if you got that somehow (killing shifter kids is one way), maintaining the balance in the second generation is a massive problem.

See, Sudomir fused with not one, but 5 souls, including a troll and a dragon. Both species are sentient and sapient. Dragons ARE mages (we know from ZZs flight aboard the stolen ship to Blantyrre; and their fight with one for the last key). Yet, he was still in control.

And Zorian HAD interrogated him extensively about it (he wondered how the hell it even partially worked). So, the experimentation was already done (by Sudomir), and Zorian by this point is powerful enough to replicate it. And since it would involve fusing with his own soul, it won't be an uncontrollable mess.

But still, the rational thing to do was to do the simplest thing, eject his old soul, pass it into afterlife and continue from their. Least complications. But still, it was a massive setup for no payoff (as far as we know of right now).

It's not really clear whether Zorian manipulating his original's soul will give him any more control in a fusion ritual than Sudomir had. It's unknown if there were any clues at all in Sudomir's experimentation that would let the secondary souls retain sapience. And it definitely doesn't seem to me like Zorian is the kind of person to perform a probably- irreversible soul magic on bystanders, without them actually requesting it (even if in this case the other party is his original self).

If he stores the key findings of the research, not all is lost as presumably this will allow one to derive the rest of the research with time in a world where magic is less "magical" and more like a physical property of the world, e.g. electromagnetism.

Of course there is a massive data loss but with enough people he recruits, some is still salvageable with time. Frankly, I'm not convinced all of the research would have even been necessary for his immediate and pressing goal.

Edit: Just thought of another scenario that /could have/ potentially circumvented the orb's precious contents being destroyed if they had managed to exit physically.

OK so they were never going to be allowed to keep the things they physically obtained in the time loop. Their souls leave, but not physical goods so it's not really a loss. Plus, whatever they obtained in the loop can almost-just-as-easily be reobtained.

The iterated blueprints and data Zorian gained... Doesn't he already have a memory bank ability that he uses to store that stuff anyway? Like I remember a section where he even dismissed some of the orbs usefulness since he could already store memories. He's probably also well familiar by now with the iterated plans so again not much of a loss.

The entire team making it out was always going to be a hail Mary and this really does hurt him a little. But he was always able to convince Xvim and Alanic of the time loop with trivial ease later on, he'd be able to recruit the inner circle pretty fast. Plus like Ilsa said, these are grown mages at the end of their careers, they've mostly plateaued so the loss of the gains inside the loop aren't a big deal.

And like others said, this was the last chance for everyone except Zach to get out, it was all or nothing.

Also, I really disagree that Qatach is evil. It's mostly a moral disconnect from the from more brutal time he comes from.

Eldemar and Sulamnon are the biggest threats to his country and he just wants to weaken them enough so they can't threaten Ulquua Ibasa.

I'd imagine from his point of view, it wasn't backstabbing (Plus ZZ literally planned on straight up murdering him if he so much as stepped into the orb).

But the cultists and Quatach were probably too clever and figured out what they were really doing and trying to stop them so Panaxeth could truly be freed.

Oooh right I just reread the relevant bit. That is a pretty big blow actually but it happened 2 chapters ago really.

Chapter 22:

#+begin_quote
  There were two main forms of mana available to the mage: his personal mana and the ambient one that emanated from the underworld. Personal mana was something that all things with a soul possessed in varying amounts, and it was attuned to the person producing it -- it bent easily to its creator's will, and was innately more malleable and controllable than anything else they might use to power their magic, since it never resisted the caster's efforts to shape it. Ambient mana, on the other hand, was both harder to control and toxic to living beings. Not enough to kill a mage just for using it once, but any substantial, prolonged use resulted in sickness and insanity.

*************** for Zorian's benefit. because the Guardian is not going to know what to do with Zorian since it will find a soul already in place when "re-anchoring", where Zach's body will be fine. they don't want to risk that so they had to find a way to bring Zorian out as a body rather than as a soul

Chapter 55:

#+begin_quote
  "So the Controller has their original soul drawn into the time loop when it is first made," Zorian said. "They aren't a copy, so there is no problem with them leaving. But everyone else would have to kill someone to get out, and that's unacceptable. Is that correct?"

  "Yes," the Guardian agreed.

  "But you could do that?" Zach suddenly spoke up. "If one of the copies wanted to leave this place, you could switch their soul with that of the original?"

  "Theoretically," the Guardian admitted, "but that goes against what I was made to do. I am the Guardian of the Threshold. One of the main tasks the Maker gave me was to ensure things inside the time loop could not menace the source of the template. If a diverged copy tried to kill the original by switching their souls with it, I would do my best to stop them."

  "What about a normal, un-diverged copy?" asked Zorian. "Surely there is no harm in replacing the original with a normal copy. They're practically the same thing! It's what makes it okay to destroy millions of souls every month or so, isn't it?"

  The Guardian hesitated. A short, tense silence descended on the scene as it considered the scenario.

  "So long as the copies do not diverge too much from the original, such a switch would be theoretically acceptable," the Guardian eventually admitted. "But it is my purpose to keep the time loop from spilling out in the real world as much as possible, so I would still refuse to perform such a switch. Only the controller, with the knowledge and secrets they gathered inside the time loop, is allowed to leave and make their mark on the world outside, since they are technically of that world to begin with."

it's not that there's an advantage to taking their bodies out. it's their only feasible option. they did discuss the possibility of tricking the Guardian but they decided it was ultimately too risky and unfeasible. how would you even go about figuring out the mechanics of the Guardian when it's godmade, contingencies to prevent tampering, can immediately erase you (or you can assume so), and you have limited ways of interacting with it?

also, to be perfectly accurate, they had no real plan from the start. they were looking for clues on how to get out for quite a while.

only until Chapter 65:

#+begin_quote
  "Why, though?" Zach asked. "Is this about finding a way for you to leave the time loop?"

  Zorian looked at his fellow time traveler in surprise.

  "Don't be so surprised," Zach scoffed. "You already told me how space itself seemed to collapse when Panaxeth tried to leave his prison. It's natural to wonder if that kind of spatial hole could be used to fashion some kind of passage out of this place. I've thought of it too. Admittedly, I have no idea how you could actually go about doing that..."
#+end_quote

and even in Chapter 85 they were still only just figuring things out:

#+begin_quote
  Yet, Zorian knew he had to risk it. The fact was, their current initiatives were insufficient. Even if they managed to gather all the keys together in one restart before the time ran out, that wouldn't be enough. Not for Zorian, anyway. The problem of how he was supposed to exit the time loop still remained. His original self was still out there in the real world, so he couldn't just order the Guardian of the Threshold to shove his soul into his real body and be done with it. The Guardian of the Threshold may be confused about his controller status, but it would surely notice there was already a soul in Zorian's original body upon trying that. And even if that could be sidestepped somehow, there was still the matter of how to seize control of the body from his original self.

The primordial did specify (several times) that he was "Incarnating" those that took his offer, so theoretically that should mean a brand new body, so there would indeed be two Silverlakes.

*** Super excited to see where the Cyorian aranea come into play! He can't prove that he's from the looping world perfectly but for some people he has key memories of their most guarded secrets to help at least convince some of them. See Xvim and his passcode. For some people, he has also obtained enough of their skills where it is eerily impossible for something to not have happened and he can actually just show them what's going on in the Dungeon in order to at least convince them partially.

I'm not sure how contingent belief in the loop for various characters are in specifically the fact that the spiritual realm was cut off in the looping world, because presumably the spiritual realm is now accessible again.

Which begs the question... should Zorian attempt to call for the angels' help? Getting help from them could end up being a double edged sword. I can see a scenario where he could potentially leave a tip to operators of certain temples (and disguise himself to remain anonymous/untraceable), and the priests/priestesses at these institution could then relay this information to the angels.

*** I don't think that there will be too much of a concern with proving the loop, he's only really lost a couple items of proof:

1. They won't be cut off from the spiritual world, which was a pretty big factor for at least Xvim.
2. The Primordial cage won't be changed, although that only mattered to Silverlake, so it basically doesn't matter.
3. The loss of the orb will lose Zorian a lot of research materials and other resources they may have stashed away.

However, they knew they were going to lose the orb anyways, and they always have a couple contingencies. At the very least Zorian will still have all the notes (that he altered on to empty notebooks) that Zack and Zorian used to convince Alanic, Xvim, Kael, etc before they were given temporary marks. It seems likely that Zorian will have specifically updated those notebooks, as well as expanded them to most, if not all, of the people they gave temporary markers.

This won't be as useful (for example someone like Taiven isn't going to have some sort of cryptokey generation prepared for such an event like Xvim and one of the spider colonies did), but it should be doable.

I feel like the big question is "how soon can Silverlake convince Red Mage, and then perhaps Xuat Lichl." It could turn in to a race between the baddies assassinating the team members versus the good guys warning and helping them.

The good news with that is that I doubt Silverlake will go and try to do murdering by herself, certainly she'd be leery of fighting Alanic and Xvim, even with surprise--that's why I think she'll go to Red Robe first. From there, however, Silverlake and Red Robe may team up to start killing people while a RR simulacrum convinces the Lich to support against the stronger members.

If they are replicas, there's still a chance that the memories are salvageable. If they are replicas, that means the Sovereign Gate itself stores the memories and not the orb.

** Well this was a chapter and a half.

A huge change in the stakes of the story too. One hand, Zorian doesn't have to worry about the impending collapse of the time loop and his soul with, and on the other he's now out of the time loop - no more second chances.

And now he's got to decide who he tells about the time loop he just went through. There are the usual suspects, obviously, but I can't see him being particulalry open about it unless he needs to reel in some assistance and explain his knowledge.

I also want to see how much, if at all, the next month differs from the inside of the time loop, what with the spiritual planes back in working order.

But I bet Zorian's going to enjoy the first day of the next month, assuming he lives that long.

** So Fucking hyped for the next chapter, this one was absolutely incredible.

I don't think we've seen the last of Zach, he almost certainly made it out as well. (From a Literary standpoint, Zach has had far to much screen time and mystery surrounding his forgotten past to die an implied off-screen death.) However, I'm curious as to whether Zach will be an ally once Zorian tries to meet up with him in the real world. The last 13 or so loops would have gone by in a fraction of a real world second, so Zach should have arrived back to reality at nearly the same instant as Zorian. Will the probable mental compulsions placed upon Zach make him Zorian's enemy? Can't wait to see.

I'm also curious on how Zorian plans to handle the situation if that occurs, because most of combat magic was done by Zach. Even though Zorian has combat skills comparable to a skilled Combat Mage, and could probably win against most combat mages (Even Irrespective of his Mind Magic), he is nowhere near the level of master combat mages like Zach or Quatach-Ichl. He just doesn't have the mana. However, If Zorian could somehow replicate the divine energy frame around Quatach-Ichl's soul and double his base mana, that would go a long way to evening the playing field for Zorian. He may not have the time now that he's out of the time loop, but after all that analysis and destruction of the Divine artifacts, Zorian is the only mage even possible of pulling something like that off on his own.

Seeing as how Zach's mana reserves allows him to cast about 250 force bolts, and Quatach-Ichl's mana reserves, with the crown, allows for around 3000 force bolts ( 300 * 10 = 3000), doubling Zorian's mana from around 80 Bolts to 160 would definitely help him bridge his mana gap, while still allowing him to remain an underpowered character compared to his adversaries, having to rely on strategy and preparation to win. I really hope Zorian manages to get a mana power up like this, which I feel he desperately needs to take on Zach, but we will see. The wait is gonna kill me.

It is implied that Zach has been mentally compromised by both the angels and Red Robe. Ignoring Red Robe, when one considers how weak zach was when the time loop started, its very easy to believe the Angels put layers upon layers of compulsions on Zach before sending him in. The sovereign gate's keys were scattered by the angels, and it hadn't been activated for millennia, because if used to its fullest extent it can turn humans mages into practical demigods. The angels wanted a demigod on their side to fight the Primordial, but due to Red Robe, Zach wasted most of his time and became simply a master mage. Regardless, I don't believe for a second that the angels would ever risk a rogue demigod coming out of the Sovereign gate. Zach had to be controlled. Since Zorian maintains his free will, I don't think the Angels will be too happy when they realize there is a time looper not under there control roaming around.

******* Of course there's no direct evidence stating Zach had to be controlled by the angels. However, just logically, it'd be in the angels very good interest to mind control Zach, because as I stated, the time loop allows for absurd power ups in mages if properly utilized. We know it's very likely he's under a mind control spell in some way, and its implied in chapter 90 that both the Angels and Red Robe put compulsions on his mind. If the angels did in fact put a compulsion on Zach's mind, it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to figure out their reasoning for it.

The compulsion that Red Robe placed on Zach made him not achieve his goals, and this is what we have direct evidence for, but since it is implied the angels could have done stuff as well, it is probable that there are still mind compulsions placed on Zach by the Angels.

As for the keyes, I may have misremembered that fact, so I will concede to your counterpoint as I'm not gonna search 40 chapters to try to find the text. I still think my original hypothesis stands, that Zach is under the Angel's control, but this is after all just theorizing at the end of the day.

******* Maybe. We don't know the exact power level of the angels but if Zorian had been given the 20 extra years of time loops that that zach wasted fighting the Dragon, his power level would be far far higher. He likely would have figured out divine energies, which would vastly increase his base mana pool (Not just double it, since its possible he may have worked out a more powerful or efficient stabilization frame, and or just make himself ten rings that store the same mana as the crown.). Add to the that the extra experience from 20 years of study and combat, and Zorian is already approaching astronomical power levels.

Yet the 60 or so years zach was supposed to get out of the loop is nothing compared to the 1,000 or so years that a fully charged Sovereign gate is supposed to give the controller. A normal mage, let alone a mage like Zorian who has perfect memory, would have an absurd amount of power after a thousand years of learning, practice and growth. Is it enough to Rival the Angels? I think so, but who knows. At the very least, describing them as demigods is a not unreasonable.

Going along the idea that his start may have been an Angel's intervention, they may have intended what happened.

Taken from another one of my posts in this thread because it is relevant to the memories:

#+begin_quote
  Hopefully and rationally, it would make sense to cram the most important details of the data stored within the orb inside Zorian's mind. Ikosian magic seems to follow some structure and is governed by rules (and it seems spell formulae to the extent that it resembles electrical engineering in my eyes). If he stores the key findings of the research, not all is lost as presumably this will allow one to derive the rest of the research with time in a world where magic is less "magical" and more like a physical property of the world, e.g. electromagnetism.

****** Time in a time loop is different from regular time. You can avoid social responsibilities and suffer no consequences. You can not show up for work or class and spend money like its going out of style and suffer no consequences. You can ignore social interactions or taboo's at no social costs. Did you miss your friends birthday and now he no longer wants to help you on your personal work? Who cares. In a month he'll no longer be angry with you, and you can ask him to help you then. You have much more free time to do what you want, and alot less stress in your life, when interactions like these are no longer a requirement for you. A large part of our lives are just spent treading water, so to speak, so once you stop top trying to maintain your reputation, social circle, lifestyle, or finances, a substantial amount of time opens up to you.

A time loop is particularly helpful for teaching a person combat, illegal activities, and dangerous hobbies.

Doing an important experiment that might kill you? Who cares. Safety precautions would just slow down your work. Poisons or cancerogic compounds matter not to to you. Without the fear of an arrest, you can learn to rob and swindle people to your heart's content. Combat can be learned at your pace and stress free. In the real world, if you screw up any of these dangerous pursuits, you'd be dead, kidnapped, in prison, etc. You don't get a second chance to learn from major mistakes in a real life or death situation. Since people learn how to do things by repetition and correcting their past mistakes, learning in these dangerous situations is limited. At best, you can only correct minor mistakes, since major mistakes will just get you killed. Training for dangerous activities in safe, hypothetical scenarios can help get around this issue, but it will never be the same as the real thing. A practice scenario on how to defend against a guy trying to kill you in a defense class, where safety precautions are enforced, will always be different than learning how to defend yourself against an actual guy who is trying to kill you.

In short, you can't just look at the number of years Zorian has been inside the loop and determine his original potential. He's had far more opportunities and time to practice his talents than any equivalent time frame in the real world could allow.

what he got actual mastery of is mana shaping, so he can do basic "spells" without actually using a spell for most areas, medical magic being one he haven't found a shaping exercise for, or at least not one that was easy to practice with. his expertise in this area aid's his casting in all areas and is a boon due to his low mana pool.

****** Now after I think it again, Zorian don't want deep into necromantic (do not enslave the dead, or curse people) but he already half way there because he can cast simulacrum, use soul projection, and body possession, it's his morality and that stop him to become necromancer. From blood magic Zorian only use enchantment ritual and life force as powering magic, he never use it to summon demon. With knowledge from Sudomir and blood magic books he know how to become necromancer and demon summoner but still no, his moral against it, that's why he don't want to learn those thing.

Other disicplines, I mean master is he already too proficient to use them and overshadow many people, Zorian divination is too good because mind magic aid divination, with mind enchantment and custom built divination compass his divinination will upgrade. Yes low mana pool hold back Zorian, still with it Zorian can be lot faster at mana shaping exercise, tinker with magitek(spell formulae & artifice), and he have to creative when to defeat enemy more powerful than him 'in term of mana".

** Okay I definitely wasn't expecting the exit to happen this chapter but I am so happy it did - I was on the edge of my seat for much of the chapter. Very curious what Zorian found in Zach's mind, and what he'll be doing to fiddle with the loop. Also, how will things be different now that he's in the real world?

...will we see a return of the Cyorian Aranea? I totally haven't been hoping for that ever since they started messing with markers...

I think it'll be a while, but one thing I look forward to is more character interaction time. We haven't really had much of any for the past arc as the crunch to escape the loop has gotten more and more intense, and I doubt we'll see much for a while as Zorian will have to work against Silverlake (maybe) and with the time loop (probably). I just remember that some of the reasons I fell in love with this story were Zorian exploring the world, learning magic, getting to know and interact with his classmates and friends, etc. The last arc had been really devoid of that type of character development, and that may have been unavoidable just because of the plot structure, but I still miss it.

How legitimate do people think QI's faith in the angels is? And if he is right to regard them as he does, how does that change things with Silverlake? Might she be of the same opinion, and part of why she was so willing to take Panaxeth's deal was she doubted it mattered? I forget the exact terms of the deal, so it might be that Panaxeth forces her to work against the angels... If she isn't forced to, and QI is right about their capabilities (assuming such capabilities go beyond Z&Z), and Silverlake is unaware of that, did she just become a much smaller problem to deal with?

My /guess/ would be, even if he had a phylactery, that people wouldn't think of him as a lich for the same reason people don't think of a platypus as a mammal: he might meet all the criteria, but /that's just not what those look like/.

***** They definitely grew in the normal way, and he had that divine blessing to double his reserves put on him before entering the loop, but he had really big reserves from the start. He mentioned early on that he's a magnitude 50 in terms of Mana reserves, but can shape like a magnitude 25. Given the blessing doesn't affect shaping skill, we can assume he started out at a magnitude 25, which is far above the average of 8-12.

******* Umm, not conclusively, but it would be really odd if it wasn't the case. He mentioned he had shaping skills like someone with half his mana, he got the marker from a mysterious divine source (so we know he had contact with a divine entity), his mana situation matches exactly with the way QI describes how he got lots of mana, etc. It's pretty implausible that his huge mana reserves are cause by anything else.

******* Not sure if it was confirmed in a previous chapter, but they mention it in passing here. Zach definitely has a divine blessing. "Well, except for Zach. His fellow time traveler was sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes clothes, trying to sense the divine energies of his divine blessing and Controller marker. Zorian was not sure why he was doing that, to be honest. Both he and Zach had already succeeded at perceiving these divine energies,"

This implies he had these reserves before the loop.

** Hypothesis. Since this starts before the one month mark maybe Zorian is the one who enters Zach into the timeloop to begin with? And messes with his mind so he doesn't remember, so as to recreate the exact situation in the timeloop ending in his own release (an then Zach's). Maybe that's what he saw in Zach's mind, his own handiwork. He is the one who's good in soul and mind magic.

*** that would only work in a true time loop. and thus would not be possible.

​

say you are correct. this Zorian that just took over is going to eventually toss Zach into the loop. say it's day -2 relative to the loop we're familiar with. on day -1, Zorian tosses Zach into loop, which for some reason starts the loop in a simulated timeline that's 1 day ahead, so day 0. then new loop Zorian breaks out. it'll be day -1 at best. where'd Zorian on Day -2 come from? or rather, the day -2 Zorian that the Zorian stole the body from?

how would we continue this loop?

**** It said that zorian arrived before the one month before the release. And I think I vaguely remember something mentioned about the time loop being activated before the one month mark, just imitating the conditions of the one month before. But admittedly there's a problem with time in this hypothesis, since the time in pocket dimensions runs in the same direction as the outside world. But it would explain why zorian is the most important person to get out. Anyway. It was not the case.

***** It was mentioned in this chapter and was a really big reveal in the previous one. Not sure how you even followed this chapter without ever realizing that, must have made it really confusing haha. Here is the mention in this chapter, it is right at the beginning: "They had informed the whole group about their second encounter with Panaxeth and what it meant for Zorian. Strangely, the group took another bout of bad news in stride. In fact, the knowledge that Zorian now shared fates with them seemed to significantly improve the mood of the group."
