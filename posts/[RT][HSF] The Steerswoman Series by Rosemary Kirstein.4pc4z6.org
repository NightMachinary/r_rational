This is a great series currently with 4 books and more on the way (I am just starting to read the fourth). It is pretty obscure but I think it fits this subreddit perfectly

Steerswomen, and a very few Steersmen, are members of an order dedicated to discovering and disseminating knowledge. Although they are foremost navigators of the high seas, Steerswomen are also explorers and cartographers upon land as well as sea. With one exception, they are pledged to always answer any question put to them with as truthful a response as is possible within their own limitations. However, they also require anyone of whom they ask questions to respond in the same manner, upon penalty of the Steerswomen's ban; those under the ban do not receive answers from the steerswomen.

The series follows the steerswoman Rowan as she explores world and tries to understand its mysteries. I would love to discuss the world, but that would require spoiling most of the books.

** Good series, some of the books get pretty weird at times but usually in an enjoyable fashion. I definitely second this recommendation.

** What's the exception? Or, is that a spoiler?

*** The exception is someone under the steerswomans' ban. If you are under the ban then no steerswomen will answer any question from you.
