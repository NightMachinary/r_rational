** I was disappointed. The basic theme to me seemed to be "SW gets all the technology /and/ all the smart people, ST gets none" and this is /particularly/ annoying because, at least in the early seasons of TNG which are what I watched, TNG aspired to be more intelligent than SW.

** This is basically exactly what it says on the tin, written by someone who has read Sun Tzu.

Every faction acts sensibly in pursuit of their own goals, leading to shifting alliances and confrontations between and within the United Federation (/Next Generation/), Rebel Alliance, Galactic Empire (an original version, headed by Emperor Anakin Solo), Romulan Empire, and Borg. It is mostly written as a high level, strategic view of an extended military campaign, jumping between a few viewpoints as it's convenient - this is not a character story, it's a politics story.

And it's a /blast/. Loads of fun. Lots of interesting technology comparisons with interesting applications, lots of intelligent characters making completely valid inferences using incomplete information, lots of getting things done with creative efficiency.

About my only complaint is that the only meaningful female character is not feminist-friendly. Like, distractingly so. Also, a lot of the dramatic irony never gets closure, as in reality. But if you can get past that, /Conquest/ is awesome. I'm not even especially fond of /Star Trek/ and it's a great read. So's the rest of the site! It examines the technology and tactics shown in both of the series, plus some general space and science topics. Most of the ability match-ups in the story come directly from the analysis you can find by clicking around.

** I was a bit confused by the start wars canon.

#+begin_quote
  We are ruled with an iron fist by Emperor Anakin Solo, son of Han Solo and Leia Organa. It was not always like this- Anakin Solo was originally elected a Senator, like his predecessor Palpatine. He proved to be a good leader, and successfully maintained order over his territory even as regional flare-ups plagued the other regions. But when his beloved and elderly parents were both murdered while attempting to negotiate a peace treaty between two warring systems, Anakin became enraged. He blamed the non-interventionist policies of the New Republic for their deaths, and many in the Senate agreed with him. With their help, he instituted a massive rearmament program, ostensibly to restore the credibility of the central government and crack down on criminals, terrorists, and local warlords who had gotten out of hand."

** i know this is coming quite a bit late, but i finally found a good description of what made this story so thoroughly unsatisfying (other than the infuriatingly stupid speech q ends it with) and it's diabolus ex machina. all the important moves of the story are shit the emperor did behind the scenes before it even starts. he perfectly anticipates and manipulates every single thing an entire galaxy of alien sophonts with myriad alien cultures, mindsets, and biologies do well in advance, all of which are entirely new to him and his entire galaxy. the readers don't get to see him planning all this, we just get a lot of descriptions of starfleet ships blowing up.

add to that a starfleet that acts like a bunch of dipshit precontact hillbillies, klingons who act like petaQ, and borg just plain too stupid to live.

** I don't recall ships in Star Wars having force fields around them

+Anyway, excellent fiction, I'm about 1/2 through so far - very fast pace, very action-packed, highly recommended.+

Edit: I finally managed to finish the story, which came off as too much SW fanboyism, where they were far more cleverer the the Trek characters, outsmarting and outmaneuvering even Trek's best. Picard didn't act much at all like he did in the show, and I think the only character that seemed really consistent was Q.
