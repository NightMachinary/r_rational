** I remember really liking the first 10-15 chapters years and years ago and then the translation got dropped. When I tried again after the translation resumed a couple of years ago, I found the story went in completely another direction from what I was hoping for and didn't enjoy it. I don't remember it being particularly rational, either?

*** Maybe try reading again. It's really a good novel. The characters are intelligent, not just the main character. The main character use his modern-day knowledge, and his intelligence to outwit those in greater power. I believe the story is completely rational. The world, plot, character, and political development are really good and unique too. I suggest you reread the novel, make past chapter 30 and you will start to like the novel.
