** Oh man, that first page...

I'd heard that the prison break would start in this chapter, so that's a little disappointing, but this was still good.

Last chapter the author said it would be prison break arc. That entails multiple chapters planning and working towards it. It's not going to happen in just one day.

**** OIC. I must have misunderstood (or it got muddled through the grape vine on its way to me; I can't remember exactly what was said).

** I wonder what kind of plan Norman came up with in his "I won't lose to mama anymore" induced...freak out? It seems like he might have something intense going on. I enjoy how it shows that he keeps calm on the outside for everyone else, even in situations where he's basically going crazy.

Also, the kid silhouette at the end when they discuss their 10 day plan schedule implies they were overheard. I'm thinking it was intentional on Norman or Ray's part.

It's going to make me look at him more suspiciously from this point on. He's going to snap at some point, I'm sure.
