Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** A lot of people seem to think that rational fiction must avoid narrative causality, but I think this is a bigger hurdle to overcome than people realize. Narrative causality is major part of storytelling and I've seen plenty of stories here try to avoid it in ways that hurt the story's quality such as shoehorning exposition into dialogue, denying characters agency by making events feel arbitrary, and defying the audience's expectations instead of playing to them. While there are many stories that have pulled such things off, not all stories can or should and we need to keep that in mind if we want rational fiction to catch on.

I've read EY's essay where he says a rational protagonist should be Genre Savvy enough to figure out the rules of their story, but many authors seem to have interpreted that to mean they need to deny the audience of narrative satisfaction. I say this because we want more people to read rational fiction, but people outside this community aren't going to read stories because they happen to fit the criteria of rational fiction. They're going to read them because they're good stories, so I think we should discuss how to make rational fiction more palatable and entertaining according to the standards of fiction in general. What do you think?

*** I agree. Tropes and genres exist as they are for reasons, and one of the biggest reasons is that authors have been trying to optimize their stories for entertainment value for thousands of years. Throwing out genre convetions without understanding their purpose is */Bad/*.

Take the Unspoken Plan Guarantee, for example. Characters make a plan off-camera, then execute it perfectly on-camera. You can't have characters make a plan on-camera and then execute it perfectly on-camera, because you drain the tension from the story and the audience gets bored. The trope exists for a reason; if you want to not have it in your story, you need to figure out a way to keep the story entertaining.

I'd really like for people to just ask themselves /why/ some convention/trope exists. /Sometimes/ it's because the author is a stupid lazy hack, but I'd argue that's the minority. Authors are trying to be entertaining; the things they do with their stories are primarily in service of entertainment (this is less true in more commercial works, e.g. Hollywood, where budget and merchandising play a larger factor). Sometimes this entertainment is shallow pandering, but you have to know which is which before you throw the baby out with the bathwater.

**** Now I feel bad for using Metropolitan Man as an example of what not to do because that is excellent advice that I completely agree with, yet I haven't read any of your work after I didn't like your Superman fic. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/][Your review of HPMOR]] even did a good job of pointing out the flaws with the narrative, and I love that story.

***** Oh, I fully understand why people dislike /Metropolitan Man/, I don't begrudge anyone that. It's one of the reasons that I'm hesitant to recommend the story to people. But I didn't do the things that I did with the story because I was trying to subvert genre expectations, I did them because I was trying to create certain unpleasant feelings - the feeling that I get when I think too deeply about the end of humanity, or the wealth of pain and cruelty in the world, or the ambiguity of good and evil. Some of my favorite books have left me in a melancholy state for days afterward. (And I'm not saying that /Metropolitan Man/ does this perfectly, but I've gotten enough reviews to the effect of "I loved this, but I'm never going to read it again" that I think it was at least a partial success.)

If I knew of a way to do it, I would have signaled to the reader beforehand that it was going to be that kind of book, so they could have bailed out if that wasn't what they were into.

Edit: To be clear, there are /other/ reasons that people dislike it, which I'm also very familiar with, just trying to address the specific complaint about lack of catharsis/satisfaction and deviation from narrative conventions.

This is what I loved about Metropolitan Man!

Now, I normally hate it when writers do stuff just to create unpleasant feelings, because usually it's really contrived ("Let's kill this character everyone loves just to signal to the reader that now things are getting serious!") or else it's not a story that has enough to say to justify it ("Now that the hero has slain the dragon and rescued the princess, let's have him get blinded so we can have a Lesson About Disabilities shoehorned in here")

Metropolitan Man actually had something to say, the unpleasantness was what the story was about.

I felt Superman was "allowed" to kill Calhoun because (1) he regretted it immediately afterwards (by opposition to going evil Episode-III-style) and (2) as far as I'm aware, he's a character created in the fic. If it had been Lex Luthor, or Deadshot, or the Joker, the point might have been lost, but here it feels like man Superman kills is an actual 40s mob boss: a person who lived, breathed, smoked cigars and did horrible things. Not cackle maniacally while his hostages were lowered into a vat of acid only to be saved at the last second by Batman/Superman/The Flash, but actually run a mafia with its share of beating, maiming, killing and generally hurting people. Alive, he's a reminder that there are bad, powerful people out there who hurt others; and when he dies, it shows that someone more powerful than you can hurt you if they don't care about ethics or consequences, and it's messy, and it's most definitely not a good thing.

****** I did not get that from this story, but now I understand why others did and why you wanted to write it. I'm happy that I have a reason to respect this story and its fans even if I don't count myself among them. As intentionally unpleasant stories go, I highly recommend The Way of Shadows and the rest of the Night Angel Trilogy that I haven't read yet but have no doubt I will love.

I would describe the book as fantasy Assassin's Creed meets Jessica Jones, with child sexual abuse. It's dark, depressing, and disturbing without ever being exploitive or unnecessarily graphic. It's everything that I think an unpleasant story should be as it forces you to confront inhumanity without giving up on humanity. And now that I think about it, it's actually pretty rational.

**** Fine Structure is a good example of the first two, at least in regards to how much it kept me from enjoying the story. For how much rational fiction emphasizes characters not doing things just because the plot demands it, FS had a lot of people do things just because they were the kind of people who would do them. Unsong also has a problem with focusing on what happened at the expense of why it happened, but I find the subject matter interesting enough to not be bothered by it most of the time.

As for the third issue, there really isn't a better example than the final act of The Metropolitan Man. I don't want to rip into the story AGAIN, but it seriously bothered a lot of Superman fans to see him commit murder and then get murdered by Luthor. It wasn't what a lot of people wanted from a Superman story, even with Luthor as the protagonist, so they were turned off when the story defied their expectations of what would happen in a Superman story. It's the same reason so many people disliked Man of Steel.

*** I think I have a method to counter both narrative railroading and shaggy dog type anticlimatic developments.

When you plot your story, and find a point that looks like "ok, this is a plot armor at work" or "if MC came to a slightly different, but entirely possible conclusion, everything would have went another way" - assign probabilities to different outcomes and roll a dice. You can give your preferred outcome a narrative causality bonus, however, whatever the dice says, go along with it.

Perhaps the most awesome example of this style of writing I have read was in a Naruto fic "sticks and stones" XD (I can elaborate if you are familiar with the setting, or you can read it; the example is in one of the latest chapters though).

**** I actually think that idea of letting probability drive the plot is exactly the problem I was talking about. You're arbitrarily deciding which direction the narrative will take without focusing on what makes for a good narrative. Wildbow once claimed to have rolled dice to decide who would die in Worm when Leviathan attacked, and I think that resulted in pointless and unsatisfying deaths of established characters. If Taylor had died without getting a proper conclusion, then I would've stopped reading right there.

***** And the pointlessness of those deaths contributes a lot to the impact of the Endbringer attack, at least for me. They are Endbringers, not plot devices to kill off characters the author doesn't like. It's painfully obvious when the author is railroading an event like that, and usually feels like a Deus ex Machina.

Of cource, like with any other writing technique, dice rolling should be done correctly. Some characters - protagonists, for example - should be granted plot armor. However, even they shouldn't be completely immune to botched rolls - perhaps something important gets taken from them, or they get blamed for a failure, etc. Plan diferent outcomes and turn them into plot hooks.

****** You're right about Leviathan, that arc did succeed at what it set out to do and most of the deaths didn't bother me all the much. What actually got me to stop reading was that I felt Leviathan set a new paradigm for the story that the Slaughterhouse 9 pushed even further. It started to feel more like a slasher/monster movie than a dark superhero novel, since the plot was just became about surviving attacks by horrifying monsters, and that wasn't what I wanted to read after I'd loved the pre-Leviathan arcs so much.

******* I also loved pre-Leviathan arcs way more) But in my case it's because pre-Leviathan Worm was actually pretty light. Some of the DC comics, for example, are way darker, while still not being considered grimdark. That changed after Leviathan, and only went downhill from there. I don't like grimdark.

Btw, you might like "please don't tell my parent's that I'm a supervillain" series. It's kinda like pre-Leviathan Worm, only way, way lighter) And also pretty rational.

***** Leviathan in particular was justified, I think, because Wildbow is an imaginative enough writer, with a solid enough setting, that he could have worked with almost any outcome the dice gave him. Someone asked him what would have happened if Leviathan had hit some other city and he just spat out a 10+ paragraph plot summary. He could do that because he knew his characters and his setting so well that he could sort of "DM" them through any result of the dice.
