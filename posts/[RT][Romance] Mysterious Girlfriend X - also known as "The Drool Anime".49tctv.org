** I watched this recently.

As far as I can tell it's about a saliva wizard who's power has obvious combat potential. She has the ability to mirror her physical state, such as injury or intoxication, onto her opponent by making them taste her spit. She can also perform surface-level mind-reading on anyone who's saliva she tastes. She is abnormally skilled in melee combat with a bladed weapon.

However, as this is set in high school, she instead uses her power as a substitute for proper communication.

That is perhaps the best phrasing of anything I've ever seen in my life.

*** Not much combat potential, since it only works on people who have a genuine interest in her first (recall how she tested it on the other boy in episode 3, but it had no effect whatsoever).

** I thought I was in the wrong subreddit for a second.

This thing doesn't exemplify rational fiction in any degree really, and I wouldn't even recommend it besides to people who appreciate unique art styles. 8 years of my life down the drain waiting for some advancement in their relationship, but /nope/! Not even a single shonen-esque first/last kiss.

*** It's not espousing the rationalist lifestyle, but it has a marked lack of irrational elements and decisions, which is a vast improvement on most other romances I find.

****** I forget whether that was in the anime, too. Maybe I just read the manga after finishing the anime, or something.

But yeah, that was pretty bad. Not bad for anime, because shit like that happens all the time, but pretty bad if you want to consider something "rational".

******* (I haven't seen most of the anime (though I think I watched the first episode?), but checking the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterious_Girlfriend_X#Episode_list][episode list]] it looks like it in fact was, in episode 11.)

** I finally found a romance anime I unequivocally enjoyed, even moreso than such titans as /ToraDora/, /Spice & Wolf/ or /School Days/. Since the romance section here is relatively empty, I think it's worth a look.

The manga ran for years but the show only runs for thirteen episodes, so if you want the rest of the story you'll have to read it. That said, the ending is satisfactory, and shouldn't leave anyone overly angry.

This is the story of Akira Tsubaki and Mikoto Urabe, two young highschool students who become a couple by the end of the first episode and grow closer as the show continues. That's it. There's no evil villain or save-the-world plot lurking around the corner -- their first real relationship is quite challenging enough. This is a story about learning what's okay and not okay and how to convey and reciprocate feelings to your romantic partner. Both characters take a very thoughtful approach to their relationship and don't make terrible decisions purely for the sake of drama.

I should mention the drool. It's kinda important. If it's too gross, then I can't help you. The show rolls with it, and won't make any effort to include people who are repulsed by it. I expect that to have a lot less of an impact on the readers of this subreddit. People have complained about it fetishizing the drool, and I guess it does, but it could have been much, much worse. There's not much fanservice, although one scene goes a bit dumb later on. Whatever. It's better than it has any right to be, and that is quite enough for me.

*** Okay, I'm torn. On one hand, you're selling it pretty well. On the other hand, it sounds super gross and weird, and I'm kind of suspicious of weird animes.

**** I have watched the entire anime. It is super gross and weird.

However, if you can tolerate the gross weirdness, it is kind of interesting.
