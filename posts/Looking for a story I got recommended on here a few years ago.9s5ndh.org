It was a very short web serial (around 4 chapters I think) about an ordinary accountant from an unspecified past era. He was noticed by a nobleman one day, a nobleman who enlisted him in solving two or three moral quandaries. I'm pretty sure the last challenge was about how we should quantify the equivalence between the life of a king and the lives of a prisoner. Like "how many days of a prisoner's life can we sacrifice to preserve a day of the king's life ?" or something along those lines.

Thanks for your help !

** Oh shit, Daniel Abraham does good work. Not super rationalist, but I can recommend his Long Price Quartet as doing a great job of making wide-reaching ethical issues intensely personal. He's also a co-author of The Expanse, which is basically Game of Thrones in space.

That sounds like it could also be an excellent (and chillingly practical) question to ask in the Fullmetal Alchemist universe.
