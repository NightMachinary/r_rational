** Oh, hell, yeah! I was hoping Sam hadn't just dropped 5555.

Also, Ojai. As in, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1425][Ojai Syndrome]]. Nice.

** I don't think I'm supposed to get it, but if I am, I don't get it. Why does nothing happen at the end? Wouldn't his superior trigger an orbital bombing?

*** The entity that was in Red was SCP 3125, implied in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are][Unforgettable, that's what you are]], described in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/case-colourless-green][CASE COLORLESS GREEN]] and faced in the direct sequel, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-last-first-day][Your Last First Day]]. In Ojai it killed everybody who knew about the operation.

  [...] That's as far through headspace as Red can search, because that's the limit of the people who know about him, it, Red. *That's the hit list.* [emphasis added]

My interpretation was that there was a human element involved in authorizing the orbital strike, and 3125 removed that link of the chain.

****** I dunno. "Red" seems to be expecting for an orbital strike to happen.

#+begin_quote
  He looks up at the ceiling, waiting, still alarmed. And he waits.

  But nothing else happens.

******* That's because there really were two entities inhabiting Red (the original mind and the SCP), but 3125 left when it went on its killing spree, leaving only the human mind.

#+begin_quote
  Red looks out through the window, giving it a curt nod, and it departs.

****** That seems weird, wouldn't an organization as paranoid as the SCP have it set up failsafe in that it would fire if a signal is not recived rather than vice versa?

**** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/discordian][Discordianism]] can be thought of as an antimemetic vaccine tailored specifically against religious dogmatism. We use tales and parables, usually crafted by lampooning common parables from other religions, as vehicles to convey cognitive dissonances and confusion. This means the SCP database is kind of a treasure trove.
