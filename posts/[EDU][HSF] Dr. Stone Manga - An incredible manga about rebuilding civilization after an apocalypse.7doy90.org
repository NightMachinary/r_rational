** TV Tropes had this quote:

#+begin_quote
  To get from Stone Age to Modern Civilization, it took humanity 2 million years. We are going to rush through it! We will recover the world! We will find out the principles of the petrification and its recovery mechanism... We, two high school kids, are going to recreate civilization from scratch!

--- Senku

That's enough for me. I'm definitely reading this.

** I highly recommend reading this manga, since it's about properly keeping to a scientific mind-set in the face of what appears to be magic and rebuilding civilization from a prehistoric world all the way to the modern day.

The main characters are a little too unbelievable to exist, but considering the difficulty of the challenges they have to handle, Senku's genius can be allowed in the face of making the story better.

*** They're almost at Kamina levels of Beyond The Impossible enthusiasm, and it really works.

** The first chapter has me giggling.

It also has Trump thinking it's a terrorist attack. LMAO.

** Took one glance at the cover and went "Wait, did Boichi draw this?"

Yes, yes he did. I think I'll give it a whirl - just curious though, most of Boichi's stuff has fan service (if not straight-up hentai)... is that the case here too?

*** There's definitely fanservice, but it's not particularly egregious. The cover art is about as explicit as it gets.

**** I'm a few chapters in and it seems you're right. Kinda makes sense - the cover was for Shonen Jump, which likely wouldn't publish more explicit content.

Not that fan service or sex scenes ruin a work by any means; I just know that it can turn some readers away.

*** for a manga it's rather tame. I might even say there's more male fanservice than female.

** Ffs, Senkuu thinks there's such a thing as a Bronze ion. Bronze is an alloy. It doesn't contain bronze molecules or anything like that. He also wants to create gunpowder when he has no use for it yet because he doesn't have even half the stuff needed to work metal.

Edit: Also, Taiji is shown multiple times as having lost his legs/arms while petrified. Wtf?

*** Gunpowder can be used as a weapon just fine without metal. Stick it in a coconut; make a fuse; now you've got a grenade.

Taiji was placed face-down into a pile of leaves or loose soil, I think. His arms are there; they're just buried into whatever the “ground” in the shot is.

** This manga is great. I came for the male fanservice and stayed for the science wanking.

** I read everything they've made. How do I keep reading it? Is there a way to have them email me when it updates? There's an RSS feed, but it seems to be for all their manga, and since I don't read all their manga that's not what I need.

Edit: It looks like [[https://www.mangatown.com/manga/dr_stone/][mangatown]] lets me subscribe.

*** A bit late here but the chrome extension "mangareader" is the best for keeping up with manga.
