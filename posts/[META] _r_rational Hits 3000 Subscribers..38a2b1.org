** Woot!

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ryed3/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/][This]] was one of the subreddit's first ever submissions, posted by [[/u/seraphnb]] on December 3rd, 2013. I don't actually have the statistics on when we hit 1000 subscribers, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2rcbbz/meta_rrational_hits_2000_subscribers/][we hit 2000 on January 4th of this year]], which the reddit dating algorithm is still calling "4 months ago" (per OP) but is really much closer to 5.

So, we went from 0 to 2000 in thirteen months, and we've gone from 2000 to 3000 in five months. I'm guessing this increase was definitely attributable to the Grand Finale of /Methods of Rationality/, considering that's the subreddit that spawned this one, so of course there would be a trickle-down effect.

The next 1000 will undoubtedly come much more slowly, but, if we manage to keep up the steady rate of submissions and quality discussion we've enjoyed over the last year and a half, I'm sure it will be all in good time. Not that it matters or anything ...

Here's to another happy 18 months!

** Neat.

Just a reminder to be the change that you want to see in the subreddit; the internet runs on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29][1% rule]], and you can heavily influence the direction of this sub by being part of that 1% of content creators or 10% of commentators. The average submission to this sub gets around 15 upvotes; that's not uncommon for a sub this size, but it means that a single person can have a huge impact.

*** This. Even if I don't particularly enjoy a piece of fiction (which isn't often here), I'll upvote and/or comment to give the author some encouragement.

Who knows? A little push and anyone here could make the next Harry Potter.

****** I was thinking more along the lines of Target/Walmart. Convenience stores here are about as convenient as a root canal before your solo on Broadway. Not to mention the incredible lack of quality for the prices.

In a similar vein, if I want to buy a book, I have to go to the צומת ספרים at the mall and pay 45₪. I miss Amazon Prime.

Also, I'm not בנימין, sorry. But hi anyway. טוב לפגוש אותך.

You made aliyah into the army? Typical, but not entirely smart.

******** I actually made Aliyah upon finishing highschool, almost two years before I started my service. Regardless, I absolutely should have waited until I would get all the benefits personally, as opposed to contributing as a minor to the family benefits.

I was unaware they existed. The only meetups I've been going to in Tel Aviv are Smash Bros. meetups.

********* It's not the benefits I'm concerned with. It's that most olim who do the army as their first or only thing in Israel end up unacquainted or un-acculturated to civilian life, and end up becoming the bitter, unhappy kind of yordim.

************ I'd /like/ to go into linguistics, but then my only options regarding jobs will be 1) Teaching, 2) Research, 3) Computational Linguistics. I'm extremely interested in neurolinguistics, but that's probably better approached from the neurology side. If I could have my dream job, I'd write fiction for a living, and maybe teach creative writing in a college setting - but going for a degree in Creative Writing, while technically possible, is not really the best use of my time or money.
