  “Because it won't work,” said Grace.  “In the event of an emergency, all perimeter guards are to stay at their posts, and increase their vigilance.  And the wires on the electric fence are connected to an alarm system.  If they get cut or the circuit gets broken, it sends off an alarm.  You wouldn't make it a mile.”
#+end_quote

Wow. The functional security system just makes the death camps seem even bleaker.

#+begin_quote
  It had taken two more years to escape the camp.
#+end_quote

Well fuck.

#+begin_quote
  The most remarkable thing in the whole building, of course, was the bearded man in front of her, wearing a bathrobe, bare feet resting on the smooth wooden desk, sipping tea and reading a book.  A gramophone played a smooth piano song, and he nodded along with the rhythm.

  “If we solved one problem for them, they'd expect us to fix everything,” Tau said.  “And do not imagine they'd be grateful for your help.  The thoughts of a Humdrum are close-minded and stubborn and prideful all at once.  If they found out people like you existed, many would try to burn you at the stake.  They'd try to burn all of us.”
#+end_quote

I had noticed the parallels before, but this chapter in particular is seriously /Harry Potter/. With extermination camps.

(which makes me wonder if Tau is doing the "pretending to be senile" gambit)

#+begin_quote
  “These include directions on how to travel through the mountains to the Principality's lines!  Do not linger!”

    “You went mad.  You burned every Humdrum in sight, soldiers and civilians.  You created mountains of ashes.  They're calling you ‘The Pyre Witch' now.”
#+end_quote

I kind of get the feeling that the Principality straight up exterminated them to sell the lie.

#+begin_quote
  Even in the middle of a war, Paragon could spare three whole top-ranked squads to hunt down one of their own. 
#+end_quote

Here we see that Tau's rhetoric about his hands being tied was bullshit. Suddenly, when their personal power is threatened, they can find troops to spare.

#+begin_quote
  “About Buttercup Lodge,” said Grace.  “And Egress.”
#+end_quote

Anyone get what that part means?

#+begin_quote
  ‘Ernest Chapman', a Grey Coat assistant at Paragon Academy, is an imposter, a girl with the mask of a boy.  Her real name is Anabelle Gage, a three-time failed applicant who attempted a body theft from cargo ship 9187, crate serial 541256h, attacking and nearly killing two students in the process.
#+end_quote

Nooooooooooo.

(still a little surprised that Tunnel Vision has that level of info on her, yet Ana is still alive)

Well, I guess they could always break into a body store and steal a new body, and skip the "money" part. I mean, I know this world is pretty cyberpunk, but there's no way corporate warehouses will have more security than the headquarters of a major terrorist organization, right?

The Tau senility thing reads as a thing about which /something/ will be revealed, for sure. My running theory is that the Spirit Block is an active effect he is constantly maintaining.

My in-universe answer is that since Paragon Academy is so uptight about security, they'll probably need proper documentation when a student changes bodies, so Ana can't just steal a new one - she needs the paper trail and verification that a legitimate purchase provides.

**** Oh, no, that ship has definitely sailed. Ana is never going to Paragon (as a student) ever again.

I meant stealing a body to address the "only has a few weeks to live" problem. She's still going to be on the run for a while (that is, for the rest of her life / until the civil war breaks out / until the sea rises and everyone drowns).

***** Oh yeah, true. I thought you were talking about before when she was still a student , not gonna lie.

It'll be interesting to see where Ana goes from here, though. Paragon is looking less and less appealing (from the reader's perspective, at least). Maybe one of the countries we haven't seen yet?

I assumed this was some Jeffrey-Epstein-island shit, a secret place that a 1%er can take part in extremely immoral fantasies (given the setting, I can only imagine what kind of weird stuff was going on there).

**** Egress is probably a top secret Epistocrat spaceship plan. I recall in a previous chapter that it was mentioned that the world had around 6 years left before there was literally zero land left due to the sea level rise. Humans might be shit at long term planning but there is no way people with the kind of money and power these guys have wouldn't have some plan.

** Grace is, much like the rest of her former squad, sort of a pitiable wretch of a person at this point. She's sacrificed all of her memories, all of her relationships, all of her /humanity/ in pursuit of her goals.

Unlike the rest of her former squad, I find her goals largely admirable and I think her success would, on balance, make the world a better place. Don't get me wrong, she's done some nasty shit and she's /incapable/ of feeling regret at this point, but she's really the only character we've seen who truly recognizes the injustice and inequality that is at the core of this society and is willing to sacrifice her own well-being to fight against it. She's willing to sacrifice the well-being of /others/ as well, which is no bueno, but at the end of the day I'd much rather live in a world where Grace achieves her goals than live in a world where our "heroes" stop her.

Edit: HOLY SHIT THAT'S WHY HER NAME IS TUNNELVISION

** On Akhara's Gate:

Akhara is mentioned in [[https://pithserial.com/2019/11/25/3-c-the-empty-book/][3-C]]:

#+begin_quote
  Rana the Monk. Akhara the Polymath. Tegudar the General. And, of course, Darius the Philosopher. The Four Eternals. The most famous of the Great Scholars, the ideological foundations of the world's nation-states.
#+end_quote

I don't think that it's clear which nation Akhara is associated with.

One side of the gate is anchored inside Grace's submarine while the other contains what is clearly a metaphorical representation of her pith (shaped by the redemption camp and constant modifications carried out by her Vocation). Which it makes physical. Which then Grace made into her office. (Which is pretty metal.)

Akhara's Gate might be a vocation or it might be an artifact.

** Were there any hints who the real boss of Commonplace might be? Has she appeared before under another name?

She forbade the Nudge terrorism attacks Grace got up to.

#+begin_quote
  “She said we were abusing the people we were trying to protect. And she gets final say.”
#+end_quote

Maybe Grace just follows her, because she believes in the boss' vision?

We have apparently seen her in [[https://pithserial.com/2020/07/14/7-c-the-blue-charlatan/][7-C]]:

#+begin_quote
  A hooded figure stood next to Tunnel Vision, wearing a faded green military long coat, the kind you'd see in photos of the Shenti War, or older.

  One of her thumbs had been cut off at the first knuckle.

  On the podium, the hooded woman turned towards the storm of projectiles, impassive, not even trying to run or dodge.
#+end_quote

Then Grace protects her throughout the fight. Ana does not see the boss contributing.

If that's really her, she has a maimed body that she keeps. Why? Is she a Joiner, unable to leave or does she just keep it for sentimental value?

It seems to me that she is probably a prisoner Grace freed during her campaign through Shenten. Probably not even a projector. Have we seen anything that contradicts this?

Jun said awhile back that he met her briefly, and while he doesn't know her name he suspects that she's a Humdrum, and that she's someone high up in the government (if not the Prime Minister).

*** Grace is only half-Shenti ("round eye") and Florence is not Shenti at all and missing both hands. It would be hard to find a look-alike for either at the camp.

I had been expecting for Grace to find an untrained projector among the prisoners, but that quite clearly did not happen.
