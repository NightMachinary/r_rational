** See also the [[https://from-ai-to-zombies.eu/][other podcast]] that was independently transcribing everything into audio. It isn't done, but I have grown rather fond of the narrators' voice.

*** I thought this was what OP was talking about. Apparently there's more than one group making a free audio version.

** I just got the audiobook from audible and I have to ask why the audio sample is so shitty, I almost didn't buy it because when I clicked on the button I was assaulted by crackling grainy white noise to the point that it was unlistenable. The actual audiobook is fine though.

*** That's what kept me from getting the audiobook myself. So you say the actual quality is fine? Hm...

**** The actual quality is fine, everything is enunciated clearly and easily understandable even at double-speed. It's kinda annoying how the speaker says titles in the same breath as everything else and there is a little bit of breathing but it's not a big deal.
