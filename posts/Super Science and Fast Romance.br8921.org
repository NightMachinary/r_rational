As in the title, I've found this great rational fic. Especially in the sense of exploring topics of trans-humanism, AGI, and building/pursuing plot from the rational outcome of sci-fi inventions.

warning: quite NSFW, lots of mentions of drug use as well (though I think it is legal in the setting, meh).


** This is great!

It's NSFW, but not particularly explicit. Generally the NSFW parts boil down to "then they had sex" (or "then they wanted to have sex over the Internet, so here's a detailed explanation of the technology that could go in to making that work. Then they had sex over the internet").

Aside from that there's some excellent sci-fi weird dystopia stuff going on - it makes me think of /Accelerando/ crossed with /The Diamond Age/, on an acid trip in a strip club.

Edit: I think this quote perfectly sums up the book.

  “That's stupid and amazing.” He says. “We've actually found some interstellar asteroids with space DNA. We'll send them over if you let us party with the aliens too.”

** I liked it; it has a manic, freewheeling quality. I really like the absurd positive existentialism; everything's terrible, nothing means anything; let's make things better is very attractive. That said, the writing is a bit hard to follow because the characters don't really have distinct voices.

** I'm sorry: I got about four chapters in and had to give up. The voice it's written in just gets on my nerves.

Being in present-tense is part of it, but the bigger problem is that it's written very conversationally. This is strictly a matter of taste, but, to me, it makes it not feel professionally written.

*** I think that's what drew me. That it reminded me of HPMOR: part Socratic dialogue, part mad science brainstorm. (If you've read the Girl Genius webcomic, it too has a conversational style to it, with this mad-bent momentum that builds to super-transhumanism.)

This conversational style is not the polished experience we expect of classic [Hugo & Nebula] Sci-did, but it provides us the immersion of someone ratchet deep in the mental machinery of breaking humanity through the transhumanism, AGI, and post-scarcity boundaries.

I do enjoy Girl Genius. But the thing is, a comic is pictures and dialogue. So, when a webcomic is conversational in style, what has a conversational style /is its dialogue/.

A written work's dialogue can be just as conversational as a webcomic's, and so the SSaFR dialogue is fine. It's everything /else/ that feels off. It's the conversational /narration/ that's irking me.

***** Ok, I can see that. I suppose I don't remember if that changed further in, but this story is definitely of the “show, don't tell” school, and all the showing is done in dialogue and stream of consciousness.
