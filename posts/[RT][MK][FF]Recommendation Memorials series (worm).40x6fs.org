I'm somewhat of a lurker, which means I don't have a rapport with anyone here. So, I'll preface my recommendation by mentioning this prior [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/23l0qj/cenotaph_worm_fan_fiction/][link]] and directing you to Eliezer Yudkowsky, who stated [[http://hpmor.com/2014/04/]["Cenotaph is the most original-flavor thing I can ever remember reading"]], high praise indeed!

Memorials -- if you haven't gathered by now -- is Worm fanfiction, which means it contains: superheros, supervillains, /murder hobos/ and terrified civilians. I would not recommend Memorials to anyone who disliked Worm, on account of its dark tone. Not to say Memorials is dark all the time, just that it's set in a universe containing /Jack Slash/.

Disclaimers out of the way, I'll just outright say that Memorials is -- in my own opinion -- better than the source material.

Unfortunately I cannot go into the story without spoiling said material. But I will say, Accord is in it and he is acting rationally -- while being true to the character to boot.

On the topic of Memorials characters, they're extremely well thought out. Every one of them is rationally furthering their agenda. It's actually somewhat sad, Worm's characters almost feel like a caricatures of themselves, on reflection.

All of this adds together to produce a world, which is so internally consistent, as to be almost as realistic as our own. In other words, it's one of the most rational pieces of fiction I've ever seen.

If you'd like to give it a shot there are three /books/ in the series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442][Cenotaph]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2417525/chapters/5347754][Wake]], and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legacy-worm.345448/][Legacy]] (in progress).

*TLDR*: This guy likes it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/23l0qj/cenotaph_worm_fan_fiction/][link]], Eliezer [[http://hpmor.com/2014/04/][enjoys it]], and I love it. It's rational, go read it.


** Ironically, I feel like Worm fanfiction where there are 'rational' characters somewhat misses the point.

*** You can't expect characters in Worm to act truly rationally due to their outside influence. It's like saying you can write rational characters on LSD.

Unlike the LSD case, the shards have an agenda and they influence their hosts, who have their own agenda. You can extrapolate to their combined actions, to some degree.

I'd argue that the original work is a Rational fiction already. There's less arbitrary stupidity than there is in HPMOR (magical Britain in general outside of the main characters).

***** Oh, I see. I thought you were saying that if the characters were acting rationally it would invalidate the central conceits of the story.

*** I think you're missing the definition of rational. Acting rationally means you're advancing your own agenda, it doesn't mean you're acting optimally. The characters still hold individual beliefs which are themselves irrational (the existence of E88 is proof of that).

**** No, I know what rational meant. I was referring to the idea of shards and personal trauma being a major canon reason why many Worm characters don't and can't act to further their agenda. It's a pretty major plot point.

***** Given that the influence of shards over parahumans, is not widely known, it seems likely that the effect is minor. It accounts for a personality tone shift, not a massive alteration of everything you are.

Furthermore, the shards act towards creating the most conflict. Memorials does not remove conflict, rather the opposite. Even acting rationally does not remove conflict. If you're goals are in direct opposition to anothers, then the best course of action is conflict.

** I read Worm a bit selectively - never liked things with that level of grimdark - so I have two questions: do I need to read full Worm to read Memorial and is Memorial as grimdark as Worm?

*** I suspect that you can read Memorials prior to Worm, though you'll probably miss a few of the details. Give it a shot, you don't stand to lose anything 'sides a little time.

Memorials isn't quite as grimdark as Worm itself, but conflict and loss are some of the main themes. It depends on what you consider grimdark -- if you're put off by Worm's body horror, then Memorials has much less of that (Bonesaw doesn't make much of a appearance); but if you dislike the general theme of the Worm-verse then I doubt you'll like Memorials.

All that being said, Memorials doesn't have nearly the same defeatist attitude Worm does. Our main character is a hero, so there's more of a positive outlook on the world.

**** Thanks for advise.

What I consider grimdark the most is a feeling of despair. Despair of seeng a new Endbringer form just after you defeat one. Despair of Tyranid hive fleet casting shadow on your world. Despair of being chained up for a crime you did not commit.

P.S. Body horrors are wonderful things actually)
