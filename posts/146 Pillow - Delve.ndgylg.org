** Does anyone else think it's odd that he wants to evacuate the village before further farming the crack? The logic that it's all in the middle of nowhere would seem to suggest the villagers are in little danger anyway, and if they leave the crack it'd be easy for it to get claimed by some other group or something.

It feels more like a narrative choice to prevent powerleveling with a buffed Rain than anything else.

*** I think main danger to villagers are random spawns in shadows. People are dying at rate mayor says acceptable for winter. But after winter they won't stop dying, and getting wood for fires will get harder over time.

*** the city has to evacuate due to the rank shift, it's not a choice. Ascension can protect them while they're in town but the moment they leave the town will die whether or not the people are there.

** It hasn't happened even in the Patreon chapters (or ever), but I think Rain will use Dozer's thoughts on what counts as *[Filth]* to use *[Purify]* on things he couldn't before. I place my bets on it happening on around chapter 180.

**** Heh, didn't realize it would be December, not that I think that anyone would remember anyways. I was actually guessing the chapter when they'd go deep enough in the depths that even Tallheart would face danger (intentionally or not). That, or when they leave and maybe face something strong. Maybe a DKE member.

*** Yeah he can already do things with system integration that Goldplates find hard, when he tops over in Silver and gets the massive boost to effective stats that would provide I imagine he'll gain a frankly ridiculous amount of utility and specific control over how his Skills are applied.

**** [Purify] can remove [Filth] from within a unaware/ unwilling target. ie: removing alcohol from a person who wants to remain dunk.

[Purify] can remove rust, so it can remove oxidized iron.

[Purify] (maybe) can remove the hemoglobin from a persons blood.

***** Unfortunately Purify also targets Rain so he'll probably want to go for something other than Blood.

Might be worth figuring out if he can +delude+ convince himself into believing non-Rain mana is poison. Instant cripple/debuff field.
