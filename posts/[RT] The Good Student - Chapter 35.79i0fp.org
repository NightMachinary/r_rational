  Pencil. What do you see? You see a pencil, correct?
#+end_quote

Not if I have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia][aphantasia]].

#+begin_quote
  [Nic] was trying to portray himself as the hero, acting out of noble purpose. It was hardly that. In truth, he wanted [Dizzy] to know he was saving her, to sob over his grave, knowing he had sacrificed himself for her.
#+end_quote

Hmm, that definitely reminds me of [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-19][something]]...

#+begin_quote
  The door banged against the wall as it was flung open and Nic ran in. [Simole] had called him and he'd come, not knowing what he'd find, what danger he'd face. Foolish boy.

  He didn't see her or the doorway. She could make herself known to him, but there was something about his despair at finding her limp, lifeless body that she found perversely pleasing.
#+end_quote

Damnation. If the latter segment was from Dizzy's PoV, it would have made Dizzy x Nic romance so much more morbidly fascinating. As it is, it doesn't give much ground even for joking about either Dizzy or Simole and Nic deserving each other.

** Excellent chapter, one of my favorites so far! I really cannot get enough of the top-notch banter. I know I am repeating myself from my last comment, but as intriguing as the plot promises to be, I'd love this story even if it were just 100% comprised of ordinary school life and constant witty banter. The characters really do have a life of their own. I wonder, does Mooderino just effortlessly come up with these amazing dialogues or is there a lot of hard work behind them?

  Why were the Ministries more effective than a democratic system of government, like that of many of Ranvar's neighbours?
#+end_quote

Seems like this should be part of their normal civics course. For a Ranvarian, it would be the opposite question which is thought-provoking.

*** Yes, actually I think you're right. I meant to imply they would discuss the other side of it, but didn't get the wording quite right. Perhaps a slight shift in emphasis is needed. Thanks for the heads up.

It was big and black, not dissimilar the one in Nic's pocket.
