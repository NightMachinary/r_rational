** I'm glad someone thought this was worth posting, but personally I'm not very happy with it.

One of my long-term projects is trying to figure out how to do infodumps in a way that isn't boring. One technique writers who are better than me use is putting the infodump into dialogue, and dribbling out the info like the answers to a mystery. If there's also fun dialogue stuff happening, you can spend a surprising amount of time doing worldbuilding without people feeling bored.

This short story is basically me practicing that technique, but I think it suffers from two failures.

1. The interaction is kind of boring, because it's fundamentally a delivery mechanism for the information rather than an interaction I thought would be fun to write.

2. I think I tried so hard to dribble out the information in a way that made the reader curious, that I made it too difficult to figure out what the fuck the information actually /was/.

*** just an idle thought, but this comment made me draw a link between this story and "Two Games", both of which have something of a POV from a demon (assuming that's what's going on here). I thought in the other story, this made for an effective stinger---but here, where that voice is used throughout, I found it less effective

in "Two Games", I read a deliberate ambiguity over whether Ellie would actually get caught by the trap eventually---but it felt like the point (the reason why it needed to be from the demon's POV) was to show that the demon's doing a long-term gambit that has presumably paid off countless times on countless Ellies in the past, to reveal the full extent of the farce. A different (lesser?) ending might have been to stay entirely in Ellie's head: after her plan works, you see unease over how easy it was, before skipping ahead to a future Ellie (faced with an economic problem) who sure seems sorely tempted to try it again with larger stakes...

similarly, a different version of "Storybook Tower" might stay in the King's head (or, perhaps, a different audience surrogate)---thus, playing directly /into/ the reader's desire to learn more about what's going on, and pulling the rug out from under their feet as they come to independently realise that the protagonist they're reading about is also just playing out a story. As is, the audience is deliberately alienated from the King, which I think is a missed opportunity to personally invest the reader in the implications of the introdump...? So I think the conceit here's strong, but there's a good case to be made that the POV is what scuppers it a little

**** It's an interesting point! I probably don't spend enough time thinking about what sort of mindset different POVs put people into.

** Maybe I'm just too tired and I should re-read in the morning, but... could someone explain what's going on?

*** Demon summoning used to be happening in the wild; now they have it more "contained". I agree this was much weaker than the other story posted though.

** Not mine, but another story from the same author was posted here recently.\\
I've rss-subscribed to his site, looking forward to whatever else he brings out.

** So it's like a fantasy version of Cabin in the Woods?
