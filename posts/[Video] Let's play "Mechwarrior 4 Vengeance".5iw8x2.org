** Excellent series overall. The creator does an excellent job of building a new narrative distinct from the original, and the characters have a lot of chemistry together. If you're a fan of riffing on games for inconsistencies and irrational actors, you'd probably enjoy watching this.

** Yeah, this series is great. It's fun to watch if you haven't played the game, but even better if you have. It's its ownself-contained intelligent story, but at the same time inspired by/parodying the original.

** I appreciate the social commentary later on. The setting is a feudalistic-captitalist dystopia, and they make good use of it to perform social commentary.

Episode 4 is when it really starts being acceptable.

** Is there any more stuff like this? Games where the narrative is exchanged for a funny yet consistent alternative I mean.

*** Abridged series. The absolute funniest of which is probably Sword Art Online Abridged, which turns the main character from a one-dimensional heroic archetype to an unloveable but hilarious total asshole who experiences such wonders as character development.

**** Pfffff no, the best abridged series is Helsing Ultimate abridged. Which is more or less the same but with Nazis instead of character development.

***** Okay. I will concede. Helsing Ultimate Abridged is /funnier/, but Sword Art Online Abridged is /better/, with more emotional range and story salvaged from some frankly pretty bland source material.

*** Not that I can recommend. If you're interesting in /finding/ some, you might try going through the tvtropes page on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAbridgedSeries][abridged series]].
