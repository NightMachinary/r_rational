PB's a hard fantasy serial that's been running for a bit more than a year now. If you want to start at the beginning--it's a grim yarn about power politics in a terrible world that superficially resembles Sumer or Babylon--[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][click on this]]. Thank you!


** It looks like the entire history of Ram's world is a factional proxy war between two groups of Bazuu. I can't think of any other group of beings that would know how or want to set up that situation.

*** I dunno. Think it sounds like maybe ancient man stole fire from the Bazuu, resulting in the world we see.

(Tangent: Perhaps AncientMan ascended to become Haranduluz and it's his values now represented by the haranu, or perhaps it's something else. )

**** Do bear in mind that you're getting a very garbled and incomplete picture here, from a bazu perspective. Imbri isn't Tattletale from Worm, after all.
