** The paper says that after a change in the timeline is made, a vague process labelled "w" occurs that changes it back. There is no indication of how or why that would happen though. It just says "if time is consistent and everyone at any time has free will, then if it wasn't consistent, something would happen to make it consistent." Nowhere does it disprove the many worlds version of time travel, as w would be unnecessary if you were now in a new universe.

*** I've seen the argument that the "many world" version of time travel is simply doesn't count as time travel as there it's impossible to travel to /your/ past - you always end up in another timeline that is independent.

**** IMHO it's more like you can travel to your /past/, but cannot change your /present/future/ - that is, the split of timelines happens at the moment you "arrive" to the past, which becomes the divergence point. And since the original timeline still exists (sans you), you could argue it is not "true" time travel.

** First off: This is a terrible paper to use as a basis for generalizations about CTCs. It talks about very specific dynamic processes that aren't really applicable to most circumstances. Maybe start with something by [[https://www.its.caltech.edu/%7Ekip/index.html/PubScans/II-121.pdf][Kip Thorne]] if you want something technical. Or just the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve][wikipedia article on CTCs]].

Second: Yes, CTCs are solutions to general relativity equations that allow for time travel--specifically of the "you can't change the past" variety. That isn't to say, necessarily, that the past cannot be changed (ie, that you can't create multiple timelines). It means that you can't change the past with a CTC. CTCs take you to the past of the current timeline, where you cannot change things.

The Many-Worlds Interpretation is a completely different phenomena (and not at all related to time travel or coin flips or the like, but that's a different topic).

Doesn't MWI have consequences for relativity-compatible time travel such as wormholes?

If you take two entangled particles, one up & one down, and take them a lightyear apart, and measure which you have it'll reveal you're in the world where the other particle is the opposite. But that information of which world you're in can only propagate at lightspeed, so if you step through you're wormhole to the other particle a lightyear away then the world on the otherside is still indeterminate and you could step into the other world where the particles have resolved the other way round when measured.

In fact, since natural entanglement happen all the time, wouldn't all wormholes lead to other worlds in the MWI sense?

**** This is an interesting idea. It's not what people generally mean when they talk about using MWI with time travel; usually they mean that the timeline branches when someone uses time travel to change the past. They conflate quantum mechanical interactions that cause branching with things like decisions or coin tosses.

 

The situation you've described is actually the EPR paradox, but you missed the key component. The thing about the EPR paradox is that quantum mechanical interactions are very explicitly /not/ bound by the luminal speed limit of relativity. As soon as you measure one box, the other one is instantly determined, no matter how far apart they are. According to MWI, the whole universe branches when the first particle is measured.

 

I think you're overcomplicating the problem by adding entanglement and the EPR paradox in. Any simple binary quantum phenomena would work for this idea, but I'll stick with "up" and "down" (we could also go with the old Schr√∂dinger's Cat "Alive"/"Dead"). Basically, the idea is to take an isolated indeterminate particle back in time through a CTC/wormhole, /then/ measure it in the past, thus branching the timeline. That means, when it's time to put the particle in the CTC, you have two possible contradictory pasts with equal likelihood: in one universe it exited with an up spin, in the other with a down spin. What if you check the result before sending the particle in? Could you decide whether or not to send it based on its measurement?

 

There are a few possible resolutions to this paradox:

1. Single-Timeline. Since the CTCs do not allow for changes to the past, the behavior of the particle is deterministic. In this case, the particle will always have the same spin. There's no way to change the past. This bypasses the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics in the same way that a CTC bypasses our notions of causality.

2. Chross-compatibility. Measuring the particle in the past branches the universe. However, since CTCs form in a continuous spacetime, the particle must have been sent back in time in /both/ resulting timelines. (For this interpretation, imagine you're in the past and watching the particle in the CTC as it comes from the future. If you follow it from past to future, you will eventually see someone place the particle in the CTC. If this weren't the case, it would mean that it simply blinked out of existence at the point of branching).

3. Legitimate branching. We decide if the particle reads "up", we'll send it back in time, and if it reads "down", we won't. In one universe, it reads "down", which means it /was/ sent back in time by one universe (in that universe, it read "up"). This solution would mean that the quantum mechanical ability to split timelines is stronger than relativity's ability to maintain them.

 

It's all conjecture, but if I had to guess, I'd put the solution as #2, but in such a way that it would look like #1. As in, technically, MWI would branch the timeline, but the CTC would keep it intact enough that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Like maybe we fumble the particle when it exists, or we don't record it. I attribute this to needing to change our conception of "causality" when we start using CTCs.

 

This isn't a trivial problem. Most models of CTCs require a lot of negative energy or quantum interactions. A lot of scientific conjecture nowadays is whether or not reconciling quantum mechanics with gravity is going to show that CTCs can't exist at all.

Isn't one of the strengths of MWI that it obeys the principle of locality, which is to say it obeys the speed of light limit? How can you be superluminal and not non-local?

I thought the whole universe, entailed the whole "observable" universe (parts of the universe can observe the event rather than reverse to whatever extent those aren't equivalent) which propagates out from the event at the speed of light (+inflation effects at scale).

Having the whole infinite universe determined instantly after a quantum event resolves begs an absolute framework for location.\\
As per general relativity the rest of the universe only has a place and a time relative to other events.\\
This can't be established until observation occurs.

The way I've always conceptualised MWI, is one infinite repeating universe where every place is just one of an infinite number of places with the same set of identical events.\\
And as per relativity your location is only determinate down to being in one of these places with identical events, because your location in space & time is defined relative to those events you observe.\\
Similar to how quantum location is constrained by observation.\\
In the case of a quantum event, observe the outcome just resolves whether you're in the infinite set of location that resolves up or down, and until that event observation propagates to you, your location is undetermined between the two sets.

Isn't that how the criticism of MWI creating worlds from nothing is resolved? MWI doesn't creates worlds during a branch, it's just the existing set of infinite worlds diverges into two sets of infinite worlds.

Huh. I'd never done much research into MWI to see changes propagate at light speed. It still seems like you can't use wormholes to circumvent EPR though, because the wormhole itself shortens the distance between the two particles. Since the whole idea of a wormhole in this example is that it's traversable, that would mean that it should allow passage of the light cone from each entangled particle. You'd just end up with a wormhole connected 2 points in one universe and a wormhole connecting 2 points in another universe.

Yeah, I was kind of hoping you'd gloss that part because simultaneity is a bit of a nuisance in quantum.

This one I actually have read about. The idea is that new branches aren't created from nothing, it's all just part of the larger Universal wavefunction. To drastically oversimplify it, basically the multiverse has x amount of energy, which gets divided amongst all the branching universe based on the overall "probability" of that universe forming.

** The paper proves that it's possible to time travel using CTCs without causing a Grand Farther Paradox.

It also proves that you'll be able to have freedom of choice in two scenarios as long as all other scenarios are kept consistent, i.e.. you can only have two scenarios that can be influenced by what happens in the other scenarios.

It seems to more have the "you can't change the past" as a parameter and a process called W will happen to bring the past in line with the expected future.

As for the many-worlds interpretation this has little to no influence. It only talks about time travel within the same timeline. Nothing is mentioned when changing between different timelines.

*** You might be wondering why you are downvoted.

You are a physical object, part of a wave function deterministic both forward and backward in time. There is nothing "free" about it. (And time travel changes nothing about that.)

You can still choose to do or not to do things, of course. If you feel like this is a contradiction, you might want to look at: [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Free_will]]
