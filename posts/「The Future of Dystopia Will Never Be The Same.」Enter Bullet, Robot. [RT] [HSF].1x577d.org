** I'm reading the prologue right now, and there's something that really bugs me...

Is there a reason why in this world, Go is played on a 17x17 grid (instead of 19x19), with white starting first (instead of black) and with the stones being put on the squares (instead of the intersections) ? At first I thought the 17x17, white starting first part was a dig at older (15th century) customs (although the 17x17 part would still be dubious), but the squares thing still doesn't fit.

*** You have sharp eyes, Jinoc. Thanks for your note.

The weird part is that I was actually playing rounds of Go against myself while writing that chapter.

Refresh the page in your browser and you should see the changes.

P.S. The game also appears in later chapters. Be sure to watch for it.
