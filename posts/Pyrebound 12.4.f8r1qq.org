With apologies for being a day late--a lot of obligations piled up this weekend, and I don't have a backlog anymore.

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/02/24/chapter-12-4/]]

Pyrebound follows the adventures of Rammash im-Belemel as he struggles to make his horribly grim world less horrible and grim. The first chapter starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. Thanks for reading!


** I discovered this the last time a chapter update was posted, and I'm glad I started reading.

** Well... somehow this keeps getting downhill.

I'm really not seeing any outcome for this where our protagonist and his companions don't end in a shallow, shallow grave before the year is over. They really don't seem to have any kind of plan in mind.

*** I'm not aiming to make it easy for them. But I do have an end in mind.
