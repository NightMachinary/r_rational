Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Many of you have no doubt encountered the [razor floss trope]([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss?from=Main.RazorWire]]) at some point or another, as have I, and I've been wondering what it would take to make it work with something that isn't necessarily sharp. More accurately, I've been thinking of a character similar to Skitter but in a world where magic exists so they can arbitrarily enhance the strength of spider webs and maybe even shrink them with heat. One of the only things I can think of in regards to making traps, aside from the obvious clothes line, is some sort of loop knot anchored to something sturdy on one end of the thread and the other end attached to a counterweight that's draped over something that the counterweight can fall from. The problem is, without a pretty heavy counter weight, I don't know how to get an adequate amount of constricting force without the need for a motor like in this scene from [The Counselor ]([[https://youtu.be/3lBNXvIna2U?t=71]])(warning: movie spoilers). I guess my question is what sort of traps could be made with such materials and abilities?

On a separate note, I've been trying to rationalize how a technique like Tsukuyomi from Naruto would actually work since I think the ability has some fun applications. So, as far as I can tell, sharingan users can increase the speed at which their brain processes visual (maybe all) information leading to their perception of time slowing down (they see in slow-mo). How it does this is one question, but I think the real problem here is that Tsukuyomi slows someone else's perception of time such that they experience 72 hours worth of consciousness compressed down into a second. But how? This time compression ability is supposed to be unique to sharingan users (or those that implant it, but that's another problem entirely) but they're basically giving someone else this ability by some unknown means. Is there any way to explain a technique like Tsukuyomi without said explanation opening the door for a flood of other broken abilities? Like maybe the magic/chakra of sharingan users allows for a faster mode of communication for neurons than electrical and chemical signals, and they can implant their magic into someone else to grant them similar abilities?

Maybe the magic/chakra of sharingan users accelerates them to near-lightspeed so that their neurons work at normal speed, /in the reference frame of their body./ Then giving the magic to someone else has the same effect.
