Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I've watched [[https://rifters.com/real/progress.htm][/Vampire Domestication: Taming Yesterday's Nightmares for a Better Tomorrow/]], and I'm in love with FizerPharm from it. An unethical mad science organization that wears its lack of ethics on its sleeve, and seems to be /proud/ of it. An organization which decides to resurrect superintelligent super-predators after boatloads of human experimentation, plainly tells that to people, and makes it sound like a good idea. And these beautiful taglines!

  - /Success no matter what you call it./\\

Are there any pieces of media with something similar? Aperture Science from /Portal/ sort-of fits.

Preferably with the protagonist firmly on the organization's side.

*** Sounds like you would really enjoy "Better Off Ted"

[[https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1235547/]]

The main character is Ted, a middle manager at an evil/crazy science corporation. He has a cold and ruthless corporate boss and is in charge of two genius but naive scientists. A lot of the humor centers around the scientists inventing things just because they can then trying to figure out what to do with it, or dealing with evil requests from higher.

I haven't watched it in a while but it used to be on Netflix.

** I recently had the pleasure of reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2113260][/Shades of Grey/]] (Fforde, not James) for the second time.

The premise is that, five hundred years after the Previous were wiped out by the Something That Happened, the utopian Collective is a society organized, according to the Rules revealed in the Epiphany of Munsell, by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system][color]]. At the age of twenty, each of the Collective's inhabitants is classified according to his color-vision capability (red, blue, and yellow categories) into Ultraviolet, Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, or---if he scores below ten percent in every category---Grey*. Fraternizing between people of complementary (opposite) colors (e. g., Red and Green) is both officially forbidden and unofficially considered deviant and taboo. All inhabitants of the Collective have very limited color vision (and no night vision), and have physical and mental reactions to certain colors. Doctors (such as the protagonist's father) use swatches of color (taken from the exhaustive Long Swatch in a major office or a Short Swatch light enough for house calls) to induce reactions in their patients, and for this reason are called swatchmen. Certain shades of green are addictive (though Greens are totally immune to them).

Each inhabitant carries a merit book, in which is recorded his merit tally (showing how well he's abided by Munsell's Rules) and his color-vision scores. In addition to a Spot of the proper color, he also may be made to wear badges of pride or of ignominy on his lapel. In addition to the official count in the merit book, merits are traded between Collective members in a semiofficial fashion; a person may have low book merits but high cash merits. Full residency, which includes (/inter alia/) the right to marry, requires 1000 merits; anybody with negative merits gets sent to reÃ«ducation at Reboot, via the Night Train.

Et cetera, et cetera. It's an extremely funny book, and two sequels are planned.

*The localization is a bit inconsistent. "Gr*e*y" and "col*o*r" exist side by side...

If you're talking about Grey vs. everyone else, that's part of the plot, late in the book. Any person whose best color perception is at least 70% can be appointed Red, Blue, or Yellow Prefect of his town; in a town, these three Prefects act as a panel of judicial and executive authority. (Judgments can be audited by the next village over.) Obviously, then, there can be no Grey representation.

If you're talking about people who aren't part of the Collective and don't have the same color-based physical and mental limitations, those "Riffraff" are mentioned in passing but not actually meaningfully encountered.

The Collective is a peaceful society (apart from occasional raids by bands of nomadic Riffraff)---and, as far as anyone knows, it's the /only/ society in existence. This is post-apocalyptic, remember.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Most shades of green are fine---only a few specific ones are addictive. The only people with access to such colors are swatchmen and their assistants. Any missing swatches will be noticed and reported by the swatchman, or by National Color when it notices that a swatchman is ordering more of certain swatches than he should.

***** I'm actually talking within the part of the society that works. Why do they have a colour (I don't know why you are correcting my spelling but I'm assuming it's because you're only familiar with US English) and what are the advantage of that way of separating people compared to our societal structure? Is it just a fun idea the author had or is there solid underlying logic beneath? Does seeing specific colour correspond with particular personality traits or intelligence or something?

As for conflicts I was actually more interested in say red- vs green. Typically when you divide people the ingroup-outgroup mentality gradually increases and it seems intuitive to me that a society that specifically uses that mechanism would need goo conflict negotiation mechanics to stay coherent.

#+end_quote

In-story, the characters justify following the sometimes-confusing Word of Munsell by holding order as a virtue in itself: a Rule that at first glance seems counterproductive still should be followed, because failing to follow it probably will cause disorder further down the line. Also, the Collective produces "synthetic color" by mining the ruins of the Previous for color-bearing items, and people who can see color are necessary for telling which items are worth scavenging.

It's revealed by a semi-Riffraff late in the book that the Collective actually is just a giant experiment.

#+end_quote

The constant threat of demerits seems to be the only conflict-resolution mechanic, but it works fairly well. The Prefects (at least 70% color perception) delegate their authority to Senior Monitors (50%), who in turn delegate to Junior Monitors; all of these people can take away merits if they see an infraction of the Rules. As mentioned previously, decisions of a Prefect can be appealed to the Prefects of the next town over, and presumably decisions of a Monitor can be appealed to that Monitor's superior.

*** If you haven't read China Mieville's works, they might be of interest to you. Perdido Street Station, Kraken, and Embassytown are suffused with cosmic horror, though Mieville leans more on slow-burning surreal strangeness than on climactic violin stabs. Also, his fiction is -1000% as racist as Lovecraft's.

House of Leaves is also an easy recommendation if you like strange/thinky/spooky and aren't married to cosmic.

None of the above is rational fic, though certain of Mieville's characters, like Kraken's PoV character, are more rational than average.

*** SCP has tons of horror, varying from Cosmic, to memetic, to fridge horror, to just plain horror. Each story is written by a different author so quality may vary.

Necroscope is a good vampire/supernatural horror series.

Infected by Scott Sigler is a great psychological thriller about a mentally ill man dealing with the first stages of a silent alien invasion.

The Descent by Scott Lang, and it's sequel, start off as regular thrillers and both end on existential horror.

I found Semiosis by Sue Burke to fit well into a scifi horror category but others may argue against that. For me it is clearly fridge horror but that doesnt always qualify as horror to others.
