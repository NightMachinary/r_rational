Hi, guys! I'm assuming that people here are avid readers of online fiction, so I wanted to ask - where do you usually find new cool stories to read? (other than [[/r/rational]], obviously).

Are there any other good websites or subreddits where I can find cool stuff to read?


** In terms of published fiction, I like [[/r/printsf]] a lot. [[/r/fantasy]] is.... not exactly bad, but not as good or focused as [[/r/printsf]] in a lot of ways.

For fanfiction and other purely online stuff, I quite like [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/][Spacebattles Creative Writing forum]] and the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/user-fiction.2/][Sufficient Velocity user fiction forum]]. SB and SV tend to be taken over by fads periodically, right now we're in the middle of The Worm Fanfiction Fad which has been going on longer/stronger than most other fads ever have, so if you like Worm fanfics it's great but otherwise not so much. Previously they've had similar periods with e.g. things like Familiar of Zero. Spacebattles also has fairly good discussion forums for various types of fanfiction posted elsewhere in it's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/the-index.63/][index subforum]], which hosts among other things [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/general-recommendation-thread-13.295360/][a general recommendation thread]]. The general thread has a potpourri of recommendations, while major fandoms tend to have their own discussion threads.

If I find a fanfiction.net or AO3 author who I like, I will check their favourites lists. This is a tentative thing because many authors who write things I like have completely different tastes than me, but it can be helpful sometimes.

*** I've been checking out [[/r/printsf]] for the last couple days; they seem like they have good taste and I've already found some nice leads.

Thanks for the tip.

*** The [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/quests.29/][Quest Forum]] on Sufficient Velocity is also a fantastic source of new stories for me. If you sort by Most Replies you'll get a lot of quests that have been going for long enough that it'll keep you occupied for a good amount of time. Very few quests like that are actually finished, and some of them are dead forever, but there are a lot of ongoing ones.

  I quite like Spacebattles Creative Writing forum and the Sufficient Velocity user fiction forum.

Seconded. SB and SV tend to have an older/male-er user base than ff.net/AO3. The "older" part is most important (more experienced, competent writiers) and the "male-er" part matters if you're not really into romance.

*** The calibre fanficfare plugin is perfect for grabbing stories and compiling ebooks out of them. I use it all the time; works great. Also, we have the same strategy!

** For fanfiction I look at TV Tropes Fanfic Recs pages, and usually only check out the ones with more than one user recommending. For ebooks I subscribe to BookBub to let me know about sales and special offers for what I'm interested in, then look at the reviews on Amazon.

*** You should look for reviews and ratings on goodreads as well. It's like the IMDB of books combined with forum.

Anything over 3.8 in rating has always been a success for me :)

** For web serials, when I feel I've got room for following one more, I check what's high on [[http://topwebfiction.com/][Top Web Fiction]], read the fist few chapters and see if it's for me.

** [[/r/narutofanfiction]], [[/r/wormfanfic]] and [[/r/hpfanfiction]] are all moderately active and have various recommendation threads, plus you can ask for specific styles of story. I use [[/r/narutofanfiction]] a lot, and there's also a rec list on the wiki there, likewise for Worm. I think the HP subreddit recently started their own wiki rec list too. [[/r/fanfiction]] isn't as good a source as you might think, because most of the discussion is either about writing rather than reading stories or about fanfiction for a small enough setting that you won't have heard of it (at least, that's been my experience).

** There is a curated list of Undertale fanfiction located [[https://www.reddit.com/r/UndertaleAUs/comments/4ax1d4/heyo_want_some_fan_fiction_well_i_got_some_for_ya/][here]], though much of it is shipping focused (they are noted as such, though, so you can avoid it if you wish).
