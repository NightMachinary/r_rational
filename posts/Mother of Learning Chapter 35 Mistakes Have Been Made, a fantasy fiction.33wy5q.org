** The way I see it, the spiders were suspicious of Zorian, made some investigations of their own, discovered that the whole Cyoria web was dead, decided to do a deep search of Zorian's mind to find out his involvement, knew they weren't going to get his cooperation and so decided they'd have to play rough. The original timetable for getting back to him was two days, that it took eight days is pretty significant.

Since I only recently started reading this, and have only participated in some of the discussion on an anime forum, I'm curious about how popular certain theories are:

- Zach's guardian (Tesen Zveri) as Red Robe- Someone Zach might have turned to early in the loops who he didn't realize was untrustworthy, after somehow securing his place in the loops could have messed with Zach's soul/mind. Also has a "Z" name, and the invaders are thought to have had agents in place in the government. He also could have hid the fact if Zach was in a coma for Zorian's first 7 loops, but wouldn't have been close enough to the school to know that Zorian had spent a number of loops like that as well.

- The aranea are just kicked out of the loop, not actually dead.

- The loop is a simulation of the next month based how things were at the beginning of it, caused by the Sovereign's Gate, and no actual time travel is actually happening.

2. Obvious, since no spell to kill a soul exists.

3. Very interesting hypothesis. I wonder if the simulation would take more energy/magic to sustain than a real time loop. Would be definitely something to keep in mind while reading.

**** I remember your name from the 17thshard forums. I started reading this story a few weeks ago.

I was hoping that the grey hunter's ability to shrug off most direct attack spells wouldn't actually work on mental magic, so that at some point in the story he can deliver the egg to Silverlake by just walking the grey hunter up to her while the spider was under his mental control. (The same way the matriarch used the worm in one of the loops to fight off invaders.) He still hasn't managed to truly shock any of complete hardass teachers yet. And that eventually he'd use the grey hunter against the invaders directly.

He might later be able to find a way to overcome that of course, just it would be another barrier to get through, and he'd need to have a very strong psionic assault.

****** I guess I should have clarified, when Zorian first explains about grey hunter he states:

#+begin_quote
  It could run faster than a hasted mage, jump incredible distances, shrug off regular firearms and lower-level attack spells like a duck shrugging off water, outright *ignore most direct-effect spells* and bite through steel.
#+end_quote

The question is not "is mental magic a direct-effect spell?" (mind-crushing and bodily control certainly are.), but rather, "does mental magic fall under the category of *most* as far as grey hunter magic resistance is concerned?"

Since human mind mages are so rare, much less a natural empath like Zorian, I doubt it would ever be considered a viable approach outside of his particular circumstances, even if does work.

******* I would guess that it being able to ignore magic is due to something like it's skin being filled with antimagic liquid like its toxin which disrupts most magic. As such, mental magic would be broken, being made of mana and being direct normally.

What I suspect he might be able to do is to use the slower method of trying to find a hole or a weakness in the defence, as Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty did with him. I could easily imagine, after he's been trained by the Aranea, that he has some tense scene where he's desperately trying to avoid the grey hunter eating him while he tries to find a hole in its defences, ending with it inches from his face under his control, fangs dripping with venom.

Or that it takes him two or three restarts to get mental control of it, as it tends to seek and attack him when he tries to take control.

Looking back on the story, I can't help but feel Zorian's progress has been a little underwhelming. I don't ever want him to reach god tier, or even demigod tier, but at this stage in the game I feel like he ought to have several moderately powerful tricks under his belt.

He talked about divinations that can analyze objects: what their function is, who touched them last, etc.

There's also the north finding spell and the library divinations from earlier chapters.

None of those involved markers.

And since spell formulae seem to be engineering-natured rather than woowoo-natured, it would basically be a Divine Function spell in reverse (which is admittedly a /lot/ more complicated, but it still doesn't need markers).

******* Ah, Haslush Ikzeteri

Divinations can find out information about what objects have done in the past, yes, but only with an example of the object at hand. You're not making information out of nothing, you're taking information out of an object at hand so you have a marker, the object, at hand. Divination spells like this extract information e.g. where is an object what is it doing when you have an example of the object at hand.

The north finding spell finds what direction is north, likely using a magnetic field. It extracts information from the magnetic field surrounding you most likely.

The library divination finds objects surrounding you that have particular words. You need to know what words to search for.

A function and a spell formula have exactly as much connection as a function and an object do.

We're just reversing the order of input to output.

In one case we have "physical thing>function of physical thing", and in the other we have "function of physical thing>physical thing".

The sort of examples of where he has used divination on objects has revealed things like that the watch was for ward breaking, or that repair magic was used in the smashed up house, or that there were blood stains lying around.

That seems to be more how the magic functions. You look at an object, you suspect it has some particular function, you cast a spell to detect known markers of that function e.g. to be covered in blood it must have blood on it, you get a yes or a no.

We also haven't seen any real depth to these divinations. The divination looks for repair magic. He didn't seem to learn repair magic from that, he didn't gain anything from that scan, he just got a y repair magic is present in that object.

Ask the wrong question, interpret the results incorrectly, or fail to take an important variable into account and it's all just wasted effort. Experience can help you minimize those kind of issues, but it helps to be naturally perceptive."

Based on that, I read that it's heavily about using intuition to interpret spell results.

We went over it, I disagreed. I believed that the power was strictly limited to pattern recognition, while he seemed to believe that the spells plucked information out of nothing. That means either the information is being produced by the spell (super intellect) or that they can find information that doesn't exist yet (time travel).

**** The telepathic spiders turning you into a mind-slave memory packet courier forever is significantly more costly than ending a single loop.

Once he knew he was at risk of that happening he should have just given the whole thing up as a bad job.

******* What he knew was that he'd dealt with the two in front of him, there were some coming in from deeper in the dungeon, his retreat route was clear, and he could outrun the attackers. It made sense for him to run.

Once the other aranea popped up to block his escape route and started smashing at his mind shield, that would have been a good time to suicide. He wasted a few seconds there, but I'm quite willing to put that down to "no one wants to suicide and he was in the middle of a combat situation so didn't have time to react with perfect rationality."

**** He should be carefully weighting his resource expenditure based on predicted outcomes. Suppose each day is worth 1 utility point.

If he becomes a mind slave that would likely be at least 1 gone. -1 utility points. I think that's a massive underestimate.

Consider his probability of escaping. Suppose he has a 70% chance of escaping. This seems rather high, but whatever. He was about 18 days through a loop. He would gain a utility of 12/30*0.7=0.28 if he escaped with his life.

The 1 lost loop plus the lost time in this loop would lose him 0.3 * 1+0.3 * 12/30=0.42 utility points. So even based on that incredibly conservative case he'd be worse off.

Realistically, he could easily lose more than 1 loop, and he probably didn't have a 70% chance of surviving. If he lost the next eighty years and only had a 50% chance of surviving then it would be an extremely bad idea.

He shouldn't go in with an "I have finite time to work with, better risk it" attitude when facing threats to his long term survival. I can't imagine any probability calculation that's going to say it's a good idea in most cases. He should minimize his risks as much as possible, knowing that he needs to take some risks for his long term survival.

***** True, but he's not deciding between "fight to the death" and "immediately suicide". He can fight for a few seconds and see if it's easy to escape and fall back to the suicide plan if that fails, which is what he does. I agree he balanced it too far toward risk, but not quite as much as it seems at first glance.

In either case, keep in mind the worst-case scenario is not just permadeath, it's the success of the undead invasion.

****** The longer he fights the more risk he has of an adverse reaction or of failing to carry out the suicide plan. I'm doubtful that the additional risk of failing and becoming a mind slave is worth 12 days, especially since a few seconds isn't long enough to do a risk calculation. I think he balanced it far too much towards risk.

Plus, even if he waits to fight for a few seconds he might be injured in those few seconds. He lost an entire restart compared to just losing 12 days.
