** Can someone sell this for me? I always fail to make it past the first few characters because I really don't like Reg, but since it's reached forty one chapters and it's getting consistently upvoted maybe it's really good and I'm missing out on it for a dumb reason.

*** [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/07/significant-digits-chapter-fourteen.html][Chapter 14, Azkaban]], contains very mild spoilers. But if you read it and like it, you'll probably like /SD/. If you read it and don't like it, then I suggest just moving on. Read /Worm/ yet if you haven't, that's pretty fantastic. Or Tad Williams' /Otherland/ series.
