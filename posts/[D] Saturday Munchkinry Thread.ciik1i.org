Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the ability to send your consciousness into your body one minute into the past at will, at no harm to yourself, however you cannot use it again for five minutes, that is, four minutes after the time you initially used it. At this point you will be able to travel another minute back.

The laws of time travel in this scenario are such that the world is not predestined, that is, your choices can change events.

Let's see what you guys come up with.

*** 1 minute of time is plenty for gambling. For moderate sums of money, you can buy scratchcards every now and then, and if they don't win, rewind time to before you bought them. Larger sums of money are also possible, but tend to draw a lot more attention.

You can also use that 1 minute to learn things about people without them knowing you have learned these things. Like in this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY][video]]. Granted, you can only use it once every 5 minutes, but that only means it will take you longer to learn things.

This isn't exactly safe however. If you do something very offensive, the person could punch you in the head and daze you, making you forget to or become unable to rewind time.

All functional relationships are preserved with the appropriate, ineffable required secondary superpowers (in the ‘intuitive' manner, e.g. relative to your change in mass when it comes to lifting things via stronger muscles and bones (so if you can bench 2x your bodyweight now you'd be able to bench 2x bw post-transformation), or your metabolic requirements; though some things remain ‘functionally' constant, e.g. you generate and radiate heat in a manner such that you'd be as susceptible to overheating or getting chilly at the same temperatures and exertions as you would be now).

There are no limits to this transformation, so you can become as large as mountains or galaxies or as small as an ant or an atom, though you'd still be unable to breathe in space (though your corpse wouldn't collapse into a black hole, since your body's structural integrity will have scaled too).

Consider your blood circulation. If your body size increases, and the secondary superpowers work in the 'intuitive' manner, does the amount of time it takes for blood to go from the heart to any other organ stay the same as before? But that would imply that if you grow as large as a galaxy, your blood would be moving way way faster than light. Your body would be one giant mass of backwards time travel.

** You have a magical charisma that makes most people (>80%) agree with your opinions (the rest are genetically resistant to your magic, but could still be convinced non-magically to agree). However, your power comes under the following restrictions:

- You must never attempt to communicate with anyone in any method other than pointing your thumb up or down at something. Any other attempt at communication will cause your magic to fail and turn you back into a normal human.
- Every action you take without the intent for communication will not communicate anything to any observer. For example, if you walk to a restaurant, that does not make observers that think the restaurant is good. (Though doing a thumb up at the restaurant would.) If you write a note without any intention of sharing it, people who somehow see the note will just think of it as a cryptic memo you wrote for yourself, whose meanings are indecipherable to anyone else.
- Your magical charisma only affects observers that see you thumb up or thumb down in person. Any kind of second-hand information, such as from cameras or word of mouth, is not affected by your magical charisma in any way.
- Your magical charisma only makes an instantaneous change to an observer's opinion. This new opinion can still be changed later, exactly like any non-magical opinion would be changeable. That said, there is nothing to stop you from thumbing up or down the same item again to once more change the opinion.

Yeah actually I think this is maybe useful for like a few days at most. Longer than that is unlikely to be practical, because family/friends would check up on you and probably not take thumbs up/down for answers as to why you're not speaking/texting/calling. People don't just suddenly go mute for no reason as an adult.

It's even worse than that. You're starving. You go to the store. You bring your purchases to the counter. The act of placing items on the counter is a body-language communication that says "I wish to purchase these goods." Boom, you lose your power.

Not everywhere will have self-checkout kiosks. Even then, what if the attendant tries to look in your bags? You just have to stand there, completely mute and staring straight ahead, since any body language at all is a form of communication.

Very little, if anything at all. The problem is that you are simply reduced to a like/dislike system. You could react with a thumb to something somebody else said, but that limits your ability to express concepts to simply the concepts that are given to you, like an even more restricted version of Newspeak. I would probably immediately give up the magical charisma, or if I saw some immediate use for it, I would make use of it for that purpose, and then give it up.

*** The big thing would be getting an immune helper that knows (to a decent degree of accuracy) what I want and knows about my power to help me.

This could be done initially via thumbs upping at individual letters of a large picture of the alphabet, to show him I believe I have magic powers, after which I could just show him my thumbs up powers working on someone else in person to make him believe.

After he knows about my power and my disability (aka, not being able to communicate any other way) he could ask me questions (eg. do you want me to order food for tonight?, do you want to rob a bank today?) which I would then thumbs up or not respectively.

While I can't do anything other then thumbs up+down he can convey whatever information he wants (eg. you want to give me and my friend 10 million dollars), which I would then just thumbs up so that they agree. With the assistance of even a single person I could leverage this into getting pretty much whatever I want, from money to (global) political change.

I might end up ditching the power eventually after I have everything I want due to its huge costs, but I would use the hell out of it in the meantime.

If that exploit doesn't work you pray to the god of your choice that your power considers 'communicate' as people guessing your value judgement of things rather than say analyzing possible interpretations of body language. If people can read your unconscious body language you might be able to find a handler who can do food/necessities so you can survive with the power and you just leave money around your house.

**** The first wouldn't work because the pictures/videos of your thumb are second-hand information. And handing the pictures/videos to someone would be a form of communication no different from writing a message.

The second works somewhat. Any action you take without the intent of communicating will not be taken as any kind of communication. Your handler won't be able to tell whether you are hungry from your body language. On the other hand, your handler could simply guess that since it has been a long amount of time since your last meal, you now require another meal. Leaving money around the house may or may not work depending on the handler and how your agreement was set up. If you already had the handler before you got your magic and already arranged for the handler to just collect whatever money is laying around as payment, there's no problem. If the handler gets annoyed by the fact that you aren't paying him any money, and just decides to steal the money lying around the house as payment, there's no problem either. If the handler asks whether he can just take whatever money he finds in the house and you thumbs up, there's no problem either.

On the other hand, if you place money in front of him, or anywhere in the house with the intent of making him think you want to give it to him, that's a form of communication with intent to communicate and so you lose your magic.

I admit the limitations are somewhat hand-wavey. I wanted to see what could be done with a mind control that only works via thumbing up or down things, but realized it would be extremely overpowered if you could just say anything you want and then thumb up it to make people believe anything you say. Similarly, I didn't want you to be able to just prompt someone to bring up whatever issue you want to thumb up or down. So I wanted to only let you thumb up or down things brought up by other people without you causing them to.

--------------

The instant her wish fell into place, space and time and weight stopped in place, Felicity moving in a near-timeless passage, even her own heartbeat slowed beyond recognition, dust particles suspended in the air, her clothes dragging behind her, blind to gravity as if painting an afterimage. She had roughly twenty minutes left on the clock before the next round, and not one second seemed to have passed, so if nothing else, she thought, she had time.

Arlene was ready long before the she entered the arena. Again, she sat on top her defensive dome inside her trapped fortress, but where the camera feed used snap instantly to the new scene, she saw the new view blend into the old, top to bottom, at first cut in half, all artefacts visible only in the world she now inhabited.

What else was new was her ability to pour over individual frames of the image, seeing each moment as the ground raised steel walls as if a flipbook, each page slowly turned.

Her opponent was missing.

At least she had time and shelter to figure this out. She had a lot of defensive options, including running. Her offensive capabilities were strange and unphysical, but effective and varied.

Her opponent could have entered the arena somewhere else. If they had free choice, they would most likely have hidden themselves away for some indirect attack that took time to prepare, or have spawned as close as possible, aiming for a blitz. Only a fraction of a second had passed, so either was still a possibility, and Felicity immediately ran into the safest, most trapped area of the fortress she could find, neither too close to the centre nor too close to the outside. If her opponent was outside stalling for time, she needed to get going.

Her opponent could be invisible, or extremely skilled at hiding. Were this the case, leaving the fortress while not in constant motion would be suicide. They could have any kind of attack, and a single hit could come from anywhere, leaving her dead. If so, she needed to utilize her traps, or figure out how to circumvent this immunity.

Her opponent could have teleportation. This was potentially an even worse prospect, since it allowed both defense and offense. However, if they did not have enhanced reflexes or immediate use, it was not necessarily a bad matchup, and it would leave the opponent less likely to have some other, confounding trump card.

Other options that came to mind seemed less plausible. Perhaps her opponent was miniature, or underground, or so fast as to avoid the first frame of the camera. But they were still concerning; a miniature opponent would avoid most of her traps, as would a tunneling opponent, and if her opponent outsped her... well, hopefully the game was fairer than that.

Felicity ran to take a spear from a trap, less interested in the flamethrower now it spewed flames at such a glacial pace, but halfway through her acquisition sensed a loud buzzing sound and felt the room shake. In the molasses of time, sound was a strange thing, and rumbles were merely subtle linear motions, but somehow her wish translated them, and they were as natural and contentful as ever. She yanked the spear carelessly and rushed to find the source of the attack.

--------------

The wish Felicity went for is “I wish for /speed/”, or more particularly, “vastly enhanced speed and reflexes” from part 2, since reflexes seemed to her like they would pay off. She didn't summon kyubey because she thought wishing to create creatures that wanted to entrap prepubescent girls in soul-harvesting schemes seemed evil and creepy, and that part didn't seem to have anything to with her current circumstance, so she ended up distrusting the whole wish.

With aid of the camera system, Felicity has found major structural damage to the top parts of the fortress. The fortress is only one floor plus spacing, so she expects it won't hold after many repeated attacks, though it should take a fair few. The attacks seem to be some kind of laser beam, about a metre in diameter, with no visible travel time but some observable ‘warm-up‘ time (that is, it fades in, rather than acting as a projectile), though it isn't clear at what point it becomes lethal. The attacks seem to be coming from the air; Felicity thinks her opponent has flight.

Felicity has found that she, and things she is exerting force on, move as if affected by forces in subjective time. That is, Felicity feels standard gravity, and struggles to pick up heavy objects. If Felicity hits a wall, her hand ends up sore. However, once released, objects maintain momentum; if Felicity throws a rock, the rock's speed is maintained on release and will become a deadly projectile with a lot of inertia. This does not let her jump extra high, since gravity affects her in subjective time, but she isn't sure if there's a way around that restriction.

If Felicity had enhanced aim, she would venture outside and attack directly. However, her flying(?) opponent will prove hard to hit from afar, and though Felicity might be able to dodge the laser attacks, she isn't certain---after all, magic is in play.

After looking at the Slow Mo guys [[https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=319][video on TV's]] and doing a quirk calc it seams to pull this off she got at around a 160 times speed multiplier (The frame rate was 4000 to see the frames. They gave 25 as normal. 4000/25 = 160). To put that into perspective a baseball thrown by Felicity would travel at 4160m/s (mach 12) and have more kinetic energy behind it than some cars at highway speeds.

Run out and throw stuff at them. We almost certainly have better reaction times then them so the fact they weren't there at the start means they must have spend a pasive wish that caused that. So 1 wish for invisibility/different starting location, 1 wish for flight/teleportation/portals and 1 wish for the beam. I am willing to bet they don't have good enough aim to hit Felicity while she is moving so finding and attacking them seams like the best move.

  Throw a rock on a rope? You throw the rock, it gain a bunch of momentum, you then grab the rope and let it pull you along.

I'll answer things Felicity would have had opportunity to test, and this seems like one of them.

This doesn't work, the rock and rope all end up undergoing Weird Physics, and although the rock falls slowly, the rope tugs on it ‘as normal' and arrests its momentum. If Felicity instead ties the rope to a solid object and lets go of the rock after throwing it, the rope breaks and the rock flies off into the distance.

(I'll confess it was a struggle to figure out how to grant a superspeed wish that actually looked and behaved something like superspeed, but I think this is a decent compromise.)
