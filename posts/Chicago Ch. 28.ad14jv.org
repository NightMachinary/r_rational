*** It's a dark gritty fanfic of Madoka Magica. It has some good twists and world building. It's a sequel to the previous story Fargo. Lots of action scenes. It has a lot of Canadians.

**** You should really make a note when you post it that it's a sequel, that's not mentioned anywhere and I'm up to chapter 23 and just learning that.

***** It's a sequel in the sense it happens chronologically later and in the same world, the story is completely separate so far and can be experienced in any order

** This chapter was fucking wild. Clownmuffle is some incredible horseshit. Hard to call her power a singular power, really, which is about as much as I can say and avoid spoilers. Interesting that she's doing her level best to ignore her Canadian adventure...

This entire fight scene seemed almost impressionistic, which suited the content just fine.

*** This chapter completely lived up to the hype, Clownmuffle has always been high bullshit even without a transformation but now she went complete bullshit and I love it
