A fantasy short story that takes the plot points of the biblical story of Noah's Ark as a given and explores the consequences of it from the perspective of people not of Noah's family.

** Holy shit. I never considered how horrifying a world with a nearly omnipotent being who cares very much about how you live your life would be. How could anyone even oppose that?

The only thing I can think of is biding your time and gathering information on what this god can do secretly. If he can't read your mind, that is.

** Seriously? In the Christian version of Noah's ark only him, his wife, his kids and their spouses could get on the ark?

Not wanting to get into a religious war here, but as a Muslim, I keep getting shocked at how horribly the prophets are portrayed in Christianity. We believe in all the same prophets and I used to think we told the same stories about them, but that really isn't the case.

*** Yes, the first and last quotes in the story are direct quotes from the Bible.

**** Wow, any chance the bible also contains verses that say something like "All of Noah's followers were allowed to join him on the ark"? (which would be more in line with the Muslim version of the story, where Noah keeps asking people to join him but the evil doers refuse, thinking they could take care of themselves)

Or in the bible version does Noah have no followers?

***** Supposedly there were no other decent people in the entire world worth saving, only the people mentioned (which, I found a loophole in it as I tell in the story). I read the relevant chapters of Genesis while writing this story and could find no such verse. If the Qur'an has that, it could be a case of Muhammad reading the Bible and going "wait, wtf?"

Shouldn't that lead to him going around collecting babies to save?

******* Yea, it should, right? but then, since when did the Jews of the bible give a crap about /other/ peoples' babies? Doing something like that would be very /out of character/ :/
