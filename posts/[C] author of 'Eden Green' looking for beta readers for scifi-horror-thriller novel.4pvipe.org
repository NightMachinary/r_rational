I'm looking for beta readers for my latest novel, /[[http://homework.never-ends.net/newnight/][New Night]]/.

#+begin_quote
  Lucas was a police officer in Gothic, Arkansas, on a career path to success. That all ended the day horrifying needle monsters* tore through his beloved city, killing hundreds and forcing a federal evacuation. Now Gothic is quarantined behind high, razor-wire-tipped fences, and Lucas works as security at a FEMA refugee camp outside its borders.

  But just when things look bleak, a mysterious young woman named Io blows into the camp, sparking chaos and conflict. With the help of his stoner friend Zechariah and a cryptic old computer wizard known as Mr. Condy, Lucas must fight tooth-and-nail for the innocents he has sworn to protect. The quarantined city of Gothic is leaking its monsters... and its secrets.

*It's a sequel to /[[http://homework.never-ends.net/edengreen/][Eden Green]]/ (previous threads [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yf55g/rtrst_scifihorror_novel_eden_green/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/455qdh/eden_green/][here]]), but I've tried to write it as accessible to those who haven't read it. Therefore, I'm especially asking for readers who have not read any of my other work.

For those of you who /did/ read /Eden Green/, this is not as 'rationalist' as that was. One thing I'd like readers to watch for is whether I should even be allowed to call it 'rationalist'. The main character is not a bio-nerd like Eden. The book does, however, continue to explore '[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman][What Measure Is A Non-Human]]' territory. My alpha reader, [[/u/feepingcreature]], has already gone through it; I hope he pops into the thread to answer any questions.

The book is about 60,000 words long, and I'll hope to start sometime after July 4 (via email announcement with Google Docs link) and finish in 3-4 weeks. Please only volunteer if you think you'd be able to read the novel in three weeks while taking detailed notes. My favorite kind of note is a Google Doc comment, but a list of notes with textual references would work, too.

I hope this goes without saying, but this is a pre-production version of the book, and I'd rather it not be leaked to a wider audience. I don't so much care about book piracy, but I'd prefer pirates have access to a complete and non-embarrassing version of the book.

With all that said, if you'd like to be added to the list, or have any questions, let me know below or by PM.


** I'll do it if you'll do the same for one work. Have yet to read /Eden Green/.

** I'd totes be willing to Beta (preferably in exchange for beta reading of a work later down the line, but I'm honestly intrigued enough that this isn't a sticking point). Have not read Eden Green.

** I have a fair bit of experience editing and would be happy to look it over for you. 60,000 words would probably take me a little over an hour to read through, although exact time depends on the amount of commenting I do.
