** What is this "getting rescued"? They keep a Soyuz spacecraft docked at all times for a reason.

The stoning thing looks like it emanated as a sphere about some point on the surface of the earth. In order for the astronauts to escape it, the space station would have to be on almost the exact opposite side and the radius would have to be almost precisely the diameter of the earth. The ISS isn't really that far into space. Given that they can see it, and that it's not spreading extremely slowly, it doesn't seem to be likely. Maybe there's a big glowy sphere in addition to whatever force turns people into statues acting only on the surface.

*** Hopefully they'll find this out when they take a week off for research.

*** Plot twist: The explosion was actually a last ditch attempt by the Americans/Russians to defend themselves against what they perceived as an attack by "the other guys".

Hypothetically, what if the effect spreads through the air? Maybe nanomachines that are waiting for a trigger signal that might need to bounce off the atmosphere to reach the entire globe?

** I guess we can now rule out the possibility that the stoning was something that "mother nature" and given the size of the blast it seems unlikely that it was a dilebarate attack of some country on another. I'd also find it unlikely that it was some technological accident since the 'stoning' are so complex, gives energy to keep the brain running for thousands of years and can regenerate tissue. So I am leaning towards either alien technology or some crazy scientist.

Possibly to prevent some catastophy such as some incurable disease or global warming. Or in the case of aliens maybe shoving us back to stone age to prevent us from exploring space.

Given that the people on the space station aren't affected by the bomb we can probably rule out any kind of radiation causing the stoning. Maybe some kind of resilient virus that aggresively bonded with human DNA(even dead) and were spread through the wind blast of the bomb?

*** I'm mostly on board with the healing hypothesis ventured towards the end of the prologue [[[https://readms.net/r/dr_stone/015/4346/10][page]]]. That is, the restorative power of the stone is in fact its intended purpose, only the suddenness and scope of the effect was accidental. If anything, this allows us to attribute any benevolent complexity directly to intentional design.
