** Black, in one of his interludes, came to the conclusion that you needed to defeat her three times before she is driven off - at least for a while- and that was purely physical attacks to do it. Cat's already danced through a few of the Bard's stories, and she mentions three potential setups in the conversation that could also apply to previous bardic setups to kill her.

I wonder what happens when she slips the noose on this one? Driving her off three times by dodging stories instead of using physical attacks? Maybe the Bard is out of her life forever.

** I'm curious if Bard is local to Calneria or if she's active worldwide. We've been told that Calneria is a backwater, with only the Dwarves being near a world power. Is this just a side gig for her, or is what's going on here really that important on a global scale? Maybe there's a Super-Bard out there who's dealing with even bigger threats on the other continents.

*** Calernia may be a political backwater but it could also be the most dynamic and creative story wise. The rest of the world seems remarkably stable with large empires and balanced leadership.

**** I really wouldn't assume much about the nature of the rest of the world, static or otherwise. We simply know very little about it and, with a handful of exceptions, what we do know is in character travellers tales.

I mean, yes, we're told that X empire exists. It is big and even Calneria knows about it. But would we know about the Turquoise Turban rebellion ragging in the east, or the quiet assassin war being fought between the merchant families of Xong and McFusty? Or the valiant last stand of the proudly independent mountain kingdom of Bitet against encroaching hegemony of its larger neighbours? I doubt it.

*** I've always had this idea that Calernia is the last bastion of the god's fight in creation. That all other powers are already out and are no longer involved. So the bard is fighting hard to keep the game going in this parts. But mostly because i like the idea of that twist than because of any evidence provided.

** So we haven't really learned anything about the Bard's intentions, aside from the fact that she seems to want Cat dead. Which would almost certainly mean she's against the Accords, so that's can't be what she's going for.

We know about a few things she's done seemingly on her on accord though:

1) Setting a Crusade against Praes, with Akua's Folly and making sure Black destroys the weapon.

2) Driving a wedge between Malicia and Black in the process of starting the Crusade.

3) Having Cat named Arch-Heretic of the East, and removing Cordelia's trust in the heroes, making any deals or treaties with Callow null and void.

4) Stripping the Hierophant of his sorcery. Which resulted in Sve Noc trying to recruit him and getting their fingers burnt, possibly making them more cautious in the future.

5) Unleashing the Dead King. Which was an effect of Black destroying the weapon, and which she admits to in an Interlude.

The Bard almost certainly knew to expect the ban on the sale of dwarf-made weapons with nations at war with Callow: Cat going to the Everdark at the same time that the Kingdom Under was invading was part of a story, which is in her jurisdiction. So her plan so far seems to be to corner Procer. It /could/ be that she actually is trying to kill the Dead King. But that seems to narrow in focus for this series. Not very interesting. Cordelia having some kind weapon pulled from Lake Artoise: that'll be a key part of the Bard's plan. We'll have to see what it is.

I mean, Cat is for the Accords and isn't really all about self-preservation either.

*** Maybe she's trying to somewhat "force" Cordelia into a name so she can finally have some control over the country. It'd more than likely be a vilian name as Cat has pointed out her actions have been less than heroic

**** A win, a tie, a loss, against gods and beings beyond mortals ken. She won winters mantle, she tied with Sve Noc, twilight was abdicated and no fight fought so it quite possibly doesn't count as a loss. Also a story of a villain trying to take down the force of good who "only seeks the dead kings death"

** Wait, does Cat have a Name, now? The Bard just claimed that she can only talk to Named, and Cat didn't call her on it. has her assumed Name of Black Queen actually become a real one?

*** Cat pointed out the discrepancy, and got "speak of the devil" as an answer:

#+begin_quote
  “First Prince isn't a Name,” the Intercessor sighed. “That's what I work with, like your teacher told you. Names. I can't touch the Nameless outside of some very narrow boundaries.

  ...

  “Narrow boundaries,” I repeated, hinting at a question.

  She looked amused.

  “You spoke of me,” the Bard said. “It was enough, given who you are.”

  And wasn't that just the loveliest of ambiguous sentences? Who I was. It might even be true, given that I'd avoided speaking of her as much as I could. The last time I could recall, in truth, had been with the Tyrant of Helike and we'd been hiding behind the madness of the Hierarch unleashed on that night.

Not really. I mean, sure, someone to proof-read the text before publishing would be nice, but the quality of the writing and the overall content is honestly pretty consistently good.

** I think the bard has the ability to make people relive past scenes--- a sort of “remember who you are” storyline ability with her narrating.

This is just her using it to try and kill someone.
