** A one-time-use Wild Hunt summoning tool? That's pretty reasonable as far as Checkhov's Guns go. If they planned for one fae and the Woe, they probably didn't plan for /all/ the fae.

*** I dunno. Surely Malicia knows that Cat is also the Queen of the Wild Hunt and should be able to summon them. I'd be disappointed if Malicia didn't have countermeasures against the Hunt in place too. They'd probably end up being a distraction for Cat's real trump card.

Speaking of trump cards, is Thief officially a villain now, or is she always neutral, or can she switch back and forth as needed? As a Named of Callow, facing the Dread Empress of Praes, maybe she can switch back to Good for a moment and claim a BS power up to use against the arch-nemesis of her people.

**** The thing is though, she may have been planning for Cat to summon them as Queen of the Wild Hunt. But Cat didn't summon them that way, she summoned them with an Aspect of Akua's.

***** It's probably because Cat and her allies are "special" and the only ones we know of who are closer to neutral/rational evil than pure Evil. Good always triumphs over Evil, but rational evil (as has been said countless times in the story by various characters) is a new breed created by Black.

****** i wouldn't call cat rational, especially not anymore. Black might fit that trope, but she's just sarcastic evil, or possibly "Hard Men" evil, at this point.

Like, shit, she literally did a fae "exact words" bargain 2 chapters ago. She agreed to the superweapon. She brags.

******* True, she isn't a rational character per se but she acts rationally in some cases compared to the other Evil characters (except her allies, Malicia, Black and the Dead King) who only live according to fictional tropes.

** If they have wards against Archer, how can Thief successfully land hits with a common bow and arrow? Surely the wards aren't just protecting only Malicia since they need the mages to hold Catherine down.

Is the Wild Hunt supposed to be her "invisible crossbow"? Isn't summoning them just one of her regular powers? Even if she can only do it once or for a limited number of times, it's not really strange enough to require all the obfuscation since even without seer powers her enemies should be expecting them.

*** Invisible crossbow is definitely talking about Archer, and since she hasn't appeared till now, I suspect she will be playing that role. Their plans are messed up enough that Archer probably has a different timing on when to come out compared to what Catherine wants, or she might be somewhere ahead.

Wards for archer are because archer uses her name skills to power her arrows, which can be warded against. Thief is just using regular arrows, which are most likely non-magical and hence can simply go through wards.

**** I don't think that's the reason. It's stated several times that Archer has special arrows that pierce wards, and we know that mages can generate shields against physical objects as well as magical ones. It would be pretty foolish of them to be so focused on anti-Archer wards that they don't include a physical shield as well.

My guess is that either Thief borrowed a special arrow (it was meant to hit Malicia, after all), or the mages were so focused on Cat that they couldn't spare any power to shield themselves.

EDIT: Found the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/08/02/interlude-apprentice/][exact interlude]] where they explain her special arrows.

Nope. She used the cystallized version of one of Akua's Aspects. Different power.

** Am I the only one who thinks that successfully killing the puppet will only impress malicia? I could see this turning into a story of 'worthy allies' and I'm very happy about that.

Also, remember when we were impressed with Cat for forcing war games to come to a draw through necromancy, explosives, and a fondness for footstools?

*** Malicia won't be impressed, no. If anything, she'll loathe Cat even more. The Dread Empress has only disdain for swords, even her own Black Knight wasn't spared her saying "nice going kid, you killed someone again, now adults have to clean up the mess again". People are tools, you see, and disposing of one is failure. And performing said disposal inelegently is the sign of the dim-witted and the incompetent.

No, seriously, Malicia won't be impressed. But she may re-evaluate Catherine's threat level upward.

** I wonder why Catherine never brought up the points like becoming the Arch-Heretic of the East, Tyrant being up to something or Black marching to Salia. I know that this wouldn't change the main point of contention (Procer attacking everything it has a border with), but surely reviewing the tools at their disposal would go a ways towards a compromise?

*** Malicia is, to her, an enemy 100% because of the Liesse accords. Even if they act jovially with each other, Cat knows that sometime later on she will have to go. So why give information to an enemy /known/ for being good at scheming and politics?
