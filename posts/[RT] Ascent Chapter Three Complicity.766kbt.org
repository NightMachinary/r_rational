*Conurbations*

Last week there was a question about what exactly a 'conurbation' is - the word refers to extended urban areas that cover several towns and cities, but in 'Ascent' the numbered conurbations are a specific kind of highly self-sufficient city. Not quite like an arcology or a regular town, Conurbations are built around incredibly high density subsistence farming ('protein farms') - most residents grow heavily modified seaweeds or staple crops in high density square meter plots, a little like the ancient Inca method of farming. Conurbations are built to minimise public spaces and opportunities for meeting and congregation. They are designed to be nearly self sufficient in food, water and basic goods, with heavy recycling and printing facilties. Energy is provided by extensive solar power farms, the only method of energy generation that does not add to total planetary waste heat. The only things that need be imported are high-tech goods like medicines and some electronics. There is little need for travel. All in all, the Earth's total population at the time the story is set exceeds 20 billion, with demographics resembling a present day middle income country. 'Wastelanders' are an insignificant minority.

** I remember this setting! You've written two other short pieces set in this, one about how Vash rose to power, I believe, and the other about how Earth came to be like this and who is on the other end of that phone line. Keep up the good work

So far there seem to be three main throughlines - the AI plot, the aliens plot, and the alien AI plot. I'm hoping that Ascent will touch on the origins of the enemy from Bows and Arrows, because that really intrigued me last time. On the other hand, Ascent seems to be a somewhat personal story about somewhay personal stakes. On the other other hand, it's called "Ascent", which carries some pretty strong implications of transcendence as a theme, so who knows? Either way, I'll be following.

** I liked this chapter way less than the other two. The dialogue felt very... I dunno, off. Stilted, on the nose.

I remember reading an article called something like "Travel by plane if it were written by bad sci-fi authors", that went "Oh, we are taking a plane. It's a very efficient means of transportation that can take us all across the world." /They embarked on the flying machine./ "But aren't you afraid the plane might crash?" "Well, it's possible, of course. I mean, planes have crashed in the past. But it remains the one safest way to travel, statistically speaking."

What I mean is, the exposition and dialogue don't feel like things the characters would talk about and think about, they feel like things being communicated to us, the audience. It feels like the whole chapter is screaming at me "This character is a kind man who has to make utilitarian choices that lead to many deaths".

--------------

The dialogue with the alien AI thing felt like the worst part of the chapter. It's SoD-breaking. Among other things:

- Vash is supposedly the president of the world, and has had his job for a while. But he demonstrates very little competence, or at least very little negotiating skill. It would make sense if the narration was trying to imply that he's not fit for the job and he's just completely overwhelmed, but the rest of the chapter seems to imply that he's somewhat experienced, and can keep a cool head. Basically, the question I'm asking is: if Obama (or Bill Gates or someone who's leading abilities you respect) were having this conversation, is that how they'd react?

- Vash doesn't seem to understand the Alien at all. I know this is supposed to indicate that the Alien is weird and inhuman, but as written it just implies that Vash isn't fit for his job. Has Vash never talked to the Alien before? If not, then hasn't he at least been briefed? Talked to previous ambassadors? Listened to previous recordings of the Alien? At the very least, Vash should know enough to realize that his appeals to compassion and respect for human life aren't going to cut it.

- The Alien threatens to nuke the entire colony if the crowd doesn't disperse. Why does Vash believe it, but the crowds don't? Presumably, the crowds are aware that the Alien exists. Has it never blown a colony before? (I think it's implied it did recently) I know crowds can be irrational, but "An entire city was nuked from above and the same might happen to us" isn't something that people just rationalize away. "This person can and will kill me if pushed" is a very basic, very instinctive concept; especially in a post-apocalypse society where cops shoot to kill.

- Why doesn't Vash try to reason with the Alien? An argument he could have made is "These protests were started /because/ you blew up a city. I can disperse this one, but if you blow us up, other protests will pop up elsewhere. It will work out better if you leave me time to disperse the protest."

- Also, I'm not sure I get why the Alien doesn't like riots, but if it's memetic propagation, I'm not sure how much sense it makes. I don't think people socialize that much in violent protests; they're all going to be focused on the citadel, not each other.

Overall, the whole situation seems blatantly forced to give Vash a reason to order civilians to be shot.

*** I'm sorry to hear that. I too have read that and found it hilarious, in part because it perfectly satirises a failing I can acknowledge that I'm guilty of at times. I wonder if it may be the fact that Vash is a new voice and one that still needs refining? I'll certainly bare it in mind... Your criticism of Vash's phone conversation however I think is partly based on mistaken assumptions. The exchange is intended to seem 'off', and hopefully as the story unfolds things will become clearer. To respond (without giving too much away):

1) Vash's role is more complicated than that. He's 'ambassador', but the title is essentially euphemistic. 'Those above' and the Arco administration are not on an even footing in any sense and they both know it.

2) Contact has been incredibly limited. There is no real diplomatic exchange, just orders issued via the phone. Thus Vash has only a vague idea of how they think, discerned from the orders they give.

3) A great number of people are beginning to believe that 'those above' are an Arco fiction to justify repression, or that the two directly collude. Surely Arco wouldn't flatten it's own capital to stop a protest? Furthermore the use of orbital strikes against population centres is a recent phenomenon. The perpetrators are not a monolithic bloc.

4/5) I'm not sure I can really address these without giving too much away at the moment.

Normally I'd just respond with 'wait and see' to these kind of questions, but the fact that you clearly get the 'point' of the chapter whilst feeling it is forced gives me pause for thought. I went with the approach of giving very little away about the context of the exchange, in order that it might be revealed more gradually, but maybe I didn't explain enough. I'll definitely think about this one.

**** Regarding the phone exchange, I think it would work better if Vash was more... I don't know, centered. Like, if it felt like he had a plan in mind of dealing with the alien, and that plan backfired because of incomplete information or because he lacked experience dealing with it. As it is, it felt like he had no plan at all beyond "Please don't kill people, don't you see that they are innocent?"

** Is this a fanfic? You can't really have a wasteland setting featuring a tall thin man in an overcoat named Vash without it evoking one of the most widely known animes ever.

**** Ah. Well THATS awkward.

Vash the stampede is the protagonist of a show called Trigun. He is a sharpshooter wasteland cowboy in a post apocalyptic retro sci-fi Western setting. He is nearly unbeatable, but also happens to be a strict pacifist. He will not kill no matter the circumstances. He also has long blond hair and wears a signature red over coat. In the show, he ends up pairing up with a grim dude bent on revenge, but his goofy antics and pacifist ways has them get in each other's way more often than not.

I've not read much of your story yet, but just reading the synopsis and a bit of this chapter made me wonder if it were a spin-off fic. You should probably be aware of it if using such a unique but well known name in such a setting.
