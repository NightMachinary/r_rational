** I'm surprised at how mundane Suze has been acting the past two days, and that Herr√∫n took all that time to just go talk to her about basic godhood rules. Given Loki can just generate the full library of all knowledge about the gods at will, and given the senior magicians of Flobovia were similarly capable of implanting rulebooks into Jake's head, should Suze even need someone to tell her explicitly?

I don't know how much I should expect of eaglejarl, so for now, I'll just stick to noticing I'm confused.

*** The Archmagi's summoning ritual didn't create information, it took all the written information within the summoning circle, burned it, and implanted the contents in Jake's head. It was effectively a reversed Scholar's Touch spell -- it let him memorize the written information very quickly.

Loki created a set of books containing things that he knew. He's a lesser God so his power is limited, but he's a very old and clever God, so he's had a long time to learn stuff.

Suze doesn't have the knowledge to start and is currently facing unknown unknowns -- she doesn't know what she should be asking. She's also been a little busy these past few days flexing her newly divine muscles to really sit down and think through the implications.

There's a little more to it, but I'll stop there.

** Well Suze seems slightly less evil that when we last saw her... She should probably get her crime to punishment ratio ironed out a bit more though...

*** In her defense, she's 19 and has suffered a fair amount of abuse at the hands of various nobles. She's just acting out a little bit...by, you know, sending people to Hell. Ok, maybe that's a bit over the top. Never mind.

Also, I'm very amused by hearing that comment from your username.

******* It was before. Although I grant that extrapolating from a data set of one is dangerous.

Having said that, it's Death. I doubt you're going to find many arguments here that it's a force for Good.

******** In a universe with resurrection, why not? Then why not neutral? Everyone gunna die and all that.

Also, she didn't exactly ask for the domain and apparently she shouldn't just go and kill people, just do something with the dead guys. She's apparently not the cause of death.

********* In a universe with resurrection, Death still isn't good, it's just not a tragedy. If it was good, why would anyone want to undo it? Having said that, I do agree that there's no reason it couldn't be neutral.

Maybe not everyone likes "good"? :)

Do everybody want to undo it? In some cases that might be the other living people who resurrect the guy who might not even want that. At least in some versions of resurrection, the victim must be willing. Why is that clause I wonder? :) [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:True_Resurrection]]

If she can put people to hell, why not to heaven?

******* It's not so much her portfolio that's going to cause the shift, just her current actions.

On second thoughts, being dependent on the worship of hordes of evil undead beings is bound to influence her given enough time...

******** I'm not an expert, but isn't killing evil beings a good act? Not sure if they are evil in-universe though.

It could also be that getting converted to worship a different Death with possibly different alignment could also influence the follower's alignment? Masses of good undead? :p

********* Yes, with D&D the killing of evil beings is generally an act of good. And the un-dead in this universe are indeed evil. (Think of Colburn who forcibly had his alignment changed to good.)

Interesting idea about the influence going the other way. Masses of good un-dead would be interesting to see.
