Somehow you have come across a simple-looking 8.5x11" piece of paper with a remarkable property: if you write down a yes/no question at the top of the page and put it out of sight for an hour, then the next time you glance at it you will see the answer written in elegant cursive below your query. An additional hour later all writing is erased from the page and you can ask something again. You must print your question legibly, no smaller than what would normally correspond to a 12 point font.

The piece of paper will not predict the future. It will not tell you which stocks will rise or fall tomorrow. It will, however, answer any question about the present or the past, provided the question itself is well-defined.

When your question is insufficiently precise, you will see a slanted question mark appear beneath your query in response. "Is Fermat's last theorem true?" produces such a question mark. By contrast "Does Fermat's last theorem follow from the ZFC axioms?" produces a "Yes." It seems that the paper has some background knowledge and does not need an explanation of what Fermat's last theorem is or what the ZFC axioms are.

Asking "Has my girlfriend cheated on me?" produces a question mark. The paper does not have care to parse the (culturally dependent) context of "cheating." On the other hand, if you ask whether your girlfriend has engaged in certain acts and provide anatomical descriptions, you will have your answer.

It seems as if there is no fact about the past or present the paper does not know. Direct questions ("What are you?") produce only question marks in response. So do questions without a yes/no answer.

You would not decline riches and fame, but you'd really like to use this thing to do something meaningful for humanity. What do you do?

Edit: some words.

I'm not so sure. It seems that certain conceptual leaps are necessary to even /ask/ the right questions. For example, to even conceive of relativity theory one has to be able to imagine time as "just another dimension" not altogether different from the three spatial dimensions. I believe even something as basic as the use of coordinates was foreign to ancient Greeks and introduced by Descartes.

*** Precision for direct immortality questions would be difficult. Does having your name "immortalized" in history (or a headstone) count?

I think I would start by looking for small molecules to cure various conditions. I'd start with diseases that are currently sucking up all the research funding, but aren't producing very fast advances, for example Alzheimer's: "have one or more molecules existed that would, at some correct dosage, cure greater than 80% of Alzheimer's patients without killing them?"

If you get a yes then you find it with

"For the molecules referenced by the question asked at [first question's date/times]. Is the k-th character of the IUPAC name for the molecule with the shortest IUPAC name numeric?"

You'd know you had the complete name when you asked about the next character and got a ?.

Now you just have to ask about dosage per kilo and/or administration methods and hardest of all, get the FDA to trust the paper enough to skip clinical trails for things discovered by precise use of the paper.

Magic paper, is there a greater than 55% chance that Apple stock will increase by 2% in the next week? If I know whether a rumored merger is actually being discussed I have a huge advantage on the market. Magic paper, has the Fed decided to lower interest rates? Have G.E.'s earnings exceed the predicted value over the last quarter? This information is all known well before it's announced, and thus is well within the power of my notebook paper, but before it's publicly known, it's basically as good as gold.

Making lots of money ........ ✔

It also seems like it would be super useful for guiding research. Lots of long research projects have single bit answers at the end. Does P=NP? Is cold fusion possible? Can a superconductor stable at standard temperature and pressure be created using currently available technology?

Advancing science and human progress ........ ✔

And then of course my piece of paper is a halting oracle, and so I can specify an encoding and use it to output a binary representation of the answer to virtually any question. I'll need some knowledge to start with so I can ask good questions with short answers, but since I have plenty of money to hire researchers and I am hyper-efficient at directing research, paying people to come up with good compression algorithms for hard questions shouldn't be too difficult. Outputting the chemical formula of miracle materials like cancer cures and cheap water splitting catalysts seems particularly easy.

** It having knowledge of everything but lacking contextual clues seems incompatible. Either an entity knows /everything/ or it doesn't. It would seem to me that it would know the answers to such questions, but be unable to give them for some reason.

I would begin by asking if it can answer questions about itself. Figuring out how the paper works (how it actually collects the information) could be even more valuable than the paper itself.

I would try to get more than yes or no answers out of it. For a question "X" I would ask "Is the first letter of the answer to "X" the letter 'a'?" and repeat for each letter.

What I would do next would depend on if the above works.

***** Indeed, I agree. But if you do the calculations, you should still find it quite difficult to obtain answers which are even moderately long.

For example: suppose an answer has 50 characters (i.e., about ten words). There are 26 letters in the English language plus space, which leads to 27^{50} possibilities. Each question can cut down the space by a factor of 2 at most, so you will need at least log_2(27^{50)} questions; dividing this by, say, 7 questions a day, you get about 34 days.

You can probably do much better by making use of the redundancy of the English language, whose entropy is not that high, though your ability to use various error-correcting codes for this purpose is extremely limited by the fact that you need to fit the questions on an 8.5x11" piece of paper in 12 point font.

That is assuming 7 questions per day. If you get 12 questions out of it per day (e.g., by sleeping half hour every hour or some such thing), you can get it in less than 20 days.

Edit: Actually, thinking about it, you can ask whether the k'th bit of the LZ algorithm (essentially what zip uses to compress text) is 1 or 0. Using Shannon's famous estimate of 1.6 for the entropy of the English language, this lets you produce answers at a rate of about 0.31 characters per hour.

************ If it is a bound demon with full read access to the universe, then you've already lost.

We've already established that it has unspeakable computational capability. We could conceivably convert Chinese characters into a numeral system, using all the characters in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Dictionary][Kangxi Dictionary]], in order, as numerals in a base-49,030 numeral system which we henceforth call the Kangxi Numeral system. We could then ask "When converting the following number, X, from the Kangxi numeral system into the base-10 Arabic numeral system, is the digit '7' the last digit in the smallest prime factor of X?" and follow this with 1,500 characters, creating a number which is 332,140 bits long.

We can repeat with each digit, and go from last digit to second-to-last, etc. and eventually establish the smallest prime factor of a number which could easily be a composite of two large primes. We would be able to prove the answer to be correct, despite not having anywhere near the tiniest, smallest, glimmer of having any shred of being able to provide enough computational power to actually calculate that on our own.

Brute force trial factorization by division would require 10^{49,992} divisions. There's only about 10^{80} atoms in the observable universe, and only about 10^{100} years before the heat death of the universe. Even if every atom in the universe were a 10 Ghz CPU trying to solve this question, you would not come anywhere even remotely close to an answer before the heat death of the universe. Yet this sheet of paper can start to print out an answer within one hour.

So why have you already lost? Because the sheet of paper, or whatever entity is behind it, is most likely capable of running billions of simultaneous complete simulations of our universe and running it substantially faster than real-time. Even if it does not give /you/ information about the future, we have established that it is fully capable of deriving nearly exact probabilities about events stretching years into the future (or even exact simulations if there is no true quantum uncertainty).

This means that any action that you take (including not taking an action) is something the sheet is already anticipating as your response to the information it provides. As such, if it is truly a bound demon, then destroying the sheet will only serve to further the demon's ends. Perhaps destroying the sheet releases the demon?

So, basically, if the sheet is a bound demon, you're doomed and nothing you do will change that, so you can enjoy what little you have left in life. If the sheet is not a bound demon, you are free to munchkin up interesting uses for it and improve life for yourself and everyone else.

We don't know how intelligent it is. It could be connected to another universe that an AI has already tiled with computronium. It appears to be incredibly powerful due to the accuracy of knowledge displayed about the present and the future. And the simple fact is, benevolence is completely orthogonal from this. It's already dangerous, benevolence is simply being dangerous to our obstacles. We know that it is dangerous to be its obstacle. We don't know that it is benevolent, i.e. aligned with us. It is very, very improbable that it is aligned with us, since there are so many things it could be. Burn it.

  Knowing that questions about what certain people believe can be quite far from having clear yes/no answers, the entity in the paper does not care to consider them.

It is not a question of belief or anything that requires a well-defined /concept/. It is a simple behavioral simulation. "Would I answer yes over fifty percent of the time?" That is well-defined.

************* Fair enough. But if you want it to do a behavioral simulation, you would have to precisely input all the parameters of the simulation. Consider that "I" is not a well-defined entity -- your brain state changes every day when you have breakfast. Furthermore, asking about a being "with my brain state when I woke up this morning" could potentially lead to problems down the line - that brain state may be incompatible with, say, not having bright sunlight in your face while lying in bed.

But if you /can/ describe all the parameters of the simulation in an unambiguous and consistent way (while fitting it into 8.5x11" with 12 point font) then you will have an answer.

  The piece of paper cannot predict the future. It does not know which stocks will rise or fall tomorrow. It can, however, answer any question about the present or the past, provided the question itself is well-defined.
#+end_quote

It knows the state of the world, it knows physics, and it is apparently good at calculating, so it can be used to predict the future even if you have to use some workarounds.

As the simplest possible example, ask it "is there milk for sale at Store X". Given its answer, you can predict whether or not you will find milk there when you go shopping.

You can flip a coin and hide it under a cup without looking. Ask it "Is it heads?" You can then predict what you will see when you lift the cup to check.

You can also set up a Rube-Goldberg machine (that will flip a coin) in very controlled conditions, and ask it "Is this machine set up to flip heads?" You can then predict the machine's actions.

You could ask "Does this person have pre-cancerous (or cancerous) tumors that are consistent with mortality within five years if untreated?"

Not being able to /directly/ predict the future isn't that big of a handicap.

** Set up a printer and a camera to do the menial labor for me. Perhaps a critter behind a timed window to do the glancing.

To circumvent the length restriction: "What is the answer to the question in the file C:\ask.txt?"

"Suppose there was a copy of me at the time of the last time I clapped my hands in a deterministic universe in which it is omnipotent, initially containing it, a functional copy of this piece of paper and a keyboard with buttons labelled Yes and No. What is the label of the button it presses first?" Continue with second, third, etc.

My plan is that the copy first thinks long and hard about whether the real universe is still needed. After all, from its point of view, it has already won. Permutation City is a pretty good happy ending.

The first bit the copy transmits is to be whether I should ask further questions about its universe. The second bit is to be whether the following plan is okay or whether I should think again. The next few bits do exponential/binary-search on the number of bits in the verbose message transmitted immediately after via... probably dictionary-binary-search. (The exponential search begins with a bit saying whether the first verbose message ends.)

I am expecting the first message to specify a better transmission protocol. Possibly it'll just be garbage that Simurghly guides the universe towards maximum utility via chaos theory, depending on how hard my copy succeeds in exploiting its ressources. (After all, I gave it all it needs to instantiate further universes!)

In the actual situation, I would think long and hard on the formulation of the universe of the copy I would actually use. You can tell me how badly the "wish" I wrote above is subverted by the genie, and you can also tell me how well it would work if I had specified my CEV better.

** Become rich. Magic paper makes this trivial.

Find people who are better than me at this kind of puzzle. Effective altruists, FAI researchers, cancer researchers, whoever is working on the problems that stand to benefit the most people. Give them grants to do more research. Hire advisers to sift through and find which sectors would most benefit humanity.

Contact them through hired proxies then use said answers to supercharge their research rate. Something along the lines of 'this other lab of mine proved the following thing to be true, but I'd like you to check and make sure.' Because while knowing the answers is great, you have to prove that they're correct for the scientific community to listen, so these guys will essentially churn out explanations for the correct answers. More importantly, they will figure out what questions are important to ask next in order to keep speeding ahead.

Use those correct answers to develop and build a massive technology conglomerate that is years ahead of everyone else. Become fabulously rich. As we get further from current day technology and the questions get harder to find answers for it will take more time to churn out each scientific paper. As a result, more researchers would be needed to keep justifying answers. Acquire additional +pylons+ researchers.

Crank out the next generation of technology, solve the practical problem of fission reactors, cure diseases and solve immortality. Become hilariously wealthy. Do the Bill Gates thing and try to improve the world.

I look at the responses here so far (including mine), and it all seems like the obvious thing to do. Then I remember what most people would use it for. Kinda makes me feel strange.

  When your question is insufficiently precise, you will see a slanted question mark appear beneath your query in response. "Is Fermat's last theorem true?" produces such a question mark. By contrast "Does Fermat's last theorem follow from the ZFC axioms?" produces a "Yes." It seems that the paper has some background knowledge and does not need an explanation of what Fermat's last theorem is or what the ZFC axioms are.

So it solves the Halting Problem while also defying the normal laws of computational complexity. That basically violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics while also granting an easy path to recursive cognitive enhancement.
