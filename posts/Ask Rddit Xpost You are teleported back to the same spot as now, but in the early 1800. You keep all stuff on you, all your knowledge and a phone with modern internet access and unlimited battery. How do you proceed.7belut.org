On the other hand, you probably only get a few amps at no more than 24 volts, and try as you might, you can't get any more. Yes it's free, but you could get more with a pedal powered generator.

why not? I'm a futurist. I believe if we can jump start the race for strong AI and I can set humanist foundations for it by counteracting the puritan regression and anti-intellectualism that took hold around that time, we'd be seeing a post-scarcity world much sooner.

Even from a purely selfish standpoint, the above would help put me in a position of relative power and luxury.

If you want to jumpstart the AI revolution, your best bet will be to cross your fingers and hope you aren't in a separate timeline. Using your internet access, set up a communication loop with the future, and use the loop to brute force solutions to difficult problems. Like the FAI one. Eventually you'll want to solve the time-travel problem, too, and then you're laughing.

Without time-travel hacks, you'll be able to uplift to early-mid 21st century technology, at best. In this case, your best bet will be to figure out how the phone is communicating with the internet: it's either technological or magical, and either one means hacks.

And to be fair, figuring out how the unlimited battery works could also mean hacks.

******* Yes... I am aware of the difficulties. The large solution space is why paradoxes in closed time-like loops are (probably) guaranteed to be impossible. Nevertheless, I suspect it would be fairly easy to implement solutions for difficult-to-solve/easy-to-prove style problems. Perhaps AI doesn't fall into this category, but as you leverage the loop to solve successively more difficult problems, you may end up in a slow-takeoff scenario. I still think it's the best bet if you want to beat current technology.

I'm referring to the second Great Awakening and Restoration in the US ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity_in_the_United_States#19th_century]]) that undid a lot of the skeptical and rational culture changes that were underway across europe and the colonies ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment]]).

Jefferson and other intellectuals of the time were Deists, for instance, and there was a broad support for science and rationality around the turn of the century that was slowly pushed back by growing anti-intellectual Christian movements. However, care would need to be taken that the Abolitionist origins in many faith circles weren't snuffed out along with the evangelicism.

I will also be mistaken for Jewish, which is not illegal in Spanish territory at this time but not convenient. Travel will be difficult.

My best bet is probably to jump-start the Gold Rush. If I can find maps of the biggest deposits/the areas owned by those who made the most money, I can probably do reasonably well and get infrastructure flowing in. Unfortunately this would probably also produce war and totally upend the political history of North America, since war with Spain in the 1810s would probably make the history of Mexico completely different, and possibly derail Manifest Destiny and the political unity of the USA, so the Civil War might not happen. On the plus side, this means that I would have a comparatively early way to check Wikipedia and see if my effects on the future are changing the internet I see.

** When you start out, that phone will be the single most valuable object on Earth. You're going to want to keep it secret until you're powerful enough to protect it. Never take it out unless you're alone, preferably at night, with no chance of anyone walking in on you looking into a mysterious light square. You'll be doing a /lot/ of nighttime reading.

You probably don't have any 1800s dollars on you, so first thing would probably be to work a few hours washing dishes or sweeping floors. Once you have a seed, it's off to whichever racetracks have the best historical records in the area. Gotta move around a lot and start small so nobody clues in to the fact that you're a time traveler.

Now that you have a little nest egg built up, start investing. Just like before, spread your investments out and go through middlemen. At this point you should probably hire bodyguards, you're going to get rich fast.

Once you've backed the inventors of the steam engine, cotton gin, lightbulb, etc. (or maybe invented one or two of these yourself, if you like crafts) you'll be firmly set up as a magnate and power player in your city. Now you can start looking at historical USGS data and buying up parcels of land with valuable deposits. Stay away from oil, it won't be valuable for long.

Congratulations, your name is now spoken in the same sentences as Rothschild and Vanderbilt! You can start your own mining/manufacturing industry now. I recommend starting with solar power and communications. Tesla won't come around for another few decades, so you can shamelessly steal the idea of the electric car, and make sure it takes this time.

It should only take a few years for you to become Earth's wealthiest and most-loved individual. Quality of life has skyrocketed thanks to you, and this 'internet' thing is so much fun! Appoint your most trusted advisers to run your factories and server farms, it's time to go stop colonialism.

Regrettably, the British East India Company already has its hooks in the subcontinent, but the real damage hasn't yet begun. Buy the Company. Research where the most valuable tea, ink, silk, etc. come from, go make fair trade deals with those populations.

You'll have to do a lot of micromanaging in Europe to make sure they don't sink their teeth into India and Africa. You could do this by going to those places and giving them the technology to fend off incursion, but the whole point is to let them develop on their own, so maybe just give them medical technology and outbid anyone who wants to set up trade. Up to you and how valuable you think Western ideals are. Definitely give everyone solar and comms.

The greatest catastrophes of the 19th century have been averted and you're by far the most powerful human alive, so now you can do pretty much what you like. You might kill Hitler's parents, but we're approaching a post-scarcity society, so Communism probably never arises for the National Socialists to fight. It might be fun to start the UN a century earlier and then try to unify the world under your rule, but that's a lot of responsibility, and things are going pretty smoothly worldwide at this point. Honestly I recommend appointing someone to do that while you build Xanadu and work on making sure your favorite authors and artists are born (and if not, on recreating their masterworks).

You've given humanity a 200-year shortcut, minus all the pollution and exploitation! Regrettably this doesn't give you immortality, but put your best medical researchers and CS folks on the case. You for sure have access to the best medical technology around, so pump your labs full of cash and hope 2 centuries was enough of a boost.

Then I would try to get a place to stay and a job, or figure out how to get at least food and water.

Depending on the situation impressing someone which my magic glowing rectangle that only I can use can be a good idea or a terrible one depending on cirscunstance .

Once I have time and safety ask on the internet for ideas of what to do disguised as hypothetical scenarios,( maybe say that in writing a story about a time traveler to the 1800 and ask people for ideas and info to make it more realistic).

My phone gives me insane math superpowers , so figure out how munch of my awesome computing power I can let people know and what kinds of jobs I can get whith that( I'm actually really interested in that , maybe I'll propose a similar thing but whith only a calculator and no memories of future tech in the next Saturday munchkinism thread ).

I live in Spain so I'll have to ensure I leave the country in a few years.

I'll investigate what happened to me in my original timeline to search for clues.

It would be awesome if I could prove that I time traveled to the people of my time and therefore get help from a ton of experts , but it's unlikely that I will be able to convince people.But convincing people from the year 1800 is easier given that I don't lose mi phone.

Realistically it won't really change much because of the lack of infrastructure.

The first British settlers come in 1830 so I'll probably still be alive when that happens. That'll be trippy for them. I'll offer some suggestions.

See if I can meet up with a scientist who has access to industrial methods and work out how to accellerate technology.

Realistically though I guess my main hope is for an idyllic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which I know is far from actually existed in reality. With some googling I might have access to some climate records from 1800s and be able to predict droughts and stuff, maybe.

** I get whatever work I can, live life quietly and try to avoid getting lynched or something (black). I get married and have kids and tell them my story along with where to find me in 2017. They tell their kids and so on until that version of me receives a letter from me telling him to seriously arm up the day of the time jump.

2nd me comes back seconds after I got there seriously armed and while I'm impressed, I become somewhat used to it as more me's start pouring in with weapons, food, and various materials, basically stuff previous versions of me realized we can't replicate even with smartphone research. Eventually more meds stop showing up. Changing the future as much as we're going to means I'm probably not born in this universe.

My army of me sets up camp near an area we can mine for precious metals (smartphone research) and sends out squads to rescue slaves and bring them to my little proto-country. They'll be free citizens but they'll have to swear allegiance to the grand council of Me's. We're friendly enough but we're also basically a Me-worshipping cult. Better than being slaves though right? With the added labor of folks with actual farming experience, the money we can make from mining, and our overwhelming military might, the U.S. has no choice but to let us keep one of their states as our own separate country. A few groups of me stay in America as citizens. They bet on pretty much anything they can research and start businesses/ investing in profitable businesses. Eventually their families get rich enough to bribe politicians and sometime in the mid to late 1900s the U.S. cedes more land/territories to its newest and most terrifying ally.

After that, the focus is bringing all of our resources to bear to find the source of my one-time time jump in the first place. Assuming that can be accomplished, we send squads of indoctrinated citizen-soldiers led by versions of me (plucked from the 1800s) back to different points in time to sew themselves into various seats of power. The me's won't be at the forefront for obvious reasons, but I only trust myself to keep my cult in line.

By 2017 every world leader has agreed to make me (whichever members of the collective got to make it back to the future) their God-Kings and we mostly just use the power to park free and impress hot chicks at bars.

If that was true, then I would not be able to connect to the internet if my computer clock was set wrong.

A brief experiment shows that setting my computer clock wrong still allows me to connect to the internet.

*** Your phone gets its time through either GPS or by NTP. GPS presumably won't work because of the lack of satellites, and if it does work then you're not picking up the /local/ time. NTP (Network Time Protocol) works over the internet, so it's also getting the time from the future you came from.

In neither case will you have any issues with the time setting on your phone causing certificates to be invalid. The only reason you'd have problems is if you set the phone time manually to the local time.

No, not really. TCP/IP and HTTP do pretty much all of it. The only HTTP header a client must provide is /Host/. The server will generally reply with a /Date/ header, but that's hardly a deal-breaker. TCP, on the other hand, is more concerned with sequencing, and IP only cares about source and destination.

Really? Of all the things you could achieve, that's your #1 priority?

I mean, you only have to wait a few decades for him to be shot in jail /anyway/...

You wouldn't rather, say, rearrange relationships to alter /Hitler's/ family tree? Or take steps to reduce the death toll from the US civil war? Massively expand the body of medical knowledge? Or, if you're more self-interested, you should easily be able to find enough gold seams, buried treasure, etc, to set yourself up for life.

**** It's not the best thing I could do (not my "#1 priority"), but due to personal experience it's the first thing I thought of. Joseph Smith Jr. was born in 1806 and died in 1844, but the religion he founded ruins lives to this day. Pop over to [[/r/exmormon][r/exmormon]] to see what I'm talking about.

I've thought of the discussion prompt on my own many times (except I usually imagine an earlier date and a solar powered laptop with wikipedia downloaded to it) and have wanted to see some rational fiction about it. It's the reason I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1/Saruman-of-many-Devices][Saruman of many Devices]] dispite having no interest in guns. I also really liked the lecture at the end of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/74/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 74 of Mother of Learning]] where Silverlake points out how modern industry relies on an entire society of infrastructure.

I think I would focus on advancing human knowledge via publishing. I'd allow others to build infrastructure based on the things I publish. I'd focus first on advancing medical knowledge.

What's the most efficient way to get to the stage of mass publishing?

What would happen if people learned about the risks of overpopulation and climate change part way through the industrial revolution (1760 - 1840)?

I'm sorry to hear that; it sounds like there's a sad story there.

I doubt that whatever happened is Joseph Smith's personal fault, though, in the way that millions of deaths can be laid at Hitler's feet. And the Smiths would be already married by then, so you'd be hard pressed to intervene nonviolently; tweaking Hitler's ancestry would likely be simpler.

Also, the existence of disgruntled people who leave is far from sufficient proof that an organisation is a blight on humanity worthy of being erased from time. If there are people who get upset and leave the Democratic party, should we therefore go back a few years more and erase Andrew Jackson? More likely the mistakes and problems are being made by a few people in this century.

The printing press was already around long before the 1800s, but you could certainly add a lot to what was being printed. Shouldn't be too hard to make enough money to pay for it.

** If this happens at this moment, I'd at least have one pair of socks, gloves, a hoody. Given the time of year and accounting for climate change... probably get frostbite and lose my extremely useful fingers in short order (they're really cheap gloves), or toes, since I'm not currently wearing warm shoes. Also, been trying to run a calorie deficit for a few days, and am already kinda thirsty, so if the cold wouldn't get me, dehydration and starvation probably would.

Assuming that this happens instead on my way home from a holiday feast, the first thing to do is to use the magical internet connection to get someone on video call, stat. It's dangerous to go alone. If the internet connection has limitations that prevent calls, then I'd have to focus on finding a way to survive the winter and find safe food/water. There might be some people within 100km, but I wouldn't rely on it, or with meeting them going well. If all of that works out, I'd either wait for a sunny day, or use my phone's compass, and head in the general direction of the Mississippi River. With the absence of reliable roadways, food, etc, this will almost certainly take several times as long as it should. I think 2mph would be optimistic under these conditions, so let's assume we're looking at a week or so. Assuming /all/ of that works out, follow the river until I find someone I can communicate with. (Also, try to reduce the odds of losing the phone, or having it easily stolen during the "umm, hi?" phase of contact.)

Odds are, the first people I'd be able to communicate with would speak French, and while I speak some, understanding native speakers is another matter entirely. I'd be hard pressed to keep the phone a secret, so it'd almost certainly be stolen at some point, and I'm pretty much doomed thence forth. My best hope would probably be running into a genuinely virtuous, charitable, bilingual person with sufficient resources to have my back long enough to get back to action. Since such people are hard to find and harder to recognize, and we've already required /way/ more than 3 things to go right, It's probably safe to assume me=doomed.

But assuming that /all/ of that /extremely convenient/ stuff works out, I suppose I'd try to play the "no seriously Siri is not a demon... OK, I'm sure there's a seal of Solomon here somewhere..." game until the Louisiana Purchase shakes things up. If I haven't gone beyond someone's pet oracle by that point, "i'd sell information to whichever US explorer/diplomat/merchant will buy. I miiight need to find a way to disincentivize people from screwing me over, but I'm not sure how to leverage what I can get from the internet to accomplish this. Credible oracles really oughtn't make a habit of lies and deception, and we're talking people who would not be sufficiently impressed by predicting earthquakes and hurricanes. I think I /can/ make the phone effectively useless to anyone who would try to steal it, other than the most methodical investigators (If it's an iPhone, screen curtain and voiceover at the highest speed I can understand is enough to lock out most moderns). However, I really /should/ plan for the possibility of my death (what with the terrible medical system and me being the bottleneck for rapid improvement), so I probably would need to teach someone how to use it. And I think I'm bad enough at people that I really struggle to keep up even these best case predictions.

Oh, and try very hard not to contract smallpox, cholera, dysentery, malaria, yellow fever, or siffolus. Like, I'd need to focus on pushing medical advancement very quickly, just as a matter of self preservation. The mosquitos are bad enough /without/ the ability to kill you. ... Ugh, and I just realized all the wonderful biting arthropods I'd have to hike through. If I get warning before this trip, most of my equipment will have to be a ton of granola bars, oranges, and bug repellant. Oh, and V8s. There goes my entire backpack.

(P.S. need to work on my Japanese and put my phone in Japanese. You know, for security.)
