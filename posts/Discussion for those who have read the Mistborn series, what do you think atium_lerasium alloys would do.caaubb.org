I've released the first three chapters of a Mistborn fanfiction and would like to explore the alloyed versions of the God Metals, atium and lerasium.

Atium alloyed with gold gets the so-called eleventh metal, malatium. Gold lets a Misting or Mistborn see a version of their own past self, while malatium lets them see a version of another person's past self.

Since atium's unalloyed ability is to see the near future of anyone nearby and perfectly react to their actions, my tentative hypothesis is that its base function is to swap a metal's application from self to other or vice versa.

For example: pewter and atium would allow someone to somehow empower another with strength, stamina, healthing, the whole brute package, while steel and atium might change the point of reference for metals that can be Pushed from self to another person.

Thoughts? Especially for lerasium, I don't really have any good ideas for that.


** I'm pretty sure that Brandon Sanderson has said that an alloy of Lerasium would change someone into that kind of misting, just as Lerasium changes someone into a full mistborn. (Spoilers for the end of Well of Ascension)

*** From what we know, that's only for people who aren't actually Mistborn/Mistings. Lerasium burns differently for people who aren't Mistborn and for those who aren't.

At it's base, Lerasium forges a connection between burner and Preservation. Mistborns burning it increase their power. And if the person using it knows what they're doing, they can rewrite their Spiritual DNA as they wish basically.

** It's been a while since I read them, but I'm not sure the alloys work that way. You can't alloy iron with, say, copper or tin to get a new effect AFAIK. The alloys also appear to work in opposites, so steel/iron push/pull, copper/bronze conceal/reveal, etc. Atium looks forward and malatium looks backwards.

Are you aware of the 17th shard website? They might be have more in depth information for you. Also [[/r/cosmere]] is a good place to ask questions. There might be Words of Brandon (WoBs) about the subject, I think the 17th shard also archives them, or maybe that's the coppermind website?

Will you post your fanfic here when you're done? I'd be interested in reading it.

*** Hi, I got my information from here: [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Metallic_Arts#cite_note-Arcanum-5971-7]]

Word of Brandon Sanderson says that God Metals such as atium can be alloyed with other common metals---in fact, that's the source of the eleventh metal, malatium, and that alloying atium with other metals would have other undiscovered effects.

And sure, right now I have it hosted here as a crossover of Worm, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mistworm-worm-mistborn.766090/][Mistworm]].

**** How would Hemalurgy work in the Worm universe? It could be extremely powerful or extremely weak depending on what powers it works on. I mean, on Scadrial, a fullborn would have limited use for it, just a heightening of powers rather than a transfer. If investiture is the source of Worm hero powers, then I suppose it would have use if the protagonist can actually follow through.

Anyhow, I'm intrigued, and I it would make me happy if you posted updates here.

***** I'm assuming the the Entities in Worm are Shard-equivalents, with Scion translating into atium and Eden as lerasium. Lerasium Hemalurgically steals /all abilities/, which I'm taking to mean all /natural human/ abilities. I'm assuming this is what the Lord Ruler had as his unknown Hemalurgic spikes. Meanwhile an atium spike can steal literally any power and better than any normal spike, which is useful no matter how you slice it. I'm also going to say that certain powers can be stolen by normal Hemalurgic spikes.

And thanks, I'll make a top-level post about the story then. :)

We don't know what his atium armbands were actually filled with either. Atium is a wildcard and can hold any power, but there's no information that I can find on what they actually held.

** I think it's probably best to disregard canon malatium in systematizing atium alloys. For Doylist reasons its effects had to be a much closer mirror of gold than the systematic Watsonian understanding would imply; The Final Empire's plot wouldn't work otherwise. So given that, rely mainly on "[Atium's] alloys grant various expanded mental and temporal effects when burned."

I'm going to write my ideas for each in repl(y/ies) to this comment. (Each sentence in those ideas is meant to represent a distinct possibility for what it could do.)

** Coppermind says that Atium alloys create expanded metal and temporal effects.

With pewter then for instance, rather then giving someone else power I think it'd give you the capacity to use strength to maximum effect, like seeing physical weakpoints or straight up letting you see how much damage you'd cause.

Atium+Tin would let you see all the consequences of your actions before you take them

Atium + Steel/Iron could cause delayed pulls and pushes

now, Lerasium on the other hand seems to be about Connections, so maybe it could be the one that changes the target from self to someone else?

Atium accompanied by a duralumin burst actually does exactly that, so I'm thinking tin would be something different.

*** Harmonium or [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ettmetal][Ettmetal]] is the canon combination of atium and lerasium after the Catacendre. You're correct that it's incredibly reactive with water and is used to create enormous bombs. As a result, it's horribly difficult to use Hemalurgically since contact with blood will just make an explosion, but Sanderson says that is can theoretically be done. When a Metallic Art is used near Ettmetal, the same effect occurs from the Ettmetal, slowly using it up. You can somehow regulate its effects to create airships, but it's not explained how.
