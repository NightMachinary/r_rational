Recently I caught up to the latest chapter of [[https://m.webnovel.com/book/14064812306272705][Nanomancer Reborn]] and I wanted some opinions on whether people think this story is a hidden gem or just another tropy fantasy novel.

The main character is very OP like the protagonist of “I'm a spider so what?” And that slime anime. It also has a cliche revenge plot, Despite that the story doesn't solely focus on the xianzia style main plot and spends plenty of time giving the side characters their due.


** I like main character's traits. She is ruthless and rational in a dog eat dog world on the other side loves and trusts her friends, have a bottom line with a little sense of justice. But other characters are there just to be there, they have little personality and impact. I still don't understand why she is sticking with them. Story is predictable if summarized MC just steamrolls everything while carrying her teammates. This novel is still a good read to pass time.
