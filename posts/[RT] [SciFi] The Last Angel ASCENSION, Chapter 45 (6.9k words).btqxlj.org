** Haven't read this, I see it's a sequel. What's The Last Angel about? Rational Space Opera?

*** The last angel is about an AI built by humans that survived after they were all killed by aliens. It's still mad and is fighting a 2000 year long, one ship war.

IMO it's a bit slow paced, with lots of flashbacks and perspectives from all the different sides. But there's also a lot of [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]] to it.

**** Thanks. I gave it a shot but did end up dropping it. All the aliens acting human was one of the things that bothered me.

*** It's the /start/ of the finale.

From the top of the latest chapter:

#+begin_quote
  And here, after 44 chapters of build-up, everything will be hitting the fan.

  The next few chapters are probably going to be HUEG LIEK WHOA so to make things easier on myself and a (hopefully) consistent update schedule, I'll more than likely be posting them in halves.

**** This looks great!

I had NEVER seen this before - and it looks so useful.

​

Saving the [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] works as html then going in and grabbing the text is a bit of a PITA to be honest... Or even editing the stuff so the links work for local copies. This is SO much better!

​

​

ALSO - The list of supported sites really does give some great ideas for new material to read...

***** For fanfiction.net I would actually suggest ff2ebook.com over anything else! It even caches stuff so if a story is deleted you can still download it.

Glad to help.

** u/Nimelennar:
#+begin_quote
  If we miss this opportunity, it will be months or years before we have it again. The next time we bring the Wound's forces to battle, we won't be facing drones and skirmishers. She and the Echo will be restored.”
#+end_quote

[Switch perspective to show that the opportunity has already been missed, that Red and Echo are already restored, and that the Compact won't just be facing drones and skirmishers]

I imagine at least one "Oh, SHIT!" moment forthcoming (or, more likely, a series of them).

--------------

On another note, I wonder where they got the Kaiju hull to use as a decoy for Echo. Was it built from scratch, salvaged from the wrecks of the multiple Chariots that Red has wrecked over the centuries, or just plain stolen by Red somehow?
