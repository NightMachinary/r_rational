There's this saga named Tales of the Continuing Time by Daniel Keys Moran.

​

It's kind of difficult to TL;DR it, but it has pretty much every SF trope: cyborgs, metahumans, body augmentation, etc. Amazingly, it touched on themes of internet addiction and portable connectivity a long time before both where a thing.

​

The thing is, there's this secondary character in the first book, but main character in books 2 and 4, that is characterized for mostly being the most normal(ish) of the different main characters, and the one that tries to be the out of the box thinking guy. He is the most relatable character in the whole series, and even though I read it a long time ago it just occured to me that he might be an example of a rational character, or at least a prototype of that.

​

I highly recommend the series if you are ok with not being spoonfed every single detail of a sprawling world, the sad part is that the overall story is still incomplete (and will probably remain that way). Even so, read the first 2 books, and if you enjoyed them, plough through the 3rd one (the weakest one) to understand the 4th completely.

​

I'm looking forward to your thoughts on Trent!

You misspelled the name of the series. It's not Tales of the Continuum Time, it's [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYQBBZD/ref=series_rw_dp_sw][Tales of the Continuing Time]]/./

** Probably not. The series is a personal favorite from my youth, but there's a lot of destiny weirdness going on with the two dueling time traveling posthumans (I need to look and see if this is an influence for the cosmere and dragonsteel though).

** He always struck me as rational, but I'm biased. :-)
