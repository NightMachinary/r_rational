** Great chapter! You've been doing the gym battles very well. The psychic stuff is really cool too, it takes a lot of work to rationalize that stuff but you've been nailing it so far. If I may make a suggestion, is there a way to include more scientific examinations of the pokemon? Like the ones the pokedex did in the first couple of chapters. I feel like it adds to the world building and gives you an idea of how this pokemon actually functions in a rational environment. However I'm not a writer, so perhaps there's a good reason for not having it that I'm missing.

I still think you're wrong on the age front though :P These mofos were CLEARLY written as 16 year-olds and you can't tell me otherwise!

Well of course I have! Actually I've been meaning to make an askhistorians post concerning it; The only cultures I know of that have anything close to that level of initiation (there's an African tribe that makes you kill a lion, and I guess the bullet ant stuff in the Amazon compares) but I'm pretty sure even those examples aren't until the kid is like 15. But I'm sure there are some I'm missing, do you have better examples? Particularly in less primitive societies?

And I don't think having all three kids be exceptionally smart explains why they act exceptionally mature. Which then begs the question; these are three of the smartest kids you can find and they almost died like 6 times before they got to the second gym, and we constantly see full grown trainers and even Rangers get killed rather often by the insanely harsh environment. How the hell are the /other/ twelve year olds surviving at all? From the rest of the context, I just don't see how we could expect normal groups of 12 year olds to make it back from such a dangerous trip.

Sparta began training of its soldiers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_army][at the age of 7]], which is a bit extreme, but the Ottoman Empire also began force-drafting child soldiers into their Janissary corps who were [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries#Characteristics][an average age of 13.]]

Also, let's not forget about modern times, where there are still warlords going around enslaving and using child soldiers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children#Uganda_2][in wartorn countries.]]

Well, a lot of them don't XD But it should be noted that not everyone goes out on their journey at such a young age. Most don't go until they're older, and while I'm trying to rationalize the main characters of the Pokemon games being sent out so young, I definitely am ignoring the idea that most trainers start so young, let alone even younger.

It should be noted that the Janissary corps were slaves iirc. So it wouldn't really be that similar, they honestly had more relation to the Pokemon (battle slaves) in your story than the trainers. This also applies to your warlord example; having your child fight early is a LOT different from having your slave fight early.

There's also the point where more advanced societies tend to have later "coming of age" rituals most likely due to longer life expectancy. I highly doubt there are going to be any examples of this in a civilized country.

And the Spartan thing seems more rigorous but a lot less deadly. Unless they are making these 7 year olds fight wolves on a daily basis, I'm not sure it really compares. It would compare closer to the thing where they kill the deformed babies.

******* True, other than the Spartans it is generally something reserved for kids deemed as "disposable" by their respective societies. I guess I'm thinking of it more as "acts of a desperate society that needs lots of competent trainers to survive" lowering their inhibitions of what age children should be exposed to danger, which sort of just carried through into the "modern times" of the pokemon world.

** Hey everyone, welcome back! Three things of note: first off, I published the first chapter of my new original fiction story, [[http://daystareld.com/guardian-1/][Guardian!]] You can find it on my website under Stories. It's an original fiction with an urban fantasy setting that I'm hoping to eventually publish as a YA novel, and I'm looking forward to any feedback!

Second, we've got a new sponsor on my podcast, Rationally Writing, with a special offer! If you're behind on listening or haven't checked the podcast out before, now might be a good time to check out the latest episodes and potentially get a discount on an neat service before the promotion ends!

Finally, I've re-included into this chapter the section from Bill's previous one that I took out after feedback. I'm much happier with its inclusion in the story now, and look forward to feedback on whether others agree.

Enjoy the chapter, and thanks for reading!

** Not that this was poorly done, but it does get a little tiring to see the same set of applause lights in every rational fic.

If I had a dollar for every time a rational fic reminded me that cryonics is totally a thing everyone should be doing or that artificial intelligence is the ultimate end solution to all of society's problems I bet I could have saved like 3.897x10^{14} lives by effectively donating it to a high impact charity.

If you're intending to reach an audience of people that have never heard of these concepts, fine, but in that case this feels pretty rushed for Red to go from a kid born and raised in a world with a strong taboo around the idea of storing people in pokeballs to a sudden and fully accepting understanding of the idea and its implications.

The way this is written it feels like you expect the audience to be at least passingly familiar with the idea of cryonics, mind uploads, or other methods of suspending death, and if that's the audience you're writing for, I'd like to have seen your take on either how best to move the needle on public opinion or a character with a stong and well reasoned argument against death suspension.

As it stands, this mostly feels like a self-congratulatory parable where-in one of the rationalist communities sacred cows is reaffirmed by having our "smart kid" protagonist see the obvious righteousness of it.

I feel like this has come off more mean-spirited than I intended, but also less contemptuous than I would be if I were reading a story where the token smart character had a sudden insight into the obvious righteousness of keeping your kids unvaccinated or that no one needs to die because Jesus saves all who ask for it.

*** I can totally understand the frustration of seeing the same ideas mentioned over and over, but let me try and explain the intention without defending the writing itself (which no doubt can be improved to better explain/convey things, and hopefully will upon future edits):

First, Red grew up in a society that taboos it, but he's never been on board with that taboo. As mentioned early on (probably too early on for most people to remember, considering the glacial pace of the story) Red has thought of tons of advantages to human storage before, and always wondered what would happen if society moved past its taboo.

As for understanding the implications, I don't think it's that hard a leap to make for someone who's very pro-science: you could even call it a /naive/ belief that medicine and technology will just keep advancing to the point of utopia, and many people do call it that, but for someone who thinks that, the idea that this utopia might also include undoing the damage of human storage and even near-death should be easy to believe, once pointed out explicitly.

Also, he's still young, however smart he is. I don't know how much time you spend around children, but I've found them very receptive to new-amazing-technology ideas. I recently talked to one about CRISPR and they were already thinking of all the things that someone who optimistically studies the future of the field would hope for, just off the mix of imagination and optimism :)

Finally, as for it being a sacred cow, I can only say that I personally am not signed up for cryonics, and have no plan to unless the price drops significantly or the probability of success goes up considerably. I do, however, think that if you could do it for practically free, as someone in the pokemon world can, there aren't many arguments that make sense against it besides the spiritual/death-positive ones that are pretty unapplicable to someone like Red.

If you have some better counter arguments though, I'm always happy to be exposed to new things or ideas I haven't thought of for the story!

Interesting you should say that, because I was going to say that if I were to complain about anything it's that you present a fantastic metaphor creping up on Space Whale Aesop to present cryonics as obviously a no-brainer while in reality it's more of a Pascal's Wager, considering the effort involved for dubious benefit, especially outside of America. I guess I'm not the target audience, because if it /was/ that simple, I /would/ have signed up already, I have no conceptual objection, so I perceive a misrepresentation of the debate because you removed from the picture the only significant issue I have with cryonics: practical (un)feasibility.

**** Those a good points - I do recall the early segments with Red discussing or thinking about human storage in pokeballs, so points for laying the groundwork there.

And, also fair point regarding youthful optimism. You don't really start digging into how ideas become implemented and why it takes decades for things to go from conception to reality until you're becoming a professional.

I will still call it a missed opportunity that Bill somewhat handwaves the process as requiring only a public awareness campaign and some social shifts, but you've also done a good job of his characterization that makes me understand why he's not the person for that. Giovanni or even Oak maybe, but it would feel weird for Bill to go from tech nerd living on the cutting edge to socio-political operative seeking to influence society on a grand scale, a la Harry/Hermoine in Significant Digits.

It also surprises me that Bill's live preservation program is tied to his house AI rather than an intelligent pokemon, like Alakazam, a trained Chansey nurse, or just another person who could travel with him to enable him to leave the house more regularly. If he's willing to travel to conferences, etc. I expect he's got an emergency teleport protocol, but I'm wondering what exactly his protocol with Eva is.

Chansey nurses are only a thing in the anime, where they'er as intelligent as people. /Maybe/ he could train an alakazam to, upon being released while his life is at risk, take a container ball, release its box, put Bill's body in the box, return the box to the ball, then teleport back to Bill's lab... then take the container box out again, maybe, and Eva takes over from there? Meanwhile there's now a loose alakazam in his lab. Also he has to hope that no one else is around while all that happened to see and stop his alakzam from doing all that.

I'll think it over, but probably easier to just make sure he stays home, and if he does leave, just teleports back as needed :)

*** Fanfiction is usually copyright violation unless you can successfully argue that it qualifies for fair use. In this case, the parody defense would probably be on the most solid footing, but I think it would fail in court, and in any case, the legal battle wouldn't be worth it except on general principle.

That said, there are two arguments against advertisement. The first is that one of the four factors for fair use is whether or not the work is commercial in nature, which means that in the event of a lawsuit it's better for the work to be free. The second argument is that you're more likely to get sued if there's monetization; there are thousands of fanfics of Pokemon, almost none of which have had lawsuits (or cease and desists) filed against them, but the ones that /have/ had legal action are much more likely to be the ones that are more of a threat in one way or another.

** So, something I've been thinking about for a while: why don't pokemon store matter the same way pokeballs do? Apparently there are berries and nuts that can do something like that in this universe already, so it'd be weird if in this universe this 'turn matter into magical energy' evolved thing /and/ also all the weirdness of pokemon evolved with no relation between the two at all.

Here are all the things it could explain:

1. Why pokemon can do such energy intensive things. Their cells have been built from the ground up to use this phenomenon in various ways. They can store much more ATP, water, glocose, etc, and not pay a penalty in size and complexity. This enables them from the get-go to be much hardier and stronger.

2. Water Pokemon. We assume that storing is easy, but retrieving things while preserving structure is hard. Thus it's possible to have cell-level machinery to store limited amounts of molecular substances without caring about orientation or internal structure beyond the molecular. It's not then hard to imagine why the easiest specialized machinery for storing very large quantities of matter would be most successful with one of the simplest molecules, H2O.

3. Ditto. Most of the raw materials of its cells are kept in a stored state, leaving very little crucial material in its physical form, mostly specialized towards spooling out stored materials into various physical forms, then returning it as needed. If you further reflect that Mew is the most recent ancestor of all pokemon, and it had the move transform, it's pretty clear Ditto is just a result of neoteny.

4. Most other Pokemon. Trivial. Left as an exercise for the reader.

5. Why pokeballs only work on pokemon, not humans. The fact that their cells already have a bunch of machinery for pushing most of their raw materials in and out of that state makes things a lot easier.

6. Those nuts. Symbiosis with Beedrill colonies, defending against wild Caterpie. The cell machinery that allows that kind of storage was first introduced by the alien pokerus retrovirus, explaining why they share it in common.

7. Why people don't eat pokemon. Trivial. Left as an exercise to the reader.

Not quite: they're used to make the /casing/ for pokeballs, they don't actually have the properties. I definitely agree that if it were a natural phenomenon it would explain a lot about the world, but they never had the foresight to think of that when designing the world, unfortunately: and humans definitely do eat pokemon, in both the anime and the games, even though they don't make a big deal out of it.

Because it would be dangerous to have large volumes of stored material come abruptly and haphazardly out of cellular storage and into your digestive tract, without biological mechanisms of your own to direct it quickly back /into/ storage?

Hmm, not sure that fits all observations (e.g. death in the wild or the arena without corresponding matter explosions), maybe you had something else in mind. Or maybe you were pulling the author's trick of alluding to more facts than have been specifically determined.

** Speaking about the implications of pokeball-style storage, one thing I've been wondering about is the historical transition to pokeball use in your interpretation of the pokemon world. As dangerous as the modern pokemon world is, it must have been much more so in the pre-pokeball era. The invention of pokeballs and the associated matter storage tech must have been a hugely important moment that transformed human society and the natural pokemon world!

Those that bonded with particularly strong pokemon, or were able to command multiple at a time, tended to become the leaders of villages or warlords.

This is the first time in recent chapters I can remember being unsure about any pokemon. You've been doing this really well. Blue's battle in this chapter certainly provided pokemon type information nicely.

*** To be fair, I think Crimson's one of the more memorable ones, thanks to the little anecdote surrounding its name? I mean, it's definitely not on the level of the starters, but I definitely remembered Crimson better than most of their teams...

Also it would need a comma after "pidgey".

**** Coming back to the context of the story after a while makes it tough. There is no reason not to make it easier for the reader. Knowing the species of the pokemon is pretty key, and having to go look up details about characters is not a good reading experience.

** As much as it freaked Red out, I think Bill's reaction to being probed was just right. He highlighted the danger of such activity when it might be detected, made clear that he was upset about the invasion of privacy, and left Red to stew on it. I expect Bill will forgive him - Red's just starting to learn about his power, after all, and it would be highly surprising if he /never/ made that kind of mistake - but he did an effective job of teaching him an ethical lesson about it. And took the opportunity to conclude the original topic of discussion, unpleasant though it must have been.

*** Yeah, and Bill might be more sensitive to it than most, since he's such a private person with lots of valuable secrets in his head (not that most psychics can actually read people's minds like that, but realistically that would probably be small comfort).
