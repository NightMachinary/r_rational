** How is this even a reasonable ignorance of technology. If assault rifles exist and airplanes exist then the technology gap is absurd to have not been noticed. Also to think that a capitalist republic that got to where it's at by exploiting material resources not trading or invading new lands is absurd(google countries not invaded by Britain). Both sides are developed militarily. They show no signs of pacifism that would lead them away from conquest. The elemental nations should have been conquered a 100 years ago.

My take is that the 'Citizen's Free Republic' (its full name) is something like Meji Japan -- highly xenophobic and isolationist. They've been involved in a war with a nearby country for a long time, mostly because of the other country's aggression. Between those two things neither country spent much time exploring.

**** I'm having trouble suspending my disbelief that in your world you have supersonic strategic bombers, but no enterprising explorer has thought to exploit the natives of the elemental nations for their natural resources. Maybe it could be explained away by saying chakra somehow affects their actions to make them more isolationist?

Though, there's not a lot you can do when thrown into a world where the setting doesn't make sense in the first place.

My assumption at this point is that the Republic literally doesn't know about the EN, that their discovery is very recent -- just in the last few years.

#+end_quote

True, that. And, of course, there's the whole thing about "if the Republic has satellites, why haven't the EN turned up on them?"

The best thing I've come up with so far is "because the Sage set up a muggle-repelling field over the EN". It's feasible, since this is the guy who [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Moon][literally created the moon]] so he certainly had the power levels. I'm not thrilled with it, but this setting is so completely whack that I'm having to buy a lot of plot-hole-filler. The cloak, of course, would be breaking down because it's been a thousand years and it's running out of energy.

I'm still looking for a better answer, but that's the best I've got so far -- the Republic is highly isolationist so they didn't do much boots-on-the-ground or long-range-aerial exploration, there's a lot of naval navigational hazards between here and there to keep ships away, and the magic chakra cloak kept eyes in the sky from spotting the EN.

It would have been simpler had I put the Republic's tech level earlier as I had originally intended, but then I wouldn't be doing the setting that Kishimoto created, which is what I'm trying to rationalize. As you can see, it's non-trivial.

******** Yea, I mean, even as a regular, non-isolationist nation, I'd be wary of trying to colonize a place where the people are faster than sound and throwing around the elements. Shit, depending on the level of religious permeation of the Republic, they could've been stuck in thinking of the EN as a place of demonic men. It's what I'd think if I sent out explorers who either never make it back or come back bearing tales of lightning firing men, or men with blood red eyes that could kill you with a glance.

That goes double if they ever land and encounter a bijuu. Any theocracy worth its salt could use the bijuu's existence to promote their agenda. Just look at us now. There are several places that still buy into voodoo, witchcraft, demon possession, etc. with ZERO evidence. Imagine if you actually had some photos of a giant fox that let off this concentrated aura of malice.

And you can't ignore that they simply may not have been aware of the Elemental Nations for a time, especially if they've been occupied by what's on their own landmass. It's not impossible to believe they simply aren't that developed when it comes to exploration.

I agree with you, in that it's a bit hard to believe, but it's definitely not impossible. I wonder how the American colonies would've fared if they had to deal with super ninjas capable of throwing out fire dragons, instead of spear chucking natives.

You could probably flatten every city and town on earth in less than ten years(lets assume no nuclear weapons).

WWI era tech can decimate the shinobi population. No way are the shinobi even a threat. The American civil war had the gatling gun so they could go toe to toe against the shinobi too. There is no excuse for the elemental nations to be this isolated from advancements in military technology.

Well, it can decimate the civilian population, but do remember that the shinobi have invisibility, supersonic movement on the tactical level, giant fuckoff summoned monsters, unkillable zombies, near infinite effectively free suicide bombers (clones), and massive area of effect damage potential.

While WWI era tech could go through most Genin and lower easily enough, it lacks the strategic reach (other than some Artillery) to effectively deal with even a small team of high-tier ninja. The only halfway decent transportation method available is railroad, which can be outpaced and easily sabotaged by even powerful Genin level ninja, and whose tracks are logistically impossible to be guarded along their entire length.

That's not even including what is now my favorite new way to win a Darwin Award, also known as 'trench warfare against earthbenders'.

Flight is low altitude wood and paper based, and your opponents can breathe seeking fire dragons.

Your best bet is incendiary rounds, except some of your opponents can also breathe lakes of water, so that's out.

It isn't until massive high altitude strategic bombing, long range flight logistics, and effective long range ground transport shows up in WWII that the superiority truly shifts to the Tech side.

On top of that, you can bet that elemental nations would not very readily unite. They had to be convinced of a world ending threat to even work against akatsuki. You can bet that the republic can easily pick at the nations one by one and if necessary, ally themselves with one village or the other to share some spoils of war. That is how the native Americans were conquered anyway.

That's what I'm getting at: You /cannot do that/ at WWI tech levels. WWI required a heavy, *heavy* network of preexisting rail lines built up over years to enable effective logisitics. One of the main reasons for the beginning of the war happening the way it did was because of the need to strike out at Russia before it could mobilize. Those rail lines took decades to build, in areas completely under their own control, and there were large standing armies waiting at the borders. None of that is possible here on a separate landmass. And at WWI tech levels, one water-specialist Jonin can seriously hinder or destroy entire fleets of transport ships (not getting into the crazy logistics on bringing a million strong army over an entire ocean - D Day was over a tiny channel and 1/4th of the men, thirty years later!) - at least submarine level fire, at a time when the early German U-boats had to surface to fire.

You're seriously overestimating turn of the 20th century technology. These are not easy problems to solve.

Also the ships in WWI are well armored(Ironclads existed during the civil war). You can bet that water techniques are gonna have a hard time destroying them. The ships are also better equipped to attack from a distance. One jonin can't really take on dozens and dozens of ships like these.

** I guess you're keeping things around the Wave Arc power levels for this? Speeds ranged from 80~m/s for the Genin up to about 120~ m/s for someone like Zabuza swinging his sword.

By contrast, Gaara's sand shuriken are mach 14~ and things only scale massively up from there are the series progresses (4-5 digit mach at the end)

It's worth noting that Zabuza (and thus scalable to Jounin if sticking to wave arc power levels) displayed durability enough to be completely bullet proof. Ballparking somewhere between a building to a city block level explosive to outright kill them without looking up specific feats. Again, this goes through massive powerscaling as the series progresses (multi-city block for Gambunta and high+ tiers in the chuunin exams, up to moon level for God Tiers like Naruto and Kaguya at the end).

Where did those numbers come from? Are they movement speeds or attack speeds? 80 m/s is 163 mph, which is kinda crazy.

I wasn't aware of that info, so I spitballed some movement speeds -- I'd have to check my notes for exactly what they were, but you can figure it out from the speed at which they covered ground when they first left Konoha.

Seriously? I mean, we know shinobi are fast, but those are speeds approaching 0.01c easy. There's the teleportation time/space jutsu used, which we can assume bypasses the normal laws of physics. But if ninja are really moving that fast, shouldn't they be being continuously set on fire by the friction they generate? And inflicting massive damage where they move, not just where they take off from?

**** Calcs. I'd have to dig through them, but Zabuzas durability probably comes from not dying from the water dragon.

While one can debate specific numbers and such, the displayed feats consistently scale up and up and up as the series progresses, so at best you can say they're between point a and b where that point is rediculous ly high by the end. The Sage made the moon to hold the juubi body for example. In the last movie, naruto basically blows the moon up. Etc.

Reading character debates and calculations for such things is one of my hobbies.

In the end, they're really not glass canons. Wave arc shows Jounin with sufficent durability to ignore conventional firearms. Gambunta and a weakened shuukaku in the exams demand a decent level of ordinance. At some point anything that can be scaled to some level of naruto tailed beast mode can shrug off nukes casually.

It's a shounin. That's how these things tend to work. Bleach was stuck at mach 20something for a few years which made it hilariously slow compared to the others.

That said, do what works best for your fic. Even if Zabuzas levels of Shinobi and up can tank or even dodge bullets demanding military levels of pay grade to deal with them, how many Zabuza level Shinobi are there at the end of the day? Not many I'd imagine.

So the Republic is still terrifying because they could murder all but something like 1% of the elemental countries. At which point it becomes mutually assured destruction. They could nuke the ninja to basically non-existence, but the few that are capable of surviving are beyond their ability to put down.

  Kaguya and her newborn sons. A millennium ago, Kaguya, longing for peace, believed that it was necessary for her to attain god-like powers in order to put an end to all of humanity's conflicts. For that reason, she defied the taboo of consuming the fruit of the Shinju. Using her new-found power, Kaguya single-handedly ended the wars, and for her deed, she was worshiped as the *Rabbit Goddess* (卯の女神, /Usagi no Megami/), and had settled down amongst humans, as she would eventually get pregnant and bear twin sons, Hagoromo and Hamura. As time passed, however, Kaguya began to lose trust in humanity as the power she now held ultimately corrupted her. This led her to madness as she created her ideal of peace by trapping her victims in the Infinite Tsukuyomi and converting them into White Zetsu, which changed her public image from that of a benevolent goddess into that of a *Demon* (鬼, /Oni/). In a fit of envy that her own sons had inherited her chakra, Kaguya combined with the Shinju itself and turned against them in the form of the monstrous Ten-Tails. Their intense battle ended with Hagoromo and Hamura separating and absorbing their mother's powerful chakra while sealing her body to form the core of a celestial body that would become known as the moon. Hamura later departed along with the rest of the Ōtsutsuki clan to the moon to guard his mother's remains, while Hagoromo stayed in order to spread chakra to humanity and teach them the concept of Ninshū.\\
  However, just before her sons could completely seal her, Kaguya manifested her will into the form of an artificial being called Black Zetsu. With the agenda of reviving its creator or "mother", Black Zetsu manipulated the Sage's son, Indra Ōtsutsuki, and his descendants: the Uchiha clan, along with Asura Ōtsutsuki's descendants: the Senju clan, all in an attempt to get one of them to awaken the Rinnegan. Madara Uchiha would eventually succeed in doing so, and Black Zetsu began secretly manipulating world events to have Kaguya revived.

******* Oh, right. I hadn't realized she actually came back; I thought she stayed locked away.

Well, the story is currently somewhere near the beginning / early-middle of the Wave arc, so she's quite a ways away. And probably not in any case -- she's effectively a god, and battles involving gods are boring.

********* Let's define terms: by 'god', I'm talking about an essentially immortal with few if any limits. By 'battle' I mean a confrontation centered around physical violence.

Onscreen god battles can be great scenery, but they make for boring plot elements; humans and heroes can't meaningfully participate in god battles, so your protagonists are left standing to one side watching. You can try to put heroes up against gods in a dramatic struggle, but then there's only two stories you can tell:

- God wins instantly.
- God is an idiot (or picks up the idiot ball) and loses. Probably after a long, drawn-out battle that causes [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][DarknessInducedAudienceApathy]].

Superman and Batman are arguably the two most iconic superheroes of all time. Batman is a dark and brooding human being who suffers actual pain that readers can relate to. ("Oh my god, he fell off the building, that must have hurt!") You can understand Batman's limits and intuit whether he's doing well or badly in a fight, how much damage he's taken, and what effect that's going to have on him. More importantly, he is someone that, at least in theory, the reader could /be/ -- if you train hard enough and were determined enough, you could be an awesome martial artist, expert linguist, etc. (I'm obviously exaggerating a little because Batman is a billionaire, has /all/ the skills, and can sustain comic-book no-permanent-damage injuries, but you take my point.) He's had ridiculous numbers of cartoons, movies, comics, graphic novels, etc done about him because he's interesting.

Superman, on the other hand, is more or less a god. Nothing that really exists can challenge him in a fight, so in order to provide opponents for him you have to bring in other gods. You can't tell how he's doing in a fight because his ability to absorb damage is "as much as the plot requires." There's never much tension because it's not something the audience can really relate to from personal experience.

[[/u/alexanderwales]] managed to write an interesting Superman story by never having a battle and primarily focusing on Luthor instead of Superman. Superman's onscreen time was mostly to showcase his unadmirable qualities and show his moral decay. Again, no battles, and the story was really about a different character.

******** Be careful with Kaguya and Black Zetsu in general; Kishimoto ended up making them the root cause for basically everything. If they are near their canon characterizations, Black Zetsu has been running around for nearly a millennium being "Kaguya's Will," spying on high-tier ninja and orchestrating complex manipulations of those ninja. Even keeping Naruto low-tier isn't defense against Black Zetsu, as one of his powers makes Naruto and Sasuke prime candidates for him to pay attention to.

******* I think that's more coincidence than anything else. Wildbow had literally hundreds of different capes with different powers. Something as common place as short range teleportation kind of HAD to show up.

And cloning isn't all that unique either. I would hesitate to say he copied the shadow clone ability at all. I'm not saying it's impossible, but the power is a very generic one, and it's more than plausible he used it as it's a common power, as opposed to drawing it from a specific source.

  The Kaguya clan's destruction. The Kaguya clan were descendants of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, and selective few, namely Kimimaro, possessed the kekkei genkai Shikotsumyaku from Kaguya's original bone-manipulating ability. This ability was so powerful that even the war-loving Kaguya clan feared it. The clan was noted for being very savage and battle-hungry, having no tactics when entering battle that they initiated simply to show off their ferocity. It was due to this failed attempt to prove themselves that the entire clan was killed off when attacking Kirigakure; even when surrounded and completely outmatched, they refused to back down, preferring to fight to the death simply to entertain their own bloodlust to the last.

Yep. The Elemental Nations are already trading seals to them in exchange for mechanismic gear.

"[[#s][]]"

Yes, although not easily. I had to do some world-building as to what stuff he could clone and, among other restrictions, he's got to be physically carrying it when he clones himself. (i.e., it can't be beside him or in a sealing scroll) That puts a weight limit on what he can produce.

There is the [[#s][]] but I haven't decided if I'm going to let it exist in my world. It's such a ridiculous game-changer if it does.

EDIT: I should add that, so far, the Republic is pretty much ignorant of the existence of the Elemental Nations. They're still very isolationist and only slowly opening up. A very few adventurous entrepreneurs have gone exploring and are conducting trade with the EN, but it's all being smuggled and treated as a very closely-guarded trade secret, as they don't want to lose their monopoly.

Sure, the clones get an opportunity to exist, but /they were already existing as Prime/. Making the clones doesn't actually give them any net existential gain. It only makes a version of Naruto that will quickly die.
