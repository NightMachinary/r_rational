This might be hard to answer without spoilers, just giving the name of a series could spoil the end but I'm really frustrated. I keep reading new stories linked here and most are works in progress, which is fine, but I'm dying to see a character actually realize their goals. I want a transhumanist utopia!

The closest I've gotten is reading the iain m banks culture novels or reading [[http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm][Manna]] by Marshall Brain

Are there other works where these concepts are explored in detail? I'm so tired of dystopian science fiction that makes technology out to be the bad guy who must be defeated at all costs :(


** If it's okay to start out with that as the setting, then:

/Aristoi/ by Walter John Williams goes on the list. Possibly Greg Egan novels although only /Permutation City/ and /Quarantine/ seem to me to be really good and they aren't set in happyland. /The Golden Age/ by John C. Wright, but the sequels suck. Many different novels by Peter F. Hamilton.

Stories where the protagonists win sufficiently hard? I'm having a hard time thinking of a single one. Some of Alicorn's writing maybe.

** Banks gets closest to a true utopia. I'm not going to say utopias are boring, because they don't have to be, but there doesn't tend to be a whole lot of conflict, and conflict drives stories. And for whatever reasons, books that are essentially explorations of an idea or setting without much in the way of story don't tend to sell (though there are a few examples of this working, the only popular ones are extensions of existing franchises).

If you just want the transhumanist happy ending that comes after the conflict is resolved ... I don't know of any. I tried writing that ending once, and it just felt too happy, but that might have been because of the type of story it was.

Frankly, this sounds to me like fallacy and cowardice on the part of the writers. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist][Plenty of stories]] manage a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict][conflict]] with some kind of Big Bad to fight. In fact, since real people have a tendency to get into conflicts of some sort over things, you should expect that a utopia /will/ have conflicts: they just won't be /existentially risky/, Save the World-y conflicts. Besides which, that kind of conflict is exactly the kind people don't actually /want/ to /participate in/ on a regular basis.

So basically, all forms of Man vs Man, Man vs Self, and Man vs Nature conflicts that /don't threaten the total extinction of your setting/ should be available in a utopian setting -- authors just /think/ that people would sit around going "ooohhhhhmmmm" like fucking movie-Zen monks all the time because they /haven't thought about it/.

Why does it have to be protagonist against the government, or against someone else in their own utopian society? Those are the only two conflict elements that a utopia stops from being as effective.

The Culture novels are all set at the hard edges of the utopian society, the places where the Culture interacts with other, less perfect societies. I'm trying to think through all of the novels, and I can't recall one that takes place purely within the Culture itself - they almost all deal with how the Culture interacts with other civilizations. And that's because within the Culture itself, there is relatively little in the way of (interesting) conflict, possibly with the exception of the Minds that do all the actual decision making.

Again, I'm not saying that you can't write successful and entertaining fiction set within a utopia, because you definitely can, I'm trying to explain why this is so uncommon - and it's not because writers are lazy or unimaginative.

Well, if he and I can come up with simple and well-known examples...that sort of /does/ suggest a lack of imagination inherent in your statement. Whenever utopias are written of, they are interesting in some way.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Not quite true, but even Jane Austin novels are set at the "hard edges" of their part of society, even if that is upper class people who technically don't fear for their next meal. No one writes stories about people without problems, just living normal lives, but those with serious personal or external issues that need to be resolved.

/Seinfeld/ personifies this, with almost every problem the characters experience being internally generated while they live in the lap of (worldwide median) luxury in New York city. But they are also the most dysfunctional characters you can imagine, and they constantly rub up against a perfectly functioning society's minor issues and turn them into major ones.

--------------

As for conflict inside a utopia, there were several times that outsiders (like in /Use of Weapons/) were squicked out by the Culture. An entire habitat full of Culture citizens was endangered in /Consider Phlebas/, and their civilization is actively at war in that story.

People have conflicts about time use and the way they personally fit into the Culture. Body modifications exclude friends from interacting the same ways, and desires for adventure and excitement aren't drugged or genetically engineered out of anyone, so they still have them.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That is exactly what you have not shown, and what at least I am suggesting.

The fact that Dystopias in fiction are so common strongly suggests this. Dystopias are so easy because everything is rapidly approaching maximum shittiness. The level of imagination required to pull out an exciting story is minimal.

It is, in short, prone to lazy, unimaginative writing, and is more popular /amongst writers/ than the utopian fiction genre.

It always bugs me to hear this, because it's so clearly a Bad Ending to me. Do people /really/ read Banks and think /that/ is a perfect society?

They life in motherfucking /castes/. The protagonists - our viewpoint characters! - are all from the lowest caste. The one that has essentially no legal protection or social standing, can't own industrial or military infrastructure and live at the whim of their masters, and mostly end up committing suicide in the depths of old age even though *they can cure aging* - because it's socially unacceptable to live. And half of the protagonists are actively fighting the Culture, for various reasons!

Is it because they're the "liberal" faction and the fanbase is primarily liberal, or because they're the most commonly-recurring faction so they get positive associations from Banks' writing, or what?

Many of those criticisms are pointed out in-universe, either by the enemies of the Culture or people who live within it. But with that said, if I had free reign to pick a scifi/fantasy universe to live in, the Culture would /probably/ be it. Though the humans (and droids) can't do everything that the Minds do, they have it /really/ good compared to pretty much any other fictional society. It's the kind of place that I'd want to live, even knowing that I wasn't the guiding hand behind my fate.

(I think /Star Trek/ comes second closest, but it's never really explained how their government/economy works, and so I'm skeptical of how much that stuff has been thought out, and whether or not it's got an underbelly.)

Because you can't /do/ anything without industrial or military infrastructure; you have to hang out in places that Minds have already built and fenced off. (And because, in my experience, most people dislike the idea of being proles? I just would have expected more reaction from the readers to a society where we're /lower-class/.)

And no, I'm pretty sure they can't. Am I forgetting something? It's mentioned regularly that the Minds only "give" humans tech above slightly-above-our tech level by building an AI, giving the tech to the AI, and giving that AI the option to follow the human around. (Which is why the Culture's economy and military run on the principle of "persuade a Mind to do it", right?)

#+begin_quote
  What does your utopia look like?
#+end_quote

My utopia ... well, the correct answer is "I don't know", but we're certainly /immortal/, for a start. Probably resembles Scott Alexander's "Archipelago" a bit, with lots of little clades doing different interesting things and trying out different lifestyles and governments and laws. Universal "human rights" type thingy implemented by a Magically Infallible Authority, like an FAI (or nearest equivalent you can find, anyway) via universal surveillance and omnipresent security drones or forcefield projectors or something. Post-scarcity, of course, probably with heavy use of VR and/or physics-bending hypertech to effectively remove most "practical" limits.

Actually, my utopia probably most resembles The Metamorphosis Of Prime Intellect, if you've read that. (It's not very good, though, so I wouldn't recommend it.)

And, of course, *nobody* is left marooned in realtime.

As an example, it wouldn't be easy to set anything other than maybe an epilogue in the Harry Potter universe - the irrational worldbuilding is an integral part of the setting and part of the appeal (especially to kids). You might be able to do it in, say, the Star Wars universe, as the setting already supports FTL space travel, advanced science, and very long-lived species.
