#+TITLE: [Thought experiment]According to some researchers women employ a dualistic mating strategy - long term bonding with one man and extrapair sex with others. How would a world where women are able to optimize these behaviors (perhaps through magic) look like?

** How much effort are these powers?

That would probably be a world where men are simple laborers, whereas women just mind control them into doing what they want. If a man is getting an education, he is probably getting it in a mens only school, to stop them from being mind controlled. At a certain point it would stop seeming like "Men" and "Women" as men become worker drones to literal queen bees.

** To many factors to consider. How did this status quo come about? Did the sexes evolve like this over millions of years, did it happen gradually, was it a recent development? At what age do women develop this power?

An eusocial strategy seems like an obvious contender but need not be the only one. One possible scenario, given the right paramters, would be that men who for whatever reason were immune to women's power---gay or asexual men, for example---would rule or have very high status in this world. They'd might be solely responsible for reproducing and would have the responsibility of killing/disabling any woman that for whatever reason avoided being lobotomised at birth or was able to exert her power in spite of that. Women would be kept cloistered in farms and your clan would probably have to rent one if you wanted sons---female offspring would be automatically property of the "farmers".

Cheery.

** Ask around in [[/r/futadomworld]] ? Their captions are basically built on a very similar premise.
