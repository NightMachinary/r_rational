Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** Having tried MealSquares and Soylent for Months and Weeks respectively, here are my thoughts:

- Soylent, for all its ease, still takes too much time and energy to make and clean up afterwards. It also goes bad in one or two days after you make it, so uneaten soylent is a problem, and I found myself not finishing a full bottle more often than not. Soylent is addressing these issues with a pre-made, disposable bottle version (which is slightly more expensive).
- Related to the above point, I find that Soylent works better as a a small supplement to your daily food (15-20%) rather than a food replacement. It is also significantly better with some sort of sweetener. This combination makes it more like a milkshake you have once a day, rather than bland goop you have all day, or replacing all your food with milkshakes *shudder*.
- When I tried MealSquares, they were too dry, and neither savory, nor sweet enough. And, unlike with Soylent, I couldn't easily add more water or sweetener. They're palatable with some sort of sweet beverage, such as tea or soda, but I feel like they are also best used sparingly, like a replacement for a breakfast muffin, rather than replacing food entirely.

***** You certainly can, it's just more effort for less food.

If you make a full bottle of Soylent, you pour in the whole bag of Soylent powder, pour in water, shake, pour in more water, shake, and you're done (you can also let it settle for a while, which helps mix it even more). This has the benefit of the Soylent being thoroughly mixed and in the proper ratio of powder to water (if you use the Soylent brand bottle, which you should).

Making just a cup of Soylent requires you to have a measuring device, measure out two units of water for every unit of powder (this makes it slightly more thick than the full bottle version), then stir. Stir a /lot/. Then stir some more, because it's still going to be clumpy, unless you can use some sort of miniature whisk. Then, ideally, you'd let it diffuse for an hour or two, then stir it again, and it would be good, but if you're making the effort to make a glass right then, you probably want it right then. It's a little frustrating, and more work than a "convenient future food" feels like it should be.

Very dense, but otherwise would make an acceptable breakfast food to eat with a cup of coffee or something. I couldn't imagine eating these more than once per day. As it is, I only eat them rarely.

*** I got an order of Joylent, which is the danish equivalent. It was pretty good. Then me and a friend made a home made version which we called Super Drink. It was also pretty good. Not amazing, not terrible. Cheap though, because it is primarily oats and protein powder. After a while you can develop a taste/craving for them, which I assume is my body craving whichever vitamins/minerals I'm missing which it provides.

I tend to drink them late at night, at times when I can't be bothered to cook or when I'm in a rush and going to the climbing gym. I have always had a hard time gaining weight and I credit a decent amount of my recent 4-5 kg increase to being able to drink soylent late at night when I would otherwise not bother eating.

As a dedicated cook who enjoys trying new things it would never replace everything or even most things, but it is certainly a good alternative for when I can't be fucked to cook and would just eat freezer pizza normally.

The taste is actually pretty decent, at least the vanilla. I miss it now that I don't have it.

** I'm reading a novel called /Wired/ (by Douglas Richards), and it's...horrible.

The antagonist is a woman. Every time she's introduced to a character, they have to comment (in dialogue or in narration) on her appearance in relationship to their willingness to have sex with her. This is pretty annoying.

The thing that's unusual about this book is, there's working intelligence augmentation. Absurd levels of it, in fact, far beyond what should be possible, plus the effect is temporary. (The author didn't do the research for pretty much any topic the book talks about.) But, as is explained in a four-page author rant, this intelligence augmentation is inextricably linked to increased selfishness, decreased concern about others, and an uncaring attitude toward social consequences. That author filibuster was overly cynical and had a lot of prose that smacks of the sort of person who hangs about in [[/r/atheism]]: people got smarter and more independent over time, so religion came in to stop us from killing each other, diminishing our effective intelligence.

Anyway. The antagonist can control herself well enough not to go on murder sprees as long as she stays in a sensory deprivation chamber while under the drug's effects, and that's with iteration #78, where the previous iterations are weaker in both psychological effects and intelligence augmentation. There is an obvious solution to the problem. Use the maximum safe level of augmentation to find another drug that will compensate for the lack of goodwill toward your fellow humans. Set up situations where you will be rewarded for helping others. Engender in yourself a sense of ownership toward the world so it's a point of pride to eradicate malaria, clean up the oceanic garbage patches, and ensure that everyone has clean drinking water. Ask yourself: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][what would Orange Lantern do?]]

Everything else in the story is wrong and annoyingly so, but this...it's just such a huge miss that I can't stand it, and the author seems heavily invested in the insuperability of the problem.

#+begin_quote
  The cost of living in Portugal?

Now that I have a sort of planned end date for my Master's (assuming nothing goes wrong with my thesis), and by extension this allows me to plan a future date for financial and living independence from family members, I'm even more fearful about the next year's evolution of the local prices.

Specially because with the upcoming elections I'm seeing every political party in opposition to the current far-right, austerity measures being woefully incompetent, with the only hope of mine for a more rational opposition being personified by a 29-year old woman which seemingly up until now is the only rational and positive agent in a political system which thrives on meaningless catchphrases and outside support instead of proper results. Of course if she won we might suffer the same thing that happened to Syriza+Greece, and that is not an enjoyable perspective for the future.

On the other hand, I'm thinking about perhaps writing a small fanfic of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_%282015_animated_film%29][Home]] movie which at the same time plays it straight with the silly aliens and cars made which work on juice, but with a legitimate alien intelligence as the "occupiers".

** I've just finished reading /Jam/ by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw. (The author also does a series of web videos called /Zero Punctuation/, you may have heard of him from there.)

It's a black comedy about a jam apocalypse, which is superficially similar to a zombie apocalypse except with man-eating jam instead of zombies. The joke is that nobody is prepared for the apocalypse and what groups of survivors remain are making it up as they go along. This includes the genre-savvy everyman who has always dreamed of being a world hero, the survivalists, the pragmatists, the hipsters, the organisation that works on existential risk, and a variety of groups who think they're the sole remaining bastion of civilisation. The characters are definitely not rational - 99% of everyone they know is dead, and the remainder is quite understandably going mad if they weren't already.

I think it's quite a funny deconstruction of rational fiction.

*** People don't vote. This is endemic to reddit. The reason for it is that voting takes both effort and attention, which people have been trained not to spare. We have ~3,500 readers on this subreddit and the most upvoted thing of all time has ~160 upvotes.

So it's not necessarily that people are stingy with their upvotes, it's that they just don't think about voting too much. Part of this is that voting up or down has very little personal utility. It's something you're doing for other people, not for yourself. This is especially true for AutoModerator, since the upvotes don't do her any good, so it's not like you're giving a reward, which is how some people think of it.

And yes, vote fuzzing doesn't kick in until much later. Soft-capping is the other factor, and that doesn't kick in until the mid thousands.

No, that's really the only function of upvotes ("karma"). However, if a person's personal Reddit front page is filled with a zillion different submissions (most of them from subreddits other than this one), a post from this subreddit may need some extra upvotes to appear on that person's personal Reddit front page--especially if he hasn't activated the "Don't show me links that I've upvoted/downvoted" option.

from your description it sounds like it probably doesnt matter so much what is the absolute number of upvotes so much as the relative number or somesuch algo. in any case having more votes will probably get adjusted after a while so no point to particularly try and upvote more as it just means that at the worse case when you stop the visibility will go down for a while..

**** I could probably make a decanter of endless water (character has the item creation feat for it) however I suspect that even at full output the energy produced would be a lot more expensive than flaming skeletons from Animate Dead. In pathfinder a [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/decanter-of-endless-water][Decanter of Endless Water]] can output at most 5 gallons per second in a stream, the decanter would cost me slightly more than 4500gp to build.

Wikipedia tells me that the power from an overshot wheel can be calculated thus:

Power in Watts = 4 × Q × H × C (x V?)

#+begin_example
  Q = Weight of water (volume per sec x capacity of the buckets)
  V = Velocity of the stream in meters per second
  H = Head, or height difference of water between the lip of the flume (head race) and the tailrace
  C = Efficiency Constant 
#+end_example

Q = 19Kg (5 gallons is about 19 litres) V = 6 m/s (the stream is described as being 20 feet long) H = 4 m (lets make the thing pretty big, but not massive) C = 1 (I'm just gonna assume 1 here since wikipedia tells me that's alright)

P = 456W or 1824W depending on the formula. or P = 2008W for an undershot wheel assuming square foot paddles and 6m/s stream

***** Now the skeleton power, this is a little more complex. Burning Skeletons do 1d6 points of fire damage to all adjacent creatures each round, comparing to the table for extreme heat conditions in 3.5's Sandstorm book that suggests the temperature in those squares to be about 90°C.

The amount of energy required to take air from room temperature to 90°C is Q. Q = mCΔT

m = (volume of 8+9+9 5' cubes which surround a medium creature in m^{3} is 92) 92x1.0755 (density of air between 20 and 100 degrees Celsius) = 99kg

C = 1 or thereabouts

ΔT = 70

Q = 70x99x1 = 6930J

please correct me if I have done something stupid but considering this only costs about 25gp I think the flaming skeletons beat out the decanter.

***** Ah, water power equations. Haven't used those in a while. Fun fact, you can make H=to whatever you damn well please, which makes V shoot up as well. Normally people didn't do this in the past because there was only a small difference in height in most streams, but you can just stick the decanter on top of a building/mountain/necromancer tower you cleared and attach a pipe to it. That gives you a head of 20-300m depending on local architecture and availability of cliffs.

Funny story, let the pipe fill all the way to the top the stick a nozzle on the bottom and you can get some impressive speed and power going. That's basically how hydroelectric damns work. The problem is using the energy when you don't have the tech to make or use electricity. I mean, it's just a magnet spinning fast in a coil of wire but you'd have to explain how your character knows that.

*** Brandon Sanderson's stuff in general is good; he knows his magic systems.

/The Merchant Princes/ series by Charles Stross has a pretty dead-simple magic system, but the emergent social/economic stuff might be up your alley (this series often gets mixed reviews; if at all possible, get the reissue that shrinks it from six short books into three fat ones).

/The Powder Mage/ trilogy by Brian McClellan also has interesting magic systems, though one of the primary ones is of the "ineffable workings" variety (though it still works). McClellan was a student of Sanderson's and the influence is pretty obvious.

*** So this is a random interesting thing I'm just going to tag along on...

I've got the outlines of a setting bouncing around in the back of my head. High-fantasy space-faring, originally whipped up to be an RPG setting. One of the things it's got is an elemental magic system.

Now when you've go got an elemental magic system you've got to have them interact with each outer. One thing I feel like I see a lot is the "Pokémon maneuver" - when your electric user and your water user blast the same thing at the same time, breaking down water into component matter, and then a fire user chips in and gets a much bigger fireball than normal for that much power expenditure. I specifically don't want that in this setting (it's got interplanetary islands and magic and no humans, after all), but then I'm not sure what to do.

I like the setting, and I would be down with fiction being written/writing fiction in it, so I thought about making a main post here. But I'm not sure if anything I wrote would be "rational"/"rationalist".

So if anyone's got ideas or thinks they can help probe, that'd be awesome. Or I can also share more of asked.

**** There are a lot of ways to do elemental magic. The rock/paper/scissors approach is pretty standard, but there's nothing that says you have to go with that. What you have to ask is what you want out of the magic system; how do you want people to use it and how do you want it to impact the world. Personally, I start with some basics and then work my way forward, so that if there /is/ a cool maneuver that you can do with some combination of things, it comes more naturally as a result of what you've established about how these things work.

I would personally suggest posting to [[/r/magicbuilding]] instead of [[/r/rational]], since they're experts in the subject of magic systems. [[/r/rational]] most often tends to try to break things that are presented to them.

1. Zombies don't run farms. Given their hyperviolence they're going to starve to death in two weeks, max. A zombie virus could certainly end civilization in a few connected continents, but humanity will survive unless someone is intentionally infecting people on every major continent or the virus has a long gestation period.

2. Zombies are predisposed to violence so they're going to be twice as likely to fight each other as uninfected humans. This is the point they never bother explaining and I have a hard time suspending disbelief on this.

** I've been reading a bit about US history with the Sioux Nation.

The US government signed a treaty with the Sioux Nation (the Treaty at Fort Laramie of 1851) establishing that the Black Hills were theirs and paying $50,000 per year for 50 years for limited land use rights. The US violated this treaty, ceasing payments after ten years. Several years after the US broke their treaty, the Sioux opened hostilities (because the US was still using their land, which had no legal basis any longer thanks to non-payment).

This second treaty (the Treaty at Fort Laramie of 1868) guaranteed certain lands to the Sioux Nation, and additionally specified that the US government would ensure that the relevant groups would have at least 160 acres of farmland per person. Additionally, they were allowed to hunt outside their sovereign territory. We should have stuck with the original treaty, but if we couldn't do that, this was at least halfway decent.

But then the US discovered gold in the Black Hills and forced the people living there to move, using the military. Thus they violated their second treaty. This didn't break into open warfare for several years, though, when the US military attacked in Montana, which had been promised to First Nations people for their exclusive use.

Unfortunately, might makes right, or if not right, then at least a large measure of control over what happens. The Sioux were dependent on imported food, so the US threatened to cut off supplies until they agreed to a new treaty. Since the land had already been surveyed and prospected, this new treaty was able to restrict them to unprofitable lands. The treaty claims that the ceded territories were purchased, but there's no record of a proper, legal exchange. The US Supreme Court has ruled that the treaty was illegal, and the US has paid for the land, but the Sioux are attempting to refuse the transaction. If successful (a prospect that has approximately a whelk's chance in a supernova), several hundred thousand white people would be faced with a choice of moving or living under a Sioux government, and the Sioux would have to choose whether to grant them citizenship. I would like to see this, mostly because it's largely the right thing to do and partly because I like seeing more nations on the map. (Still waiting for Styria to declare independence. Or at least Cornwall.)

The original treaty covered about 40% of South Dakota.
