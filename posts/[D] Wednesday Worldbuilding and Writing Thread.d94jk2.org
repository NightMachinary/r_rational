Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** This might end up fitting better in the saturday thread, and if that is the case I'll go ahead and delete this and wait until then, but it should have enough worldbuilding to stand on its own.

TLDR; Ghost based Surveillance State.

Sometime in the Victorian era, dabblers of the occult stumbled upon a genuine method to contact the dead. The method was able to be replicated by anyone with the knowledge and materials, but it had multiple limitations. For one, it had a high failure rate, it contacted the dead at random, leading the potential language problems, and for a skeptical observer it was effectively impossible to dinstinguish as not being an effective charlatan. Without multiple refinements it couldn't prove itself as being real, and for this reason the effect it had on history was negligable at best. The first real change from our version of events thus occurred in the early 1970s.

With MKULTRA on the verge of total shutdown, last ditch efforts taken by an agent done on their own initative found him making contact with practitioners of a much refined version of the victorian era process. With little to lose, the agent put their claims to the test. A superior's wife had recently died, and the agent had once met the wife at a barbeque the boss had thrown. Contacting the wife, the agent was quickly convinced that the method was real and was able to confirm key details about the barbeque, the house's appearance, and certain current events related to his boss. He decided to gather more intimate details to use to convince his supervisor, and the spouse agreed because of her desire to personally say goodbyes. Initially very suspicious, the supervisor was brought to the practitioner and was convinced. The project rapidly began to explore this phenomenom, hiring the practitioners to teach the process. Armed with genuine proof of the supernatural, MKULTRA was able to stay funded despite the advances with mind control and truth drugs being unsatisfactory.

*The Afterlife*

Through interviews with the deceased, the nature of the afterlife was uncovered. Regardless of mental state prior to death, everyone reported some period of unconsciousness followed by an awakening, ranging from a few minutes to a few hours after death. Ghosts are able to move around freely and see and hear everything around them normally, those with vision or hearing problems finding themselves cured. Almost all other sensations are removed, with no sense of temperature, touch, taste, smell, hunger or thirst, or proprioception, largely due to ghosts reporting their appearance as mostly amorphous without conscious direction. Ghosts do retain the sense of balance, but do not suffer motion sickness, nor any discomfort from being upside down. The speed ghosts are able to move at is around that of a swift walk, with the ability to move in any direction, including through walls and into the sky. It appears that all humans become ghosts, but the afterlife is not crowded, which was initially confusing before further qestioning revealed that every deceased individual knows the exact location of their remains, and has an instinctive pull to those remains absent any other overriding purpose, such as that of friends, family, the desire to explore, or a sense of unfinished work. Furthermore it would appear that each ghost, as an analogy, exists in a different frequency to other ghosts, with contact between two ghosts being a difficult affair, the ease of which depends on having some sort of emotional connection between the two. The contacting process is unaffected by this. Ghosts are typically lonely individuals, burdened with depression. Absent purpose they fall eventually into catatonia at or near their gravesite. It was for this reason that the deceased contacted were very willing to discuss anything, including sensitive information, for the promise of further contact. It was the height of the cold war, and this technology had just become incredibly, vitally, important.

Many years later and the contacting process has become further refined, alongside a new development stemming from research into ways to allow ghosts to interact with the world. In the process of this research, a ghost sucessfully possessed a living volunteer, controlling the person like a puppet. While possessing the person, the ghost was capable of feeling, tasting, breathing, and a whole host of other sensations. Immediately it was authorized to use it on death row prisoners, transforming them from dangerous criminals into very loyal workers. Some ghosts are unwilling to posess the living, despite the allure of regaining fleshly pleasures. For the ones with no qualms, however, it is an offer they cannot refuse. The result is a model employee, one willing to go above and beyond so that they can retain control over their puppet. Demand began to outstrip supply, and life sentences were the next target. Moving to a timeshare system further increased supply. For the possessed, they see and hear everything, but are powerless to control their own body unless released by the machines or, strangely enough, an exorcism. The entire reason that the dead are paid in flesh, is because of the versatility they provide in spying. The ability to stand beside any political oppenent, terrorist, criminal, or target and see and hear what they are doing in private, read any notes passed by courier, break into any hidden bunkers or vaults, is one that has enraptured the minds of those at the head of intelligence agencies.

The result is an opressive surveillance state that is deadly effective, corrupted by those in power, resorting to scorched earth tactics to prevent the proliferation of these technologies, and turning increasingly minor offences into ones worthy to have one's body become the property of the state, to be used for the personal pleasures of hundreds of ghosts, so that they can eat and drink and fuck, hurt and sleep and feel. The democractic process can safely be said to be nonexistant, with a single dominant political party running show elections. The few times the elections have gone counter to expectations, the winner quickly stepped down, citing personal reasons. The rich and powerful have mostly succeeded in remaining so, with their level of sucess depending on how clean their history has been.

This is unacceptable to more and more of the population, and the only reason that armed revolution has not yet occurred is because of the control of information flow and the effectiveness of the surveillance programs, combined with a gradual disarmament of the people.

So, how could a resistance form, and win under these conditions? Winning means overthrowing the government and either being in charge of everything, or setting up a government aligned with their interests.

*** How long has this been going on, and how many people opposed to the current state of affairs have died, with their unfinished business being the destruction of this project? A proxy war conducted between factions of past ideologies via possessed puppets in the present would seem to decrease the reliability of the project and its secrecy, in a way eventually leading to its downfall.

*** If exorcism works than other things may as well. Perhaps finding the Victorian era method of contacting the dead to conduct tests? Like a method of keeping ghosts out of places and then just setting a up meeting places and random locations as keep ghosts out places. Or some ghost repellent for when they're inside of puppets.

Either getting rid of the government's monopoly on ghosts or the ghost's viability as spies is a step in the right direction.

*** The way I see it, it completely depends on the nature of the technology of communicating with the dead. If I reply to this seriously then I'll end up going through the possibilities one by one listing all the ways it can be solved.

To help out:

- How easy to access is the technology?

- Is it really a technology in the sense that it has more applications than described? You have already described two.

- Again, if it is a technology, does the amount of resources/time spent creating it increase with complexity of the application?

- I might have misunderstood this part but does the technology summon them from anywhere or does it have to be within a certain range? There are some interesting applications no matter how you answer this.

- You only described some simple applications of the technology so I will try to extrapolate a little:

  - Definitely not instantaneous, but as a simple and maybe even secure way to communicate.
  - Do they have the capability to possess animals and are there animal ghosts? There must be a few applications to a yes to this but really this question only makes you flesh out the technology more.
  - You mentioned that ghosts are on different wavelengths in a sense, is it possible to use the tech to make two ghosts the same frequency? If not is it possible to use the tech to create two machines that have the ghosts talk to one another? What is the mechanism used that allows them to speak with the living without possessing?

  How easy to access is the technology?
#+end_quote

The victorian era version is quite simple, if the high failure rate and random nature are acceptable. For the targeted version(s), especially depending on the range you are content with, it's about as difficult as building a good radio from scratch, albeit with different (vague) materials. For making the possession machine, it's about as complicated and difficult to source as building say, a CT scan machine? The knowledge is the hard part to find, the materials themselves are far less important.

#+begin_quote
  Is it really a technology in the sense that it has more applications than described? You have already described two.
#+end_quote

I suppose it isn't much of one. The two different processes are only useful for what they each do, with little application beyond that. (The second process being the posession one, which includes posession, depuppeting, and the detection of puppets, either via trying puppet someone with a tester ghost, or depuppeting someone suspected of being a puppet.)

#+begin_quote
  Again, if it is a technology, does the amount of resources/time spent creating it increase with complexity of the application?
#+end_quote

For contacting the dead, yes. For posessing or de-posessing, no.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, range is a limitation, as is the willingness of the spirit to talk. Significant effort would be needed to get a currently catatonic spirit to accept a "call" and someone unwilling to talk can simply refuse from answering the call outright. For getting a human posessed, it is even more range restricted, requiring the deceased to be within the building.

#+begin_quote
  You only described some simple applications of the technology so I will try to extrapolate a little:
#+end_quote

Only human beings can be posessed. Trying to posess a pregant woman wouldn't posess the child, just the woman. Infants work, I guess? There have not been any animal ghosts observed in the afterlife, and research into whether there is a seperate animal afterlife has been unsucessful.

For ghosts attempting to communicate with one another while in the afterlife, the ease of locating one another and then communicating largely depends on both knowledge of the other's existance, and emotional connections. Husband and wife, mother and child, fellow soldiers, and to an extent simply being coworkers. While posessing humans, they can form those needed emotional bonds which eases communication while back in the afterlife. Ghosts posessing humans cannot see other ghosts by the way, both would need to be out or in at the same time, unless one used the contacting device.

Speaking of the contacting device, it absolutely needs a human being to operate it. The reason is unknown, and the mechanism behind it is also unknown, with theories wondering about whether consciousness is needed for it to function. Electronic and analog devices can record the voices, so a switchboard like affair with one operator managing a few contacting devices is what the arrangement converges to.
