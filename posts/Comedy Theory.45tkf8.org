Hi, everyone! This is off topic, but I really want to discuss it with you guys, and I think you will find the subject interesting.

For the past several months I have been trying to understand how comedy works, to figure out a step-by-step process for coming up with jokes. I think I'm onto something, and I have written an article about it:

[[https://medium.com/@rayalez/comedy-theory-fd142076657e]]

This is my first attempt to express the ideas I have about it. I'm not a neuroscientist, and my theory can be totally incomplete and mistaken, but I think it has some useful epiphanies that explain a lot of things.

I am still working on it and trying to figure it out, and now I'm looking for some feedback/ideas, I really want to talk to some smart people about the subject.

Please let me know what you think. Any criticism/questions that you have, anything that is unclear or can be better explained, any thoughts/ideas would be very valuable to me!


** This helps to elucidate my observation that the more familiar I am with a comedy, the more the original comedic joy of watching it is replaced with an entirely different-feeling nostalgic joy.

Comedic timing is both very universal and utterly lost in text-based comedy. I don't think it's ever the sole active ingredient in a joke, but it's very commonly a vital one, intensifying comedy severely.

*** Thank you for your reply!

The framework I'm talking about does completely ignore the issue of timing. To me personally, it never seemed to make sense.

Here's my argument:

In my experience, most of the jokes I've encountered, don't change much when the timing is removed or messed up. In my opinion, the transcribed stand up routine won't lose much of it's essence. I mean it's certainly more entertaining to watch than to read, and it's better when it's performed/delivered well, but when the jokes stand alone, they are still recognizable as jokes, and have pretty much the same effect. I think that timing may affect the mood and quality of the delivery, but the essence of a good joke will remain the same, and will still generate the response even if told by a person who has no idea what "timing" means.

But I am very interested in talking about this. Can you come up with some examples of the jokes where timing is crucial?

**** Jokes made in a social environment in which their purpose is to lower someone's status by shaming them, or to diffuse tension by making light of a previous offensive/controversial/insulting comment, etc.

In all those cases, the jokes must come chronologically close to the issue it addresses. In those cases, a large portion of the humor and impact of the joke comes from the quickness of the person responding-- hence the expression "quick-witted".

**** Witticisms. There's a very small window during which the joke will be at all funny or appropriate.

**** Both of the other replies are missing the point of what "comedic timing" refers to. It's not a macroscopic context issue. It's a microscopic delivery issue. The difference between a good joke told well and a good joke told poorly is the difference between a good speech delivered by a master orator and a good speech delivered by someone who needs a public speaking class. The difference between a bad joke told well and a bad joke told poorly is the difference between a fun dumb movie and an unfun dumb movie.

Are you by any chance on the autism spectrum? That's very common around here; I am myself. Difficulty grasping certain aspects of communicative skills is commonly associated with such a condition. In terms of your comedic theory, the skill of telling a joke is the same as any other communicative skill. Once you've established the series of ideas you want to convey, you need to figure out how to convey them.

Writing the joke is one level of this communication, but there's a finer level still involved in communicating it - by telling the joke at the correct speed, with pauses inserted appropriately and so forth, you can further maximize the percentage of your audience who get "hit" by the joke at the correct points in their train of thought. You need to see things from your audience's perspective and hit them with the punchline at the point when it has the best impact. One of the most basic joke formats non-communicable in text is an interrupted pause, and there must be an exact science to figuring out how long to let the pause go on before interrupting it.

***** Timing and delivery are distinct elements. Consider the following unthinking utterance, and two potential responses:

- A: "... had a bite, then ate my laundry before setting out, but I missed the 5:40."

- B: "Yeah, that'll happen. Remembered your ticket, right?"

- A: "Yup, got it right her-"

- C: "Wait, wait, back up a second. Did you just say you /ate/ your /laundry/?"

- A: "No...?"

- B: "Actually, I think you did. Hadn't had your fill, eh?"

- A: "Sod off, I meant I did my laundry. Let's get going."

- C: "Right-o, laundry-boy."

--------------

- A: "... had a bite, then ate my laundry before setting out, but I missed the 5:40."

- B: "...You ate your laundry."

- C: "Oh, no, not again."

- A: "No, I didn-"

- B: "He's done this before?"

- C: "Yes, don't you remember? Just this Tuesday last we had a long, insightful conversation about it over the phone."

- A: "Of course you did."

- B: "Ahh! How could I forget! Now we know he wasn't just confused when he ate the bear rug."

- A: "I don't have a bear rug."

- C: "Yeah; you ate it."

--------------

The first scenario relies entirely on delivery to be even remotely funny - it's belatedly timed, and context alone won't elicit much of a laugh if the initial absurdity wasn't noticed straight-off.

The second scenario has a timing-sensitive witticism at the end, which would be funny with any delivery said in a conversational tone - granted, fine delivery could improve the rejoinder's hilarity, but without proper timing C's will flop, making timing a distinct element from delivery.

Everything after your first three sentences I agree with, for what it's worth.

Oh, that totally makes sense, I can agree with that. I guess that for my practical purposes(crafting funny jokes for writing and for my webcomics) this wasn't necessary, and that didn't seem to be at the core of what comedy IS, what makes it work, what is the central thing that makes things funny.

I don't know that I am, but I kinda wish I was)) It's just that all the autistic people I know are geniuses and I really want to be like them. I do have some asperger-like traits, but I wasn't diagnosed with anything, so for all I know it's just my personality.

I completely agree with everything else that you've said, from that perspective I also think that timing is important, I just disagree when people say that this is what makes things funny.

****** It's not "what makes things funny" in the sense that it's the base ingredient of everything, but it is an important ingredient that is very common (absent from all non-realtime sources of comedy, omnipresent in all realtime sources of comedy) and enough to sink or sell a joke. Analyzing your timing-based reactions to comedy is important even if you're only writing non-realtime comedy, because it helps you to understand the comedic theory.

** I think you should qualify that this theory is only about 1 type of comedy, while there are many more(i.e. situational comedy, the fact that some words are just inherently funny).

And this comes into play even in one of the examples you gave,

#+begin_quote
  Doctor's appointment. The doctor says “You're gonna have to stop masturbating.” The patient says “But why!?” The doctor says “So I can examine you.”
#+end_quote

When going over my thought process about this joke for example, i found the "unexpectedness" of the suggestion to be hardly 10-20% of what was funny, while the situation described itself is much funnier.

In a way I could see how on a lower level part of what makes the situation funny is the "wrongdness" of it, which again in a way is "unexpected". but i think it is still missing a lot, because plenty of things which are "wrong" or "unexpected" will not be funny. in this example, if you replaced the action of the patient with "jump rope" it would still be somewhat funny, on the other hand if you replaced it with "solving mathematical equations" it would be significantly less funny.

*** I think we can break down "unexpected" here into related but discrete concepts. It's hard enough that I can't do it spur of the moment now, at least not cleanly, but the fact that the audience expects advice to stop masturbating to be discussing it in general is distinct from the fact that the audience expects the person not to be masturbating while consulting with their doctor. And where the activity in question can be most anything for the first one, it matters a great deal for the second. Working on mathematics in your doctor's office might be a little odd but isn't really /out there/; fire juggling might do better.

There's also an element of plausibility in set-up. A doctor advising someone to stop doing maths is strange enough on its own that it might fail to establish an expectation.

** Your method is similar to some techniques used in /Comedy Writing Workbook/ by Gene Perret. I highly recommend it if you're interested in practical aspects of writing jokes.

Also Scott Adams' Six Dimensions of Humor could explain some things.

#+begin_quote
  My observation was that you have to use at least two of the six dimensions to be recognized as humor. You can use more than two dimensions for even better results, but two is the minimum. And it does not matter which dimensions you combine. I have written extensively on this topic, so today I will just list the six dimensions and tell you that you need two of them: Naughty, Clever, Cute, Bizarre, Mean, Recognizable
#+end_quote

So, according to this formula, taboo jokes are easier to make because they include two dimensions before you even start writing.

There's also defense mechanism aspect of humor that many types of comedy exploits. You laugh because alternative is being angry or terrified.
