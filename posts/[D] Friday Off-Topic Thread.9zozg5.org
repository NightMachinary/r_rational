Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Does anyone know what happened to Color Psychology? It's been almost a month. Hopefully the author didn't drop it.

*** I've just been very busy with work. I'm still trying to figure out how to balance that with my personal life, so chapter releases will probably be slow and inconsistent for a while :/

**** That's absolutely okay. Just wanted to let you know there are still readers who await your work. Personally, I would not mind you taking a break until the current RWBY season is over so that you can get the lore consistent (unless you plan to diverge from the lore of course). The biggest lore bomb has been dropped after all.

** I am reading the web novel That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. It can be found here [[http://gurotranslation.blogspot.com/p/ioduction.html]]

To be blunt it is not very good and I expect that the anime viewers are going to be disappointed. Is anyone here reading it or watching the anime ?

*** If that's the one where a dragon almost instantly agrees to let itself get swallowed by the protagonist in the very first chapters, then I didn't like it either. The protag is too OP, the story too boring.

Maybe try /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_I%27m_a_Spider,_So_What%3F][Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?]]/ --- it is very similar in format, has both a manga and a book. I found it to be a much better story, even though eventually the spider becomes boringly OP too.

**** I'm on chapter 16 of the manga now and I'm liking it /much/ more than the slime one. Solo problem solving to discover and exploit the rules of a new and unfamiliar world, rather than being overwhelmingly OP for no clear reason and then getting thousands of powerful and consistently loyal followers, again for no clear reason.

I'm starting to see the possibility of the powers outstripping the problems though, such that being clever is no longer needed or is abstracted away as an inherent trait rather than something demonstrated in the thought process. We'll see.

**** Complaining about her (Spider) becoming OP doesn't seem take into account the fact that her future enemies are god like entities. She will stop having to use her brain to fight fodder, sure, but she will still have to use it when fighting enemies on her level.

â€‹

Sure this kind of power scaling is not great, but criticizing it because it makes her fights against weak enemies boring is short sighted. As she becomes stronger her enemies become stronger, it's a story based on game elements, that's what's expected to happen.

** Thanksgiving has come and gone. Did anyone do anything special?

We had Thanksgiving at my sister's house with my brother-in-law's family, about twelve people in all. It was pseudo-potluck, with everyone bringing a side and then mashed potatoes and turkey provided by the host. Before dinner we did games: Telestrations, Scattergories, Codenames, and Wits & Wagers. Overall a pretty good time, though my immediate family isn't always on that great of terms with each other (my parents divorced when I was 10, and their relationship is cordial at best).

It was my son's first proper Thanksgiving though, since last year he was one and a half, old enough to have a handful of words but not really old enough to express coherent thoughts. He had a lot of fun drawing turkeys and saying what he's thankful for. At one of the local parent groups someone was saying that family traditions are associated with positive outcomes, but I haven't been able to track down a source, and I'm curious whether they controlled for the obvious confounders like socioeconomic status (you'd hope so, but I don't place much faith in science without being able to read the paper and methodology myself).

** Just to let people know, I've finally fixed the issue with downloading the second set of chatlogs for the AI-Box Game.

It would have been a quick fix....if I haven't left for the Thanksgiving celebration without realizing my mistake.
