It seems to me that most rational fiction begins with a character that is already rational to some degree, but is there any that starts with a character who is not, but learns rationality as a sort of character arc?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12149957/1/The-Mind-Tailed-Fox]] tries to do this -- I attempted to start with Naruto roughly the same as he is in canon, and diverge from there -- but I'm updating it very sporadically.

** The closest I have seen is "Everbody loves large chests." It's a story about a mimic that slowly gains sapience. I'm not sure if it fully qualifies as a rational story, though it does feel fairly rational adjacent.

Note: It starts out with a lot of erotic stuff, but that generally falls away in the later chapters. I think it was originally intended to be a one off smut story that gained a life of its own, which is all sorts of meta.

** If you don't mind some erotic stuff, including some non-con and brainwashing, then I'd reccomend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid]]

A naruto fic in which Sakura suddenly finds herself in a time-loop right before the forest of death chunin exam. She starts off as pretty close to show Sakura, depending on naruto and sasuke, blah blah blah, but that quickly doesn't work anymore for her and she grows from there. I don't know if she gets more /rational/ per say, as she starts off smart even in the show, but she /Acts/ more rationally as time goes on.

***** Eh. Time loop is not a new innovation. MoL has a whole new world, a whole new magic system, completely different characters, races, creatures... It's definitely not just reskinned narutofic. :D But intelligent use of time loop obviously contains training to get strong if you have such time.

MoL is written way better and it's not porn.

I read Time Braid ages ago, but I've now been reading a bit again because of this thread. I don't really like it too much anymore. I do love time loops in general, though.

**** It's fairly tame if you ask; me lime not lemon (I might have those two mixed up whichever used to be the fanfiction for softcore/R), some extreme power exchange elements, which is often a hard stop for people, but at least one very well reasoned rational argument for poly between working professionals that I honestly admire and need to spend the time capital to make a rent paying part of my psyche.

TLDR: there are godlike character re-enacting bulfinch's mythology, but they do a better job of being good people than Zeus and Hera, also there are some power exchange elements people find squicky, but make sense for the characters; I personally want to implement something in here into my psyche, its more mature and rational than what I was raised with (an old protestant upbringing, 1st career military, 2nd carrer software male) , but It's counter to my inculcation and hard.

*** um. . . Doesnt harry go from talking the talk to /trying/ to walk the walk against a sufficiently prepared antagonist, who as a /Diabolis ex machina/ forces him to *really honestly try to walk the walk*, but win's anyways because of creative use of a technological/magical advantage that's basically a 4-5 sigma event even being on his tech tree?

The "solution" was a fair cop for a solvable mystery, but we could argue for months about if it was a realistic solution to various outside context problems, as well as who the actual actors are in the conflict considering the presence of oracles and long dead actors.

TLDR: I think I didn't spoil anything: If you haven't read HPMOR I'm either: arguing or being a pendant, about who is rational in HPMOR: go read it, then come back to this discussion. If you do so, please "@" me because otherwise I'll never see it: it's a long book, but worth it.
