** I like BoC but does it really belong on the sub? Have a hard time squaring that one. From the protagonist's perspective, he just wants to farm and becomes OP by coincidence. The animal characters definitely aren't rational.

*** I agree that it isn't a explicitly rational, and I wouldn't want to see constant posts of updates (especially since the author puts out four a week). But I personally really enjoy the updates and come back to it once a week. It's wholesome, and also a good inversion of some common xanxia tropes. My two cents - it isn't rational, but a lot of readers here may enjoy it anyway.

IMO, it fits in the weekly recommendation thread, but it doesn't need its own update threads. Still, I wouldn't want this post removed because it IS a series I think a lot of readers here would like.

**** My 2Â¢ is that, if it isn't rational, there really shouldn't be an update thread for it, and it should at least be removed for having the RT tag.

Especially because we have threads for all sorts of other things things, from non-rat fic to off-topic discussions, the other threads should be reserved for actual rational/ist fics.

*** I haven't read far enough to see whether he actually becomes OP, or is only OP because everyone around the farm is just very weak.

Not that it matters. It's a fun read, but not a rational one. Perhaps it's rational by the standard of "whatever [[/r/rational][r/rational]] likes".

i kinda give them more leeway cause they're animals, so we really don't have a baseline of how should a newly sentient animal act while being raised by what they perceive as a godly entity. The humans so far have been acting very rationally. I am biased cause i like it so much but i'd love to discuss this further.

** Jin Rou wanted to be a cultivator who defied the heavens, and surpassed all limits.

Unfortunately for him, he died, and now I'm stuck here. Arrogant young masters? Heavenly tribulations? Cultivating for days on end, then getting into life or death battles?

Yeah, no thanks. I'm getting out of here.

In which a transmigrator decides that the only winning move is not to play.

** Honestly I'm loving the vibe of this story. Extremely welcome change from the typical carnage and face slapping.
