It seems like the majority of rationalist characters I've seen have a pretty consistent load out of 'powers' regardless of setting or situation.

The best way I could describe it is it seems like they are ALWAYS very together.

Emotions might be flaring every once and a while but I can't say how often I've actually seen a character who was not very very in control of themselves.

Are these concepts just completely incompatible?

How would you approach a rationalist aspiring character that has disorders or trauma?

*** For reference, the protagonist starts out with schizoid personality disorder, by the end of the first chapter has several versions of body dysphoria, and later on has various levels of PTSD, stress, overwork, mania, impaired judgement to to those, and more; and that's without even starting in on some of the trickier bits due to high-technology. In what I'm currently writing, she may be about to [[#s][potential spoiler]], and her p-doc is moving up to major-character status.

And, through all that, she's still aspiring to rationalism, as much as she can.

**** I actually didn't notice anything that seemed like it was PTSD, even though I noticed everything else. It's probably due to a lack of knowledge on my part, but can you tell me what symptoms she was exhibiting? I'm actually planning on writing a story with on of the characters having a psychological disorder and am curious how PTSD can be demonstrated.

***** After all the death in Buffalo, the panic attacks when she saw anything that reminded her of the school (until she turned off her adrenaline) were her main symptom. Since then, avoiding her memories of the event has been the main result; the biochemical tweaking has significantly altered the normal progression of the disorder.

Technically, she's barely lived through enough subjective time to pass through 'acute stress disorder', but PTSD was what I was aiming for. And, if you recall, the "Simon" toy given by her p-doc was for a slight variant of 'eye movement desensitization and reprocessing' psychotherapy.

** Flicker from [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] and sequels. I wrote her as very much in control when she is moving at high speed, but she has to slow down to sleep and talk to people, and she frequently gets clobbered by her own emotions when she does this.

She is on the autism spectrum, has PTSD, and has been known to suffer from dissociative identity disorder.
