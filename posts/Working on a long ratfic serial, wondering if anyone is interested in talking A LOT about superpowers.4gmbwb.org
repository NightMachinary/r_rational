*[I've set up an account on Slack to handle this, on the advice of a munchkineer. If you'd like to join, then let me know the email address that you'd like for me to send the invitation to.]*

I'm currently working on a long web serial for [[/r/rational]]. The tl;dr is that it's about kids with superpowers. A longer pitch is below the line. Now that I've just about figured out the power sets for every last character, I'd like to go over them with someone from this subreddit to make sure that everything's sane, there aren't any unexpected overlaps, etc.

I should warn you, though: There are one hundred power sets to go over. We'll probably do them in sets of five or ten, but /still/.

(Once I have this step done, it should be a 4-6 weeks before I can start posting. My schedule is really flexible until September, so right now I can put several full days of work every week into finishing everything else and building a good backlog).

--------------

*The Pitch*

On 1 January 2014, one hundred thirteen-year-olds find themselves empowered with strange abilities. One can slow down time; another can see (and experience) your death in the future; a third can share thoughts with pigeons.

When the dead can be brought back to life, entropy violated, and shadows turned into tangible machinery, an extraordinary world is just around the corner. But before these kids can transform the world, they'll have to keep from destroying it--and stay safe from those who aren't willing to take the chance.

**** Ah, true. I had forgotten that. Well, just create your own sub; a few people will join and that solves the problem neatly. Or, if you'd like; you can use [[/r/changestorms]]. Given as I'm not playing in the Change Storms universe right now it would be good if there were something to help keep that sub alive. If you want to let me know and I'll make a topic post saying that it's cool.

** A /hundred/ power sets? Even if your story eventually gets to 300,000 words, that's only 1,000 words per power set, which is barely anything. You'll be spreading yourself too thin, and won't be able to fully develop these power sets. And then your readers will think you're just rambling all over the place. And /then/ your readers will stop reading.

You can also run into a situation where readers get upset because any difficulty in the storyline is overcome by someone with a different power showing up (deus ex machina). I strongly recommend you start with just 1 or 2 power sets, that way it'd be easier for readers to understand all the limitations involved and thus understand your story better. And if you really want to make rational fic, it's imperative that the limitations are well known by the reader. Code Geass and Death Note do very well in this regard: well-developed, singular powers that drive multi-season story arcs.

*** The most likely way to structure a story like this is that you focus on two or three primary characters, who get the bulk of the word count, and then have another five or six antagonists, who also get more fleshed out. Then everyone else is relegated to the back burner, mentioned in passing or as part of a larger group, or killed because they're early cannon fodder.

*** Not everyone is a point of view character, or even be on screen for very long. I /could/ start talking about just a few power sets, I guess. I'm the sort to want to get everything figured out and polished before the curtains lift, but maybe that's going overboard on a project like this.

(Though, this is also going to be closer to the length of HPMOR)

**** I should add that I think it's a fine idea to at least know what all the powers on for certain cases. For example Character A asks Knowledgable Person B who is the fastest or is there anyone who can do X? Especially where these make a difference to your setting whether they exist or not it can be important to know ahead of time.
