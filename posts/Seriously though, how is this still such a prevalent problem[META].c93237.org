** Eh, there's a colloquial usage of sentience that basically means sapience. It's kind of annoying that that is the case, but I think it's like the word literally. Another English language war we lost, not sure it's salvageable or worth the effort at this point.

*** It's a little more disconcerting when i see supposedly hyper intelligent scientist characters in fiction making these mistakes as well.

** After a look in the dictionary and from memory, sentient is often used as a synonym for conscious. I don't remember if it was you but someone in another thread said that most animals are sentient but not sapient, which is only unambiguously true if we use sentient as meaning able to feel senses rather than possessing consciousness.

*** The problem being is that so many still use sentience when they mean sapience. Sure plenty of things have feelings but true Sapience is different. One philosopher put it quite well when describing that which makes humanity different than dogs, apes and other sentient creatures (forgive me as this is all paraphrase as i'm fuzzy on details). Why is thought special? Lizards think about their environment. Apes think about themselves and others. These are not special to humanity. What truly sets us apart, makes us special, is our observation of our observation of ourselves. We can think about the fact that we think about ourselves and even think about that.

I don't think i put it anywhere near as eloquently as the original author, whose name escapes me, but I think it makes my point.

There is a difference between being conscious and higher consciousness. A true line between sentience and sapience.

** I've always taken 'sentience' to mean sentience, in the stories I've read here. 'Sapience' is rarely used, but 'self-awareness' is common.

Maybe some authors aren't native speakers.

** What bothers me even more is that in the the star wars EU books, the definitions are swapped. And it's not just a mistake, all of the ones I've found are like that. So I think it is part of galactic basic's dictionary.

**** It is. I usually use the phrase "moral actor" when I want to talk about something or someone with the capacity to make decisions and understand why they are or are not moral. This usually is more or less equivalent to personhood imo.

** I'd like you to watch this 20-second clip.

Okay so

1) The hiss is not aggression, the hiss is an indication of fear. You do NOT punish that animal. That is an animal who has less than zero experience with having been exposed to human punishment. It has never been punished. Bop it on the nose and it bops your jugular open.

2) You can see that there's a toy in the midst of the damage, meaning the animal was playing with its toy when it broke the furniture.

3) She knows that the human knows that she's the one who broke the furniture, and that doing such a thing is likely to upset the human.

I haven't drank in a while and this thread has already been removed but I just wanted to say that all you "rationalist" types who think you understand brains and cognition and whatever are just as stupid as religionists, all brains are brains and brains brain just like livers detoxify and stomachs digest. There's nothing magical about the human brain that elevates us above the other animals, you're just an animal, we're not special, the glob of jelly-flesh in your skull isn't even the most complex glob of jelly-flesh on this planet in comparison to dolphins, and I'd wager that ravens and elephants and most of the apes and most of the parrots and most of the whales would be capable of just as much "meta-cognition" - or whatever it is that you people think is somehow special - as we are if they had thumbs with which to invent language, there are statistically probably fuckin 12 planets in this galaxy alone with animals who have brains as complex as or more complex than a dolphin who also had our happy accident of the thumb, sapience is an imaginary word to denote the imaginary quality of human specialness, like "oh man we think about ourselves and we think about the fact that we think about ourselves and we think about the fact that we think about the fact that we think about ourselves, oh man how fucking special," do you know that the true feral children we've found aren't like Mowgli or Tarzan or any other Victorian bullshit - from back when science still thought there was a human soul that would make a human a human no matter what - the real feral children aren't capable of learning language if they're caught much later than age 6 and they growl and walk around on all fours and act like an animal. What separates you from the rest of the animals isn't your magical special big brain, it's culturally transmitted information,

eh whatever i'm done
