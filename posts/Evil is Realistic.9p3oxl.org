tl;dr:

this is writing advice, not moral philosophy, and should be interpreted as such:

- Your villain can burn down the village of innocent peasants while cackling madly about how he hopes the hero suffers for eternity when he sees what his pathetic rebellion has wrought, and still be a very realistic character. If your villain is the tyrant king or emperor du jour, then it might be /un/realistic for your villain not to behave this way.

- Your villain's motivations can be primarily abhorrent, selfish, egotistical, and narcissistic, and still be a very compelling, complex, fully-realized, three-dimensional character. Depending on the nature of your story, it might be /harder/ for your villain to be compelling, complex, etc., without also having only "bad" motivations.

- Even if you want to have villains who are much more multidimensional in terms of their moral qualities, e.g., Prince Zuko, their role in the story might be much more compelling if they are backed up by a more "straight" villain, e.g., Fire Lord Ozai.

- If your story's conflicts are heavily centered around action sequences, e.g., A:tLA, Worm, Star Wars, etc., then the best villain is probably one who is most willing and able to physically attack the heroes. If you try to explain why your villain is trying to kill the bright-eyed, innocent hero who just wants to help people, then it is probably easiest and most plausible to say that your villain is on the "evil" side.

- Your villain can be blatantly "evil" and moreover, irredeemable, while also being so subtle, complex, multifaceted, interesting, cool, and full of potential that they leap off the page and fascinate your audience, e.g., Azula, Prof. Quirrell, etc.

- There are many ways to develop a villain's character without ever making it seem like they will not be a bad guy forever and always. Indeed, your villain should be developed in new ways in every scene, just like the hero. But if you develop the villain into a non-villain through their moral growth or their defeat, then either the story should be ending soon, or another villain should immediately fill the gap.

- If your villain cannot or will not threaten the heroes in the maximal way that the type of story allows for once per episode, then your story will struggle to develop its characters and its plot no matter how otherwise awesome and excellent your story is, because characters and plot develop through conflict.

Of the many crippling flaws that mar the /The Dragon Prince/, the one that seems to constitute a conceptual failure rather than a failure of execution is how the villain is handled. Or, rather, the lack of villain---because this is a story where there Are No Bad Guys.

Somehow it's become popular, especially when discussing action-oriented fantasy and sci-fi, to praise the idea of villains who have sympathetic motives. At best this is a tautology: “Have your villains be realistic instead of cartoony, unless you are writing something cartoony.” At worst, this advice flies in the face of almost every actual popular villain ever, and leads to situations like that of /The Dragon Prince/, in which a lack of evil villains means the good guys have no obstacles to overcome, and the story is devoid of tension as a result.

Let's talk theory before looking at the specific implementation in /The Dragon Prince/. While people praise the /idea/ of complex, three-dimensional villains whose motives can't be summed up as “because he's evil,” the villains people actually praise are pretty damn evil. Sauron is basically just a big old pile of evil. Darth Vader blows up a planet for basically no reason. Agent Smith wants to wipe out humanity. Anton Chigurh is a psychopathic killer who murders someone just to test his makeshift gun. Canon!Voldemort and Rational!Voldemort commit mass murder without feeling and are /literally incapable of understanding love./

You might have noticed some pretty complex characters on that list. Darth Vader ultimately redeems himself. Anton Chigurh has a philosophy and won't kill people if it would violate that philosophy. Professor Quirrell had people convinced right up to the end that he was actually a good guy deep down. Agent Smith has a sympathetic quality, mirroring Neo in how he feels trapped inside the Matrix. These traits definitely make these villains more memorable. But they do /not/ mean the villains aren't /basically pure evil./

(And Sauron /is/ just evil; I don't care what the Silmarillion or whatever might have to say about it, in the movies he's literally a burning eye of pure evil and everyone loved the movies.)

Narratively, first and foremost, a villain needs to provide seemingly insurmountable obstacles to the protagonist. Being pure fucking evil is a really convenient way to get someone to fight a hero who's trying to save the world. Why do romances so often portray people with some kind of class or cultural barrier to their union? Why do mystery novels so often concern murders and not, say, anomalies turned up by financial audits? Some things just work better for a genre and create a more exciting story.

/Realistically/, a lot of evil in the world boils down to evil motivations. Of course a villain should have /motivations/---but those motivations can be evil. People really do do things horrible things for power, for money, because they're psychopaths, or because they just don't care about anyone. When Darth Vader blows up a planet full of billions of people just to teach Princess Leia not to fuck with him, /that's realistic./ When Sauron tries to conquer the world /just because he wants to own everything/, that's realistic. When Voldemort kills people because he can and it feels like nothing, that's realistic.

The list of realistic, three-dimensional people /includes/ mass-murdering tyrants obsessed with money, power and giant statues of themselves and caring nothing for how their actions affect anyone else. We know that because of history. If your Literally Just Evil dark overlords aren't coming off as believable and realistic, that's because you're failing as a writer to portray them that way, not because that type of person isn't extremely common throughout history.

And if you try to write your villains as not motivated by evil but instead as trying to do good as most of us would understand it, well that can work fine for certain stories, but it can make things very difficult for other stories. There's a reason traditional fantasy stories are associated with “unrealistic” Evil Emperors---that type of villain works /really well/ in a typical heroic action-adventure fantasy story.

/The Dragon Prince/ is easily compared to /Avatar: The Last Airbender/, and luckily, the latter provides some instructive examples. There are five major villains in A:tLA: Zuko, Admiral Zhao, Azula, Long Feng, and Fire Lord Ozai.

Of these five villains, Zuko and Azula are the “complex, realistic” ones, and Zhao, Feng, and Ozai are the Pure Evil ones. What's instructive is in how the Pure Evil ones step in to supplement Zuko and Azula when their complexities or the needs of the plot prevent the siblings from providing sufficiently threatening obstacles to the heroes.

At first, Zuko seems like the bad guy antagonist who's going to fruitlessly chase around Aang and company every Saturday. But it doesn't take long for his more complex and sympathetic characteristics to surface, at which point Zhao is introduced. Zhao is not just an ontological ball of pure evil. He has motivations---his motivations are /power and status/, which are /evil/ motivations, or at the very least drive him to do evil things for immoral reasons. He cares nothing for the people he hurts, nor that his aims are selfish and egotistical. He wants power, and he'll kill to get it.

Zhao accomplishes the /main and primary/ task any antagonist in a story like A:tLA needs to do, which is /attempt to violently defeat the protagonist once per episode./ Any question of his personality or moral character is, from a question of narrative functionality, secondary to his role in supporting the development of /Aang's/ personality and moral character, and other aspect of the main characters' development, through /being the story's main obstacle./ There is more to Zhao's character, which I'll discuss later---but even if there wasn't, Zhao would be at least functional as a character. But if Zhao didn't first and foremost serve as the major immediate source of tension and threat, then he would not be functional no matter how deep or complex his character is.

At the end of season 1, Zhao gets a sympathetic moment, pridefully refusing Zuko's attempt to save him from the ocean spirit and seemingly accepting his fate. But note that this is /after/ Zhao's defeat, when he no longer functions as a villain, unable to pose challenges to the currently unstoppable force that is Aang.

At the start of season 2, Zhao is dead and Zuko not really a villain. Thus we get the introduction of Azula, a psychopath who's quite happy to murder her own brother. (Our actual first sight of her is in the finale of the previous season, where she clenches her fist excitedly and looks on with eager delight as Zuko gets burned by his father.) Azula plays the role of the immediate source of tension and threat until the heroes reach Ba Sing Se, where they are too insulated from the Fire Nation's reach for Azula to be a plausible enemy. The Dai Lee and their leader, Long Feng, are immediately introduced and play the role of the immediate source of tension and threat until the season finale.

In season 3, the Fire Nation believes Aang is dead and aren't actively looking for him. The main heroes have some relatively low-stakes adventures like in “The Painted Lady” and “Sokka's Master.” Still, Sparky Sparky Boom Man provides the immediate source of tension and threat while the heroes develop their characters and enjoy the last bit of low-tension adventures before the epic series of final episodes. But it's Zuko who's going through the biggest challenge and changes, and so it's he who faces the greatest immediate source of threat and tension: Fire Lord Ozai. Zuko and Azula both suspect that Aang is alive, but Ozai does not know this. The impending reveal of the Avatar's existence is like the guillotine blade raised high above Zuko's neck.

Once the tension between Zuko and Ozai finally snaps into actual conflict, the story segues right after into a series of field trips with Zuko by way of resolving the conflict with Sparky Sparky Boom Man, his defeat allowing the transition to take place. When the main storyline resumes, it is Ozai providing the immediate threat and tension, and it resumes /because/ they learn of the imminent threat he poses to the Earth Kingdom's forests---and when he is defeated and no more immediate sources of threat and tension remain, /the story ends./

Admiral Zhao, Long Feng, and Fire Lord Ozai are like straight men in a comedy team. By being straight villains, they let the, um, “funny villains” Zuko and Azula make you laugh so hard you cry, to continue the metaphor. (“That's rough, buddy.”) It's easy to think of them as “the not funny ones,” but in fact they're an integral part of the team and the job of writing them is just as hard and demanding.

A:tLA is a story with morally complex, three dimensional, realistic and intriguing characters, even its villains. /But at no point does it let its heroes go without an immediate source of threat and tension. In every single episode you can name exactly what their current greatest danger is and how close it is to killing them/ */right now./*

A:tLA does have plenty of relatively low-tension episodes where the immediate threat isn't so threatening. One of my favorites is when they meet the fortune teller. It's fun, character-building silliness that I enjoy. Of course, even then there's still an active volcano about to explode.

A few other examples: In “The Southern Air Temple,” Aang's volatile emotional state is dangerous. In “The King of Omashu,” Aang's friends are (apparently) in danger. In “the Great Divide,” um, I forget. In “Avatar Day,” Aang's character is strong enough that his guilt is a source of tension, and the setting is strong enough that Avatar Kyoshi lore is fascinating. But “Avatar Day” happens in the second season for a reason, and it /still/ starts and ends with the Fire Nation attacking!

By contrast, /The Dragon Prince/ fails in this regard. The episodes dealing with the elf attack have no tension because a) we don't care about the threatened character, who has no goals and no significant emotional bond yet established with the ignorant and helpless main duo, and b) defeating the elves is stated to be impossible, so there is no tension. Tension depends on /hope./ “Aang and Katara are surrounded in the crystal caverns under the Earth Kingdom, I /hope/ they can make it out okay”---that's tension. “Aang and Katara are definitely going to die no matter what”---that's not. Most importantly, we have no reason to care whether humans or elves triumph, whereas we're definitely rooting for Aang and Katara.

And after that, the main trio never really encounter any significant threats. Rayla has the threat of the bind on her wrist, but it only motivates the actions of her character in a single episode. There are various environmental hazards that the trio pass through, but they deal with them in a fairly flippant and low-stakes manner. The scariest is the situation climbing over the snowy mountain, before it's trivialized by a little boy successfully swimming through ice-cold water, finding and carrying up the heavy egg, and being totally fine afterward---and this is /after/ him complaining of the egg's weight and of being hungry in the very same episode!

If the show wasn't going to take its environmental hazards seriously, then it needed a human antagonist. That should have been Viren, the dark wizard advisor to the king, who has a weak goatee and doesn't ever stroke it. But that's the problem---the show is so determined to have its villain be a totally reasonable person trying to do good who ends up making evil choices out of imperfect information and minor but decisive character flaws that it's unable to /activate/ Viren as a villain. By the end of the season, /Viren has done/ nothing /to oppose the protagonists./ That is, without a doubt, /The Dragon Prince's/ major flaw. The other (serious and crippling) issues are all fixable. But if the series is determined to make sure that Viren can only do bad things if it sort of seems like a good idea if you're ignorant and a bit selfish and egotistical, then the show is going to have a really hard time having Viren provide an immediate source of threat and tension that matches the demands of an epic fantasy adventure.

(He could have a lieutenant whom he tasks to retrieve the egg, and then the lieutenant could be a total psycho. But then you still just have an evil antagonist, so why not have it be Viren? And the evil lieutenant is less threatening if we know that his actions will be reprimanded by Viren once he finds out. Every Fire Nation antagonist by contrast is threatening because they're backed up by the entire Fire Nation in principle, with Pure Evil Fire Lord Ozai the ultimate source of this. It's this background of constant evil that allows more complex villains like Zuko and Azula to be at the fore so constantly---their sympathetic and layered qualities don't detract from the ultimate threat.)

In fact, Viren /does/ have lieutenants he sends off to stop the heroes: his children, Claudia and Soren. But again, they have to be good guys doing bad things out of ignorance and personal characteristics, in their case, loving and trusting their father, which means a) the series has to spend time developing Claudia and Soren instead of focusing on the heroes, and b) Claudia and Soren are limited in the kinds of threats they can throw at the heroes. Claudia isn't going to torture Callum with dark magic. Soren isn't going to swing his sword at little Ezran. The only character the nice guy villains can really threaten is Rayla, which is /the/ primary reason her character works better and gets more development than Callum and Ezran's. A protagonist is developed and has their place in the story determined primarily by their conflicts. If a character can't experience much conflict because everyone likes them and basically shares their moral values, then the character has little role in the story, no matter how much screen time or how many lines of dialogue they have.

And so in fact by the end of the first season, Claudia and Soren have gotten as far as /almost starting to chase after the heroes./ They could have been written out of the first season with almost no disruption to the conflicts the heroes experience.

Another source of conflict is General Amaya. Probably everyone's favorite character, she combines level-headed pragmatism and excellent combat skills with touching concern for her nephews and a good read on Viren's character. (Though not good enough.) Her use of sign language makes her distinct and memorable. But in the episode where she plays the role as the immediate source of threat and tension, it's limited by the fact that only Rayla is really in danger. Callum and Ezran have almost nothing at stake. It's not entirely clear why they can't request a private conversation with her and explain the situation. In fact, by not doing so they seem to be trusting an elf over their own aunt.

The final immediate source of threat and tension is the monsters guarding the path up the mountain where the healer lives. After a seemingly deliberately light-hearted battle against a giant worm or something, the heroes encounter some genuinely scary webs and a frightening spider enemy. But of course, no bad guys here---it's just some illusions after all. The heroes waltz on up to the top. No tension.

Everything about /The Dragon Prince/ seems fixable except for this. As long as the show is determined to have all of its conflicts be resolvable if the characters would just share information and reiterate their shared values, it will struggle to threaten its characters. And if it can't threaten its characters, it won't be able to develop them. Only Rayla is really ever threatened, and only she gets some development. (It's not great development, but the threats against her aren't that exciting either.)

ugh that was too much typing

So now what? Do you give in to overly simplistic villains and moral portrayals and have your villains cackle while eating babies and burning villages full of old people?

nah dude. y u gotta be so extreme with ur reactions?

like, just keep reading

--------------

Let's look at General Zhao again. Zhao is evil. Zhao's /job/ is to be evil; if he's not plausibly about to capture the Avatar or taking steps to do so in every scene, then he better be done with his role as antagonist, which is exactly what is going on when he refuses Zuko's offered hand of (unlikely) rescue at the end.

But Zhao is not a one-dimensional character with no personality. We see the way he respects Iroh but also thinks of him as past his prime. Still, he's happy to accept Iroh as a strategic planner during the siege of the north and listens to his advice. We see him needle Zuko, partly out of ambition and partly out of inclination. We see how easily he himself gives into anger, and the source of his strength as a firebender and the limits of that strength. When he wants the super-archers in that one episode, he doesn't try to find a way around the other officer's superior authority. When his authority becomes superior, he smugly demands his archers---but doesn't gloat or punish the officer who previously denied him. We seem him burn with ambition, we see him smartly deduce the identity of the Blue Spirit. We see his military vision nearly take the Northern Water Tribe for the Fire Nation, and we see his pride and dismissal of spiritual matters drive him to kill the magic fish spirit when Iroh threatens him, ultimately undoing everything, mirroring the way that his anger prevented him from learning all that Jeong Jeong had to teach. Finally, we see him refuse Zuko's hand out of pride and maybe acceptance of his fate and the consequences of his decisions.

Zhao is a very effective and entertaining character. He wouldn't be if he was just “POWER EVIL POWER EVIL CAPTURE THE AVATAR” all day long. All of these subtle aspects to his personality make him human and engaging. Every time we see him on screen, we either see a new aspect of him or come to better understand a part of him we already knew. /But these things don't stop him from being evil and having evil motivations./

Please---have your villains be complex, multifaceted, bursting with personality and constantly developing and showing off new sides of themselves throughout the story. Just have them also be fucking evil.

Azula is another example, of course. She has a very different approach to power than Zhao does, as symbolized by her controlled blue flame and deadly lightning. She has her interactions with Mai and Ty Lee, her relationship with Zu-Zu, her attitude toward Iroh, her very different attitude toward her father, her difficult relationship with her mother, her brilliance as a tactician and a fighter, her psychological perception and cunning, her perfectionist attitude, her collapse into paranoia, her genre-savvy awareness of the Avatar State's transformation-sequence weakness, and probably a dozen other things---

In the first episode that she's introduced, she tries to kill her brother. In the last episode, she tries to kill her brother. /That's Azula's job in the narrative. The rest is icing, decorations---the difference between the perfect cake that is A:tLA and a shitty generic store-bought cake mix, but/ */not the main thing./*

The A:tLA strategy of /threat first, complex moral character second/ is seen in other popular series. Vader is played straight at first---the plan of him being Luke's father and getting redeemed didn't exist in the first movie. He's just a scary bad guy who blows up a planet to make a princess feel bad. By the time he starts to become seriously complex and consequently less threatening, the Emperor is there to fill the role of Just Pure Evil Bad Guy. Chigurh is an incomprehensible force of evil at first before we start to understand his philosophy. Quirrell, by contrast, gets more evil as the story goes on---but HPMOR isn't a typical fantasy story. (Still, notice that Quirrell becomes the main source of threat in the story once Harry has convincingly overcome his schoolmates, the Dementors, and the Wizengamot, the only other major sources of conflict.)

Even when Vader was Just A Bad Guy, he had a personality. The way he choked a guy for poking fun at the Jedi, his cool, distinctive suit and voice, his insistence on personally facing Obi-Wan and the way he personally flies out to protect the Death Star and his exceptional success in doing so, his tragic and mysterious backstory as a fallen Jedi and friend of Obi-wan, his murderousness, the lie he tells Leia, his strategy for letting the Millennium Falcon escape so they can track it, and other things all make him much more interesting than a guy who's only line of dialogue is “MUST KILL GOOD GUYS MUST KILL GOOD GUYS.” I'm just saying that if that /was/ his only line of dialogue, the story would still work.

(Chigurh has his voice, his unique weapon, his stare, his efficiency, his unstoppable quality, the coin-flipping stuff, his philosophy. But primarily, he's the evil killer. Agent Smith has his suit and glasses, his drawl, his “Mr. Anderson,” his neck-cracking, his conversations with Morpheus, his determinist philosophy and need to prove something to Neo, his taking off the communication device, probably other stuff---but primarily, he's the unstoppable agent of the system Neo has to overcome. Sauron is characterized in a "bad" way, lots of tell and relatively little show. He's also incredibly iconic, so make of that what you will. It's all shown in how others speak of him and react to the idea of him.)

If you compare this to Viren, /The Dragon Prince/ spends so much time explaining /why/ Viren would do evil things that it never gets around to him actually /doing/ anything evil.

Give your villains as much personality as you can. Please. Layer them as deeply and complexly as your story will allow. Just don't actually let your story not have a villain. It needs one. Really. I promise.

And frankly, it's just hard to have your villains do evil things but be good guys. Good people who end up slaughtering thousands of innocents while cackling madly /messed up/ somewhere along the way, and it's hard to have that failure be logical. Mostly, people with good intentions should act like the heroes, because obviously, especially when the choices are very stark fantasy choices like “should we start a war or prevent a war?” The show handles Viren by having him give an earnest, noble speech, and then having him do something blatantly evil. Then another earnest speech, then blatant evil. He ends up feeling schizophrenic, or really, as if he's being written by two different writers who have been given completely different instructions for his character. He's supposed to be a pragmatic consequentialist who consorts with dark powers in the hopes that they'll prove useful to the kingdom and humanity---but at the end of the season, he traps a guy in a coin for who-knows-what-reason and emerges looking like he had fusion sex with a nightmare demon.

And he /still/ doesn't actually do anything to the heroes before the season ends!

(Contrast with Zuko a good guy deep down---who notably begins as a villain and becomes good rather than the other way around. He fails to do good at first because he believes propaganda about the Fire Nation benefiting the other nations by taking them over, and he hasn't seen the true effects of their conquest. Once he sees how the people of other nations really are and what the Fire Nation does when it shows up, he begins to realize that burning people's villages and slaughtering them isn't the path toward peace and prosperity. Whereas Viren would have to be convinced that burning villages is totally a great way to help people. Much harder to do. The obvious way is that his desire for power blinds him, but then he's basically a bad guy all along and that lurking character flaw should be clear from the start; we should be able to tell, at least in a rewatch, from his first scene that his utilitarianism is a rationalization for power, even if he himself isn't aware of it.)

Ultimately, /The Dragon Prince/ feels like an extended prologue, not a proper first season. A big reason for this is that the villains never actually /start./ By trying to have its villains be good people trying to do the right thing, the show struggles and ultimately fails to come up with any reason for them to do anything evil. And without villains, the show can't threaten its characters in convincing or compelling ways, and without threats and the tension and conflict they give rise to, the characters are unable to be developed beyond their initial portrayals. The result is a show that just doesn't work.

couple of random examples:

Southern generals were beloved by their men for their gentle manners and also fought in defense of bleeping slavery. so another real life example of good personality and humanizing qualities while also being pretty evil.

*Worm Spoilers* No one would say that Worm is black and white or lacking in nuance or subtlety. But Taylor's enemies range from criminal gangs to Nazis to the f!@#ing Slaughterhouse Nine and things that are literally called Endbringers which exist purely for destruction and chaos. Scion's story is sad, but at the end of the day, he literally is trying to destroy all of humanity. There was even an argument about this on the subreddit. IIRC, some people were like “so I guess Purity is actually kind of good because she likes her kid or whatever” because that's the pattern-matching thing in which “evil” = “character with absolutely no redeeming qualities or humanizing traits whatsoever” and Wigglytuff was all like “what no lol she's a frixing nazi”. Hitler isn't a morally grey character because he was good with kids or kind to animals. *End Worm Spoilers*

Thanos: Thanos is a dumb guy with no personality whose entire job is to show up and fight avengers until people get bored of watching him fight avengers. They could've tried to give him a personality or something, although there's only so much you can do within the limits of the Marvel universe. But instead they tried to make him a complex and morally grey villain by having him be a daddy and having him want to kill everyone to, like, end resource problems or whatever. The result is a villain with confusing and outright stupid motivations that just detracts from the fun of the punchfest without making Thanos even slightly more interesting, complex, or realistic, if anything it does the opposite.

List your own examples in the comments. If I like yours, I'll kill your whole family!


** I agree with almost all of this, except for the argument against Thanos. Thanos was, in my opinion, and in the opinion of most of the people I know, one of the best things about Infinity War, because of how well he was characterized.

Thanos is, in my opinion, your example of a pure evil villain done right. Thanos is evil. His motivations are evil. The fact that he thinks he is right doesn't make his motivations any less evil, but it also leaves him acting a lot more human that other classic superhero movie villains, and that came off pretty well.

He even fits the universe. Thor is thousands of years old, but still acts like a normal person, so this is a world where immortality and time doesn't necessarily lead to ever escalating emotional maturity and wisdom. The idea that a Thor-style immortal could watch his entire planet- his entire species- self-destruct due to overpopulation, and come out of that obsessed with 'saving the universe' by doing everything he could to fight over-population, felt realistic to me. It even fit with the rest of the Marvel universe, and even felt like an escalation of already established themes; Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron are both films that either start, or have their main conflict defined by characters going way too far in their quest to "save the world".

Thanos isn't meant to just turn up and punch the avengers until we all get bored. That's not the kind of villain he is. That's not the kind of villain you foreshadow in the first Avengers film and then spend the rest of the franchise planting little teasers about. Thanos, in my opinion, serves as a worthy ultimate villain of the franchise precisely because of how he was characterized.

Tony wants to save the world, and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. He invents Ultron, an AI based on alien technology he doesn't fully understand, against the advice of the only other expert he consulted (Bruce wanted to ask the team), and nearly caused the extinction of the entire human race. Hydra (at least in the Winter Soldier) wants to save the world; they want to protect people from the dangers of freedom, and create a safer Earth by enforcing Order all over the globe; and they do some pretty messed up things in order to try and achieve that goal. Killmonger wants to protect/liberate/promote his people, and, again, is willing to do some pretty messed up things in order to achieve what is actually a pretty messed up goal, but, again, is one you can easily see him viewing as noble.

Civil War is essentially an entire movie based around the idea of people having two separate ideas of what is good and right, and coming to blows over it.

Thanos is a good ultimate villain for the franchise, because he takes these themes, and runs with them, taking them new and unexplored heights. How evil could someones goal be, while still allowing them to think they're a hero acting in the best interests of everyone? How psychopathic could someones actions be, and yet still let themselves pretend they're the hero of the story? Thanos is meant to be the answer to that, the series final examination of the ideas that have permeated so many of the films leading up to this. His characterization, and the time spent on it, was necessary for him to fulfill that purpose, and considering how well the film was received, I think it worked pretty well.

TL:DR - I think Thanos is an example of a realistic villain done right, not an example of how "evil is realistic" would have been better.

*** Movie!Thanos' motivations are easy to follow, but they fall down when examined in the light of collecting all the Infinity Stones. The Stones could easily rewrite the universe to have twice the resources, or give every civilization, knowledge, and tools capable of letting them use far fewer resources. He could be the greatest savior in the history of, well, ever. But no, he's gonna kill half the universe because he can't be arsed to take three seconds to think of alternatives.

In the comics, it's easier - Thanos would do that because he's not sympathetic, he's a dick. He could think of all the alternate ways to use the Stones and still go with killing untold numbers of beings because he just really, really, really likes killing.

He spent centuries coming up with and implementing this plan the hard way, and he finally discovers and gets his hands on the perfect tool to do it all at once.

To even consider that he might be wrong at that point would mean admitting to himself that he has been a mass murderer for centuries because he was mistaken (and didn't understand the concept of population rebound).

Not even the Infinity Stones can provide enough wisdom to let someone do that easily.

**** Just to be certain, when you say "But no, he's gonna kill half the universe because he can't be arsed to take three seconds to think of alternatives." you *ARE* referring to the three seconds he has after acquiring the last stone before Thor rainbow-ports in and chucks a god-slaying lightning axe at him, yes?

Because, while I disagree with his entire line of thinking, it's kinda moot until he actually has all the stones, and he never gets to test to see what their limits are before /yet another guy/ appears and tries to kill him. Except, unlike the last 30, he manages to take a critical wound from Thor and has only a few seconds left before he dies to make his Wish.

**** Good points, but I think marvel kind of has its bases covered here with what it can do to make Thanos make more sense. Thanos seems to have come from a highly advanced civilization (going from the tech they had going on in the brief snippet we've seen, and that he seems to be immortal, and almost all the immortal aliens in the franchise seem to be hyper-advanced). So he a lot of reason to believe that having more technology and knowledge isn't the solution. And creating more resources is just as bad a solution as killing off half the universe, if you're main goal is to stop overpopulation and you can only make one 'wish ' (seeing as the infinity gauntlet seemed pretty wrecked after the snap). Thanos is wrong, of course, but I think there aren't as many wholes in his logic as people tend to assume, once you actually examine the backstory marvel gave him.

**** I think it is because Thanos is traumatised by the death of Titan, obsessed with it.

At the time, He didn't have infinite power. So his solution wasn't to double the resources, he couldnt. He wanted to half the population.

But he sees he needs to fix that problem that exists on other worlds. So he goes after the means to do so. He gets an army, followers, etc. And he starts to massacre worlds like Gamora's. He looks for powers to do more. So he discovers the Infinity Stones and attempts to gather them, And use them to continue his goal.

At this point he is set in his ways. He has been doing it for decades. He believes he is right, despite what the rest of the universe says. He plants his feet and says "you move".

Which is part of my problem with Cap in Civil War. Sure he was right. But what about the next time? Or the next? Eventually he will be wrong. Thanos is wrong, but he believes he is right.

*** Potentially surprising assertion: Thanos is the *protagonist* of /Avengers: Infinity War - Part 1/.

A /potentially/ convincing argument: you can look for a hero's journey arc for him, and you'll find it. Refusal of the Call, Meeting with the Goddess, Apotheosis, Refusal of the Return, Freedom to Live, etc. It's all there.

A knock-down argument: at the end of the movie, there's a card that says "Thanos will return in /Avengers: Infinity War - Part 2/." The only time that card has ever been used, so far in the MCU canon, is in a heroic (rather than epic) story, to say that the protagonist of the story (the eponymous hero) will get another movie.

The question of whether /Avengers: Infinity War - Part 2/ will continue on with Thanos as protagonist, is left open to interpretation. I have a feeling it will---just being told in the mode of tragedy. (Hamlet is the protagonist of /Hamlet/.)

**** Well Thanos's planet looked hyper-advanced, and still managed to wipe itself out with overpopulation, despite what every trend on Earth tells us about the effects of technological advancement and wealth on population growth, so we can assume that humans are a special case (population growth wise), in this universe. And creating more resources doesn't solve the underlying problem, as you can only use the Infinity Gauntlet once (seeing as how it broke immediately after the snap). Thanos believes that life will always eventually outpace the amount of resources given to it, and that he only gets one-shot at saving the world, so from his point of view it's easy to see why he immediately rules out creating more resources. (The irony here is that creating more resources has the exact same flaw as killing half of all life; eventually life will catch back up). He's still wrong though, that's why he's the villain. But I don't think there are as many holes in his logic as people tend to assume. I'm not arguing that Thanos's plan is super logical, or even rational. I'm just saying that it's easy to look at the backstory they gave him (and the kind of trauma that would cause), look at the tools he has, and kind of understand why someone who actually deserves the title the Mad Titan (emphasis on the Mad part) would come to the conclusion he did.

I'm still kind of assuming they're going to go more into what the Infinity Gauntlet is, and what it's limits are, in the next Avengers film, revealing a ton of information that might make our entire argument invalid. Every time Thanos warped reality, it eventually faded (e.g Mantis didn't stay a pile of rocks on the ground forever). Maybe it can't create something out of nothing in the MCU, so doubling resources wasn't possible? Maybe it could not only do that, but create a never ending fountain of food, and Thanos just didn't think of it? Who knows?

I think that, given how the MCU changed Thanos and his motivations, they're probably going to change some stuff about the Gauntlet and how it works, to make those motivations make more sense. After all, from what I remember from my vague readings of the comics, the Gauntlet isn't supposed to break after one use, so already things are different from the comics.

***** Your making up some nice headcanon as to why the overpopulation argument works in the movie.

However, there's really only four answers.

Yours is the first, and most unlikely. Apparently their entire universe ignores all the learning we have on overpopulation, and it was designed to be this way for some weird reason.

The second is that Thanos is /insane/. In fact, he's called the "Mad Titan", so there's a lot more support for this. He went through a traumatic experience that shaped his younger life, and from that he has built his entire worldview. He tested his beliefs and found that they seemed to work (Gamora's homeworld), so decided to keep increasing the scale. This is one of those "Category Error" situations where someone has failed to understand the true nature of the problem, and by sheer chance or other influences they don't understand their response /seems/ to work, so they just upscale it... until it doesn't.

The third is that the /writers/ believe that the Overpopulation is a thing in reality, and are letting their biases bleed through to their work. Either this is because they don't actually know any better, or because they have some ethical or political agenda.

The fourth is that the writers /originally/ had a different motivation in mind, but had to change it for some reason (quite possibly dovetailing with three). For what little evidence I can think of for this is in the first Avengers movie, the mid-credits scene where his advisor tells him that to challenge the Avengers is "to court Death", followed by Thanos' big cheesy grin. This is more in line with the comics, and probably was the original intent until they had to re-write it for some reason--perhaps because of their beliefs, or perhaps they didn't want such a far out there motivation. Or likely because they don't have the rights to a certain character. The last and most likely is simply that the writers have changed over the years, and what Group A intended might not be what Group F chooses to implement.

As it stands, the second, third, and fourth reasons are not mutually exclusive. Any of them can be true or not true in any combination and it would still apply.

****** Well, their entire universe has kind of been shown to ignore all the learning we have. I thinks it's just one of those suspension of disbelief things, that sometimes you just have to take into account when watching some fiction.

Thanos says overpopulation is an existential threat to even advanced, high tech life, seems reasonably intelligent throughout the film, and has spent centuries (I assume) taking action to stop it. He even gives examples in the film, of how not only his planet was destroyed by overpopulation, but also how Gamora's planet was on the brink of succumbing to the same issue before he 'saved' it, so we can reasonably assume that, in his travels, he's seen many such planets going down his old home-worlds path, and so had his beliefs reaffirmed.

I just took it to be suspension of disbelief, which is kind of also basically the exact same thing as your third point. If the writers believe that overpopulation is a thing in reality, and are letting it bleed into their work... then in the MCU, overpopulation is a thing, because it is the writers that determine the laws of their created universe, not actual science. So my head-canon, I think, looks very similar to your third point, when you look at how they actually affect how we should interpret Thanos's place in the story, and the sanity of his plan. So I don't really think you can separate my argument from yours in a way that actually matters. (Which means we agree :D )

I do think the 'to court Death' thing is good evidence for your fourth point, but I think they probably changed that motivation long ago enough to have put some serious thought into Thanos (though it also could have been multi-purpose; with so many big purple villains, they may have just wanted a way to clearly signify that this was Thanos, and never actually intended to use his OG motivation).

I agree almost completely with your third point (in fact it's part of my head-canon). I agree that Thanos definitely is mad. I just don't think he's stupid and that, within his less than sane world view, he actually behaves pretty rationally and realistically, and that makes him a good villain.

******* I dismiss it because it stabilizes either naturally or unnaturally.

In nature, a balance is established due to the effects of predators and prey and resources, barring an invasive species. In the case of the latter, it focuses more on the supply and demand side of necessary resources. IE: There will be a boom, then a bust, followed by smaller versions until parity is reached or the entire population dies off. In a normal scenario its more of a see-saw effect. These clearly don't work 100% of the time with sapient beings by dint of the fact that they are sapient. Thus, the second option.

Humans tend to have overpopulation only due to finding a new equilibrium with their environment. In most cases, the groundwork is laid down in a culture that has a high birth rate due to high mortality. When that culture transitions to a safer environment, via technological advancement and/or destruction of its mortal threats, it tends to take awhile for the cultural need for large numbers of children to lessen. During that time it suffers from overpopulation issues. Once the need dies down, however, a more reasonable balance is made.

This is why the birth rate is lower in more advanced countries. They don't /need/ as many children to replace their losses, because there aren't any, and life can be more about ends other than survival.

The same would occur in a hypothetical future or alien world that in any way follows similar principles of survival and advancement. One COULD say that some alien race may not have the same groundwork, but doing so means the overpopulation argument doesn't either.

I'm worried about the shape of the first bust. In that period human condition will deteriorate and we will live in poverty for decades. Human society needs a sizable number of professionals to function correctly, if new generations are too small, a sufficient number of professionals might not be available. This will lead to cascade effect where we produce even less resources to sustain itself and the bust keep going down to the Middle Ages.

In case of resource increase populations will continue to grow undisturbed, and reach a point of failure again.

In case of massive genocide society will fucking collapse. Rebuilding will be much harder. Fuck the world called decimated come when 10% of a unit is destroyed making it no longer functional.

This is not considering that Thanos plans on remaining around putting all the universe under the threat of genocide in a couple hundred years if needed. Single planet are highly motivated to insure population control policies if a giant maniac with unlimited powers is around.

​

Also Infinite gauntlet is not infinite. Killing half population wrecked it. And destroying is easier then creating. I believe increasing resources would be beyond its powers.

I strongly believe that continuous menace plus a demonstration of its ability to carry out the threats through mass genocide is the FASTEST way for Thanos to achieve his goals.

There's also Kreia in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, who doesn't add tension by violently attempting to stop the heroes, but instead by constantly undercutting their belief that they're doing the right thing, and still, in the end, is /really fucking evil/.

**** That's my take, as well.

I wouldn't even count Sauron as a villain. He's a force of nature, and killed off-screen. Vader didn't destroy any planets, and his character was redeemed by his love for his son. Quirrel was frustrated by the stupidity of everyone around him (and who /hasn't/ been frustrated by the incompetence of government?), and sees most of the good guys as enemies because he (reasonably) sees their conviction that people shouldn't live forever as a threat to his life.

The best villains are the ones that are a dark reflection of the protagonist. They're who the protagonist could be if they give into anger (Vader) or weren't brought up by loving, moral parents (Quirrel), or have a different concept of what "saving the universe" means (Thanos).

Yes, they need to be an effective opposing force in order to make the conflict interesting, and yes, there needs to at least be the /appearance/ of an irreconcilable difference between the antagonist's goals and/or methods and the protagonist's. I haven't seen /The Dragon Prince/, so I can't comment to the effectiveness of the villains.

But having the villain just be capital-E *Evil*, with no effort taken to give them existence beyond the fact that they need to be opposed, robs you of so much depth that could exist within the story, if you make who the villain is and what they want important to the story.

Yup. Having only watched the LotR movies, without reading the books (I know, I know), I actually can't answer the question of what Sauron /wanted/. His motivation was, IIRC, literally never stated in the movies. He's just... a bad guy. He wants the ring, but that's an instrumental goal. He wants to take over the world, but even /that's/ an instrumental goal.

What would make Sauron /stop/? What would make him /satisfied/? What would make him go retire to a log cabin, like Thanos?

I don't know. And I don't /need/ to know. Because Sauron isn't a character in the story of LotR. (He's a character in the /backstory/, but not the /story/.)

  Let's talk theory before looking at the specific implementation in /The Dragon Prince/. While people praise the /idea/of complex, three-dimensional villains whose motives can't be summed up as “because he's evil,” the villains people actually praise are pretty damn evil. Sauron is basically just a big old pile of evil. Darth Vader blows up a planet for basically no reason. Agent Smith wants to wipe out humanity. Anton Chigurh is a psychopathic killer who murders someone just to test his makeshift gun.
#+end_quote

I don't think this really supports any sort of larger theory about villains, for the simple reason that these are screen villains and actor presence and filmmaking can pull a hell of a lot of weight even when the writing slacks (though being well written in general helps too). Chigurh is Javier Bardem playing the creepiest robot person he possibly can. Vader has the mask, the voice, the cool lines, and the fight with Luke where he becomes an indomitable force of evil instead of just a big guy in a silly helmet. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is just a fun, wacky goofball with cool scenes where he spouts cod philosophy. Heath Ledger's Joker mentioned below is a fun and creepy synthesis of silly comic book villain and serial killer. Whether or not the evil of these characters is realistic is besides the point, because the trick is that they /become/ interesting and cool and give the impression of a personality through execution. Something which is far less doable with prose (or even with animation) simply because the rules and toolset for film is different.

And... I don't really know who really consider's Sauron a great villain. I mean, he's a pretty good fantasy visual shorthand for the abstract concept of evil. But he's hardly a villain in the sense that he's a character in the story.

The stuff about tension and the need for a threat to the heroes is fair enough. But it focuses too much on the in-story nitty-gritty of how they're a threat and misses the theatre and thematics of it. For Vader, the ultimate clincher of his status as a villain during the Bespin duel wasn't how much of a threat her was physically to Luke. It was how he turned the entire core of the story totally upside down with one line. He's so evil and so indomitable that even the entire concept of the hero fighting the villain crumbles in his grasp, leaving only Evil standing before a broken Luke, who allows himself to follow the shattered pieces of Good into the pit (also his redemption strengthens the arc as a whole after the fact by having Luke break down the hero/villain dichotomy in turn but that's another discussion).

This is why Thanos, despite very spotty writing is a pretty baller villain and has been received so well. Because he's an anthropomorphic representation of the question of how far a man will go to achieve a goal, and answers that question with ALL THE FUCKING WAY MOTHERFUCKER. He's the man who's will to do what he thinks must be done is so strong that Earth's mightiest heroes can't stand against it, and Josh Brolin crushes it selling that concept.

The problem here is that you're over focusing on the granular diagetic elements of a story and not enough on the thematics and execution that makes villains really memorable. All fiction is to some degree theatre, even if different mediums operate on different rules, and the best villains leverage that to do half the work for them.

** I think the problems with The Dragon Prince are a lot broader than "not wanting to commit to an evil villain"; though it /is/ a problem: you can't have a guy who's trying his best to save the king's life in difficult circumstances, laying his own life on the line, and have the same guy try to kill the king's kids two days later.

There are a lot of problems in these series: poor pacing, poor sense of scale (why is the King's winter lodge a morning's walk away from his castle?), underwhelming stakes, etc.

But I think the big thing that keeps The Dragon Prince from working is that the writers have a poor understanding of prejudice. They seem to have this image where racism is something that happens almost by accident, and if we could just learn to tolerate each other everything would work out in the end.

The way this manifests is, we don't ever see the context of the characters' actions. The King mentions "wrongs on both sides", but we know that:

- The elves mass-deported the humans 1000 years ago.

- The humans (probably) murdered the Dragon King and stole his egg a few years ago (a decade tops).

And that's it.

What happened in between? What made the King think that attacking the Dragon King was a good idea? What's the balance of power between the human kingdoms and the magic kingdoms? Do elves bandits regularly perform raids across the border? Do humans? Did either kingdom try to invade the other at some point?

In short, why do these two kingdoms hate each other so much if they're completely separated? It can't be just the mass-deportation, it happened 1000 years ago; it would like if the French were still mad at the English for the Hundred Years' War.

So we have good guys who wants to return the Dragon Prince to stop a war, and a bad guy who wants to kill them and start his own war... except we're never shown what the benefits of that should be! Humans have had 1000 years to settle their part of the continent, which overall looks quite livable except for the lower amounts of magic. We're shown no reason why invading the magic kingdoms would be anything other than a very costly bad idea.

I caught that part of the show when my son was watching it. To me, it came across that the advisor had been corrupted by the magic he was doing and his loyalty to the king had been keeping him from tipping over to full evil. Once he was put down by the king, then he lost that last anchor.

** Nice post! Have a mostly-tangential comment.

Lately I've spent a lot of time thinking about Daniel Ellsberg's [[https://www.amazon.com/Doomsday-Machine-Confessions-Nuclear-Planner/dp/1608196704/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539293405&sr=8-1&keywords=the+doomsday+machine+daniel+ellsberg&dpID=41%252BmzqktiML&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch][The Doomsday Machine]]. The author was a RAND consultant working on nuclear war planning in the '50s and early '60s, and the book describes how he, his colleagues, and the US military decided on hugely risky war plans for what seemed like good ideas at the time. One highlight: the Joint Chiefs of Staff deliberately hid their nuclear war plan from civilian authority, because their plan was basically "as soon as US and Russian forces interact at all, we launch all nuclear forces immediately against both Russia and China". What business did a goddam civilian have, telling battle-hardened veterans of the US military how to conduct a war?

An especially chilling part is when Ellsberg requests a bunch of details from military planners, knowing they'll be uncomfortable giving him a straight answer. Indeed, it's mostly met with radio silence. The only response he gets is about casualties; they've already got the calculations, and they predict the plan will kill 500 million people if carried out. (They didn't know about nuclear winter at the time, so this was an underestimate.) Sober men, men whose intellect and principles Ellsberg had come to respect, had calculated out that number and decided it was a necessary risk. They, after all, were the guards on the wall between civilization and obliteration, men who had to make hard decisions in the face of a totalitarian existential threat.

I think there's a lot of viewpoints out there that have cackling-madman consequences without being FOR THE EVULZ.

(Oh, and if you're interested in the book, there's also a great [[https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/daniel-ellsberg-doomsday-machines/][interview with the author]] (+transcript!) on the 80K website.)

** I really like your post! It made me think a lot about my favorite villains. I don't know if I agree with villains NEEDING to be evil to be interesting.

For Thanos, I don't think he was necessarily a dumb guy with no personality. His nickname was the Mad Titan, mad as in insane. And he literally was courting Death, who has a physical manifestation in the Marvel comics universe.

Sorry it's hard to keep track of what I want to say by typing on a phone. My thoughts are everywhere here. I think I just started agreeing that his role as a father was pretty distracting to the plot as I was typing.

However, as some other counter examples of villains who weren't evil being done well:

Watchmen I think the villain I liked most growing up had to be Ozymandias, who was a hero. According to the author, Rorschach was meant to be horrifying to the readers as someone who was unable to compromise. Ozymandias, always had the good of the world as an end goal, and ended with him +temporarily+ succeeding.

The musical /Wicked/ was pretty mind blowing for me as a kid, too. In that story the villains are the heroes in /The Wizard of Oz/. Actually I don't remember much about the story besides the awesome soundtrack. But that's another story where the Villain isn't a BBEG, and does it well.

Again, I really like how your post got me thinking, thanks for sharing!

** It's odd reading this, because my favorite characters in The Dragon Prince were actually the villains. Which, like... I guess that indicates a failure insofar as I was supposed to be more invested than I am in the heroes' success, but honestly, watching Viren trying to salvage the political mess he'd been left with and watching his kids struggling with the orders he gave them got me way more invested in things than watching the heroes arguing with each other and then cleaning up the resulting messes did. If the villain-POV sections had been cut out of the show except where directly relevant to the heroes' experiences, I'd be much less likely than I in fact am to go on to the second season when it comes out. So on my view the show's villains were written extremely well, although I'll grant that the narrative suffered from the degree to which it treated Viren as an Obvious Villain Figure even before he started doing anything particularly evil.

Separately from the Dragon Prince-specific case you made, on which my view seems to be outlierly judging by everyone else's comments here, I've got another counterexample against your case for definitively-evil villains being important: Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.

​

(*Mild spoilers for Nanoha follow; anyone who wants to see it and is particularly sensitive to spoilers, turn away now.*)

​

Nanoha is a particularly action-focused magical girl show, featuring excellent fight scenes and excellent characters; it's pretty much exactly the sort of source material your various examples above were drawn from. The first season worked basically according to the model you've laid out, with a highly sympathetic non-evil antagonist working for a much-more-evil-but-still-well-characterized-and-not-just-a-personality-void antagonist, and with the latter providing driving plot force when the former falters.

But then there's the second season, which is widely considered to be better than the first. The second season dispenses with that model, instead having no evil antagonists at all, just various groups of sympathetic antagonists reacting to a lousy situation which was established centuries prior. There's one group of sympathetic antagonists who are running on lousy information while trying to save the life of another sympathetic character; there's another group of sympathetic antagonists whose plan involves sacrificing a few innocent lives in order to destroy an artifact which kills large numbers of people on a regular basis; there's the artifact itself, which is sapient and actually hates the killing-large-numbers-of-people-on-a-regular-basis thing, but is corrupted in such a way as to be unable to stop; and then there's the artifact's self-defense system, which is the ultimate cause of the whole mess (or at least the ultimate cause that's directly relevant to the plot, its creator presumably being long dead) and is barely even sentient and thus not really evil in any way worth mentioning.

And all of these forces colliding with each other and with the heroes creates plenty of conflict for the season, with no need to bring in any more straightforwardly evil villains. The role of the antagonist-that-ultimately-drives-everything is instead played by the barely-sentient self-defense system. It works extremely well, being the best season of the show in the eyes of a large fraction of the fandom. (The remainder mostly like the third season best, for reasons I don't really understand.)

​

(*End of mild Nanoha spoilers.*)

​

In light of the example of Nanoha's second season, I think your model is too narrow. I'll happily grant that unambiguously-evil villains can be realistic and can do a lot to improve narratives lacking in driving threats, but I think you're going too far when you reject narratives which omit them, even just within the space of the action-driven narratives you're focusing on. The protagonists need a strong threat to work against, yes, but appropriate threats can equally be non-sapient forces of nature, or well-intentioned opponents acting due to misunderstandings, or well-intentioned opponents who /actually have reasonable points/ working against protagonists doing stupid risky things, or dozens of other sorts of non-evil threats. All that's necessary is that there be /some/ sort of intimidatingly-powerful force gunning for the protagonists whose defeat will be followed either with the introduction of a new serious threat or with the conclusion of the story.

** I think ATLA and Worm strike a good formula by having bad guys across the spectrum. Ozai is pure evil, and he serves an important story function, but he's not nearly the most memorable thing about ATLA. Zhao is pretty unmemorable, too. Zuko and Azula are the memorable bad guys. Zuko as the one who ultimately gets redeemed, and Azula as the kinda complex one who still ultimately doesn't.

Likewise Worm hits all across the board. Petty bad guys who are out for themselves. Racists. Forces of nature. Alien god thing. Corrupt organizations who think they're working for the greater good. Psychos. It's the super-evil ones (like the slaughter house nine, who honestly just aren't that complex*) that provide a lot of the stakes but the less evil ones that provide a lot of interesting philosophical moral conflict.

I think 'bad guys across the board' is generally a good formula.

That having been said, I also think Quirrell is one of the most successful instances of trying to make a bad guy who is simultaneously very complex and very evil all in one, which is pretty hard to pull off. His whole 'indifference' schtick really helps with that, I think. It allows him to go around doing a wide variety of things, sometimes even /good/ things (being a competent teacher, helping fight bullies), while still effortlessly stepping into the role of a monster.

It also helps that much of Quirrell's philosophy, like his trademark jaded cynicism, is somewhat... tempting. And no, I don't mean that I'm tempted to go out and kill idiots for fun, but I am often tempted to just write off most of the human race as terrible and stupid. On the other hand, Thanos sucks. His life philosophy just isn't tempting at all. Thanos could have been good, maybe, if they had really dug into the cognitive failings that led him to this point (and in fact I see some discussion of here in this thread) but it just wasn't there in the movie.

(*) In some sense I think that was the point. Jack was ultimately a pretty shallow edge-lord, despite being 'the most in alignment with' his shard, but hey, guess what, the alien-god's plan to stop entropy by giving people super powers and having them fight was also pretty shallow.

However with the Dragon Prince it feels to me like maybe the danger and tension doesnt come from the advisor figure, but from /the protagonists themselves/. There's a reason the egg wasn't destroyed but instead hidden. That reason is obviously to keep humans safe. The dragon prince can be raised to care about humans or he can be used as leverage to negotiate with the magical races in a final ditch effort to save the humans. I fully expect a "nice job breaking it hero" big reveal moment at some point in the future. And there were already a bunch of people trying to find the princes and bring them back, and if they were caught their elf friend would have been in danger.

not sure if you mentioned it later, but since I disagree with the first premise I stopped reading.

the essay is too long to read it, especially if I think the premise is faulty. I probably wouldn't read it if it was about my fav. show.

You need a tl;dr

Still to prove your writing advice, write a story (maybe shorter than your essay) with a pure evil character and then change the villain parts so it is the kind of villain you think is less good.

Then make a story with the kind of villain you don't like and rewrite a version with an evil villain. (better ask another writer who believes the opposite)

Now publish those 4 versions and ask the readers to rate it. Compare results. (Maybe include metaanalysis like how long where readers on the page before voting or came back or...)

After you know your measurements make a prediction for each measurement and what a failed pridiction meant...

Or write a 4000 essay why you are right.

Hitler was anti-animal cruelty for example. The book series I think that does this best is A Song of Ice and Fire. The books do not have any clear villains besides a few smaller characters like slavers and insane killers. Most of the antagonists are anti-villains who do evil things, but also love their families and will do anything to protect their children. I think that's incredibly accurate to real history, where people do love their children and do anything for their children. And that makes sense with evo-psych too: As an animal, your primary goal above literally everything else should be to ensure the survival of your children.

I strongly disliked it when Viren said he'd prefer the egg over his son's life. You can be near morally bankrupt but still value the lives of your children, most people do.

As for my exceptions, I'd say there are a few pure evil people in the form of sadistic serial killers. Characters like the Joker or the Slaughter House 9 represent them. No major army-leading or nation-ruling people are pure evil though, you can't rise that high without someone realising you're pure evil and stopping you from advancing.

But that might be just my preference. What's realistic may not be what makes for the best stories in general after all.

** Thanks for the great read! I agree with a lot of what you mentioned. It's one of the reasons that everything after the original star wars felt sorely lacking. There was no immediate threat and feeling of urgency in them. There's no big bad that makes your butt clench on behalf of the characters. There's a lot of melodrama and pausing, breathers that feel forced into the story for the sake of creating a connection with the characters
