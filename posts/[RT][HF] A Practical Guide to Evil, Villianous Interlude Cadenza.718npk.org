** I liked the writing for this chapter - feels different from the Cat POV chapters. Even the word choice used - gears, levers - reinforces one of the earlier chapters that Black thinks of the world as a machine and himself as a cog.

** I kind of hope the Ashen Priestess's death was a fake out, but I doubt it. :( I really liked her for some reason. Even if I kind of saw her death coming ever since she used her third aspect to gank some generic no-names.

Tyrant actually did betray both parties, if in a roundabout way! He must be so happy with yours development. I can't help but think of the Tyrant going "everything's coming up Tyrant!" in a Milhouse voice.

I really enjoy chapters from Black's perspective, he's so businesslike and like. Not snarky at all. Sometimes Cat has a bit of a smarm overload, and it's nice to get a contrast. Hopefully we get another hero chapter about the aftermath soon.

Are they going to get blindsided by Champion killing Captain? Or was that avoided?

** Wow, just wow. The enormity of those closing words:

#+begin_quote
  “I am dying, I think,” he murmured.

  There was a long silence.

  “If Catherine wields the knife, I will destroy her,” she said, as if she was speaking of the weather. “And if I fail Hye will not.”

  Amadeus did not reply. If he'd been the kind of man to pray, he would have prayed then. But he was not, so instead the gears began to turn and he wondered how many of the people he loved he would have to kill, before it was all over.
#+end_quote

So Black's prepared to kill some of his Clamanities before he dies in order to bring his (and Malicia's) vision into being. That's cold, calculating and committed.

*** I'll repost my comment from below the actual wordpress....

There is no way that the Calamities haven't worked out that the Story is set up with "Evil will be forced to kill evil" built in rule. That Scribe seems to want to follow the story tropes if Cat follows story tropes seems to be putting another failure on top of an existing one.

The question is can Black subvert “the story?” The whole goal for Black and the empress has been to make Praes no longer a name based empire but an institutional one. We already have an example of that in Procer which is nominally good, but names are just the cherries on top rather than being crucial to its governing structure.

As such, both Black and the empress have to know that retiring the Calamities eventually was always part of the plan.

The “story” sets up the villainous names in such a way that even the most successful villains will be killed by their own side eventually. That is if Good fails to win directly.

There is no way that Black and the Calamities haven't discussed this and have not figured out a way to say “Screw that!”

Having the Woes fight the Calamities is a victory for “the Story.” Having Black kill the Calamities preemptively to save the Woes is still a victory for “the Story.”

Black is not going to let “the Story” win. I am also reasonably sure that the Empress and Warlock are on the same page about not letting “the Story” win. Scribe should be on the same page as well. They all know that they are fighting “the Story.” Cat killing Black would represent a tactical setback for our forces of free will and institutionalism. There is no way that Wekesa and Malicia would let it become a strategic defeat for their entire side retaliating against the Woes.

Hell, that would be a great reveal.

Bard's plan is to sew dissension in the ranks by forcing Cat to kill Black through some circumstance, setting up the Calamity vs. Woe showdown which would doom the new Praes... Only to find out that Malicia, Wekesa, Sabah, and Hye are all pre committed to not retaliating over this because their whole bit is using rationality... (though never those words) to subvert and defeat “The Story.”

**** Black is trying to subvert the story, but are the other Calamities trying to really? Or are they just along for the ride? Also Malicia's turn towards a super weapon is problematic for her ability to avoid the story. Why do you peg Wekesa as being meta-goal oriented rather than simply power acquiring(albeit more rationally than his predecesors)?

Edit: Additionally, is The Story really the enemy? What if it is merely The Story (written by the Gods Above/Below) that is the problem and story can be used for mortals, and not just by them?

***** We know Malicia is totally into the idea of subverting the story. (Also, is Dread Empress a Name?) This is why they keep killing the Chancellor.

Wekesa should be into it. He has an evil name. His destiny, until quite recently, was to be murdered by Masego, much like the story favors Cat murdering Black.

But, thanks to Cat, Masego graduates into an equally powerful name without having to kill the previous Warlock.

Assassin, we don't know enough about to comment on her/his motives.

Captain seems to follow Black because Black brings victory and she appreciates that. Even though "Captain" is a neutral sounding name, it's established that she is a villain... if the Story runs its course, villains lose. So she has as much interest in subverting the story as anyone.

Ranger is the only one who doesn't lose if the Story plays out. Her Name is neutral. That said, my read on her is that she's found being "The Ranger" for the past 100 years very boring. She had no reason to join the Calamities. She's not Praesi, she rules her own independent domain, and she is already the deadliest person on Calernia.

It's strongly hinted in her interlude that Ranger was not a true believer when she met Black. However, that she took her initial, "we can get into Callow" jaunt and became one of the Calamities suggests that she was won over by Black to the cause of subverting the story.

** I'm confused as to how the ritual works. If they can kill any Named with a hair and a sacrifice of nine people, then why wouldn't they be doing that already?

*** So this ritual requires knowledge of high arcana, a weird planar perception, and the killing of not nine people but nine caravans of people. In addition to a hair (likely of the Named in question).\\
I'd say this isn't common usage because of the large amount of resource investment and strange knowledge required to put it together.

**** And on top of that all it requires to derail the ritual is a single strand of hair apparently. I bet if someone's tried this ritual before - knowing Praes the answer is definitely yes - the designated band of heroic misfits ruined ritual every time.

**** It also requires a Named to do the killing. Warlock just redirected a ritual to target someone else, but without Sabah there to do the killing it wouldn't have worked at all.

So at the minimum you need two Named, one with a caster-like name and another with a murdery name, as well as a dozen casters capable of high arcana. Villains don't really ally with other villains much, and the murdering villain won't trust the casting villain to redirect the ritual at the last moment. Heroes aren't really thematically alined with mass sacrificial rituals in the first place. Finally, a group of alined villains like Calamities that tried to abuse the method is just asking for a Hero to interrupt the process somehow, for horrific results. And it doesn't even work on all Named apparently-white knight would have survived.
