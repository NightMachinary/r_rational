** Can anyone recommend any non-fiction books about reconstruction after society goes awry? I've been reading a lot lately about how societies descend into, for instance, a Nazi Germany-like state, but I haven't found much on how they get out of it. Even just time periods to look to would be helpful. I can think of the reconstruction of Europe after WWII, and German unification after the Berlin Wall fell, but in trying to think of other time periods my knowledge of history is proving insufficient.

*** I can offer some recommendations on Japanese history. The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori by Mark Ravina is a book on the life of an influential samurai during the Meiji Restoration, now best known due to the Tom Cruise movie based on his life.

Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II by John W. Dower is probably the definitive book for that period and is definitely the more easily accessible of the two. It presents a nuanced look at the US occupation of Japan following WW2.

*** The Knowledge: How to rebuild our world from scratch- Lewis Dartnell

#+begin_quote
  Human knowledge is collective, distributed across the population. It has built on itself for centuries, becoming vast and increasingly specialized. Most of us are ignorant about the fundamental principles of the civilization that supports us, happily utilizing the latest---or even the most basic---technology without having the slightest idea of why it works or how it came to be. If you had to go back to absolute basics, like some sort of postcataclysmic Robinson Crusoe, would you know how to re-create an internal combustion engine, put together a microscope, get metals out of rock, accurately tell time, weave fibers into clothing, or even how to produce food for yourself? Regarded as one of the brightest young scientists of his generation, Lewis Dartnell proposes that the key to preserving civilization in an apocalyptic scenario is to provide a quickstart guide, adapted to cataclysmic circumstances.

******* Paths of Civilisation is a pretty cool and unique quest, with an unfinished sequel, where the players made choices about how a civilisation would develop from pretty much the beginning of history.

There are a lot of quests out there - PoC used its own system, but if you're looking for more kingdom management quests I recommend searching for quests using the CK2 (Crusader Kings 2) system, which was based on translating some of the system of that game to the written format. It's sort of the "standard" kingdom management system, though it sometimes gets used for managing single characters. There's a lot of very good ones, but I recommend starting with A Dynasty of Dynamic Alcoholism, playing as the Elector Count of Ostland in the Warhammer Fantasy setting. (Which is pretty grim, but not nearly so much as 40k.)

** Used some of the holidays to catch-up with Ward and frankly I was a bit disappointed. I made it to arc 11 before dropping it, despite Worm being probably my favourite web novel of all time. I'd never seen much discussion on this sub around Ward though so I'm not sure how it's received here.

I've noticed that now, I'm only actively following 2 series: The Wandering Inn and MoL, with nothing else having caught my attention for ages. Instead I've been reading far more non-fiction works recently The Global Minotaur and Why Nations Fail being the most recent. Both have interesting and provocative arguments on global economic issues and I would recommend.

*** I dropped it towards the end of arc 17, though I'll probably binge the rest once it's over unless the reception is very negative.

Victoria as the protagonist is the main issue for me. She was already one of the few relevant characters in Worm I cared very little about, and unfortunately Ward didn't manage to change that. I can't pinpoint what exactly makes her so unappealing to me, though I suppose her being the opposite of Taylor in pretty much every way has a lot to do with it, as I was invested in her story from the first Worm chapter.

I generally like the rest of breakthrough more than Victoria herself, though that isn't enough to offset the glacial pace Ward has compared to Worm as a more character-driven story, especially since I don't enjoy the action scenes as much as in Worm either (again, Victoria is a problem as her power doesn't allow her to have the situational awareness Taylor had, which makes fights more confusing, and generally offers less interesting resolutions). I found the worlbuilding to be a mess as well, and the interludes on average weaker than Worm's, though I still did like a lot of them and they're my favorite part of Ward overall.

I think it's overall much harder to enjoy Ward if you dislike Victoria as a protagonist than Worm if you disliked Taylor, which imo partly explains why it hasn't been as well received. I've seen a lot of Worm readers who didn't care about Taylor but continued anyway for the action scenes and interludes, which Ward has less of.

**** Keep in mind that they had the full cooperation of most of the surviving capes, as well as Accord's plans going into it. Picture everybody finally working together only a little less efficient. Additionally, the City was the designated east coast evacuation point, so they probably started construction a while before Gold Morning. Two years sounds impossibly fast, but when you only really have to worry about supplies and labor, it's not as unbelievable.

#+end_quote

Spoilers: That is actually something the author did on purpose. The city is pretty much an empty shell, it never could have worked out in the long term. After Gold Morning, people prioritised going back to how things were before, without putting in place the solid foundations they would have needed to do so. People were unwilling to move out to the countryside and become farmers or miners, they wanted back to fastfood and skyscrapers. As a result, shoddy construction and food crises cause issues not just within the City, but with their dimensional neighbors. That is part of Ward's message about recovering from trauma; you cannot expect things to quickly go back to how they were before the traumatic event, you need to deal with the fact that going forward, some things might never be the same again.

**** I dropped wanderinginn when the author decided that the antinium had feelings all of the sudden. During the antinium wars the antinium were known for the robotic ruthless efficiency. They were mindless cold killer robots and that's why they freaked out when they found out that Erin can turn ants into "individuals". The author clearly establishes this lore deeply and its a major plot point. But during a flashback scene in the antinium war, the female antinium commander was getting pushed back and used a morale boosting skill which reduces fear and bolsters hope to the soldiers? The author tried to make it an emotional scene showing how the antinium army is now fighting with hope. And thats my problem lol this nitpick which made me drop it. Antinium were feared all over for being ruthless killer robots with no empathy. But, this flashback scene suddenly humanized every ant there. They were fighting like humans and the other races able to feel fear and hope. They were supposed to be controlled by a queen hivemind and fight like how we were lead to believe for so long.

****** Sorry for taking so long to answer! Work and uni leave no time for Reddit (which is good, I suppose, since I've been spending too much time on social media lately).

I'm going to share my thoughts, so in case someone other than [[/u/callmesalticidae][u/callmesalticidae]] reads this: there are going to be unmarked spoilers!

First of all, the ending BLEW MY MIND. While I wasn't /that/ surprised with Lex Luthor winning, and him being able to run government efficiently was foreshadowed in the first issue, the very last twist was /amazing/. I just sat here, absorbing that ending for a good minute.

I don't have a deep knowledge of DC lore, but I recognized all the main characters, and, more importantly, could compare them to their usual portrayals. I really liked the takes on most of them, and I especially enjoyed how Lois not-Lane was written here. Also, Batman the ushanka terrorist is probably my favorite portrayal of the character aside from /LEGO Batman/.

The depiction of Stalinist and post-Stalinist USSR was fine---but since the story was about the characters, not the setting, it wasn't explored at all, and I didn't really mind that.

I feel like timeskips between issues could've been handled better; sometimes the drastic changes were a tad jarring. However, I got used to them by the middle of the third issue---so it wasn't too bad.

From the graphics standpoint, I found the style to be pleasant but not /outstanding/. I honestly can't remember a single frame that visually captivated me, but neither do I remember anything badly drawn. The color pallette was probably the best part.

Overall, I enjoyed reading the story and would probably recommend it to some of my friends (definitely to those who enjoyed /The Metropolitan Man/ or /Injustice/).

The last but not least: Lex Luthor here is unacceptably hot. I never thought I needed a ginger version of that smug fuck, but I apparently did.

/Planetary/ is about a team of "archaeologists of the unknown," who, in the process of digging up the secret history of the world, also dig up the history of superhero comics, their roots, and their influences on other genres (e.g. "here's the story where we see how 1920s pulp adventurers gave way to flashier, more inhumanly powered characters," "here's the story where we learn about a 1950s lab with atomic-powered people, atomic-powered ants, and, well, you get the idea"). Over time, a larger plot emerges.

/Transmetropolitan/ is, if you haven't heard of it already, Hunter S. Thompson (by another name) In The Future.

/Black Summer/ is another Ellis comic. Long story short, there were once seven superheroes who were all some spin on "Iron Man-type tech hero." They fought crime. Then some of them died or got injured. They split up. A few continued to fight crime.

Then in 2007 one of them thinks, "You know, I fight crime... And the President is a war criminal..." and straight up kills W. Bush and Cheney and kicks off a nightmare sequence of responses and responses to those responses, which is what the following seven issues are about.

Also, Warren Ellis is British, so there's an interesting "this is America as perceived from the outside" flavor to it.

/Nextwave/ is classic "people punching things and being witty" Silver Age superheroism, and I love it. There are tactical drop bears, broccoli people, and a dragon who wears purple underpants.

/Crécy/ is a graphic novel about the Battle of Crécy, narrated by a longbowman as he marches to and fights at Crécy. It breaks the fourth wall a bit (our narrator is speaking to /us/ and comments on modern events and contextualizes things in a way that helps them make sense to modern readers) but I don't think that detracts at all. It makes the important point that people in earlier times weren't stupider than us, they just didn't have the mass of accumulated knowledge from which we benefit today (which is probably an obvious point to anyone on this subreddit...).

COMICS BY KIERON GILLEN

In /Uber/ and /Uber: Invasion/, the Nazis discover how to make superhumans just in time to push the Russians back from Moscow. Luckily, a British spy is able to smuggle the formula back to the U.K., and so WWII enters a new phase, with new weapons. There /are/ characters with superpowers, but the series pays as much attention to "how platoons and regiments of superpowered soldiers would be utilized" as it does to "what this individual superpowered soldier is doing." Also, Ukrainian anarchism becomes relevant in the second series!

You mentioned elsewhere in this thread that you're familiar with /Watchmen/, so allow me to recommend the 2019 run of /Peter Cannon: Thunderbolt./ You know how DC bought some characters from a dying comics company, hired Alan Moore to write a story about them, and then asked Moore to change the names because his story had rendered almost all of their newly-purchased characters dead or AWOL? Peter Cannon was Ozymandias 1.0, and Gillen's run does some interesting things with the character's relationship to Watchmen. It gets fairly meta, in a /Planetary/ sort of way.

/Die/ is Tabletop RPG Jumanji. Six kids were drawn into a weird fantasy world, and five of them were able to get out. Now, decades later, the game is coming for them again.

COMICS BY OTHER PEOPLE

/Miracleman/ by Alan Moore is a peculiar one. It's another "revival of an old character from the days before DC and Marvel were synonymous with superheroes," and Moore does some really weird things with the character. Also, there's a (very much on hiatus) sequel miniseries by Gaiman which shows us a world transformed by Superheroes Who Actually Do Something.

/Dwarves/ is a French fantasy comic about, uh, dwarves. Most of the issues center on different characters, but their stories intersect over the generations (I'm working on a blog post that tries to put things together, because some events are centuries apart from each other). I really like how fleshed-out dwarven culture is. Unfortunately, the other comics in this universe, /Elves/ and /Orcs & Goblins/, are pretty bad.

/Superman Smashes the Klan/ is basically what it sounds like. It's a loose comic adaption of the 1940s "Clan of the Fiery Cross" radio serial.

/The Manhattan Projects/ is a Weird Superscience comic by Jonathan Hickman with nuclear ghosts, "Zen-powered Death Buddhists," and Oppenheimer's evil twin.

/The Private Eye/ is a 10-issue scifi/mystery comic where, in response to a privacy breach to end all privacy breaches, people decide that they really like being able to keep secrets and go all-in on it: there's no longer any "clouds" for people's secrets to spill out from, digging into someone's search history is a federal crime, and the government guarantees your right to use a pseudonym in just about any situation. Also, everyone wears a mask in public so there are lots of great costumes and you should get the trade paperback editions because there are even more costume sketches in the back.

Last but not least, I wrote a [[https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com/2019/01/04/media-recommendation-the-black-monday-murders-by-jonathan-hickman/][review for Jonathan Hickman's /The Black Monday Murders/]]. The story is complete in the sense that the initial mystery was solved but there are lots of sequel hooks dangling, and unfortunately Hickman hasn't gone back to it recently.

And...it's almost midnight, so I'll stop here. LMK if you want more recommendations, and please let me know if you read any of these! >:]

******** Okay, that's one long list. Saved, I'll go through it as soon as the concept of free time starts existing in my reality once again.

Out of all these, I only read /Transmetropolitan/ around four years ago and found it to be okay. I greatly enjoyed watching the antics of the main character and, to a lesser extent, his assistants, but nothing else was actually memorable enough for me to look back to. That's just my personal opinion, though, I totally can see why people may like it a lot.

*** After you read /Sandman/, I recommend trying some of the other classic comic series in the Vertigo imprint. For instance, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer][Hellblazer]]/ was a trend setter for many ideas that later became popular in the urban fantasy genre. The series had its ups and downs as it changed authors and artists, and in some ways it's a time capsule for the issues that were important in Britain at the time it published, but the high points are definitely worth the read. It's not particularly rational (but then neither is /Sandman/).

*** Literally glancing across my comic shelf...

It's not as famous as some of the other recommendations you're getting, but I really enjoyed Neil Gaiman's /Eternals/ run. It's available in a single paperback collection.

/The Unbelievable Gwenpool/ is widely acclaimed. If you enjoy it, or have read it, I just finished and quite enjoyed the next two comic series to follow the character (/West Coast Avengers/ and /Gwenpool Strikes Back/), although they're not /as/ good.

If you're ok with rather wacky non-mainstream comics, /The Adventures of Dr McNinja/ (by the same author as /Unbelievable Gwenpool/ - it's what landed him the job) is surprisingly good. It's available for free as a webcomic, but also available in print as a series of slablike collections - and the fact I bought one despite having already read the whole comic for free should speak to how much I liked it.

You may also like the webcomic Order of the Stick. It starts out as a series of unrelated jokes about D&D mechanics, but evolves to the point where it has some of the most impressive moments I've seen in a fantasy story in any medium. Given that it's a stick figure comic, that's incredible.

- Nanocultivation Chronicles is also good, and has the interesting conceit of having the Outside (real world, with nanotech) and Inside (a VRMMO), with most characters existing in both.
