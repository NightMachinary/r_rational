Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Fun fact: there are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/][a few billion reddit comments loaded into BigQuery]], which allows for some mildly interesting data to be extracted.

*** The max score is definitely the most interesting thing there.

I would love to see length of comment against comment score for the max scores (then compare across subreddits).

Why does the max score often disagree, the one on Reddit isn't the same as the one on the spreadsheet. Surprises me how few people are overall negative too.

Is there a way to separate comments into upvoted and downvoted ones? Also if I didn't remove the upvote from my own post my average would be almost double, that's curious.

Reddit has vote fuzzing in place; scores are almost never accurate, though they're accurate to within a certain range. The data also only goes up until 8/31/15.

You'd have to run a new query, but yes, it's possible within the dataset.

****** Nope, this dataset just naively takes whatever score is provided by the reddit API. They're not inaccurate to the same degree, because reddit doesn't fuzz the same on all comments; fuzzing increases as absolute score increases. (The dataset is ~2 billion comments, so I imagine scraping it many times over in order to guess at "true" score would have been wildly impractical.) Though I suppose you could ask [[/u/stuck_in_the_matrix]] for clarification; he's the one making the datasets and has a huge amount of knowledge about the reddit API.

*** I used to build PCs for pay. Generally speaking, building a PC lets you use higher quality components that have a lower chance of failure. If you want a desktop and want to spend more than $200 USD, and are willing to invest ~3 hours of research and ~1-2 hours of construction time (imagine making a moderately complex lego construction, but each lego costs $100 so you are very careful) building your own is 100% the way to go.

Here's what I'll need to know to make you a recommendation:

- Budget (and country in which purchases are made)
- Monitor's native resolution, or desired monitor if none owned
- What games to you intend to play? What settings for them?
- What do you intend to use the computer for besides gaming?
- Do you intend to overlock?
- Do you need an operating system?
- Do you need a monitor or any other peripherals as part of your budget?

So, 767 all told. This comes out a bit over budget, but going lower than this would leave us with a dual-core CPU which would not be able to handle streaming, I'm fairly certain. Going over the choices quickly:

CPU: X4 860K is a cheap quad-core CPU. AMD is more efficient at this price range, despite slightly lower single-thread performance. The cheapest intel CPU with 4 cores is the i5 4160 at $181, so we make do with AMD.

Motherboard: Gigabyte motherboard is cheap and has the slots we need.

Memory: 8 is what we need. 2x4gb is cheaper than 1x8gb and has slightly better performance at the cost of making an upgrade to 16gb (2x8) slightly more expensive.

Storage: Seagate Barracuda is inexpensive and fast at 7200 RPM. It's no SSD but it gets the job done.

MSI GTX 750 TI has the best price performance in our range. It's more power efficient and cooler than the AMD offerings, and MSI makes good products.

NZXT Case is cheap and although it is low-featured and a bit cramped to work in, the price is right.

Corsair CX 430W meets our power needs and is efficient.

Windows 7 can be upgraded for free to Windows 10. I am not familiar with buying used keys and have never done it. If savings can be made, they will be made here.

These Acers are the cheapest, best 1080p monitors on the market for $100 each. You'll be hard-pressed to do better.

Logitech K120 is a great keyboard that gets the job done with no frills.

Gigabit GM-M6800 is a wired mouse with good tracking and it's cheap.

This computer will meet your needs, though you could knock off about 10% of the price by being very clever and shopping around, and waiting for deals [[/r/buildapc][r/buildapc]] and pcpartpicker.com are both good sources to use. This assumes no mail-in rebates and only using Newegg and Amazon.

****** Depends on your system requirements. I've never built compact PCs because they're a pain to work on, but there's nothing actually wrong with them.

*** I'm not that knowledgeable, but I built my own PC myself, with some help from a friend and [[https://pcpartpicker.com/][this site]] It's really useful because it has a lot of built in features that let you put together a PC build online without knowing all that much. For example, if you select, say, a processor that's incompatible with your motherboard, it will notify you of this. It's still a good idea to double check this sort of thing, but the notifications can really help you do a lot of your primary filtering. It also aggregates products from quite a few popular sites for parts (Newegg, Amazon, etc.) and tracks them. You can even set it so it sends you a notification if a price drops below a threshold you set due to, say, a close out sale, or black friday.

So yea. That site. Is the shit. Once you were done putting it together based on what you wanted, it's really easy to link your build to a friend or helpful redditor. For example, [[http://pcpartpicker.com/user/Kishoto/saved/MMk9TW][here is the PC I built roughly two years ago]]

Feel free to shoot me some basic questions but, as I said, I'm not THAT knowledgeable. I know enough to build one, but I'm not the best by far. I also watched this three part video series( [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPIXAtNGGCw][part 1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_56kyib-Ls][part 2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxaVBsXEiok][part 3]] ) It's a 2 hour investment, but it's comprehensive as hell, and will definitely help you understand things if you are as clueless as I was when I started

Fun fact, when I finally got all my parts shipped in, and sat down to build, my internet went out, so I was completely unable to reference things mid-build. Took me 4 hours. 30 minutes of that was being convinced I was putting in my processor wrong, because the latch to secure it had to be pressed down SOOO hard, I was scared I was going to crack my motherboard.

I don't remember most logic gate functions off the top of my head, and I can't look at file headers and tell you which magic numbers correlate to which file type, but I can administrate the shit out of a Debian server, know most networking off the top of my head and also built computers too, which is the relevant bit of information here.

I work like 90 hours a week, but PM me any questions you have or link me to a question thread you have and I'll be more than willing to help you out :)

** So, for those of us here not following various people on Tumblr, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]] has been updating in the last little while. I don't think it's really a good topic for it's own thread - the story is not exactly rationalist fiction at all - but it's very definitely the sort of thing that people reading [[/r/rational]] would probably really really like, and you should check it out if you haven't. Summary: A group of people who knew each other on the internet where they discussed their favourite author's works, gather in person to discuss and attempt an exegesis of his baffling final text, presented in a variety of forms (personal accounts, forum threads, source materials, etc). It's really really good, and is written by nostalgebraist.

I don't know where it's going but it's super interesting, 10/10 story.

***** /Naruto/ is available to watch for free on Hulu ([[http://www.hulu.com/naruto][pre-timeskip]], [[http://www.hulu.com/naruto-shippuden][post-timeskip]]). It's all one series--but, like /Dragon Ball (Z)/, there was a time-skip in the middle, so Part 2 got a separate name for simplicity. Personally, I think nearly all of it's worth watching, except the individual filler episodes and most of the post-timeskip filler arcs. The comedy spin-off anime /Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals/ is also /absolutely hilarious/, and available for free on Hulu [[http://www.hulu.com/naruto-spin-off-rock-lee-and-his-ninja-pals][here]].

** How does everyone deal with the massive amount of commends on Reddit threads (especially the repetitious "jet fuel can't melt steel" or thread-derailing silly ones)?

I really love the discussion on most threads but I find myself having to really wade through many of them to find quality discussion about the topic at hand; obviously the ideal solution is to unsubscribe from the default subreddits, but it's often hard to find good alternatives (for example, I've tried a few and haven't been able to locate an active community for world news, etc.).

For example, one of the solutions I'm considering at the moment, is trying to find a filter program like [[http://www.unspoiler.tv/][Unspoiler]] except for Reddit.

Edit: Hmm, or I've heard people mention using RES to tag people, I suppose it might be worthwhile to tag posters of good discussion, if that makes them more visible? Or tag jokers to hide their posts?

It also includes a ton of other enhancements.

Subreddit discovery is a bit trickier; it really depends on what you want to talk about. Sometimes there just isn't a place for discussion outside the defaults, either because the alternative is too small to have much conversation, or because too few people care for there to be an alternative.

** Let's talk about lurking a little bit.

I read this subreddit more than I read any other, and yet I think I've posted maybe five comments in here. Ever. This is the first subreddit I open when I get home and start casually browsing on my desktop, yet I just don't interact with the community.

Reading this thread made me start wondering why that is. I thought on it a bit, and I realized my knee-jerk emotion was intimidation. I recognize the silliness of that, and that I'm likely falling prey to the Dunning-Krueger effect, but I'm just posting this to wonder out loud if anyone else feels the same way, or acts the same way for different reasons?

*** Most people lurk. This sub has ~3,500 subscribers.

As to why that's the case ... it's something that I think about a lot. Some of it probably comes down to personality. There are certain people that just naturally post a lot, because they like being part of the conversation rather than listening to the conversation. But I think there's probably something more as well. I don't know.

I've thought down the exact same lines. I don't have anything conclusive other than vague thoughts about community atmosphere and that beyond a doubt the topic (or lack thereof) of the community being big factors, but nothing quantifiable. Figuring out that theory and maximizing towards participation is an itch that's been in the back of my mind for easily a decade now.

*** *Short answer:* definitely absolutely not. Get a portable monitor or a stationary monitor instead and save a ton of money.

*Long answer:*

My dad used to have a thinkpad with a similar feature, the Thinkpad W700ds. W=workstation-tier, 7 = 17" screen, 00 = Core 2 Duo G3, ds = dual-screen

Basically it was an extra half-sized screen that slid out on the right side. It wasn't super useful, but it was pretty sweet. That being said, the thinkpad W-series computers were tanks, they were monstrosities. Basically portable desktops. I loved them.

If you're doing the starving grad student thing and really need extra screen space, you should just buy a couple monitors. Spending $400 on some extra screens for your laptop attached like that is ridiculous. You could spend $200 and buy two of these big honking 21" HD monitors: ([[http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009316][newegg link]]) and be drowning in screen space. Then spend the extra $200 on ramen or whatever

If you absolutely MUST have portability (say you can only work in coffeeshops or something) you can drop your number of megapixels from 2 to 1 and get a usb-powered-and-driven portable 16" monitor for a similar price, so 2 for $200: ([[http://www.amazon.com/AOC-E1649FWU-USB-Powered-Portable-Monitor/dp/B005SEZR0G/][amazon link]]). I personally don't like portable screens but my sister has used one of these and she liked them. I think these come in 2-megapixel versions (same as the slidenjoy) for $130 each?

In any case, spending $400 on the slide n joy is like spending $150 on a fancy holster for a portable screen, or if you use your laptop as a desktop, spending $200 to get worse, smaller screens. I would never purchase this unless it was super duper seamless and I was lazy and had a lot of cash. Since you're a starving grad student, it's worth it for you to deal with the portable screen problems (ie, not having a nice holster / carrier, etc) to save $200. In fact you're probably like the worst sort of person to use this item, since you're resourceful and intelligent but poor; this is an item for people who don't have a lot of time to deal with it and are rich.

Make sure to order through some service that lets you return them if you don't like them, like Fry's Electronics or something. Kickstarter of course does not provide this.

So yeah definitely don't get that.

**** Well one developer job I do on three screens. Trust me it's needed. The other one I do is "research" really low bid software prototyping engineering for my school's customer, on my laptop. So I'm probably just waiting to see how the unboxings go when the kickstarter models go out, but I thought it might attract some interest or useful commentary here.\\
I'm cautiously optimistic with the images they have shown of the aluminum model's hinges, but I think the real concern will be how the cabling is routed and or guided with the sliding part, the wiring harness seems to be the most vulnerable faiure point if they are engineering the hinges to allow the screens to be positioned at an angel in two axis. That and it's usually the part that get's skimped on the most to cut costs/ ensure the obsolescence lifecycle imho.
