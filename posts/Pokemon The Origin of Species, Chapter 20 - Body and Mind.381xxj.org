** I found this story when it was on chapter 19 and read all of it up to that point pretty quickly.

Really cool stuff. Taking a deep and serious look into a world that I always found pretty interesting. I also likr how it's pretty even handed; there are good things and bad things about this world, strengths and weaknesses of the society. And those strengths and weaknesses are different than the ones in our world. The coolest science fiction does this.

Of the whole story the part that I liked the most both in concept and execution was Blue's sister influencing ther Clefairy's metronome. That really gave me chills! I want to see more like that.

I really like the way that psychic attacks are depicted as more mental/psychological attacks than blasting with energy. I also think that the concept of dark (and people being dark) is cool, and the term really makese sense. It's not dark like as in evil or sinister, but that they're noninteracting with that phenomenon. dark matter. no blips on that radar. dark.

As for my thoughts on things not yet revealed about the setting:

Even before pokeball technology it seems like humanity has a certain... affinity for them. Humans are quite different from all the other non-plant life in this world (pokemon), and it seems that in one way or another they developed ways of controlling pokemon as their method of survival. I think it's a little bit deeper than how people in our world tamed animals. The way these characters form bonds with the pokemon seems very... instinctual, like it's not a learned social behavior but it goes deeper than that, that humanity was interacting with pokemon this way for the entire course of its existence, and controlling pokemon may have been the reason humans gained intelligence in the first place.

It'd be cool to see some of their cultures' equivalents to the garden of eden myth: i.e. their mythological explanation for why humans are different than pokemon.

One interesting thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem like there are any 'domestic only' species of pokemon-- that populations raised in captivity for generations have not significantly deviated from their wild types. I suspect this means something, but I'm not quite sure what.

Question, mostly just out of curiosity:

I know it's comparing apples to oranges, but how far along in its technological development is this world compared to ours? If you were to reduce the maturity of a society to a scalar, would you put them in our past or our future? I get the impression it's somewhat in the future, since with things like only old people really living their countrys' native customs it feels like their world has been globalized for at least a few decades, where ours is really only beginning to be so.

There are definitely some pokemon that aren't particularly dangerous, and so could be called "domestic," but outside of a few circumstances, pokemon are never bred to be less dangerous: human's survival relies on them being able to fight wild pokemon, and while some are raised for non-combat purposes (like for beauty pageants and whatnot) that hasn't been going on nearly long enough to affect the species.

It's definitely hard to measure, but relatively speaking, the future. Like our world, their "modern age" signaled a rapid revolution in technology and globalization, especially with technologies like the internet, but they were far ahead of us in other regards before then, forced to develop incredibly powerful technology to survive, and in some cases like with medicine, having access to biology completely alien to us to develop their nearly miraculous "potions."

** And the plot thickens! Can't wait to see Red investigating his psychic powers! It's starting to look like the true nature of pokemon is a LOT more complicated than expected. I'm guessing it will take Red longer to come up with a theory on the origin of pokemon than Darwin did with his theory, since quite frankly pokemon seem like a more difficult puzzle than real life species, because of pokemon like gastly, grimer, voltorb and magnemite that don't really make sense with real life biology. It would probably make a huge theoretical gap between biology and physics, even bigger than the one that we had before Darwin, unless the physics in the world of pokemon is significantly different, but since humans exist in it it probably can't be /that/ different. This gap would also explain why technology in the world of pokemon is so advanced and yet they still cling to the type-charts. I find it interesting to compare and contrast the type chart paradigm with Aristotelian physics and elan vital. The fact that the type chart paradigm seems to be more like an "Aristotelian physics" kind of explanation than an "elan vital" kind of explanation, seems to support the possibility of such a large theoretical gap between pokemon biology and their world's physics. I'm guessing the scientific community in the story /knows/ the type chart is wrong, but still use it because they have yet to come up with any better unifying theories.

Then again, maybe the physics IS different. After all, humans in the pokemon world are a bit different than the real world in that some of them have psychic powers and things like that. It seems almost as if they're a subspecies of human slightly different from our own. Although why humans give live birth when ALL other pokemon lay eggs, EVEN THE MAMMALS is going to be hard to explain. I'm wondering if it would be better if you just retconned it so that egg laying wasn't universal to all pokemon species except humans.

I also noticed that we're on chapter 20 and haven't even gotten past pewter city yet. That means this story will probably be significantly longer than HPMOR.

This is awesome! Can't wait for the next chapter!

I'm actually retconning this: it's something I think falls under the "clearly a game conceit because the makers of Pokemon couldn't be bothered to think out the complications of an alternative and to make it easier for children" classification of justified departures from canon.

In the games no pokemon is capable of speech outside a few very rare/mythical ones, and even then it's not in the form of actually speaking english with their mouths like in the anime. With the sole exception of pikachu in Pokemon Yellow and the latest generation of games, pokemon don't even say their own names, just make animal noises.

The analogue is to our world's animals: there are some who are definitely smarter than others, and they communicate in some ways, but there are none that inarguably show "human level sapience," let alone the complexity of language.

Psychics are generally classified as such based on their ability to interact with the psyche or manipulate reality with their own mind, so while psychics rank among the smartest pokemon around (especially those that can do more complex things), they are not uniformly smarter than non-psychic pokemon.

You've used this argument before and I just took it at face value but now that I think of it I'm less convinced. Why couldn't they just have the Pokefarm/daycare owner give you a newborn level 1 pokemon instead of an egg that needs to hatch first? In both cases nothing "icky" would have to be shown or discussed.

Same goes for Ghastly by the way. Nothing forces them to definitely not come out of eggs. They wouldn't have to be made of calcium carbonate after all. Just whatever the inert version of a ghost pokemon would be. That is if they aren't actually generated by the death of another pokemon. Though I guess especially with pokemon like koffing/weezing some other type of procreation and life cycle makes more sense and is more interesting to write.

I think the idea of getting an egg and having to hatch your pokemon is part of the process that (a) helps bond with it and treat it as a "real" baby, whereas just being handed new pokemon feels rather mundane, and as a more practical effect, (b) makes the breeding process require more effort.

I don't pretend to know the exact reason Game Freak decided on everything they did, but it just strikes me as very likely that once they decided to include breeding in the games they just recognized the simplicity of having everything come from eggs.

Absolutely, on top of which, some of them contradict the idea of coming from eggs: the pokedex is full of all sorts of nonsensical bullshit, but it still describes Grimer as being born from sludge exposed to "x-rays from the moon." It's not outside the realm of possibility that they can be produced both by natural occurrences and from eggs, but it strikes me as simply a game convenience to have all pokemon that can reproduce do so in the same way mechanically.

It's something I might look into later, as I've also been thinking of hosting the story on its own website to make the interaction between myself and fans or between fans and other fans more smooth: a lot of readers are only on ff.net, which has terrible support for communication and communities. Thanks for the suggestion though :)

**** No problem! I was just wondering, and I would totally support you, even if I didn't get anything from it. I think of it like a thanks for entertaining me, and it could at least buy you a coffee / beverage of your choice every once in a while.

** I'm slightly upset at the idea that psychics are able to read surface thoughts and change memories. For one, it feels a bit too cliche, but I could over look that. It's mostly the fact that we have somewhat of a understanding of how memories are formed and stored. In addition, memories are hardly static and should reasonable deteriorate/change over time, therefore, the idea that removing Red's partition would revert him back to a prior state seems a lot less believable than say, it would make him a lot more emotional especially on the subject of his father. To simply be thrust back to a state that he's already dealt with, even though it was under his psychic protection, would make his prior efforts to deal with his grief a complete waste of time.

Memories themselves are a function of the brain and for psychics to be able to alter memories or read surface thoughts you're essentially giving them the ability to alter the physical brains of others and not only observe the synaptic activities of said brains but also have the ability to understand those activities as an external system. To me that would break the boundaries of being human. It's simply too strong of a power. I also understand that there's an immense amount of training involved however that doesn't excuse the fact that psychic abilities are too strong.

Granted I understand that this is a fake world where our science doesn't truly follow, but it's a break in the foundation that you've built with the explanation of other pokemon abilities, i.e. charmander's ember and bulbasuar's leech seed.

Of course this is simply my opinion and I still enjoy your story quite a lot. As I said I'm only slightly upset and I'm looking forward to see where you'll take this story.

They actually can't change memories, just remove them. Not sure if that helps, but I think it's a big difference: being able to change memories would be incredibly overpowered, and I think even more unrealistic than the already unrealistic premise.

The point is that he did not originally deal with it: it was dealt with for him by his powers essentially blunting the emotional response and keeping it separate from his thoughts and feelings. If I understand the science behind neurology correctly (and I fully admit that I might not), memories change over time because of the constant interaction: hence my thought that having the emotional response to the memories kept separate would keep it the same as plausible.

Psychic powers absolutely are "too strong," but I would say that about practically anything else in the pokemon world as well, not the least of which being the pokeballs. But psychics are an integral part of the pokemon world, both reading thoughts and altering mental states. Removing those abilities would leave them basically just telekensis, which is nonsensically bizarre enough, but also kind of pointless as a stand-alone thing.

It's true, psychic powers are legitimately different from unusual biology of other pokemon. Fair warning, the same goes for ghost pokemon and some other aspects of pokemon's powers, like the Clefairy seen earlier: that's where I wanted to first show that there are some things that are, simply put, "magic." I'm going to try and make them as rational and consistent and defined as possible, but there's no way to make them not-magic because they're not based on any scientific foundation in our world.

Completely understand, and I appreciate the feedback :) Please do continue to let me know whenever you think some aspect of the world is too poorly defined, explained, or divorced from realism. Just because I have (in my mind) justifications for having unrealistic aspects in this case doesn't mean I always will, and if there's something fundamental I'm missing about how the mind or memories work, that's something that I'd like to know so I can adjust the way psychic powers work accordingly.

** I was wondering where you got the steps for when Red is upset. Is that a common thing I've just never heard of, or did you develop it yourself? It seems useful to have something like this, especially if you get upset a lot, like I tend to.
