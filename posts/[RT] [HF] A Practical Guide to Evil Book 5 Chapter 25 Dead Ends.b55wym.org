** So...Masego's trying to repair the weapon? And he's testing in Arcadia? Or maybe the Dead King's taking a leaf from Cat's book and is dropping a huge chunk of Arcadia onto Iserre. Just obliterate the entire principate to get rid of basically every enemy army.

I wonder how Masego would be powering the weapon though. Diverting power from the Observatory, which is what caused it to fail? Plus sapping Fae, maybe.

*** Using a 100k Fae instead of humans would definitely power the Fortress. Also would be less evil, which would suggest Masego still cares about that.

***** depends, since fay can't "die" the same way humans do, so you don't permanently kill them by sacrificing them just make them temporarily unavailable.

so morality is the difference of knocking someone into a coma for 1-12 months compared to offing them permanently, putting numbers on it I'd say it's a 7:1 at least.

****** I think that being used for ritual fuel is actually the /only/ way to permanently kill a fae, if I'm understanding the conversation at the end of [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/villainous-interlude-proscenium/][Proscenium]] is correct.

******* i read it just to check, and no, they don't say either or.

basically fae are made out of power and if it's used up completely it theoretically could kill the fae, according to Aqua, and since we don't know if squeezing it out completly is like trying to get 100% of all the juice in a lemon (semi-impossible) or if it's easier then that we don't know.

the fae say however that they can't be killed like that by mere mortals, if this is just their usual arrogance or actual truth we don't know.

so yes it might kill the fay, might not it's inconclusive.

***** The average fae foot soldier can be considered at the same power level of the typical transitional named, therefore the typical fae would probably he around the power level of a more passive names like scribe or in the old days, thief imo.

Basically more powerful than the average person, but still not all that powerful. So about 3:1.5 imo

*** The real question is why he's trying to repair the weapon, though the answer is obvious...

It's a Hellgate generator. Both of his fathers are in various Hells. He's trying to get them back.

**** If it's not this I'll be disappointed. Masego is easily arrogant enough and desperate enough to think this is a viable option.

Going to be a real heart wrencher when he fails. He haz yet to really run up against a true limit, but I'd bet this is one he can't overcome with any miracle. He's going to have to deal with his first major magical failure ON TOP OF losing both of his parents forever. Going to be very hard for Cat to convince him not to attempt TDK's apotheosis trap (which I'd bet dollars to donuts Masego is already well aware is totes a trap).

**** Hierarch's power (as we seen thus far) is subversion of humans, though. Witch trials that ultimately depend on the energy of a mob.

I'm leaning towards Masego testing Akua's weapon in Arcadia. And it must be a recent thing too, because Cat gated earlier when she jumped in front of all those horsemen.

****** Oh that's possible, given the fact that gates not working benefits him in tying down both the armies of Callow and Procer. Not sure how much experience he has dealing with devils though. Akua is the expert demonologist in this story.

Although if it was the Tyrant, I would be looking for an obvious sign proving it's his work. Like a glowing eye of Sauron shooting laser beams everywhere.

***** Not recent: intermittent. The gates have been wonky for a while now, with these same symptoms.

If Masego has been trial-and-erroring the hellgate creator, perhaps the times that gates worked correspond to times he was in research more rather than experiment mode?

*** It's about a world where meta-story reasons are real (plot armor is basically actually a thing) and some people, heroes and villains, receive Names that give them great power. Names like "Black Knight" and "White Knight", along with many others. Good and Evil are more than intangible concepts, they're sides in a massive game played between the Gods Above and the Gods Below, using Named and whole nations as pieces.

The main character is a young (teenaged) orphan from the recently conquered Good kingdom of Callow. She takes on an Evil name as the Squire to the Black Knight, hoping to change the system from the inside to help her homeland.

Lots of stuff happens.

Yes there are tons of really awesome fight scenes. Yes the main character (Cathetine) grows in power throughout the story in a very satisfying way. Her main strength, however, is genre awareness - she is acutely aware of stories and how they impact the narrative of the world.

Read it. It's one of the best YA web serials for sure.

#+begin_quote
  The Empire stands triumphant.

  For twenty years the Dread Empress has ruled over the lands that were once the Kingdom of Callow, but behind the scenes of this dawning golden age threats to the crown are rising. The nobles of the Wasteland, denied the power they crave, weave their plots behind pleasant smiles. In the north the Forever King eyes the ever-expanding borders of the Empire and ponders war. The greatest danger lies to the west, where the First Prince of Procer has finally claimed her throne: her people sundered, she wonders if a crusade might not be the way to secure her reign. Yet none of this matters, for in the heart of the conquered lands the most dangerous man alive sat across an orphan girl and offered her a knife.

  Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she has a plan.
