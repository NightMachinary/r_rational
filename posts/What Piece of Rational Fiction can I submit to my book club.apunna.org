I'm part of a book club at my local nerd social club. (we get together and play MtG, DnD or WoD RPGs I run an anime night Tuesdays, there's a board game night saturdays, that's the sort of audience we're talking about) Each month after discussing the last book we pull a name from a hat and they choose the next book.

​

I'm very fond of rational fiction and have been itching to discuss one as part of the club so last month I submitted Blindsight. I had just read it based on it's inclusion in [[http://ratficonline.website/][this anthology of rational fiction]]and it's published so other members of my group can get a physical or audiobook copy.

​

Now, their reception of this story wasn't great but that's not really an issue we've read through some much more hated books. However, what really struck me was how little I had really noticed the shortcomings of this story as rational fiction. People raised questions about the opaque motivation of the characters and the scientific accuracy of the protagonist's behavior. (the clinical evidence has never suggested having a lobe removed would lead to the seemingly autism-spectrum behavior of the protag) They pointed out how much of the science seemed jammed in sideways instead of a natural part of the story, and by the end I felt my opinion shift on Blindsight and while it had some interesting philosophy in there I don't consider it a very good example of rational fiction to have presented to them.

​

So basically I think I can do better. What would you recommend I suggest next time my name gets pulled from the hat? It must be of a reasonable length. Past books have had audiobooks of 12-20 hours at most so most of the better ratfics I've read could be submitted only as the first portion. I would also need to overcome the obstacle of printed copies and audio versions for those who prefer those formats. (though not strictly requirements I would feel slightly rude submitting a book that did not have a printed version and I would inconvenience the 3 most skeptical readers in the club by submitting a book with no audio version so while tricky I'd also like to avoid that)

​

Because of these requirements I've considered HPMoR, and handing out self-printed copies of the first several chapters (I prepared a full printed version for a friend of mine a few years ago). For the audiobook readers I could point them to the podcast. The issue though is that I'm finding it difficult to find a reasonable section of the first part of the story that has some point to reading only that part. I'm also not at all convinced it's the best example of rational fiction I could offer.

​

I really want to submit Worth the Candle more than anything. Maybe it's just because I've read it the most recently but I think it's the most compelling and well written ratfic I could suggest and the RPG style setting fits really well with my audience. However, it would be troublesome to provide a print copy and as far as I know an audiobook isn't even on the horizon (yet).

​

So considering all these things what does [[/r/rational]] think would be the best choice of ratfic I can suggest?


** Imo metropolitan man is the quintessential rational fic. It is true to the cannon world while reimagining the consequences of characters acting rationally. It's a nearly perfect short story.

** Surprised /The Martian/ hasn't been recommended, since it's pretty commonly considered to be a very mainstream but rational story. It's also an easy read, which I value personally.

If violent sex stuff is OK, /The Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect/ is interesting, and about AI safety (but very much a fantasy). But there's no audiobook, though there's a paperback as well as kindle.

It depends on your crowd though: it seems you're getting a lot of recommendations for fanfic. Do you think fanfic would go down well with your crowd? Based on the demographic, it seems... probably?

**** The ending makes the earlier parts of the book a giant plot hole. It severely breaks tone. However, it's also kind of neat IMO on a thematic level. It's like an irrational rejoinder to overconfidence in rationality, sort of.

Everything before that is fine in terms of plot holes. Its other big limitation is that the main character is too competent to be entirely interesting as a person, so the main joy is watching what he does, not observing who he is.

** Worth The Candle would get my vote if it wasn't for the desire to have an audiobook version. Also it's unfinished, so I don't know if that would be an issue for your group or not (though I'm assuming it wouldn't be since you yourself brought it up).

If you require an audiobook to exist of it, then you could read Worm. ([[http://audioworm.rein-online.org/][Audiobook project here]]). Though if you haven't read it, it's not rationalist fiction so much as just a rational setting where almost nothing feels contrived or out of place. The main characters are for the most part just regular smart people, not uber-rationalists. They're still very clever though, and even when you don't agree with their decisions you never feel like they're holding the idiot ball.

More seriously the audiobook project is very hard to understand sometimes and I don't think it's good enough to offer up as a real audiobook for the story. I also think Worm is best around the middle, and, again, it's not the first choice for an example of rational fiction. I might bring it up at some point down the line though.

It's very well-written and gets very deep in terms of being able to piece together what's going on. Lots and lots and lots of references to Jewish Kaballah and computer programming, so if you like both of those topics you will probably enjoy the story itself. If one or both of those topics goes unappreciated, the story will probably get a "meh".

It is not quite as self-contained as /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, but it at least reaches an emotional stopping point (Book 1 ends with a wistful scene of Harry writing a letter home after his eventful first week at Hogwarts). If your group likes it, you can add Book 2, [[https://cdn.rawgit.com/rjl20/hpmor/0c10d2e8b6bd68e88fd2fc6e6b233140917e7314/out/hpmor-2.pdf][/Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres and the Professor's Games/]], next month, and so on until you do all six.

Alternatively, you could try Book I of /Worth the Candle/ (chapters 1-14, covering the "tutorial"). As you mention, it doesn't have an audiobook version, but TTS programs have gotten really good at making decent audiobooks on demand, and it would be a great fit for a tabletop RPG group. Again, if your group likes it, can add the other books later.

My recommendation: Do all of /Methods/ first, to give /Worth the Candle/ as much time to progress as possible.
