** I enjoyed this - the Fermi Paradox has bothered me for a long time, and this is at least a clever way around it.

** My main problem with this scenario is that it doesn't seem like the precommitments that come up are in any way fundamental - why would an alien mind also settle on these?

This leaves you with no real incentive to pre commit, since the reciprocal commitment could easily be incompatible.

A secondary problem is trust - both parties would have to allow access to verifiable source code to rule out betrayal, and you basically get a prisoners dilemma with a massive power differential and unknown loyalty.

I just don't see this working.

The pronouns make it sound like it's being narrated in a shitty German accent.

*** That was my least favorite part - it was distracting and didn't seem to add that much to the feel of the story. I get /why/ it was done, but I don't think (for me) it served the purpose it was intended to serve.

**** I think it's meant to call back to Greg Egan's books. I don't know any other published authors who use ve/ver/ver.

No, Elder Brother, you won't. There wouldn't be much point in altering your value system if I didn't also make you happy with the changes.

*** To elaborate: Naturally, you don't want an alien superintelligence to engineer your value system so that you value B instead of A. And naturally, you would precommit to destroy anyone who does so.

But you wouldn't see it that way. From Younger Brother's perspective, his value systems would be changed from something wrong to something right. Surely that's something that he wants to happen?
