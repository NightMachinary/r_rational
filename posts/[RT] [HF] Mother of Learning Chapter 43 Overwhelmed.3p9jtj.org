** I love how Zorian starts out trying to be moderate. Only wants to make two friends to avoid drama, only wants to spend a bit of time on golems, only uses basic spells to avoid being overpowered... and he ends up with all the friends, him wanting to spend all day on golems, and still beating everyone else so bad Taiven started crying.

The accidental badass trope isn't used nearly enough.

It was because the Chinese webnovel was flooding that sub and the mod got dissatisfied with it. He/she believe that [[/r/LightNovels]] should be mostly discussing about Japanese novels.

Sadly most of us got tired of the typical Japanese MC trope which generaly is meek and coward. So this Chinese MC trope is kind of a blessing for now.

Therefore they eventually gave us 1-2 week notice (I forgot) to make a new sub or join the sub that they have made (I don't remember). Almost everyone choose to move to a new sub to avoid that mod though.

I shall seal the heaven is an example of a great chinese webnovel. Unlike the rest of its peers, the MC wasn't shoved with luck like the IET novels (e.g. coiling dragon). Nor the MC slaugher its way like in Martial God Ashura (maybe? I didn't read it)

Or you can always find translated "proper" novels & some more webnovels in [[http://www.spcnet.tv/forums/forumdisplay.php/29-Wuxia-Translations][here]]. You can find the translation of Condor Heroes series which is very popular in East asia. So much so that it has its anime. I personally recommend A step into the past by Huang Yi. It is quite rational IMO.

In the end though, you do need to understand some chinese culture to able to understand some their novels. Rebirth/reincarnation is not a common sense in every culture.

I think the sheer size of Chinese population (overseas Chinese included) makes it not as important to promote their novels outside their own region.

That is unlike Korea which depend their economy with that culture push.

*** I think the facility is unrelated to the time loop. Time dilation is something that is difficult, but can be done, and has been referenced before.

  [You're very close,] the matriarch said. [They were indeed trying to cause as much damage to the city as possible, but it was to be much more than a simple distraction. Apparently, the date of the summer festival is very magically significant. It is the day of the year when the barriers between planes of existence are the weakest. In fact, the weakening starts exactly one month before the date, gradually reaching its peak on the day of the festival. And this year's summer festival is even more special than usual. I'm afraid that us aranea don't know much about astronomy, seeing as we live largely underground, but apparently this year's summer festival includes some kind of... 'planetary alignment'?]
#+end_quote

Reasonable guess would be that the loop starts at the beginning of the alignment, ends at its peak. I'm curious about whether that means it starts 2:40am on the first day as well, if Zorian can somehow inject a "wake up" command in head for the very beginning. I think Kael was saying that's around when the Aranea die at the beginning of each loop.

  Yes. The logistics of time dilation are much more complex than people usually posit, though. I cringe every time someone write in a scene where a character spends a few months in their personal dimension (double cringe if they spend all those months alone; how are they not insane by the end?) like it's nothing. Later, when Zorian actually gains the capabilities to do that, I intend to explain why Zorian can't just casually abuse that idea.

It definitely exists down there, and Zorian will acquire access to either it or the necessary techniques, but it doesn't seem like he's going to be spending all time in such a place.

If if's significantly more than a notebook, then I think Zorian just got a stealth upgrade to his cross-timeline carry-over capabilities. Maybe even let Kael keep entire memories, at the absolute most optimistic.

Well, assuming those stones are something he can blueprint and reproduce, like his spell requires. And assuming the limiting factor in his brainspace isn't actually raw information rather than just mass. All right, maybe this /is/ bit too much of a speculation...

On another note, wow, he got killed so off-handedly by the lich. Shouldn't he be afraid his soul would've been ripped out of his body and kept as some kind of trophy, or something? Not that I would've seen that coming, since I thought Zorian wasn't having a noticeable effect on the invasion overall, but after the fact I feel like that's really something there should've been countermeasures for. Or at least some consideration whether Quatach-Ichl would bother.

Eh, but the drama ending was as neat a bombshell as I've ever seen.

From [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/4/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 4]], the lich's first combat instinct seems to be the red disintegration ray. The lich only resorts to soul magic when Zach practically yells it at him.

So basically, the lich would generally just murder Zorian. Assuming he survived somehow, he would have plenty of time to activate his suicide failsafes. But even if that didn't work, as long as he managed to not say "My soul is in a time loop, lol" like Zach did, the lich would just kill him.

That is, unless Red Robe informed the lich about Zorian beforehand, in which case he would almost certainly not wait until the invasion itself to mutilate his soul out of the loop.

It would take far too much time devoted to it to turn it into any kind of useful skill and it's not a game changer anyway. Seriously, what good are martial arts among high level mages? Ever see Quatach-Ichl or Kyron throw down with their fists? Plus most of his opponents are nonhuman and hence it's suicidal to get within range of them.

Taiven is just jealous atm, and if he does start explaining it will make things worse than if she just things he's born like that.

That one wouldn't work, because Taiven-of-this-loop has never seen an Aranea. They were soul-killed, so Zorian has never interacted with them to her knowledge.

******** Again, nope. If I had magic powers - which I don't honest - this is an example of the trivial but info-leaking kind of activity I would avoid.

Winning a lottery? It happens to someone. Winning a lottery, and also predicting a large number of other events with no plausible mechanism? /Highly/ suspicious. Better to use it three times only:

1. Do something big, which would usually have very severe consequences. Eg optimise the outcome of pulling a Snowden for every country, at the same time. If still anomyous, continue with #2 and #3.
2. Find personal happiness, eg via the power of Love^{^{TM}}
3. Excessive money - eg via a lottery - to accomplish whatever goals remain.

- According to the Filigree Sages, *shafts like these* were the 'secret' to the ease with which the aranea could penetrate even very deep layers on the dungeon without getting slaughtered in the process. While a *shaft like that* did allow for some of the horrid things from lower layers to reach you easier, they were very defensible and could always be collapsed on invaders if incursions got too frequent. In cases where *such shafts* didn't exist, aranea were liable to create them via application of stone shaping spells. --- Imho, the description gets kinda repetitive and could be changed slightly to amend against that.
