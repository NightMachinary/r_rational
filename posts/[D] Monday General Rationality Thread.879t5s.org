Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I sometimes check out topwebfiction just to see if anything new catches my eye. I noticed a new series (new to me, at least) has taken the number 2 spot: [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/small-worlds/]["Small Worlds"]] by Alex Raizman. Apparently it's only been up since March 15th, but I'm a bit surprised it has so many votes. The author says he regularly posts to [[/r/writingprompts]], so maybe that explains it?

Anyway, before investing time into that, or its follow-up [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/strange-cosmology/]["Strange Cosmology"]] (currently number 18 on the site), I was wondering if anyone else had read them yet, if they were recommended, and if they were rational?

*** Just a follow-up; I decided to give Small Worlds a shot. [[/u/Turniper]] hit it dead on as "popcorn reading;" it's quick and action-packed, and while it has hints of deeper themes to explore and threads to follow, it's rather shallow overall. This isn't necessarily a plot you need to think about and wonder what comes next, because "what comes next" will literally happen in the next chapter.

Like [[/u/dalitt]] said, it definitely draws inspiration from American Gods and has some MiB influence too. I also felt echoes of Unsong; a lot of the gods alter reality by manipulating equations, which felt similar to the Word manipulations in Unsong. But overall I'd say the entire thing felt like a superhero story where the heroes are gods.

Definitely not a rational story, though. /Everything/ happens because the plot requires it - or at least, we don't get enough insight into seeing why characters act like they do to say otherwise. Rather than delving too deeply into the rules of the world, the most common catch-phrase is literally "just roll with it." That said there are some decent applications for solving fights, but they seem designed solely to show off a cool outcome. The characters themselves act in such a way that these moments feel railroaded to an extent.

Anyway, it was a quick read (I finished it in less than a day). I may read the sequel, as the story stopped without remotely resolving the main plot, but only because I don't have anything else to read right now. I'd give it a 5/10, maybe a 5.5/10 because the dangling threads make me a bit curious as to where it'll go.

Thanks to the two posters for chiming in!

****** Pretty much all the good ones have been posted at least once. Practical is a must if you haven't read it yet, super powereds and savage divinity are also excellent. Mother of learning has obviously been posted plenty, as has anything wildbow. Star child was meh, similar to small worlds, maybe a little better, iron teeth is supposed to be good but I just haven't been able to get into it. Large chests is meh, mediocre writing and too many sex scenes, same with dao of magic, except minus the sex scenes. Good student is decent, though I haven't read any since finishing 1-30, waiting for it to get farther ahead.

** So I've been thinking about the goals I have when arguing politics. Namely, to

1. Moderate the views of opposite-side extremists towards the center in the hopes of decreasing the amount of extremists my side needs to deal with.
2. Moderate the views of same-side extremists towards the center so they're less likely to go "all parties are the same", and then dig their heels in to prevent incremental change that they don't feel goes far enough.

Obviously, this is strategically contradictory. Should I seek to use dark arts rationality to pose as an opposite-side member that's become dillusioned with the "establishment" because it's not extreme enough? Or should I use dark arts rationality to dillusion the faith opposite-side extremists typically have in their fellow human beings, so they go further towards the center, but hopefully don't become significantly more likely to actually use their voting power?

(As a given, I think debate is fun and enjoyable on its own merits, so even despite the fact that I'm not really likely to substantially change people's minds I'll still keep arguing.)

*** It's funny, I was thinking about debating recently. Quoting myself:

It's a little abstract, but it's like, metaphorically... being aware that it's not enough to push, you need your feet to be on solid ground. Knowing "my position" and why I believe in it isn't enough, I have to know "normal", and why people would be there; what obstacles there are between "normal" and my position, and respect these obstacles as serious enough to warrant a true effort.

I think this is a process a lot of people fail at, because they see a different opinion, they see their opinion, and they just fill the gap with generic [naïveté / cognitive bias / prejudice / pure evil / a society that never taught them better / stupidity] in a way that's reassuring (my position is the right one, but people disagree because they're stupid and they grew in a prejudiced society) but not actually good at finding ways to "bridge the gap". So they just say "this is why my position is the best, you really need to realize that", and that's only enough for people who are already almost convinced.

  my side
#+end_quote

From my point of view, this is the problem. It suggests that /you/ are an extremist, or more accurately a partisan, and I'm not sure what the difference really is.

A moderate won't say "my side". A moderate doesn't want a single party in control of government, because they know a party's goal's aren't policy objectives, but staying in control (and maybe using that control for personal gain).

A partisan will find it more important to /damage the other side/ than to /achieve preferable outcomes/.

#+begin_quote
  should I use dark arts rationality
#+end_quote

I'd be worried, but nothing I've seen indicates you have any such skills. In terms of strategy, knowing your limits is also pretty important.

--------------

In order to achieve preferred outcomes, in an open and free society, it is best to simply argue for the preferred outcomes as diligently and persuasively as possible, proposing whatever strategy seems wise. Doing otherwise can have disastrous consequences.

--------------

In terms of "goals I have when arguing politics", "achieving policy outcomes" hasn't been one in quite a long time. The odds of actually changing someone's mind is so incredibly small, and the effects of success are also highly limited -- the outcome isn't worth the effort. And "winning" an arguing is something only children try to do. Better goals are to "learn" and "educate", with emphasis on the former and humility in the latter. Suppose in the course of debate that you successfully educate someone on viewpoint. Maybe they'll convert to your position, or maybe they'll use their new understanding to dismantle your position when debating with someone else.

Personally, I just love the thrill of the intellectual battle. Experience, knowledge, and raw intelligence -- crafting hypotheticals and thinking through scenarios in realtime... no one is likely to convert anyone else (especially on key issues), but it sure is fun, and in the end, I usually know more than I went in with.

Preach.

#+end_quote

I don't think it's that small. People do change their opinion over time. I think there's also an effect where people don't want to appear weak and back down in a debate, even when they're so convinced by an argument that they internalize it and start sincerely believing it over time.

I am indeed a partisan. That doesn't make non-moderate, however-- it's simply the truth of FPTP. If you're at all left of center, you vote democrat. If you're at all right of center, you vote republican. And we've learnt that anything less than total control of the government by one party results in absolutely nothing getting done.

Of course I don't know dark arts rationality-- I've never needed it before. But appealing to people's basest impulses isn't /that/ difficult to learn.

I'm not convinced about that. Again, I don't think I'm an extremist (at least, relative to most positions I hold), but I'm still relatively extreme compared to a lot of people. If I try to argue for what I actually want, they'll just dismiss me out of hand. And the outcomes can't be more disastrous than they already are-- these people are already doing what they can to work against me and support what is (from my perspective) bad policy.

#+begin_quote
  In terms of "goals I have when arguing politics",... (Snip)
#+end_quote

Why try to do anything other than win the debate? That's just self defeating. I try to recognize when I'm wrong, but doing anything other than attempting to further my goals is just even more of an objective waste of time than usual.

And yes, I know that it's impossible to truly convert most people. But it is significantly more likely that I can make someone less or more extreme in their beliefs, and as I mentioned in the first post, I'm wondering wich tactic is more effective.

The problem is that if people realize that you are not debating in good faith, they will promptly ignore you altogether.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If that's the case, you're probably facing a difference in outcome preference rather than policy preference. If so, you need to back up and address the outcome preferences. For instance, you might take the position that the ultimate fate of mankind should be digital uploading, because this offers the most potential for longevity, experience, and individuality. Someone else might say that whatever mankind becomes, we should remain identifiably human, and therefore digital uploading is off the table. You might not be talking politics anymore at this point, but it could still be an interesting discussion.

On the other hand, revealing truly distasteful views will end a discussion. People I have debated with in the past have claimed bestiality should be seen as acceptable and non-deviant behavior; or that they see nothing morally or ethically wrong with killing babies. Notably, some people promote racial or ethnic genocide. If you suspect even for a moment that people find your positions truly repugnant, then you should educate yourself on the issue more thoroughly and figure out why your position is socially or morally unacceptable.

I am not a lawmaker. I don't draft public policy. I'm not a pundit, or professor, or other sort of thought leader. Therefore, engaging in any sort of political debate is primarily a form of entertainment. Which isn't to say it isn't practical: developing a better model of the world is always worthwhile, whether that means learning a new thing, or understanding a different perspective. Nevertheless, this sort of debate is basically just entertainment.

I think you're misunderstanding my point. It's not that I only enjoy debates if I win them, it's that if I don't think I can win a debate, then that implies that I think my position is worse than my opponent's. In which case, why would I argue for a position that I realize is worse?

#+begin_quote

Well sure, but that's an implementation problem. It's pretty easy to make an alt account, and people can take a long time to catch on if you're not insulting and pretend like you're an ingroup member.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That's the fundamental question, though. /Should/ I address the outcome preference, by arguing that a more centrist position is in both their interest and mine, even if we ultimately want different outcomes (which is the tack I currently take, and of course intend to keep taking for same-side extremists)? Or should I pretend to agree with their outcome, but suggest that the political party they'd otherwise align themselves with aren't extreme enough to implement the policies that would lead to their preferred outcome?

I understand pretty well why people find some of the things I want weird or unappealing. I'm not going to spontaneously change my value system, however. But I'm pragmatic enough to know that arguing directly for them is unlikely to work in my favour, so instead I'm considering alternate strategies for getting what I want.

*** My principle in this is: whatever you're discussing, and whoever you're debating, never lie. Never fake your principles, never misrepresent your values. You can and should do great things with your way of presenting things, your choice of language, words, examples, angles to approach things from, but outright lying or faking just makes the problem more complicated. It's how we got in this shit we're in. Don't do something you wouldn't wish as a universal principle, and everyone lying about one's ideals would make political debates even worse a madhouse than they already are.
