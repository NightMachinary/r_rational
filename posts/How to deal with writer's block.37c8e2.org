I was writing a rational fiction but the plot got inevitably derailed and I ran out of source material and now I'm having trouble catching any inspiration for anything new while I wait for more source material that may or may not eventually be created. I tried to write yugioh fanfiction, but I could never figure out how to make it work to my satisfaction. Also, I don't know that much science. Every time I come up with a relatively vague idea and I can't figure out how I want to flesh it out, to the point where I can't even come up with a basic concept of the plot, just the vague and uncertain impression of collections of tropes battling it out in my head as my imagination searches through them for a fun and interesting story to no avail. Any advice?

Thanks!


** Just keep writing. In the process of writing, ideas will eventually come to you, and if you look at your words and see that they're crap, hopefully you'll get some understanding of /why/ they're crap, and figure out a way to fix it.

Writer's block doesn't have to mean staring at the keyboard doing nothing, and I personally think that's the wrong way to deal with the block.

(If the problem is that you don't know enough about something, you can alternately spend your time doing research.)

** I haven't found a way to push through it. It's obviously possible, but I haven't found myself in a situation where I absolutely need to produce (since school, at least), so I've always dealt with it by stepping back and doing something else. Something else is usually finding something to read, or possibly watch or play. This does mean I mostly write in waves, cranking out 10k words a week for while and then not writing almost at all for a while, but it works for me. I'm sure it's different for those who have already broken through and managed to get published. In the words of Jim Butcher: "I don't have a muse, I have a mortgage."

** I am not a writer so take what i am saying with a grain of salt, But i read something before which felt true for me(in the context of writing technical stuff etc.). i think its something by Stephen King , though it might have been someone in here just as well.

"There's no such thing as a writers block, there's only holding yourself to too high a standard. see that if you try letting yourself write without being negative about it eventually you will manage to write something which you will also feel good about, but if every time you start to write you are stopping yourself because its not good enough you will never get there"

googling a bit i see a similar quote by William Stafford, if that helps
