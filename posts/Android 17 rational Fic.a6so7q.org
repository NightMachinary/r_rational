In the Dragon Ball Super series the character Android 17 seems quite rational (even compared to the wise Namekian):

Do you know of any rationalist fic about him?


** There are perhaps four rational / rational adjacent DB fics in general, which comes on top of there only be hundred or so good ones overall. As far as I'm aware, there isn't any extant fic that fits this criterion, and I do a lot of searching in the DB fandom across many websites. Android 17 fics are also unfortunate steely rather rare on the ground in general, as he only recently achieved any real popularity in the fandom with the ToP.

*** That's not really rational, much less rationalist, and definitely isn't about Android 17.

** Anyone remember a fanfic in which the relationship between Crillin and A18 is a subject of discussion?
