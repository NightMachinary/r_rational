** I'm really iffy about the identification of this comic as rationalist fiction. Overall, a lot of the world building is poorly explored and explained. Things happen, /then/ we find out why the main character is so cool to have done what she did. The world doesn't always make sense and problems are solved in ways the reader can't really anticipate themselves.

Worst of all, throughout the story she and other people are essentially batman: pulling solutions out of a metaphorical utility belt, or ninja-arguing their way out of situations using concepts being introduced for the first time. See my recent comment on the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/21xyoa/hfd_sandersons_first_law_on_the_rules_of_magic/cght80e][Sanderson post]] about why this doesn't work. All this is presented with a sort of high-school mentality, where the world bends in response to a single forthright individual's strongly held and logically consistent opinions.

There are situations where this doesn't work or backfires. The protagonist is then often horribly physically and/or mentally abused in an almost /fetishistic/ way as a consequence, but the long-term results of those failures are usually either minimal or eventually reversed.

Somewhere along the line, the protagonist will have a chance to bemoan a world where people like her are targeted by the norms, followed by her saying how she won't change the choices she makes; even if that very decision puts her at a disadvantage compared to a strategy of better disguising or mediating her responses based on the acknowledged reality of the situation.

A lot of the author's philosophical points are perfectly valid, but it is presented through the lens of a sort of late-adolescent wish fulfillment. The main protagonist is quite clearly a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl][Manic Pixie Dream Girl]] and a rather poorly excused [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Mary Sue]], to use the common fanfic term. Her flaws are enduring traits and both mental and physical problems are really strengths. The protagonist narrowly avoids being [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth][Too Good For This Sinful Earth]] as the climax to a number of plot lines.

I get the feeling that the author was, at least at first, exploring their own philosophical thoughts in public and maybe feeding a few fetishes more than trying to tell a complete and rational story. Because of the lack of sustained and consistent world building at the start, and some major characterization issues, it fails for me as a rational story. At least, the first few years of it do. If someone is up on the current status and finds my views outdated or wrong, I'm very open to being corrected.

** What's this about, exactly? I'm not quite convinced that clicking on an NSFW link is worth my time.

*** It's a bit hard to describe; if I had to call it anything, I'd call it a philosophical fantasy webcomic. Different characters collide in a medieval-ish setting, and their interactions revolve around trying to fix various messes by doing the smart thing. The nsfw material is soft; there's a bit of nudity, and I think a sex scene or two, but all in the service of examining romance philosophically, and trying to optimize it.

***** Oh, man.... It'd be a hoot if the comic is unpopular, but the link gets upvoted because the /thread/ is good. XD
