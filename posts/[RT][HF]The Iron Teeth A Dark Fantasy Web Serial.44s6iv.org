** Hey man. I read your story as updates come out. It's really good and I like the character progression.

It would be cool to see more about the magic system though.

*** Thanks for the comment. I have some more chapters coming up that will explain it a bit more but I also don't want to just make them a info dump...

I might do a journal on the topic, to fill the gap until I have time to feature it more in the actual story.

** Hey everyone! I just found this subreddit and I'm super excited to find other people who love the same kind of fiction as me.

My story definitely counts as rationalist as Brandon Sanderson was one of my major influences, especially in creating a consistent magic system. I also strive to take fantasy monsters and present them as real animals that exist in a ecosystem.

Check it out and tell me if I'm breaking any of my own rules!
