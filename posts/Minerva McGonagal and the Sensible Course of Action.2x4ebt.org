** McGonagall /isn't/ smarter than that, which is part of the problem. I did enjoy this departure though - I'd like to see more of these, where the whole plot is screwed up by someone thinking a little bit more about things.

*** I reckon if Time-Turners are really rare and fragile, which Prof. McGonagall says they are, then Madame Pomfrey or whoever should /already/ be coordinating student time travel. That way you get all your Hermione Grangers in the same place, cutting down on the effort put into avoiding paradoxes and saving on the number of ridiculous artefacts in Hogwarts.

I made a point similar to this once before and got shot down, but... eh...

**** Yeah, I'd imagine there'd be a separate "time-turner program" in the same way that schools have AP programs, with coordinators et al.
