**** Idea: secret magician/warlock/summoner makes contact with an eldritch entity, it enters into the world in a (semi-)physical vessel, the two fall in love and get on swimmingly. Some time later, the magic user's day job/persona is a somewhat introverted and seemingly mild-mannered accountant whose social skills seem a bit off, and after initially setting into their new job over a few days/weeks, some of their coworkers start to reach out and talk to the new hire. Conversations about "married life" and "hobbies outside work" come up around the water cooler and our protagonist has to balance navigating these discussions for the sake of politeness and a desire to be on good terms with their coworkers, while also not saying weird stuff because a relationship with a trans-dimensional cosmic "horror" is going to have different dynamics, different discussions, and go on different dates than what is normal. It's a romantic comedy about the differences in relationships people have, but the main character's relationship comes from a literally supernatural understanding of one another.
