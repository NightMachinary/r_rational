*** SI fits organically within the story as if the character actually belonged there, unlike almost all SI.

That's because it's never told from the SI point of view. We, the readers can pick up hints of the SI's origin, even as the characters in the story didn't suspect a thing.

Obviously, this will change as the SI ages and she is able to comprehend her memories and situation. But we'll witness all of this externally, without access to her POV.

That's the premises.

Other than that, it divulge into the origin and politics that lead to the third ninja world war even as butterflies derail canon.

**** Just read the few chapter that are up. This is surprisingly good. I am always leary of self insert fics because they have a very high tendency to be op wish fulfillment crappie. This story does not do that are works hard to avoid that by not using the pov of the si. Additionally the characters are well fleshed out and mostly true to cannon from what I can recall. They act rationally and I think this is perfect for this sub.

***** /his story does not do that are works hard to avoid that by not using the pov of the si/

I am sorry? Can you rephrase that?

/This is surprisingly good./

I agree. Naruto SI these days are a bit overdone, so it's good to see a new refreshing original twist.

** I like how it is kept ambiguous how much of the SI's behavior is just them being a small child, and how much is planned manipulation.
