I read recently an epic fanfic, Lady Knight Volant, set in Tamora Pierce's Tortall between the second-to-last chapter and the end of the last Protector of the Small book. (It draws not just on Keladry's stuff but also on every other Tortall book and the Tales short stories.)

I figured I'd mention it here (link is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/511762/chapters/902085]]) because it hits at one of the things that I think is central to a lot of good rational fanfic works: interrogating the question of "what would have happened if {character/s} had undertaken {more-optimal path}.

Why so little integration into the economy of Immortals? What does it mean to try to make peace with same in the middle of a war? How do we adapt our understanding of the "bad" Immortals (in particular spidrens) to the revelation in Bone's Day Out?

Anyway, figured I'd drop the link in here and see if anyone is similarly Tortall-obsessed and wants to read a casual half-million words or whatever.

Note: It's kind of Mary Sue-esque, but not in the lack of consequences to the main character or the lack of appropriate challenges to the character's new heights of capability and ability to form unlikely alliances.


** Wow, I read those books like 15 years ago and enjoyed them quite a bit. Haven't thought about them in a long time. I may check this out if I burn through my backlog. (Though Protector of the Small was my least favorite of Pierce's series... [Edit: first three Tortall* series, since I see she's written more which I haven't read])

Thanks for the rec.

*** Keladry's solution to bullies won over my heart, which is in large part why it's among my favorites.

**** I just remember there being a bit too much preteen relationship drama for me as a 13 y/o boy, which is probably why it fell to third place in my rankings. What was Keladry's solution again? I know Alanna's was "quietly take the beatings and train until you're strong enough to beat them back"

***** There were three or four boys that took that traditional hazing too far and crossed the line into bullying constantly. So Keladry patrolled the halls and would start fistfights with anyone she caught bullying, which eventually inspired her peers to do the same until the bullying stopped.

***** "Wanna fight? Fight me." it was less Alanna's "quietly take it and train", and more "go out picking fights with bullies and rally your peers to stand by your side".

** When I was around ~12 and browsing in a Barnes & Noble my mom handed me 'First Test.' About a decade later she was surprised to hear the book had been about a gal.\\
Later that year, at summer camp, I was discussing the Lioness Quartet with another young camper, and I vividly relish the memory of her saying that she "really liked the lioness quartet, except that Alanna was such a slut."

I definitely believe there is room for rational fiction in Tortall, and I am excited to read it.

*** I really liked the portrayal of Alanna in that book, I went to Catholic school and it was the first portrayal of healthy relationships that I really found in media. She had sex for fun as well as for romance, she made sure people treated her right, and she valued being respected. It was really, really good especially when so many YA books pretend sex doesn't exist. Whereas the Lioness Quartet has that wonderful scene where Alanna gets her first period and has NFI what is going on.

** It has some interesting ideas, but I quickly got sick of how everyone keeps being shocked and awed at how awesomely awesome Keladry's awesomeness awesomes.
