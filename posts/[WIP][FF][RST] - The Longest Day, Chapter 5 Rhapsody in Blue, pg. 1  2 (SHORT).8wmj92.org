I couldn't really think of a good way to tell the next part of Hermione + Twilight's story in words, so I opted for a different medium. I expect that I'll release two-three pages or so along with each written chapter for the next ~5-10 chapters.

** Okay... we know Hermione's an alicorn at the moment because she copied Twilight's body plan, but if she comes back to life as a pony, will she continue being an alicorn because she's now survived death?

(I guess the reason for her to be a pony would be if she decides Atlantis aka Equestria is so fascinating she wants to visit and research there herself. She probably wouldn't stay long if Harry's still on Earth, though.)

On another note, which Element maps to which?

*** Questions that will definitely be answered as the story goes on... :)

As for the Elements, the mapping is as such:

Generosity/Beauty -> Space (Mirror of Noitilov)

Honesty/Strength -> Power (Philosopher's Stone)

Laughter/Hope -> Time (???)

Kindness/Healing -> Life (Deathly Hallows)

Loyalty/Bravery -> Mind (???)

Magic/Sorcery -> Love (Friendship is Magic!)

The Element of Mind and Time will have brief cameos in the upcoming chapter.

**** Honesty as the Philosopher's Stone - that's ingenious!

I suppose the representations of the Elements in different continua are separate - so, for instance, Applejack won't be taking the Philosopher's Stone away from Dumbledore?

**** I don't actually know a lot about Latin, of course, but doesn't /generosity/, if you look /way/ back, come from a word kind of overlaps with power? I was kind of hoping those would be the names of the same element.

Oh, and, reddit ignores single line breaks. You'll need double line breaks for that to show up as separate lines, possibly with bullet list syntax to distinguish it for ordinary paragraphs.

***** Thanks for the formatting tip!

My understanding (not being a Latin major either) is that the "generosa" meant more like "nobility" rather than explicit power. But they do go hand in hand; that interpretation had crossed my mind. But my hands were kinda tied since MLP canon pretty much specifically defined Honesty as mapping to Strength.

** So...The people of Atlantis transfigured themselves into unicorns for the eternal life? Like a version of what happened to Hermione except without keeping human form?

***** Or might their blood have similar effects? AFAIK, pegasi never appeared in HP or HPMOR canon, and earth ponies are definitely different from anything on Earth. The only information we have is Pinkie's statement (backed up by WoG) that nopony ever dies in Equestria.

It appears there are actually /several/ magical pony species which cannot do magic. I think these must be the form other sentient beings (merpeople, centaurs, goblins, veela, etc) take, when fused with the unicorn.

there's a surprising amount of overlap given the completely distinct canons
