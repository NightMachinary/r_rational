Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55zwfb/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d8fb6tj][Last week]] I posted my take on the universe of Young Wizards that I thought clarified some points that were left ambiguous in a way that tied into the themes of the series, like how wizard pets work and using that as an explanation for other nonwizard supernatural powers.

One thing that I realized I didn't rationalize, however, was the actual story. Young Wizards is really about children with magic powers fighting evil, often with little assistance. Nita and Kit are tackle most of their quests alone and only receive advice from adults, and that is implied to be the norm for wizard children.

I have yet to read all of the books, but so far a reason has not been given for this. It's made clear that younger wizards have more power, but it's never clear why. Sometimes it seems like it compensates for their lack of experience, but at others they're recruited because they inherently possess more power.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/51low4/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d7cvjlz][I've tried to rationalize child heroes before in a way that didn't have unsettling implications]], but Young Wizards just avoids the question of why the Powers That Be throw children in the line of fire and hope they survive. Is there an explanation that is thematically appropriate for the series?

*** I always assumed younger wizards have more power just because that's how the universe works. Perhaps entropy itself wears down a wizard's magic over time? Just like the Powers That Be can't (and won't) totally destroy entropy, they can't change this.

**** When I first considered that idea I was annoyed that it implied wizardry is tied to a person's idealism or innocence, which I associate with naïveté. But now that I think about it, a naïve wizard would probably fail while those that succeed would maintain their idealism in the face of darkness and evil that encourage you to give in to cynicism. That is actually one of my favorite themes for stories to explore...and I had completely forgotten that all the books in the series are about exactly that.

** I'm homebrewing an extremely weird Pathfinder campaign setting. Which has led to come up against yet again, with some of the problems with trying to figure out all you can do with control over your own mind. Within the setting there is a group that due to magical alteration from birth has total control of their own mind, as well as the ability to run programs in their mind, which are far easier to design than any normal programming.\\
For all intensive purposes all the abilities a simulated human mind would have (except for being able to run far faster) these people have as well; though they still have normal human bodies bodies, plus this is a non-magitek fantasy setting so there are limitations on what they can do with many of their powers.\\
It's of note that the setting /was/ a magitek setting more advanced than our own before a magical cataclysm so modern logic and stuff is fair game to consider. The nature of the post cataclysm world basically means things are in a crude simulation running in the minds of insane gods so nearly all advanced tech and chemistry doesn't apply, and the new magic system makes magic highly reliant on mages to constantly power and maintain it making magitek doubly impractical at any large scale.

/So the question is, what do you expect from the psychology of a group of people that have been in total control of their minds source code from infancy?/ I immediately realized the problems from wireheading, so at the very least the magical enhancements (which /have/ to be done in infancy) have some weak protections against artificially giving yourself any sensations that are /too/ enjoyable. However these could be easily be circumvented once somebody has basic logic skills. So the question arises how do you stop people from gradually going down the road to wireheading, especially when you're talking about children? Another point arises, how would the ability to always have the willpower to act in the way you wish affect somebody? Especially if that's the only thing they knew. I have a strong suspicion that these people would have extremely condescending views on other humans, because they have no sympathy for a lack of complete self control.\\
I also wonder the effects of people from childhood being able to just shut off negative emotions at will. I wonder how likely it is that this could lead to everyone in this society being perfectly selfish rational agents, and how that would bode when these people have a disproportionate amount of power politically and magically.

There was a story on the reddit where somebody got the ability to manually control how much they liked things that is somewhat relevant but I can't find it for the life of me.\\

*** They have people who don't want to reprogram themselves in harmful ways? Do those people understand /why/ they don't want to do that?

From that point, it's a simple matter of applying that patch to other people, either through guiding them or the scary magics.

Simply put, I expect them to use magic to make sure that everyone's in roughly the same mind space. And if they don't?

Expect them to be outcompeted by those that do (ctrl-f [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][4. The Malthusian trap]]).

Of course diversity is valuable as well, but having everyone be in the same mind-space means that you can use technique like super cooperation. So whatever the minimal set of changes they can make that accomplished that, I guess. Presuming they're in a cooperative environment.

**** They're unlikely to be out-competed /as a whole/ in /any/ scenario because being the only people who can become mages in more than one very narrow area is a /tremendous advantage/. They are also basically immune to mind control so that also helps cement their political power. The only other groups that have been able to cement nearly as much power are the bloodline of people gifted in mind control, and /dragons/.

I can see your point about those who use strict indoctrination having more success if that means they are less likely to wirehead. However You can't use magic to make sure they're in the same mind-space, mind control on these people requires a /really/ good mage so you can't count on magic making a difference here.\\
The Malthusian traps are also going to be complicated by the fact that since these people hold so much power, anybody who defects is going to lose status, or worse.

*** It sounds to me like the risks of the enhancement would result in a specialized school to indoctrinate the children in a philosophy that discourages unwanted behaviors. Don't go wirehead because you have a responsibility to others. Don't reprogram your emotions because that risks turning you inhuman, with horrific examples of dark lords past and present.

The willpower problem is very weird because there's no psychological model where you can make yourself want or not want something at will. Even if you could encourage the kids to want to do something, they could change their entire value system whenever they wanted and not want to change back. What sense of identity would these people have if they know they're minds are just programs?

**** Yeah one bit that's going to make indoctrination difficult; is that the mages of this world mainly come from this group of people. Mages in this world are the ideological descendants of magical engineers in the old world (so scientists and engineers basically), so they aren't a culture that's likely to be very fond of this sort of indoctrination even if it's extremely valuable.

There's also the problem that there's no way to know what kind of changes they have preformed to their mind without powerful and rare levels of magic, and with total control over one's emotions and physiological responses, deceit should come with great ease.\\
There's also the fact that you can't very well tell them to not reprogram their emotions /whatsoever/, that sort of thing isn't likely to fly. At the very least people want their kids to learn magic and that requires a tremendous amount of mental discipline that you can't acheive without either over a century of training, or manipulating your mind.

***** Why do people even want to create these types of mages if they're so difficult to control? It seems like every one of these mages is already considered insane even if they're on your side, and that's assuming you can even find them if they want to hide. The only story purpose I can see for them is for antagonists or ambiguous allies, since every one of these should be feared by everyone.

****** Well keep in mind prior to the creation of these people the only magic users were: Clerics (as I said all the gods are insane so clerics can get away with damn near anything that the gods shattered mind can't /obviously/ tell is opposed to it's values) who tend to also go a bit insane from contact with their god, sorcerers who can can only master the one kind of magic in their bloodline, and humans that managed to become mages through over a century of training, along with some who mastered it without necromancy by being genius magical prodigies.

Plus while theirs a clear danger from the one's that turn off empathy and act as purely selfish agents, that's not necessarily going to be the norm. If a lot of powerful mages and the god (well more of a demigod, but it's complicated) of magic all become enamored with an idea it's not hard to imagine how lots of people could get on board with this project to make magic vastly more widespread.

I'm not sure why you think they'd all be dangerously insane. There's two main threats that come to mind: The people who wirehead themselves until they either die or are otherwise rendered impotent, and the people who go down the slippery slope of turning off unpleasant things like guilt until they become totally selfish.\\
The one's who become totally selfish are the only dangerous ones but they're still totally rational, given the existence of contract and truth magic and the massive drawbacks to being cut off from the rest of the magical world there's a clear incentive to follow the laws.

** If there's a very dangerous and predatory species of natural animal that favors hunting humans and livestock (by "natural animal" I mean something like the larger dinosaurs, as opposed to a magical creature - something that could easily exist in our world), would it be realistic for humans to simply avoid their territory, or launch targeted extermination campaigns where their territory is particularly attractive, rather than outright launching a global campaign to drive the species to extinction?

*** Depends on what tech level you're at. Large enough creatures would take an army to fight, and squabbling feudal princes wouldn't want to leave themselves open to attack after exhausting their resources on the beasts.

You could also say the creatures have religious significance, so the people believe they are the will of the gods, who punish the greedy and sinful, which would carry over to just about any time frame you want to portray.

** Let's say I have a world filled with magical fire and ice creatures. The fire creatures populate the poles and the ice the equator. Is it reasonable for such creatures to begin to reverse the climates of these regions, what effects might this have on the planet, and, if the creatures would be negligible, what external events might cause the reversal instead?

*** Ooh boy, the global circulation is going to be messed up /so/ badly.

- Ocean currents are largely driven by density changes... caused by temperature and salinity changes at the poles (the salt is rejected by ice formation).
- "Hadley cells" (atmosphere) are responsible for the cross biophysical structure of earth, causing subtropical deserts (eg Australia, the Sahara...) and driven by temperature differences.

All of these things are deeply influenced by the Coriolis effect, and making the poles hot and the equator cold is going to be /very, very messy/.

Over the period of a short change (anything less than many thousands of years), expect chaos worse than the nightmares of climate change activists. Every existing ice sheet will melt. Most species would go extinct and ecosystems will collapse. Sea level will be all over the place. Rain and temperatures will be highly unpredictable, leading to massive agricultural problems. Expect plenty of storms, droughts, floods, mudslides, and other disasters.

*** As a rough number, the poles receive 200 watts/m^{2} less energy from the sun than the equator, so swapping climates would take a change of 400 w/m^{2} (if we accept a naive interpretation of climate).

If we assume that the creatures are deer-sized and have the population density of deer in a good habitat (100 kg, 20/km^{2),} then each fire creature would have to put out 2 MW of heat, and each ice creature would have to absorb that much.

The box in [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/35/][This What-If]] looks deer-sized. According to that, 2 MW of output would mean that the surface of the fire creatures is about 1300C. If I'm doing my math right (which I'm obviously not), then the ice creatures would need to be at -1000K, or else cheat somehow.

Of course, that's all assuming that the heat/cold is coming directly from their bodies, as opposed to any sort of area effect.

**** I think this implies that the pole reversal won't happen by accident. But if the creatures are intelligent then I can easily imagine them creating some sort of magical technology to cause this reversal deliberately. Large elemental spires that create or absorb heat in a manner similar to their bodies but on a larger scale. Or something like that.

Have you accounted for geometry? There's a far greater area within 100km of the Equator (~520,000 km^{2} ) than within 100km of the poles (~62,800 km^{2} ).
