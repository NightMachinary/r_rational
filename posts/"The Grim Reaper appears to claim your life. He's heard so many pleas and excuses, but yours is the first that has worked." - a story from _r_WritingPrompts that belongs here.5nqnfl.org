** 1) I can think of situations where multiple people have made a complaint and all were wrong; for instance, several people have claimed that Jews bake Christian babies' blood into matzohs.

2) If the guy is a better reasoner than Death, Death's response should be to invoke [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html][epistemic learned helplessness]] and ignore his reasoning no matter how good it sounds, just like most real-life human beings will.

3) If Death has previously been exposed to arguments about not taking people, he should have been previously exposed to /this/ argument, and already had an answer for it.

**** That was what I expected as well. Asking if, over time, he has come later and later in the process of 'dying' as the medical science advanced and what some generations would consider 'dead' became merely 'seriously injured, but savable'.

Then extrapolate that argument forward.

** Eh. I honestly wasn't very impressed. The avatar of death seemed pretty unaware of a few key elements of his /primary function/ which, to me, doesn't seem very likely. Especially considering he's ferried about 100 billion people (definitely googled that figure) to the afterlife. Dave's reasoning here doesn't seem so far out there that he would be the first of 100 billion people (ok, let's assume not EVERYONE pleads to live but even if 5% do, that's 5 billion...) to take that sort of angle. Or another angle that would work, considering how simply fallible Death is portrayed here.

In addition, in like 100 billion ferryings (not a word, sue me), you still think that Death would be incapable of detecting death? That seems very unlikely, to say the least.

Overall an amusing read. But I'm not wow'd.

** I'm more interested in the fact that Death seems to be willing to ferry you to whatever afterlife you want. Not only that, but it seems to be a specific feature of his office, as he seems to be completely dependent on the newly dead person for direction as to where to go.

There has got to be a way to exploit that to gain effective godhood.

*** It's easy to make it impossible to interact with the 'real' world, but other than that exploiting is probably unnecessary, you simply get what you want as long as you don't try to escape your new universe.

**** How about a copy of the real world to be omnipotent in, along with a read-only interface to original spacetime as a backup?

** I imagine that Dave dies anyway, an the conversation continues a few minutes/hours later, when Dave realises it himself and Death comes back to pick the conversation where they left it, now with a proof that he is /right/.

Death can wait, after all. Nobody said that the Ferrying happens immediately after death.
