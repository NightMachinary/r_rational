****** He might need aid from Below if he had just seen the face of a God, crushing his bones and eyes and ears and leaving him bleeding from every hole in his body. My reading of it was that he was already broken and well on his way to death.

Plus, his crafting of Tikoloshe's contract was described as meticulous and cautious beyond what most diabolists demand. I imagine that, when summoning a creature specifically designed for mind-reading and manipulation, Wekesa made sure the contract /couldn't/ be dismissed merely by a stray thought.

Him spending his second wind on that rather than Masego is potentially a fair point, but I have imagined having to choose between my daughter and my wife. The ethical calculus there is /not/ as simple as you might think. I, at least, won't second-guess his priorities. Plus, he may have already decided on his course of action with Reflect, and knew he was about to save Masego. 'Loshe was the one who needed to get clear of the blast radius.

Amusingly enough, had Wekesa left the contract in place, he could have forced Tikoloshe to run. Probably. But who knows what happens when the mortal half of a summoning contract dies? It's probable that there was a contingency that forcibly dispersed Tikoloshe in the event of Wekesa's death.

** So that was a very, very full chapter. So much happened so quickly that there's an awful lot to go through. It's going to need a couple of rereads just to unpack it, I think.

There wasn't a huge amount of incomprehensible magical jargon, which I'm happy about, and instead we got a really interesting look into Warlock's life (and by extension the lives of the Calamities) and it just really humanised all of them.

Then there was an enormous battle - which i think was actually the largest fight we've had in the series, despite it's brevity, with direct interventions from the Gods Above and Below - and holy crap the Crusade actually did something! After the Battle of the Camps or the Vales it's good to see Good being a threat.

And so now Warlock is gone, which happened right after we were given a lot of reasons to care about him, his husband, and their relationship, so it was actually quite upsetting. But this is going to have huge repercussions going forward.

Malicia is a bit screwed. She just lost one of her biggest assets, which doesn't put her in a great spot if things come down to a straight fight for her (which it might - I can't recall offhand whether Ashur have more ships/men -EDIT: they do but a limited amount-, and there's always the looming Callow situation). Plus, Masego just lost his biggest incentive to pull punches against Praes himself, or to argue against fighting Praes, which are both fairly big deals.

Also, Masego just lost his fathers. Poor guy. That resolves both the issues of him being pulled between his old family and his new, and thankfully sidesteps the whole personal-drama-because-people-can't-communicate thing he had going on with his parents. Thank God. Although now he's got no warning on the dangers surrounding the Dead King's knowledge.

Then there's further strain being put on the resources of the Grand Alliance, and right before the Dead King steps out. There's reveals about how and when the Gods step out to play and what that looks like. And a bunch of other important details.

** Just got around to finishing up Book 3 last week, can anyone tell me (in a non-spoilery way) if it seems like Book 4 is approaching the end? I'm not a huge fan of reading new chapters as they come out, so I prefer to wait until each book (or clearly delineated arc like wildbow does) is complete then bundle them together.

*** It's... not really clear. A lot of shit has happened already in Book 4, but the plot looks like it might checking items off a list, and we know that list isn't exhausted yet.

Unless the unchecked items on the list are to become major plot elements of the next book, in which case we could be coming up on a "Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked" style of cliffhanger.

*** According to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/9fb55v/overall_lengthtime_remaining/e5zpm5p/?context=0][WOG]] book 4 has 7 story arcs. This is probably the end of the third, so less than half way?

*** As others said, we don't know, it will either go for a long time or end with a big cliffhanger soon. But there are some good arc like delimitations to it. So you can probably just read by arc. Won't spoil you here but if you want i can give you where the first arc "ends". that way you can probably read some of book 4 without having to read week by week.

​

Also a question to you. since you already read book 3 recently. I read book 3 as new chapters came out. And a lot of the fae arc seemed to me incredibly slow and boring. I think some of it might have been because i read every episode as it came out. Did you feel the same in this arc?

**** I'd say that a lot of the fae arc was slow, but not boring. I thought it was intentional though, because fae are eternal creatures who don't operate the same as humans, and it would make thematic sense in PGtE that this quality would bleed into the story structure itself.

​

And I appreciate the offer, but I'll probably just wait for a while. The author writes are a breakneck pace, so it probably won't be that long, compared to how long we have to wait for the next installment of normal novels.

** One thing I wasn't clear on, was that God summoned by a hero? If so, that would certainly count as breaking the rules of engagement set between Catherine and the Grey Pilgrim. Maybe it would even if it wasn't summoned by one, since they can be seen as larger proxies for above and below.
