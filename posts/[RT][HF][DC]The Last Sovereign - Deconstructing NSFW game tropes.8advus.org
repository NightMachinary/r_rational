Hello, [[/r/rational][r/rational]]! I won't pretend this isn't a post promoting my (100% free) game, but I do sincerely believe it might be of interest to people who read rationalist fiction. A fan recommended that I post here, but just inform me if I shouldn't in the future.

The Last Sovereign is a game, not prose, but it's story heavy and so I hope it is appropriate for this subreddit. Many people have reported 50+ hours played as of the current version and the wordcount is in six digits (exact number is arguable because you'd have to remove non-plot text and duplicated text for different player choices). All sex is text-based and while there is no built-in skip, the text skip feature could fly past it pretty quickly.

The newest version of the game can be downloaded from its blog:

[[https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com]]

TLS is basically a deconstruction of certain genres of NSFW games, particularly those where including a bunch of sex overrides any kind of coherent world, logical plot, or consistent characters. This game attempts to construct the world that would be required for many of those tropes to exist, take them to their logical conclusions, and let the player fundamentally transform that world by frequently taking the third option.

Some elements I think might appeal:

- The real main character (not the first introduced) has many traits in line with rationalist fiction. Logically minded, Crazy Prepared whenever possible, and willing to search for unorthodox solutions.

- One of the main elements is breaking down false dichotomies. Good/evil to a degree, but in this world particularly lust/purity.

- Magic is not a mystical phenomena, but a scientific field of study. Exploring those mysteries that do exist is an endeavor similar to high end theoretical physics, and something relevant to both the characters and the plot.

- Attempts to reconstruct RPG tropes in a rational way. For example, there is a reason monsters carry money and a reason it doesn't destroy all economies.

That is not to say that this story is entirely suited for this audience. The effect may be less interesting if you're not familiar with the tropes of certain genres. In particular, I'd note that many of the antagonists made clear so far are explicitly irrational, for reasons related to the setting. There are rational antagonists, but they are smart enough to realize that they don't need to make themselves targets in order to accomplish their goals. However, if the general outlook of the game sounds reasonable to you, then it has a lot of content to offer!

If you think a description from the author is too biased to be useful, there are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastSovereign][TV Tropes]] and [[http://thelastsovereign.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Sovereign_Wiki][wiki]] pages I had no part in writing. I will also be around to answer questions if there is any interest!

*** While I'm not sure what your definition of a good eroge or good RPG is, I can guarantee that there is zero trash mob grinding in TLS. In general, each enemy appears on the map only once. Once you kill them, they don't respawn. This can make the game pretty difficult because you can't level grind your way to victory. Instead you have to learn the skill system and equip your characters carefully in order to win the harder fights.

It also forces you to make some difficult plot choices. If you skip that tough optional dungeon, you may be missing that exp gain until much later in the story, which can make fights down the road harder. But if you're not good at playing the game, you won't be able to beat the difficult optional dungeon right now.

***** Well, I think TLS fits your good RPG criteria. The game has a ton of choices and there are visible consequences (some permanent) to your poor or great decision making. Now, you can't take the main story off the rails, but you can cause some pretty significant ripples in how it plays out.

(Slight Spoilers)

For example, when you end up fighting in a war later in the game, all your previous choices as well as the tactical choices determine which battles you need to fight and who survives. Your previous decision affect which fights you get and which decisions you are allowed to make during the battle. And your in battle decisions will also contribute to your success/failure scores at the end. If your choices were really poor, you still end up winning the war, but it becomes more like a pyhrric victory and it can dog you for the rest of the game.

(Spoilers End)

The number of choices and the extensive combinations of consequences is actually one of the toughest parts about playing TLS for me. I love to be highly optimized in RPG's, but its almost impossible to perfectly optimize the game because of the huge interacting decision trees. I even spent a month of free time looking into the underlying source code of the game to try and map a "perfect" game, but in the end I gave up because of the difficulty.

***** Many many choices. They don't all branch, but rather most give +/- points to invisible stats the game keeps running in the background like "city stability" or "population unrest" or "siege defence" or whatever and when those bits come up in the plot the game checks for what score you have and things can change from there. Entirely made up example: you're under siege, after having spent time and money investing in building up the city. A siege def of +20= enemy repulsed with ease with massive casualties, future fights with them made easier and you can sally out. siege def 15-20=enemy repulsed and have to pull out of their planned next attack. siege def 5-10=enemy barely repulsed and immediately attack again. siege def under 5, they break through and you have to personally deal with the invaders while the city takes damage.

But the money you invested in the siege defence might have been needed for personal equipment, or sponsoring a religion or helping magic studies or w/e and you can't grind much so money is not limitless so time to make some decisions. Maybe a siege def score of 5-10 is worth it in order to get a better sword for that boss fight coming up, or maybe you accidentally overfunded the mages school before realising wait shit the walls need to be repaired.

*** HotDropMarble has done a good job answering many of these questions. I felt a JRPG was a good match for the type of party system and strength progression I wanted in the game - but as mentioned, grinding isn't possible.

In terms of branching, the game has only some. It's hard to answer this question because you can never be sure about someone's points of comparison. But it's a long story with a lot of moving parts, so deep fundamental branches would quickly become untenable.

In terms of consequences, including many is one of my main goals with the game. Nearly all the player's actions are tracked and have multiple consequences along the way. Rather than trying to laud my own game, it might be simplest to look at the wiki guide for the recent war event: [[https://thelastsovereign.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Arclent_War_guide]]

The "variables" section at the beginning will give you a sense for the kinds of things the game tracks and how they have consequences. There are spoilers if you go lower.

Can't promise the game is to your taste, but thanks for your interest!

(Minor spoilers): did you advise your old acquaintance (a nun in a somehow safe church) to leave the safety of the convent's wall behind to help others? Or do you choose to not say anything? She could end dead and missed, or she could choose to join the group and to help (a little) undermining one of the candidates to throne during a Succession crisis. And we are talking about a minor character here.

Do you take the time to examine a small farm of... slimes in a elf city? Maybe that will get you a young, energetic elf as a business partner that down the road will help a worthy candidate.

** For what it's worth, I definitely recommend The Last Sovereign to any [[/r/rational]] redditors who don't mind NSFW games.

I've played about 50 hours in the past and one of the things I like best about it is the worldbuilding and the characters. I find most characters in harem games ( and NSFW media in general) pretty forgettable, but TLS manages to make all of its characters memorable.

The worldbuilding is pretty great as well. I guess this is where the characteristics of [[/r/rational]] stand out the most to me in the game, because of how carefully constructed the world and backstory is.

All in all, if you like text based RPG's and you are ok with a NSFW game, you should give this game a solid shot.

** I've actually considered making a post about this game here, so it's neat to see that someone beat me to it, and the author too, no less.

Besides the characters, I really like the game's focus on soft power as a necessary complement to the traditional RPG power treadmill. This is especially true when it comes to economics, and I love how much the investment and economic developments you make play into how the game progresses.

It's something that's woefully neglected in mainstream games, so to see it in a genre that isn't often known for deep thought was a real treat.

To anyone who is not turned off by the thought of NSFW games, I cannot recommend this one enough.

*** Good question; apologies for not being able to give a thorough answer right now.

My primary inspiration and influence for this game was the deconstruction aspect. Playing a variety of other adult games, I often felt dissatisfaction with the worldbuilding and the protagonists' impetuousness. I recognized that I'm not the target audience for those games, though, so I set about making something for myself. That includes both the aforementioned aspects and just going all in on the detail-oriented investment and hidden variable stuff. Fortunately, other people seem to like it too!

The TV Tropes description is a good summary of the game, I think. Glad you like the concept!

Still, the world-building and dialog are amazing. The only /slightly/ annoying thing, is that to experience everything, you have to regularly talk with all possible characters to double-check whether they have anything new to say. I'd prefer if there was some visual indication whether a character had something new to say or not.

In particular, there is a strong emphasis on making practical, well thought out choices, and building up soft powers such as economic and political, rather than just follow the standard RPG progression of "kill monster, loot stuff" (though a certain degree of it happens anyway).

2) A large library of freely available resources, sufficient to create a diverse world with artistic consistency.

3) An active community and ongoing development of both engine and resources.

I'm not as concerned with the software being free or open source, though both are pluses.

You're asking because you want to suggest another engine? I don't mind, as recommendations could always lead me somewhere new and worthwhile. But to be clear, I do not intend to throw away several years of work to recreate everything in a new engine.

**** currently started chapter2. Trying to stop myself from reading the wiki too much. Damn choices. Do I run after Varia and then do all side quests with her or do them now? in case they disappear?

***** I usually try to signpost points of no return clearly, but this one is less clear. While you can technically get a little bit more optimization by manipulating the order of things here, it's not a huge effect. I would recommend leaving Varia for last - and make sure you don't miss the mountain on the area map.

** Based on the comments and your description; this definitely seems like a post worthy of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. If the characters act as you say, in a logical, consistent matter, then I think it fits the sort of content that we're looking for here.

** The game looks pretty fun so far, thanks for making it and reccing it here!

Slightly annoying: Making the runtime work on linux. For other linux users, virtualbox does the job, ie no trouble with the nightmare that is directx pass-through. I did get a couple of random crashes, but this may well be my fault (running a weird setup).

Has anyone managed to make the runtime work under wine? Or, even better, on an arm / android (an arm tablet would be a quite natural device for playing this)?

*** I just copied the files of the complete version. Worked with wine without any configuration required although it may have been due to me already having the necessary dependencies. If it doesn't work for you, just scour the debug log and check on google to find out what dependency to install from your distro's packages.

As for ARM, I can't imagine trying to get it to work (nicely) considering it is not native to the architecture. Not really worth the time vs just remote accessing to an x86 computer.

** I can't find a good summary or any screenshots of the game. The premise interests me, so I'll give it a looksee, but - I'm guessing based on the header that there isn't much, if any, content for gay dudes.

I mean, I'm willing to check it out for story regardless, I'm just curious. I'll probably fill that niche myself one day; I'm studying comp sci for a reason.

*** Yes, sorry, but you won't find any sexual content that appeals to you. The protagonist isn't an avatar for the player and has a set sexual orientation. Glad you're willing to give it a shot, but didn't want to be misleading about that aspect.

I think the TV Tropes link from my post is best for a summary, while the wiki has screenshots.
