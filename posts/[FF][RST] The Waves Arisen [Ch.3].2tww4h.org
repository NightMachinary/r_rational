** I like how the jutsus have been explained so far; the descriptions feel unforced and consistent, while leaving enough unsaid that even the crazier gimmicks from the series remain plausible. There is tons of potential here.

** First off, a request: can you make the text on your site darker? The light grey is hard to read.

I was really interested by the experimentation that you had Naruto doing with the clones in the beginning. If I have it right, each time he summons clones his chakra pool divides evenly between them, and so on down the chain. Therefore, if he starts with 1,000 chakra:

- Summon clone A1, each body now has 500
- Clone A1 then summons 9 clones. Original now has 500, A1-10 each have 50
- Original summons 4 clones (B-E). He and B-E now have 100, A1-10 still have 50.

Is that right?

A couple of questions:

#+begin_quote
  he had no one “real” body, and if ever he had only one body left then that'd be the one that became “real” again,
#+end_quote

Shadow clones vanish if they bite their tongues, normal people don't. So,

- If Naruto has no shadow clones out at the moment and he bites his tongue, does he vanish?\\
- If he had one shadow clone out and his original body bites his tongue, does it vanish?\\
- If the shadow clone then bites its tongue, does /it/ vanish?
- If both bodies are punched at the same time, do they both vanish?

Also:

#+begin_quote
  he took damage in proportion to the number of bodies he had active to spread an injury out over
#+end_quote

So, he has two bodies out (one original, one clone). One of his bodies is stabbed with a knife and vanishes. Does half of the wound appear on the other body? If so, what does "half a wound" look like?

When a clone pops, do its memories go:

- to the original body
- to whoever created it
- to all current bodies?

Do Naruto and his clones constitute a hive mind, or when he "has a clone" do something, is he yelling orders to it?

Last question: you've changed how the kawarimi works -- in canon a ninja can substitute with any inanimate object, but now it sounds like they have to have prepared the object first. Why the change?

*** I've changed the wordpress theme to something with darker text, now.

Commenter Kaukamieli has answered most of your questions, but I'll clarify that when a new shadow clone is summoned his consciousness branches off from the original, so he'll be aware of what "he" had been intending to do with himself, but any new decisions thereafter would have to be communicated in speech. There is no special awareness of the thoughts of any other active clones, until they die.

When popped, a shadow clone's memories go to all current bodies, offering another avenue of communication for anyone willing to burst themselves to send a "message" in their thoughts.

*** The amount of chakra might not be quite like that. I didn't calculate anything but I thought there is some fixed or flexible cost too, like 100 or 5% chakra for using the kagebunshin at all. Everything should have a loss methinks.

#+end_quote

Do you? :)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Apparently yes, as there is no "original body". I think this fails here when one of the Narutos has the forehead protector and others don't, so clearly there is something like that, or does some clone get that randomly?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They think like him and they literally just have thought about whatever he had thought so they totally know what to do even without mental link after the summoning.

Probably because it's overpowered bullshit? :D

edit: Extending on the last bit, it's overpowered because it's not really explained and has no real limits. It's literally the power of the plot protecting people. Ooh you got hit with this killer tech? KAWARIMI!

**** A quick note about the forehead protector: Naruto's "original" body was wearing it, then it failed to be duplicated for his clones, but the physical original body (who is now as vulnerable to bursting as any other clone) was still wearing the original item. He doesn't vanish and then reappear in two places, or anything.

***** Shrödinger's Naruto. Naruto can be observed to be in multiple places at same time. To find out where he really is, you must deal enough damage. This collapses the Naruto to single one.

Each of them is just a potential Naruto. Naruto breaks himself down to potential Narutos and when there is no more chance for him to be anywhere else because all the "clones" are killed, you can kill the actual Naruto.

This looks way cooler than the original.

Nope, and I would be very surprised if Naruto did either. The point I was driving at is that it seems very strange to say "there is no 'real' Naruto."

For that to be true it would need to be the case that all of Naruto's currently existing bodies are the same. The implication of that however, is that you start with one body which is non-poppable, and then you create another body. If there is no 'real' Naruto, then both of these bodies are poppable -- so one of them just lost the 'not-poppable' property. But if both of them are poppable, then you can completely kill Naruto if you have an AoE jutsu that does the same amount of damage as biting your tongue. In other words, using Kage Bunshin makes you /more/ vulnerable. No other technique that I'm aware of is like that -- aside from costing chakra, no other technique has negative effects on the user. (Ok, maybe the Yamanaka "I leave my body undefended while I possess you", but that's really not the same thing.)

****** So an AoE "punch you" jutsu will kill Naruto if and only if he has a clone out and they are both in the area. Ouch. Well, I guess he better make sure he always has one clone WAAAAY away from the battle.

******* I meant to imply that one clone would be hit first, and the other would become real, so no such danger exists in that specific case, but you've actually touched upon something I shouldn't say anything more about, yet.

******* Yea, I think making a low chakra clone to live in the village highly guarded could be damn smart. He could always report the village what's happening, and if all other clones die, he still lives.

** What Naruto does in this chapter is a much simpler version of what Naruto does in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4573620/1/A-Drop-of-Poison][A Drop of Poison]]. In that fic, Naruto coordinates multiple clones to get more work done as well. But, he also has several clones henged into unique identities around the village, that build their own reputations over time. He also experiments with the limits of the clone jutsu, and figures out how to have tougher clones that don't dispel as easily. I recommend reading it.
