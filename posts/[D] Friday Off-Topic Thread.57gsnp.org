Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I think I have depression. Many of the symptoms I've read about online apply to be, and I've been having something resembling episodes for the past year. I've decided that this isn't a problem that's going away on its own, so I've decided to seek professional help as soon as I can muster the will to do so. At the same time, though, admitting that to myself has improved my mood slightly. I'm still in a crappy state, but I feel more comfortable with it and a bit more confident that I can get better.

*** Good luck with that -- it can be quite a difficult road but this step may really help.

Any time that the problem lies not in the world but in the operation of your own mind, it becomes extremely challenging. But at the same time has the opportunity to be extremely rewarding. How much better would your life be if you had a lot more energy and enthusiasm to apply to things?

Let me issue a challenge. You say "I've decided to seek professional help as soon as I can muster the will to do so". I challenge you to seek that help (go so far as to schedule an appointment) within the next 5 days (by October 19).

I love Worm to bits, but it's absolutely massive in every sense of the word. I can't fathom what the SFX budget would have to look like to truly do justice to fights like Leviathan's or Behemoth's.

**** The only reservation I have is that Worm wasn't really a superhero story, at least after Leviathan. It was more like a modern dark fantasy, bordering on horror, where the characters just happen to have unique powers and wear masks. It's still good, but it needs a more consistent identity all the way through to avoid disappointing superhero fans the same way it did for me.

After Leviathan, the story stopped being something I wanted to read and the superhero trappings made less and less sense given the state of the world. If it had been more clear that I was in for something out of a seinen instead of something like Daredevil or Watchmen, I wouldn't have been put off that it defied basic genre conventions of superhero stories after an AMAZING start.

***** Worm is a deconstruction of the genre. Pre-Leviathan was making the point that, on the surface, a world looking like the superhero verses might make sense. Post-Leviathan was throwing all the glaring problems with these verses into harsh light.

For instance, the biggest problem with superhero verses that they never, ever take a look at in a satisfactory way is collateral damage. You expect me to believe that Galactus is devouring large sections of the world, or that Parallax is eating entire cities, or any of the other extinction-level events in these worlds are happening, and that none of the cities look like warzones? You expect me to believe that, after Superman gets thrown through multiple buildings, there's no evidence in Metropolis that this has happened before, that buildings are damaged?

Superhero verses have some sort of magical fix-everything-ium. All the destruction and obliteration happening onscreen never has effects on future episodes, like it was just wiped away. In Worm, though, Leviathan shows up and then Brockton Bay never recovers. Which is exactly what we see in the real world when massive natural disasters hit nations unable to absorb the losses.

In addition, you have the problem of the heroes being too "good" to ever consider killing anyone, from Batman's pathological aversion to using anything resembling a lethal weapon to Superman deliberately pulling punches. /This makes no goddamn sense!/ In the real world, the Joker would accidentally fall down the stairs four or five times the second or third time he escaped from Arkham. Hell, he might not even survive Arkham! I take as evidence the case of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer who killed over 100 people around 5 years ago. Norwegian prisons are famous worldwide for being really, really nice, and his "cell" is more of a luxury apartment by comparison to prisons most everywhere else. He's attempting to sue, though, because they won't let him leave that cell for any reason. Why? Because all of the other prisoners in the facility have sworn that they will kill him on sight. These are patriotic Norwegians, a nation with the lowest recidivism rates in the developed world, and one of the lowest overall crime rates, and they are vowing to murder the guy.

That's the prisoners. That says nothing about someone who might actually be able to get away with killing him in a "tragic accident." And that is what would happen to the Joker in reality.

So. Worm turns that on its head and gives us Jack Slash. Crazy, obsessed with knives, no obviously busted superpowers other than charisma, /and makes a point of not getting caught because he knows that he will die if he does./ Marvel and DC have this thing about how killing is always a bad idea and about constantly bringing back characters who should have kicked it already. Worm neatly sidesteps that problem.

Leviathan is the wake-up call. It's saying "Hey, you know all those tropes of a superhero verse? They make no sense, and here's why." It replaces those tropes with grim reality, a world where the heroes must kill on occasion, a world where most of the villains just dropped into villainy accidentally. A world where bureaucratic efficiency overtakes the common good, where the heroes are often wrong and the villains...not right, but not wrong either.

A world much like our own, in some respects.

****** That's the problem, though. Worm feels like a superhero story written by someone who doesn't like the genre. People like me who are fans of it understand that some of the tropes can be dumb, but we get past that because we enjoy the core of the stories. We're still happy to see more realistic takes on the genre, at this point we're demanding it, but if that core is changed then we won't enjoy the story.

The reason why Watchmen was a fantastic deconstruction was because it stayed true to the central theme of superheroes while turning every other trope on its head. It wasn't beloved because it was realistic, in many ways it was as goofy as ever, but because it gave people new insight into stories they loved. Madoka Magika, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and HPMOR succeeded for the same reasons.

A lot of people like Worm, and that's fine, there's a lot to like about it and I like a lot of it too. But it's a story that defies the themes superheroes are built around. It creates a world that resembles a superhero verse on the surface but lacks any of the same substance. It should carve out an identity for itself separate from the superhero genre so it can be appreciated for what it is instead of what it isn't.

What? There are plenty of superhero stories around by people who don't like superheros, and they don't look anything like Worm. If this was actually the case the author would have pruned off the superhero parts and ended up with urban fantasy or something similar. That's what a lot of urban fantasy and science fiction is. Superhero stories by people who don't like superheros.

Worm is about finding logical in universe reasons to explain all the things that happen in regular superhero stories but don't actually make sense. Heroes have got to fight when they first meet 'cause (out of universe) the comic book reader wants to see that? Okay, have a shard driven urge to conflict to explain that.

Reed Richards is useless (no science hero bothers to use their amazing tech for anything but superheroing)? Okay, have a Simurgh specifically hunting for any Reed Richards' that are about to make good, plus various tinker power restrictions.

Villains don't get killed off permanantly and prison is a revolving door? Okay, have regular Endbringer fights which necessitate preserving every superpower in the hopes that it might someday allow for a combo to save the day or the world, and hence a system designed to keep villains busy but not dead.

Does it seem rather odd that almost everyone decides to put on a costume and either declare themselves a hero or villain? Have a not particularly covert government propaganda and PR program to narrow down the decision space that people think in when they consider they should do with new powers, which is devoted to finding something not /too/ damaging for all these conflict seeking semi-psychotic people with superpowers (both heroes and villains) to do to keep themselves busy yet alive for the Endbringers.

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool Bill's PC ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][previous threads here]]):

--------------

The initial setup for the Move tab is all but complete.  A handful of things remain to add to the GUI, and then it's just a matter of hooking it up properly.  I said I was going to do that part this week, but due to needing to redesign so much of the move properties it just wasn't ever in a solid enough state for me to formally complete it.

--------------

This is mostly due to the creation of what I call the Aspect system.  Previously I expressed the desire to divide moves into Moves and “techniques”, and the Aspect system is the culmination of this idea.  Aspects can be thought of as sub-types: different schools of application of the usage of a particular type.  

For example, Psychic is divided into Telekinesis, Teleportation, Telepathy, Focus, and Shielding.  The three Ts are self-explanatory, while Shielding is things like Barrier and Focus is the use of psychic energy blasts. Each Aspect will have its own EV which is trained by using moves of that Aspect.  So, to train Focus I can spam Confusion over and over.

But what's the point?  Well, through use of this system I hope to make defining move lists a thing of the past.  A move like Psybeam might be designated thusly:

#+begin_quote
  Psybeam: Requires Brain.  Requires INT > 100 AND SPATK > 60.  Requires Psychic Typing >10%. Requires Focus > 200
#+end_quote

So to learn Psybeam, a pokemon has to meet all of the above requirements, and it can then be taught the move.  This can either be done by Move Tutor, TM, or by telling your pokemon to “Experiment”, a mode of training that has a % chance of learning a new move based on what moves the pokemon has witnessed and their eligibility.  A new Kadabra that has never heard of Psybeam might not ever discover it through Experimentation, but one that has seen Psybeam used dozens of times by friends or foes has a good chance of figuring it out!

Some moves can be approached by multiple types.  Thunder Punch, for instance, would look something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Thunder Punch: Requires Arm OR Grasp tag. Requires ATK >80 AND SPATK > 40. Requires Martial > 50. Requires Chi + Discharge > 400.
#+end_quote

So a pokemon could learn this move either by training the fighting Chi Aspect to 400, or the electric Discharge Aspect to 400, or by mixing some of each if it can.  Some type combinations are common enough to have their own dual-type Aspect, such as Mud being Rock/Water or Terrakinesis being Rock/Psychic, with their own tech tree to match.

This system is very exciting to me, as it will force move sets to be /systematic/ in a way that canon pokemon is not.  Access to a move is going to be based on meeting the raw requirements and not something as arbitrary as species.  This is going to result in a lot of emergent gameplay that will no doubt result in surprises for veterans of the series. It will also remove the burden of the designer needing to manually add each move to each pokemon, which is important considering that I plan for there to be many more available moves than in canon.

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YfTAk95UdTEtOVFmMl42spmsg3Trn2TRsnqNkFj721c/edit?usp=sharing][The Aspects in their current form can be viewed here]].

--------------

While working on these systems this week, I came to the conclusion that I am starting to get diminishing returns on prototypeless design.  So, I will be spending this next week cleaning up Bill's PC, scrubbing up the documentation, and otherwise getting it into a solid state for the future--as by this time next week I will have begun setting up the game itself.  Bill's PC is not complete, but for now it grants us enough capabilities to be able to start working on some bare-metal coding.

*** Quick question: how close are you to making a prototype of this game? From the little I've seen, I feel like you're defining way more rules, mechanics and other gameplay elements than you should before having a playable version. You should have a prototype super early so you can test if the general mechanics are enjoyable and nothing in your system is broken. There are a lot of things that can look good on paper and go super wrong once people start playing your game, and you do /not/ want to find them after you've already spent hours building a system that depends on them.

On the other hand, I'm following this from afar, so I might be completely wrong, and I have no idea how much experience you have in game design.

**** Well I aim to start on that this week. I have made games before, but you're right that it's a lot of front-loaded design work. Part of that is because it's horribly complex, but part too is because I don't want to have to throw work out because systems turn out to not be compatible with one another. There's a lot of moving parts, and many problems can be avoided by thinking through the issue thoroughly. This process has also forced me to clearly define what this game /is/ and /isn't/ about. Having those sorts of limits are important rather than just throwing code together and hoping it all works.

Tarn Adams defined a list of things that he wanted in Dwarf Fortress, like, ten years ago /and he's still working on that same list/. Granted, I have no hope of being so dedicated or consistent, but there /is/ virtue in thinking it all out ahead of time so as to build each system with the whole in mind.

But to /actually/ answer your question, the two things I will start with are the hex grid/ movement and Pokémon generation. I aim to have map reading/writing and movement working by the new year, and a rudimentary Pokémon gladitorial simulator working by around the same time. The grid will allow me to start testing what speed, initiative, and movement mean in this game, while the gladiator combat will aid in defining how Pokémon are generated and allow the community to help start balancing individual Pokémon and move stats.

**** That's what I'm here to find out!

Although it is very complex, I try to avoid complexity for complexity's sake. Whenever I add a mechanic or a system, it's either to permit deeper and more interesting decisions, or in some cases even just to make it easier to develop. The anatomy, affinity, and aspect systems all appear to add an incredible amount of complexity, but they also alleviate a certain amount of workload themselves by removing the need to, say, manually define move lists. Time will tell if this turns out to be an efficient trade.

Another design rule that I'm always keeping in mind, (but that doesn't always show through in these posts) is the concept of an /unfolding design/. The idea is to build systems in such a way that /scale/, that work as a whole if I put 10 hours of work into it or 100. This is mostly a matter of scope on the macro scale: first I aim for a game that lets you walk around a map that's generated from a template. Then I build a game that's the same thing but generates Pokémon for you to look at. Then I do the same thing but a game that has those Pokémon interact with you and lets you fight them. Then a game that also lets you catch and tame them.

And so on and so forth: by focusing on keeping each iteration self-contained and as complete as possible as a game, it keeps the idea of fun-ness and usability as central as possible. This concept has also been referred to as building in 'stripes' or 'layers', and hopefully it keeps everything grounded, no leaving big holes in the game with the hope that "it'll be fun once I fill it in later".

I still might end up way over my head with nothing to show for it, who knows. But I /think/ I can manage it; the burden of complexity is mostly in balancing the Pokémon data and not the systems that read that data, and I like to think I have a knack for that. We'll see, though; I'm as interested to see if it will work as you are! The point is to gain experience with this level of detail, after all, win or lose.

--------------

/[[http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4][Europa Universalis IV]]/ is a "grand strategy" game, in which the player controls a country between 1444 and 1821. It's been derided by some people as "mindless map painting", as it's rather abstracted--especially in comparison to its predecessor. The goal of [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234109254][the MEIOU & Taxes user modification for EU4]]* is to replace abstraction with properly realistic (rational?) simulation. For example:\\
- In vanilla EU4, the player can click a button and spend abstracted "monarch points" to gain abstracted "development points" in a province. In M&T, this button is removed; instead, each point of development represents ten thousand people (with exhaustively-researched numbers at the start of the game in the year 1356), and the population of a province gradually rises or falls depending on the circumstances (war, famine, terrain, crops, etc.).\\
- In vanilla EU4, if a player sends a missionary to a province, the province typically will be converted from its original religion to the state religion in at most 100 months, if it can be converted at all. In M&T, only ten percent of a province's population (divided into twenty-one separate pieces, of which each can have its own religion) can be converted by a single missionary, and decades may pass before the majority religion of a heathen province becomes the state religion.

The release of MEIOU & Taxes 2.0, which will bring the accuracy of the simulation to [[http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/42atyf][even greater heights]] (e.g., large cities will import food from agricultural provinces, will produce special urban goods, and will have large influence on trade), [[http://i.imgur.com/tDG8Li4.png][is drawing ever closer...]]

*The Steam Workshop version is the most convenient link for me to place here. The vast majority of discussion takes place on [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/839][the Paradox forums]]--but it's accessible only to people who have registered EU4 there.

Then claims 'Maybe you heard that Trump said maybe we shouldn't defend NATO countries if Russia invades' and that is somehow worse? Despite the fact *Trump didn't say that* how is demanding allies hold up their agreements in the case of war with Russia a bigger risk of nuclear war than provoking that war?

His point was that, if you can't distinguish a 'n+1 player' from a 'n+100 player', then you will be confused when people tell you in strong terms that the 'n+? player' is obviously better than the 'n+? player'. From your point of view, both players are very smart/sensible/incompetent/corrupt, so you think that anyone who strongly prefers one over the other is probably engaging in confirmation bias or something, because you assume that they can only see what you see.

****** The Dunning-Kruger phenomenon may or may not exist at all, and most certainly doesn't exist in the way it is usually understood (including the wikipedia article about it).

The Dunning-Kruger experiments found that, on average, people consider their "competence" to be closer to average (well, slightly above average) than they are.

- People who have a 10 think they have a 30
- People who have a 40 think they have a 50
- People who have a 90 think they have a 70

I'm inventing the numbers, but the idea is there: incompetent people know they're incompetent, but they're a bit off as to how incompetent they are, and vice-versa. The more someone is competent, the more they think they're competent. DK explain it as "being more competent gives you more tools to see your limits", another explication is that this is a statistical phenomenon, basically people's estimation of themselves being noisy towards "higher than average competence", with return to the mean when they do get closer to that level.

As a personal note, I found out about this recently, after noticing it felt like a meme that would spread independently of its accuracy. Confirming that it was more or less an urban legend made me decide to never trust or quote any popular finding in psychology/sociology/etc that I hadn't verified myself, including but not limited to: Milgram's experiment, The Stanford Prison Experiment, that one experiment about conflicts where they opposed two groups of kids, The Peter Principle, The Talos Principle (wait, no, not that one), the Asch conformity experiments, etc.

EDIT: Also, I'm not sure you understood my point. What I was saying was that, if you saw a n+1 commentator having a strong opinion on two n+?, you'd think the commentator is unreasonable to differentiate them so much since they both seem undistinguishable, so you'd assume that the commentator only has their opinion because of some bias, even if their opinion is actually well-formed.

I'm using python's new async features, which I hope will make the whole thing a lot more practical then normal python game engine stuff. So far this has led to the immediate improvement of being able to run a python terminal alongside the render loop, although it still freezes if you tell the terminal to sleep for too long. I'll see about getting it working multi-process.

*** The github page says it's intended to be used as a real engine. How good is the API?

The main thing that turned me away from Minetest (outside of the general poor quality of the baseline game) is that, while it has the perfect tools to help you make your own version of Beta-Stage Minecraft, with your own (very dumb) mobs, your own XP/potion-making/spell-casting/enchanting system, and your own ores for making yet another bunch of pickaxes/shovels/swords, it's incredibly hard to make an original game with it.

You can't make a tower defense because the game doesn't support mobs, and the mods that add mobs don't include pathfinding or aiming, you can't make a Sim-City style game because there's almost no support for interfaces other than the classic inventory bar, etc.

So if you really want the engine to be used, I'd recommend trying to make your own games (and/or get other people to do the same) in various genres that aren't usually associated with Minecraft, and learn from the experience. How good is your engine for making a hack-and-slash? A strategy game? A racing game? A survival game in space where you must mine asteroids to repair the breaches in your space station while desperately trying to hold off against waves of monster that feed on electricity, trying to survive until help arrives? If I ever make a boxel game engine, these are the kind of games I want to see pop up.

That mirrors my thoughts on the rewrite pretty closely.

It's going to be a lot more primitive then minetest, but hopefully it will be more extensible.

The basic boxel-map object is hopefully going to be usable in things like roguelikes, or other tile games. I'm going to include a 3D renderer, but not minecraft (or any gameplay) like functionality. The 3D view will mostly be for prototyping things, or extending things.

So expect less high-level primitives to start with. For example, there's not going to be an easy-to-use "inventory bar" created by me, I'm going to focus on API stuff first.

--------------

But I am thinking about including a generic "RPG" world. That would include rules for character/world/item interaction, but not anything about user-input.

You can make all kinds of different games using re-usable rules like in GURPS. In GURPS, you can throw a classic superhuman-fighter from a d&d like setting and have him fight beside someone from transhuman space. Although typically transhuman-space characters are a lot more powerful, alongside the superhero settings.

If you base all your mobs on GURPS attributes, you can take, say, spaceship-mobs and throw them into a completely different genre. Sure, you'd have to re-do the movement AI most likely, but basic compatibility between objects/mobs/items between games sounds nice, if it can be made to work.

The question is, can it be made to work?

My idea is that if you want, say, a quake like twitch-shooter you import standard characters, then give them traits that give them the features you want. In this example, a consistent amount of health, floaty-movement, infinite stamina, and perfect aim (or make guns with perfect aim).

RPG-ish stuff gives you the basic behavior, which you can then completely override.

Hopefully that means a platoon of WW2 soldiers can take down a quake-soldier, in enough numbers.

Start with something that approximates real-life, and then break the rules for particular genres.

******* I'd say the problem is that the 'life' attribute of an entity, and the whole damage system surrounding that entity, is a product of the surrounding gameplay and can't necessarily be translated to a different gameplay without reworking it from the ground up.

For instance, let's consider /Heroes of the Storm/ and /Overwatch/. Let's say you want to import all the characters from /Overwatch/ into /Heroes/. It obviously won't be as simple as running their files through some sort of converter, since the two games have different gameplays, but let's ignore that. Let's assume that every character has a file listing all their attacks/movement speed/other characteristics as key-number pairs. That file would be worthless for the transition, and would have to be entirely rewritten for the /Heroes/ version of the character, because a MOBA (I mean, uh, Hero Brawler... nah, just kidding) has characteristics very different from a FPS.

In a FPS, not all move speeds has to be equal; a character can walk faster, making them more agile and better able to dodge as part of their intended gameplay. In a MOBA, higher movement speed barely helps dodging since most attacks are auto-aimed or have a wide hitbox, but helps you escape auto-attack range, among other things, which have completely different implications. Or consider a character like Bastion, whose core mechanic is having enough damage output to completely flatten any hero, no matter how resistant, in a matter of seconds at most. Such a hero would be completely broken in a MOBA, where killing an enemy hero is a big deal, so his damage output would have to be revised.

In other words, there is no simple way to convert the statistics of a game's character into another game with a different gameplay. /Overwatch/ vs /Heroes/ is probably one of the strongest case, since both games have a gameplay that's both similar enough to be compared and completely incompatible, but it works for closer games too. You can't compare the damage output of a /Modern Warfare/ gun to a /Quake/ gun, because once was designed for a gameplay where regenerating all your life never takes more than three seconds, and the other was designed for healthpacks.

That's not to say you can't mix things and have a fun, balanced gameplay. /Overwatch/ gives you characters with Quake-like gameplay (Pharah, Junkrat) and then Soldier 76. But doing so require tinkering, and I don't think the amount of work needed is going to be reduced by having a super-generic health system abstraction.

The trick of it is that I'm not worried about balance. You want your D&D fighter to be able to compete with legendary archtypes? Pick up some goodies from transhuman space.

Once you throw the idea of balance out of the window, it becomes a lot more reasonable. And real life isn't balanced anyway. A quake soldier is probably going to be able to handle even an experienced and well equipped platoon of WW2 Soldiers, etc.

Gurps wasn't balanced either. If you want to create a balanced game you're going to have to go further then just importing assets and behaviors from another game.

This is a particularly interesting point. For example: Dwarf Fortress doesn't have health points at all, but actually tracks tissue damage to each organ - and inflicts it based on material properties including armour.

** I've been following /Star Wars Rebels/, which is currently in the middle of its third season, which introduces Grand Admiral Thrawn, probably the most popular character from /Legends/ books.

While Thrawn is way more menacing than usual /Rebels/ villains, I feel he's still a downgrade from trilogy!Thrawn. The awesomeness of the original Thrawn wasn't that he looked very smart. It was that his plans /were/ smart, and made obvious sense. Every single important decision he made was visibly optimized to increase his chances to win. Whereas one of his major decisions in the last /Rebels/ episode to date (let his enemies go after they blew up their own base, ostensibly as part of some greater plan) visibly decreased them.

The show got most of his personality right, though I'm a bit ticked off at the parts where he personally uses physical violence (he needs a Noghri bodyguard); the studying art is there, the way he captures Hera is well done, and the show seems to imply he ran drills to train the stormtroopers to navigate the local environment. But what I feel is the core of Thrawn, the uncompromising search for victory? Isn't there.

Trilogy!Thrawn wouldn't have let the rebels escape. He would have either executed Ezra or kept him securely locked up in his ship, and shot down the Phantom as soon as the hostage exchange was over. There was no gain in letting them go. The intelligence he did get about Twi'lek mentality was not worth letting two Rebel leaders and two jedi go, especially since he could have had both. And while it was shown that letting them go was somehow part of his plan, I'm pretty sure that whatever this plan will turn out to be, it will work worse than it would have if he'd just killed them when he could.

Also, as much as Thrawn himself is well done and mostly faithful to the Heir trilogy, I wish Disney hadn't gone for the easy route of making him look smart by surrounding him with stupid/slow underlings. Book!Thrawn was almost always surrounded and opposed by smart, or at least competent people, which made his genius all the more apparent when he outsmarted them. Pellaeon in particular was a key part of Thrawn's character: he was both fairly dull and unimaginative, and very competent, aware of his limitations, and perfectly capable of understanding subtext, following Thrawn's reasoning and coming up with his own insights. Governor Price and agent Kallus could have that role, but neither of them has the military position that would justify following him around and serving as his foil. And Admiral Konstantine and Captain Slavin are very poor foils.﻿
