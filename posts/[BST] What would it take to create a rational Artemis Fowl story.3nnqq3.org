** OKAY.

I know EY used Sherlock Holmes as an example of how not to do rational fiction, because Sherlock Holmes makes inferences using evidence not available to the audience. Going by the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this is not actually the case. Holmes deduces things that are /really really unlikely/, but the stories are scrupulous about fair play. Granted that sometimes the details are trivial (EY deliberately avoids this with James' rock), but it's definitely fair play.

Artemis Fowl is not. In fact, Artemis Fowl is what jumped to mind in place of Sherlock Holmes specifically because it was such a better example of how /not/ to write a genius character. Also because I liked those books, but yes.

I think...

I think the best way to do it would be just the first book. At first. What would an actual genius do to profit from the knowledge that magic is real, and exclusively the domain of fairies who do not negotiate with humans?

I'm not ashamed to say that I've got a long list of potential instigating actions Artemis could use sitting in a file on my desktop. Given better character flaws, he'd be a genuinely interesting villain protagonist.

*** I mean, unless you're going to pull a HPMOR and rewrite the main characters backstory, you ought to keep in mind that Artemis grew up getting "gold is power" drilled into his head by his father. Then the father comes back and has a complete change in goals, so... maybe you could work off of that, actually. Artemis is a rationalist with a misguided utility function - optimizing for personal gold and power for the Fowl family.

Course, if he was a perfect rationalist he should figure out pretty fucking quickly that he's got the wrong idea.

**** /Artemis Fowl/

He's an 11-year-old boy genius (where have we heard of that before?), and his role in cannon is as the wiley Irishman who separates the leprechaun from their pot o' gold. However, before we move on to what /he/ is like, we should look at fairy civilization. Lost below the surface of the Earth for millenia, fairies survive by dint of technological superiority and magic. The former bears a short examination: their technicians have mastered human surveillance systems and presumably have satellites of their own orbiting the planet. They make use of this technology to monitor what they have to on the surface (rogue Lower Elements citizens, escaped trolls, kraken and other Class X fairy folk, and spontaneous magical phenomena.) For extreme emergencies, their neurologists have developed a system by which the mind can be examined, neurons be manipulated at will, and memories rewound. They have useful nuclear fusion reactors and stuff.

More interesting is their magic. A comment of LEP officer Holly Short to illustrate the problem: "I haven't been running hot in four years." /Four years./ That's quite the stretch for anyone, especially a reconaissance agent who presumably uses elfin magic on the regular. Magic, for common folk, simply isn't that taxing. Many species, particular pixies, centaurs and goblins, can go their whole lives having completed the ritual only once. Elves, perhaps, have a disadvantage there. The most common uses for magic are mesmerization (occasionally shortened to /mesmer/), a form of invisibility, and wholesale elimination of injuries. While elf telekinesis is only strong enough to deflect light within a certain radius of the individual, invisibility and illusion are their forte. Magical healing is used more rarely than it would be on the surface, in part due to the size and culture of fairy civilization, but it is undeniably effective at just about any use within the domain of restoring health that the user can dream of.

At any rate, having run out of magic suggests a spurt of heavy use, followed by a period of apathy towards renewing the ritual. Perhaps it's just as well; getting to the surface beyond the sight of humans is a PITA. Or perhaps there are ritual sites below ground.

Artemis Fowl Sr. was an Irish businessman and white-collar criminal. His family's company, (I really don't want to call it Fowl Industries), is heavily invested in the technology and communications sector, operates two IXPs in Ireland, and is frequently listed alongside IBM, HP, and Phonetix as a mainstay of computing innovation. Honestly, I picture E Corp from Mr. Robot. Fowl Sr. was personally involved in the global black market for nearly any good or service known to mankind, and maintained his status by providing exotic vices to those who might have been able to pass judgement on him.

He has been missing for three years. A deal with Russians gone bad in 2003, many assume. His wife, a British socialite named Angelina Fowl, subsequently suffered from a horrendous nervous breakdown, though some believe that she still controls (I swear I'm going to come up with a better name for this company). At the time, his son was seven.

Unlike most child prodigies, Artemis Fowl Jr. was pronounced entirely ordinary by his pediatricians and psychologists. At first. By the age of four, however, he was studying computer science, human psychology, Chaucer and Homer. By five he spoke nine languages, could remember any moment of his life after December of 1999 with perfect fidelity, and probably suffered from mild schizophrenia. One of his pet projects, a computationally inexpensive 8192-bit encryption system, he nicknamed "the Infinity Code", after its projected cracking time. Since birth, his constant companion Butler has provided for his safety. Having developed a taste for luxury, Artemis turned his mind to plotting shortly before the disappearance of his father (legally, he could not attend a university before the age of sixteen, and had no interest in applying for excemption.) Many of these schemes should be detailed so as to give y'all a better idea of his personality, but since that hasn't solidified yet, neither have they.

Fowl Sr. disapproved of his son's various ideas, though whether he thought them silly or excessive isn't known. Nevertheless, Artemis was shattered by the loss of his father (and, effectively, his mother as well). He turned his attention to recovering the both of them.

It was at this time he began to notice anomalies in the satellite registry. Mistakes in various national databases, he assumed at first. But eventually he was tempted to access one via a satellite he owned personally, sixteen solid hours of searching for weakness, and a buffer overflow attack overlooked by one of Foaley's apprentice coders.

--------------

It so happens that fairy magic is detailed extensively in the Book, a 99-page document which cannot be touched without the owner's permission, lest terrible shit happen. Literally every fairy has one, which makes it something of a weak point in their security. Moreover, Artemis suspects that it is, in fact, possible to read a book without touching it. (There are other reasons why permission is necessary, but that's not important right now).

So, Artemis Fowl decides to get his hands on a copy of the Book of the People. Armed with his bodyguard, Juliet Butler, millions of dollars in liquid assets, and a compromised fairy satellite, he sets out to change the world by acquiring a copy of the Book of the People.

Beyond that, I've worked out some crucial plot points this afternoon (thanks for the inspiration), and still have to decide to what degree our protagonist is a total sociopath, what role Short plays, and some other things. But that's the gist of it.

** It'd be hard to not write the Faeries as rather evil and hypocritical.

Much of the books take a poor view of human actions on climate change. Fair enough, and the Fairy characters' words on it come off as reasonable rather than soap boxing.

That being said, these are people with nuclear batteries so ubiquitous they put them in their standard-issue weaponry. Sharing the technology would probably help out a lot with the whole fossil fuel issue, guys. And your advanced technology. And magic healing ability...

The sheer, inherent power behind the Mesmer ability is there to. The fairy people really should have most of the world under control given that a single agent can mind control any world leader.

The racism is also a bit sketchy. Foaly claims that Goblins are about as smart as dogs- There's even /tests/ that show it! This sounds less like a reasonable theory and more like the ramblings of 20s eugenicist, but it's less-or-more taken for granted in the main story.

Agreed on the Mesmer ability, though its worth noting that its not all powerful and can be resisted (usually with bad health consequences.)
