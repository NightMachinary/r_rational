I'd prefer Batman or Superman in a rationalist setting (and I'd prefer their characterizations stay as close to the normal as possible; I like Batman's no-kill rule, for instance.) Any suggestions?

****** Expanding on [[/u/JackStargazer]]'s comment -- when Zoat comments on other Paul's in other dimensions, those comments take the form of short stories. There's a whole "blue lantern" thing that I wish he'd do more of -- ideally in preference to Renegade.

Oh, that's another thing to be aware of. He's doing two stories in parallel. The main one is about Paragon!Paul, the SI, where he's a good guy who makes allies. His story entries start with orange text. There's a side story about Renegade!Paul. He's a good guy...sort of? Also an utter asshat. Everyone in the thread (almost) /really/ wants to see him fall on his face. His story entries start with red, except for the current arc which is all about him so he's the default.

I mention this because if you're reading the story only thread you'll be baffled why occasionally Paul does something and then time drops back a few minutes and he does it again in a different and more asshat-ish way.

******* The current arc also is going to be following Renegade primarily - while I don't like him nearly as much as !ParagonPaul, I tolerate him in his worst for moments when he gives his much needed The Reason You Suck Speeches.

The main issue with Renegade so far is that he hasn't failed at anything. In fact, outside of ParagonPaul having a higher maximum power level due to his [[#s][Spoiler]], Renegade's asshatishness has gotten equal or better results in almost every single mission he's been on before the last arc, where he missed out on a huge technological breakthrough bigtime by being needlessly antagonistic.

This has mostly, I think, been due to the fact that we only see Renegade in short violent bursts, doing the things he is best at doing - overwhelming force applied massively, very quickly - and nothing majorly subtle, which is ParagonPaul's forte.

Hopefully, with a whole arc, we will be able to see things for once not going perfectly for our Anti-Hero. I don't think he's been quite the Karma Houdini others in the thread seem to, but he's certainly due to a comeuppance.

Personally, I suspect that at some point he's going to go off the edge after somehow [[#s][Spoiler]].

Google isn't showing me the link, but it's been here a few times.

I also have an original rational superhero series on Amazon right now, "The Change Storms". The premise is "what would society look like if superpowers were real, and contagious?" It will eventually become rationalist, but that's in the next book.

*** I'm not sure how rationalist it is. Edwin seems to only be concerned with helping supervillains make money. He doesn't seem to care about figuring out what they actually want, let alone what he himself actually wants. He also focuses on telling them what to do, not how to think for themselves. Granted, they're not even smart enough to follow his concrete advice, so teaching them to be rational would be an exercise in futility, but from a Doylist perspective you need to teach someone how to think if your goal is to teach the reader how to think.
