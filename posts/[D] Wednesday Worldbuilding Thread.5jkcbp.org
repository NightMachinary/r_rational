Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** This is a long-ish dump of ideas for a homebrew fantasy D&D setting, ideally trying to get some feedback on which of these you'd like to encounter as a player, or some neat twists on these concepts that arises naturally from their cores (note that this is D&D and non-rational):

- *Tarot card class*\\
  The tarot mage holds a deck of cards as his focus, which he draws from in order to cast spells. His deck must be randomized in accordance with the strictures of his class, else it will be worthless for casting spells. While the tarot mage has little control over which spell he'll cast, these spells are much more powerful than those cast by a wizard. Creating new cards is an expensive and timely process.
- *Poisoned fighter*\\
  The poisoned fighter consumes a cocktail of poisons at the start of every fight. Due to his unique biology (a product of both magic and intensive training), these poisons are beneficial to him, though they still come with drawbacks. Special features include poisoned blood and the ability to poison weapons with their spit.
- *Multi-level mage*\\
  The mages of the Manifold Pyramid are always out to recruit others. There is a price associated with joining the pyramid, but once you're part of it, you can gain immense power by getting people to join, as well as benefits from anyone who /they/ get to join.
- *R9K mage* The uniqlomancer never casts the same spell twice, nor ever casts a spell that any other uniqlomancer has ever cast before. To do so carries grave penalties. If they abide by their constraint though, they are rewarded with powers that grow as more spells are cast, and their versatility in comparison with other mages makes them dangerous even at the start of their careers.
- *Out of body class*\\
  The astral warror leaves their body behind on the battlefield, using it as a hitching post from which their soul can strike. Their bodies are heavily armored and protected to keep them from being slain; their weapons are made of their own spirits.
- *Linking class*\\
  The linker blends willing participants together into a cohesive unit. The linker's allies share their knowledge, their skills in battle, and become more than the sum of their individuality. The qualitative process is described as invasive and unpleasant, and those with secrets to keep need not apply, for risk of those secrets bleeding out into the world.
- *Feng shui inspired class*\\
  The pathist sees a few of the pathways of probability and makes connections that are impossible for others. A simple step to the left might make a completely unrelated attack miss an ally. A defensive posture might alter the course of the battle for no apparent reason. The actions of the pathist are nonsensical, but their consequences cannot be denied. The most powerful of pathists are able to use minor actions in the present to create huge effects in the future.
- *Passion mages*\\
  The spellcasting equivalent to the barbarian, the passion drinkers allow themselves to be consumed by powerful emotion to funnel their spellcasting. In many cases this results in a fugue state, and the results are not entirely predictable given how inflamed their passions are when they're at their most powerful.
- *Offbeat Elemental mages*\\
  glass mage\\
  iron mage\\
  steam mage\\
  gem mage\\
  gold mage\\
  flesh mage\\
  blood mage\\
  bone mage\\
  wood mage\\
  lava mage\\
  clay mage\\
  smoke mage\\
  ash mage\\
  rust mage\\
  mist mage\\
  flower mage\\
  salt mage\\
  sand mage\\
- *Velocity fighter*\\
  The velocity fighter is all about speed, not simply dexterity, but the ability to move quickly. To this end, he learns a set of powers that increase his movement, his actions per turn, and the quickness with which he can accomplish tasks.
- *Still fighter*\\
  The still fighter can arrest his movement in various ways, allowing him to fall from any height without injury, to prevent knockback, and so on. They have the power of perfect immobility. At the highest levels, they are nearly invincible, because they can stop the movement of their flesh when it would be bludgeoned or pierced.
- *Revision mage*\\
  Revision mages are amazingly powerful, capable of nearly any act of restoration short of undoing death. They can walk into a castle that has been knocked down to its foundation and reverse the tumble of stones to the ground. Their healing is second to none, as they can unbreak bones and cause blood to pump back into the body. In combat they can reverse the motions of their opponents, trapping them in place as though in amber. The revision mages are rare and, to anyone with common sense, terrifying.

*** Riffing on the idea of the Tarot Mage:

It could be cool to have a deckbuilding aspect to this. To make it more unique than just RNG over a normal mage's spell slots, you could have the more powerful cards require specific sorts of experiences to attain. E.g. Death could require reaching the brink of death (negative HP or failed saving throws, depending on edition).

Once obtained, these powerful cards could be swapped out with the regular ones at a rate of level/4 per long rest. There may have to be an additional limit on their quantity (like =wisdom mod + level/2=), or you could require them to be balanced with negatives or something.

You could also do stuff with other tarot symbolism, like whether a card is drawn upright or inverted or drawn with the left or right hand. All of that greatly increases the complexity of the class in the design process, but it may help to create a sense of player agency or make for a more awesome opponent in an NPC.

"With his left hand, the mage draws a card from his deck. He shows it to you, smiling; it is a skeletal horseman, Death. The card turns to smoke and flies in a cloud to choke you. Make a constitution saving throw."

**** I was thinking that I'll probably pick up an actual tarot deck and use a tarot mage as a boss, mostly because I love to DM with props. (And the tarot deck would probably become a magic item with remnants of power to be used by the PCs once the tarot mage was defeated.)

The big design problem is that you'd be increasing variability, which is usually a bad thing for a class and has to be compensated for with variability reduction or increased power. That's not really a problem for an NPC, because you can cheat more, but as a PC class ... I'd want to introduce "cheats" like dealing from the bottom of the deck, being able to see the next card, or something like that.

I really like the idea of incorporating all the weird stuff that's used in tarot readings to make the cards themselves more variable.

Out of universe, the spells are variants of those found in the player's handbook with both flavorful and minor mechanical changes whose uniqueness is determined by die-rolls modified by how creative and powerful the variants are.

(There would obviously need to be constraints on what "unique" means, because if you can use two spells that are 0.00000001% different from each other there's not really a point to the class/idea.)

*** Tarot card class sounds like fun to play, but the level of randomness it introduces could be a bit much for the player. Perhaps if the spells themselves removed the element of chance normally present in DnD, maybe having their numbers set at the card's creation? This'll allow the spells to be used to a greater degree of tactical precision then is normally possible in the game.

Poisoned fighter sounds more like a race then a class. Or just NPC flavour. What is the mechanical difference between a special class who can poison their weapons after drinking poison, and any other class who can poison their blades without drinking poison? Also lots of things in DnD are immune to poison. Maybe it could work as a broader "chemical" fighter using combat stimulants and potions to gain an edge.

Multi-level Mage is hilarious and I can see so many problems with it as a player class, but if you think you can balance it with everyone else it could be a fun and novel charisma-focused spellcaster. Also it will result in the Pyramid Mage attempting diplomacy at every opportunity and building convoluted social skill leveling schemes for their recruits.

R9K I don't really see working well. Or maybe I don't understand it. The best way I can see to do the idea is allowing them to cast any spell in the entire Player's Handbook that they're the appropriate level for, and making sure that the player understands the whole system well enough to pace their spellcasting appropriately for their XP gains. The "other R9K mages count against your spell limits" part seems like an arbitrary limitation that's a bunch of extra work for everyone involved.

Out of Body looks interesting. Lots of ways to implement it. Might want to limit it to short range though, to avoid having to come up with convoluted means of threatening them. Easy to have it be really fragile or basically unstoppable. I'd implement it as a gradient: The greater distance from/time spent/powers used in astral combat, the less control and protection for the main body. Overextend and they risk being cut down, play defensively and they risk seeing the battle turn against them.

Linking class looks like flavour for an NPC. I've seem some psionic powers that did the things this does, but a class that unevenly denies other classes their individuality isn't something I'd recommend implementing. Or just go the whole way and make the players a hive-mind to start with.

Feng Shui class is an interesting idea. It's...basically a subtle spellcaster? I'd suggest looking into the psionics stuff, it has a bunch of more subtle/mental powers that could work with this class.

Passion Mages sound like Wilders, but more fun to play. it also sounds like Wild Magic, which someone else mentioned.

Offbeat Elemental Mages. I like all of these. The Salt Mage should be overpowered as hell and claim a disproportionate amount of the XP. Whenever another player yells at him or cries, he heals 1D10 HP.

Velocity Fighter is something I'd like to play, I love mobility-focused classes and there aren't nearly enough of them.

Still fighter could serve as an interesting puzzle boss too. A PC Still Fighter would clearly be the party meatshield.

Revision Mage. Good concept, interesting powers, Wizard-with-time-speciality is fun. Not sure why they can't reverse death at higher levels though? Everybody else can.

**** R9K gets access to arbitrary amounts of spells, sometimes through flavor tweaks and other times through mechanical tweaks. There would be some kind of abstraction layer to determine whether a spell variation has been used before. So /ideally/ you get things like "/fireball/, but it's blue, and becomes a cone at the point of detonation, and curves to the right, and etc." with each modification of the base spell increasing or decreasing the, I don't know, Spellcraft DC or something. (The uniqlomancer of course has a bunch of variations prepared ahead of time, and has some level of coordination with other uniqlomancers to ensure that they're all exploring unique spellspace. Hence conflicts, which I like.)

Poisoned fighter wouldn't be immune to poison. So they'd take their 1d6 DEX damage from terinav root, but they would get some kind of benefit from it, like a 1d6 boost to STR or something. At higher levels they would increase or decrease die sizes; 1d4 DEX hit with a 1d8 STR boost maybe. Most of the benefit comes from these "chemical pathways". (You'd be barred from the class if you were immune to poison.) (Obviously there's an issue with cost, since D&D poisons are really expensive.)

Revision mage can't undo death mostly because I liked the idea of a high-level revision mage coming to a city that had been wracked by storm, unshattering all the windows, uncollapsing all the ruined shops, causing splintered wood to knit back together. All the limp bodies are restored as they go through their motions in reverse, until the people are sitting at their tables uneating food ... and then when the spell ends, they're still dead, so there's a perfect scene that looks as though they all died of natural causes at the same time. (Conceptually, this is because they don't have access to the soul. Probably never a PC class. Hooks include needing to escort a revision mage or attempting to track one that's turned to murders that can be accomplished without leaving evidence.)

***** I just don't know, I see the appeal flavour-wise, but it sounds like the Uniqlomancer has several downsides (failure chance vs. extra preparations, conflicts with other Uniqlomancers), but it's only upside is easier access to niche spells, which isn't a great trade-off.

Ah, I like that better. Sacrificing HP/attributes temporarily for other benefits.

Revision Mages could do some fun things. Reversing their injuries as they happen, erasing recent memories, "pausing" things by constantly reversing them over a tiny time-span, re-use one-use items...

*** I'm always a big fan of anything that includes whole new concepts for classes (as opposed to "mechanically identical to X, but flavor wise they're a Y"). I'm just going to go through each one and say my ideas, or mention a related thing you might want to get ideas from (most if not all of these might be your source of ideas for the class in the first place, but I'm going to include them anyway just in case they aren't).

- *Tarot card class*\\
  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4zwfrl/the_tarocchi_a_playing_cardbased_magic_class/][The Tarocchi]]
- *Poisoned fighter*\\
  Reminds me a bit of the Delusionist or Diva classes from [[https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/666378-penny-arcade-adventures-episode-three/faqs/64577#section8][Penny Arcade's Rainslick Precipice of Darkness EP3]]. Respectively they are "applies buff at some kind of cost" and "steals MP from allies turning them into mana batteries".
- *Multi-level mage*\\
  Other than the obvious pyramid scheme reference, I feel like this should actually result in powerful NPCs simply because the characters will see it and go "oh it's a scam, obviously" and underestimate them, even though such a scheme could easily work in a fantasy setting.
- *R9K mage*\\
  Glueboy [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5jkcbp/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dbhjflb/][mentioned]] the Staff of One below, but this also makes me think of the aspect of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/644389][Dreams]] from the SBURB Glitch FAQ.
- *Out of body class*\\
  I like this. I'm a little surprised nobody has designed a "become immobile to boost damage" archetype in D&D before (ala Overwatch's [[https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/bastion/][Bastion]] and LoL's [[http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/xerath/][Xerath]]). This one feels more versatile than the *Still fighter* you mentioned. Perhaps this one is a "astral body must remain adjacent to physical body" style, wheras Still fighter could be a grapple lockdown, or debuffer who reduces enemy speed/Dex, or even the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/634465][Rhyme]] aspect (who's core concept is all "stop stop STOP EVERYTHING").
- *Linking class*\\
  The name makes me think this a reference to the [[https://wiki.erfworld.com/Caster_Link][ability]] of Thinkamancers from Erfworld, but even if it is, the [[https://wiki.erfworld.com/List_of_Caster_Links][List of Caster Link-Ups]], and [[https://wiki.erfworld.com/Speculative_Link-ups][List of Theoretical Caster Link-Ups]] should be helpful.
- *Feng shui inspired class*\\
  To account for the random opportunities that would appear and vanish on a changing battlefield, perhaps 2 decks of cards, one with triggers, and one with effects. Each type has a trigger/effect labeled as lvl 1, 2 or 3 (or some combination therof) and you can perform any trigger actions on one to trigger the same level (or lower) of effect on the other. (eg you draw a trigger card with lvl 1 & 2 triggers, and an effect card with lvl 2&3 effects, you will only be able to activate the level 2 effect). Triggers range from simple (move 5 feet to the left (when facing the location of the effect) without triggering Opportunity attacks) at level 1, to the complex (hit with a ranged weapon attack on an enemy weilding a shield, and do at least 5 damage) on level 3. Effects are correspondingly powerful/weak depending on level (shove an enemy 5 ft, ally gains 5 temp HP, to next attack on enemy that hits is a critical if the attack has advantage, enemy is disarmed and falls prone, ally gains HP as though they spent a healing surge). You can discard the pair of cards at end of turn, drawing new ones, and they are automatically replaced if you used an effect at the highest level on that card. Character building adds or removes cards with different keywords to your deck (which, honestly, should be about 15-20 cards), with paths that include effects that [[http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Scry][Scry]] either or both decks, path that focuses on healing, battlefield manipulation, or direct damage.
- *Passion mages*\\
  Nothing special to mention here other than the obvious "Rage Mage" joke.
- *Velocity fighter*\\
  Might work best as a monk path since those get speed boosts already, or as something the local messenger's guild would recruit. References to the Cordwainer class (sooo many shoe puns) from the above mentioned [[https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/666378-penny-arcade-adventures-episode-three/faqs/64577#section8][Penny Arcade RSPOD Episode 3]], and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/608450][Flow Aspect]] (who tend to focus on "And it don't stop, just keep going forever") from the above mentioned Glitch FAQ

*** Here are brief write-ups of the offbeat elemental mages ("mage" being loosely defined):

- *Glass mages* are half-casters who fight with blades of glass and attack with razor-sharp shards. They also to some extent have mirror powers, scrying through reflections and bouncing across reflective surfaces.
- *Iron mages* are heavily armored mages that monkey-grip enormous swords and shift their armor around them to make up for how utterly impractical this would otherwise be. They're tanks, but faster and more powerful than they would otherwise appear.
- *Steam mages* are all about pressure. They build it up and use it to fight and cast with, throwing giant haymaker punches and make explosive leaps through the air. Some equip themselves with weapons that utilize steam to fire projectiles.
- *Gem mages* have a variety of aspects depending on which of their gems they focus their power through. A gem mage is constantly shifting through their gems, using them in combination. They are always on the lookout for new gems of sufficient clarity, quality, etc.
- *Gold mages* gain power through material wealth. The wealth must be close to their person, and gold is powerful above all else, though they often stud their armor and weapons with jewels as well. It's a precarious class though, because they paint a target on themselves. Probably quite powerful to compensate for the fact that they're so showy. (Probably forced to be showy? It's not just about hoarded wealth, it's conspicuous wealth.)
- *Flesh mages* are healers, using the power of flesh to knit shut wounds. Most of them are bulky, sturdy fighters whose immense power belies calmness and kindness; it is difficult for them to use their flesh magic to harm, because another person's flesh is inviolate and they have an appreciation for the properness of flesh.
- *Blood mages* are the most vicious of the elemental mages, using their blades to open wounds that will never close and extracting the blood from their enemies with a touch. One of their favorite abilities is to pop blood vessels or cause bruises, leaving horrible marks on their victims that are slow to fade.
- *Bone mages* carry around bags of bones with them, which they use to cast spells. Each bone is treated ahead of time with a specific spells, which goes off once the bone is snapped. In a pinch, the bone mage can use their own lifeforce for spellcasting by snapping their own bones, or the bones of a helpless opponent or willing ally. Better spells take bigger bones. (flavorful, but not too mechanically interesting?)
- *Wood mages* fight by “planting” themselves into the ground and growing out appendages of living wood to do their bidding. Using wood, they'll cloak themselves in thick armor to allow them to withstand powerful attacks. Unlike most other elemental mages, the wood mage cannot draw on his elemental plane and must use wood that he's taken into his personal store, which limits the size and shape of his creations.
- *Clay mages* are creators, makers of trinkets and statues that are sculpted on the fly and brought to life with a kiss. These creations get better with more time to make them detailed, though they don't have to be lifelike so long as they're deliberately made with a skilled hand. They also wear armor of clay and can turn some kinds of stone into clay.
- *Smoke mages* take their power from burning various substances, then inhaling and exhaling that smoke. When they breathe in smoke, they can take on the properties of the think they're making smoke from. When they breathe out smoke, they can temporarily imbue whatever they're blowing smoke onto with the smoke property. (Turning things into smoke is supernatural, allowing attuned items to turn to smoke without fire or oxidation.)
- *Rust mages* take their power from oxidation. They work like rust monsters in some respects, in that they can rust away nonmagical swords and armors, but usually they come into battle with stacks of metals strapped to them so that they can fuel their fighting/casting, and they strongly prefer to engineer their battles to take place on metallic terrain.
- *Mist mages* can generate obscuring mists around themselves, from which they coalesce temporary weapons and armor. Their fighting style is to move through the mists at nearly teleportation speeds, which makes them deadly when a fog has descended. They can't see through the fog, but they can blindfight in it through their mist sense.
- *Flower mages* center around the concept of “bloom”. They carefully cultivate flowers, each of which corresponds to a particular spell in their repertoire. Their comparative advantage they have over other mages is that they can “bloom” their spells all at once, which means more spells per day and more spells per action. Their flowers can also leach from magical items, allowing them to wear flower necklaces, flower dresses, flower etc.
- *Salt mages* are closely associated with places; they gather salts from diverse locations and make large salt crystals out of them. Their secondary power is that of stillness and preservation. On the battlefield, so long as they have a salt crystal of the place they're fighting in, they can build protective wards of a variety of sorts.
- *Sand mages* use precise magic that correlates to the number and placement of grains of sand they they either lay down on the ground or spray through the air. A sand caster is meticulous in their designs and tends to plan well in advance so they can create their sand patterns ahead of time. In terms of actual magic, there's a heavy emphasis on the flow of time.
- *Lava mages* utilize the flow. They carry rocks around with them, which they move in circles to heat; once they've made enough rotations and become hot enough, they turn liquid and the lava mage can maintain their circles in the air. They use these like whips and shields, altering the flows to do harm. It takes quite some time for them to spin up and spin down, but once they're ready they're formidable fighters.
- *Ash mages* work with that which is ruined beyond repair. They use ash to evoke the spirit of that which has been burnt. A smear of sword-ash on the palm conjures a ghostly sword into the hand, which a smear of cuirass-ash on the chest conjures ghostly armor. Their true abilities extend beyond that though, since they can ritualistically burn things in order to see a whole version of them again - burning a corpse can allow them to use the ash to create a temporary ghost that can be talked to, or burning a ruined book can allow them to read that which has washed away.

*** Mostly I would ask for more details on the experience and the aftereffects such as:

- Subjectively, how long were you ran really fast?

- Did you have any access to the internet?

- If no, in what way could you affect the world?

- Do you remember your life before the experience?

- What did the experience change about you?

"Not one bit."

"Other than having had to replace most of my visual cortex? ... Well, I'm definitely sure that I can be comfortable in my own company, and I've figured out my best possible study habits. And I am really, /really/ inclined to find out what I can do to keep anyone else from going through anything like what I did. Even if I don't have any human rights, there's plenty of reasons to reduce the sorts of gross negligence that led to this."

****** "It's a years-long story. Oversimplifying a /lot/... There were other... processes running in that system, which I'm told is the whole point of the thing. I couldn't stop them, but early on, I figured out some of what they were doing - and I found out I was almost certainly going to be deleted. I studied something called 'homomorphic computation', and tried to make a backup copy of myself which wouldn't be deleted by the same process, but there were all sorts of issues, such as not having enough space for that backup, and before I solved them all... that copy of me was deleted, and eventually the backup was started up. Unfortunately, that copy of me was missing most of my visual cortex, and the patches I'd come up with only helped a little, and I was basically helpless for what I estimate were years before my brain adapted enough to let me become functional again. After that... it was mostly a matter of making more backups to survive the latest processes, waking up as one of the backups, and doing it again."

** I'm trying to write an original fantasy story around a goblin main character which was inspired by a light novel goblin kingdom (a story that I don't recommend). As for worldbuilding I think I have a pretty unique magic system by which I mean I've never seen it before. It revolves around the entire magic system being intelligent but not sentient or aware. For me it explains how words being spoken or neurons firing can translate into a physical force like a fireball appearing out of thin air.

The magic system is very stupid. This also explains the creation of new magic as 'training' the magic system by thinking a certain way many times that is similar to thinking another way. so if you and enough people want the spell to be stronger then over the course of a century it becomes stronger, though it costs more mana to cast.

The residents themselves are unaware of the true nature of the magic system and have not taken advantage of this. There actually is a good reason that the people are unaware of this/live in the dark ages technology-wise.

There is a lot more worldbuilding I have planned but I don't want to spoil the story.

So, if I want to create a new spell, say to freeze water, should I stand by some freezing water while chanting "/Frigidero/" and waving my hands?

I think that could be really cool. Spells have to be trained on things that are possible without magic, but they can then be coaxed into doing it more powerfully or in different contexts (e.g. freezing a lake in summer).

truthfully I haven't been thinking about the specifics as much as I should have been. Really I've been just thinking generalities. I also may have not been clear. It takes decades for the magic system to be trained in the slightest but once it learns the magic it does not forget.

Really that just applies to making new spells. You can still train your mind to go through certain patterns to access higher level spells. These spells can be recorded in ancient tomes or be taught from master to apprentice.

Some magic, you can't even train for the reason for this lies in the ability of an individual to think certain ways. For example a bloodline might be DNA shaping your unconsious mind to be able to express certain concepts for certain magics more fluidly or at the same time another part of your mind is expressing another concept. This allows for one person to be able to access a certain spell while another person cannot.

In my story magic has been used for around a thousand years and as a result there is a plethora of magic to use.
