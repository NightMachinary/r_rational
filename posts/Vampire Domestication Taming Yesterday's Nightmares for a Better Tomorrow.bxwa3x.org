  As it turns out, a large number of [Texas]'s convicts did not show any sociopathic pathological tendencies whatsoever. In fact, many of them were not even guilty of any actual crimes!
#+end_quote

Aaaand I remember why I stopped listening midway through the last time this was posted.

Seriously, the author makes no attempt whatsoever to makes his political digs subtle. This is annoying at first when it's only making fun of corporate pharma, and gets really irritating when it branches out into making digs at conservative talking points and Texas' prison system.

**** Heh, old timey Marxists used to rant about media being an opiate to distract from material circumstances. (Most of it is, let's be honest - functionally escapist fantasy. Family Matters and CSI Miami do not reflect reality.)

Lead might be in the water, you might be one broken bone away from being homeless, you might not even get the $300 in blood money (that's the standard cut as established by Iraq) from the next war of capital acquisition, slavery is literally still legal, but... there are sexy people on tv. Or cute goofy animals. So it's all okay.

Literally everything is political - even trying to escape from it is itself ceding power to someone else.

  slavery is literally still legal
#+end_quote

This is outrageous enough that most people aren't aware of it, and is therefore always worthy of a tangent.

Go read the 13th amendment if you don't believe me. Go watch "Slavery By Another Name" to see how it's enacted in the real world.

It's a bit more gentle now than it was in the 1940's. But still goes on behind closed doors and out of sight.

You all remember the "Hillary had slaves" meme that talked about how they use slaves in Arkansas to clean the governor's mansion. Instead of giving someone a job and, you know, /paying them money/ to do it.

I personally think a rational thing to do would be to support the creation of a society without slavery, and not pretend I'm powerless to do anything. But if I am powerless, it is a lot of free time wasted that could have gone to being wasted in other equally useless ways.

... did I just use a Pascal's Mugging there? ...sorry.

*** Considering that's the 6th straight page of the same joke, it's interesting that you draw the line at "turns out many convicts aren't actually sociopaths." Says a lot about you, not much about the story though.

No it doesn't, and stop playing passive-aggressive internet psychologist, it's childish.

I picked the "prisoners weren't guilty of any crimes" line as an example, because it's representative of the forced "ahah, aren't conservative awful" tone, not because I hate people who end up in prison.

Point is there's plenty of "aren't liberals awful," "aren't doctors awful," "aren't regulatory committees awful," "aren't corporations awful," etc, etc, ETC, that you didn't seem to catch or have a problem with, so it's not likely to be about the type of attempted humor.

And if it's not that, it's pretty freaking annoying that you're going to whine about the political implications of the part that doesn't match your opinions.

Seriously, you're making wild assumptions about the thoughts behind my post, and it's kind of insulting.

Yes, I noticed the all the other jokes about evil doctors and creationism and Texas as a nazi-like state supplying prisoners as test subjects. Because I didn't make a list of every single awkward joke in the story doesn't mean I didn't take issue with these awkward jokes, it means I wanted to keep my post concise.
