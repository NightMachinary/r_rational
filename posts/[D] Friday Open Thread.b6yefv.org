Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I have been a fan of xianxia genre for a while now and I have noticed I feel an odd sense of [[/r/gatekeeping][r/gatekeeping]] when ever someone recommends the Cradle Series by Will Wight. In my mind I picture the people who recommend it as normis who aren't True fans just because they didn't have to force themselves to read unfinished, badly translated garbage to get into the genre.

I know that it's a silly thing to get annoyed about especially since a well written western xianxia series is likely good for genre and will lead to more high quality works in the future.

Also the people who recommend cradle are likely just as big fans of the genre as I am who are just glad that they don't have to read badly translated garbage anymore..

*** I feel an odd sense of gatekeeping whenever I encounter badly translated garbage. Like, who are you to present this series to me as if it were translated when it looks like you just ran it through a machine translator and didn't bother editing it? Some fans put forth time and effort to translate series that they enjoy so that other people like me who don't speak foreign languages can enjoy them too. And some people submit awkward garbage that's barely even gramattical and pretend that it's English. In many cases, it's worse than if they didn't even bother, because if a bad translator claims a series it might dissuade more competent fans from doing a proper translation of that series. And it also wastes my time that I spent looking through it and makes it take longer to find good series with proper translations.

Maybe I shouldn't be too harsh on people, given that I haven't put forth the effort to properly learn a foreign language and am just free-riding on the work of other people. But at least I'm not a negative contributor to a public good.

** I had the recent pleasure of watching a high school performance the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seussical][Suessical]] last week. It was cute, but kind of bittersweet. Part of that was my insight into the production - my sisters were on crew, and privy to a lot of the drama going on in the background. Many of the senior actors refused to work in the musical in protest, because it was a step down from the productions they worked on before. There was one backdrop and maybe three or four movable props. This is coming from the school that built a moving car for their production of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEzaMe7Lmew][/Chitty Chitty Bang Bang/]]. As crew members, my sisters have been consistently disappointed in the new stage-director's insistence on minimalist sets, and this was the embodiment of that.

Other than that, the Suessical also feels kind of... slimy? The same way Broadway shows always do, in that supporting a performance of a musical means supporting the theater industry, unless the performance wasn't properly licensed. I'm already disheartened by how copyright works in more mainstream media, so I'm not super psyched that Broadway is allowed to clamp down on the distribution of recordings of musicals the way they do, even if that recording isn't even on Broadway.

I'm nearing the end of my second semester of college, and let me tell you, if you get the opportunity to study Software Engineering at RIT, choose Computer Science instead. I hate that I have to say that, seeing as it's my major, but it's true. Even if RIT has one of the oldest Software Engineering programs around, there are a few really /strange/ prerequisites. I have to take University Physics I and II, and pass both with higher than a C. This is a requirement on a technicality - all engineering majors have to take UP I & II, and Software Engineering is still "engineering" even if it's mostly computers. Knowing this subreddit, you might not think that's a big deal. But UP II is one of the more notorious weed-out classes for the /Physics/ major. So I have to struggle through this elaborate /70%/ fail-rate hazing ritual for physics majors because my degree is tangentially related to the discipline. (To put this in perspective, two of the six people at my table have taken this class and failed before. I'm the only freshman in the room.) If it were enriching /and/ difficult, I would be happier about it. But it's mostly a chore.

The worst thing about it is that, because it's a required course, the college didn't take my AP Physics credits. That's okay in the long-term, because I still had about a semester and a half's worth of credits in AP courses going into college without it, but I'd still appreciate being rewarded for the effort. University Physics I was mostly review of the same material.

EDIT: And if the degree had the general science requirement that Computer Science had, I wouldn't need to take any classical science classes at all, because I carried over like six credits worth of AP Biology. So not only did they deny my Physics credits, they treated my hard-fought biology credits as /electives/. Ugh.

I'm far from a dumb student - if people like me have trouble keeping their grades up in a class like this, it's probably not well designed. I really feel like they ought to have split the curriculum for this class in two, but maybe they wanted the symmetry of a two course series over an actually sensible design.

****** My problem with 'weed-out' courses is multi-folded.

Generally, I find that they are often taught by people not actually pursuing that field of knowledge. Specifically, my organic chemistry and Physics 2&3 courses were taught by professors that were at the University to do research and were required to teach a course. As they couldn't find anyone to teach what was considered the hardest 'weed-out' courses, they taught those.

Additionally, they often only teach the simplest aspects of a course in class and expect you to do the grunt of the legwork yourself without explaining how to combine simpler theories into more complex ones, as if everyone should just naturally be able to do so and has practice doing it. Then they get condescending when asked about the thought process on reaching the conclusion. This was never an issue for me with organic chemistry as it is my favorite subject, but I struggled mightily with physics and was looked down upon for it.

Often times I found that the higher level courses taught basic concepts much more pricesly and succinctly than the 'weed-out' courses required to reach those classes.

*** I recall doing a physics course in university, which was taught by two separate professors with very different exam styles. The first professor would expect you to memorise the relevant equations and simply (mechanically) apply them to the questions as given - finding a faster but equally correct way to reach the same answer was given only partial credit.

The second professor would give you a sheet containing the equations in the exam, but then require you to use them in innovative ways to find the answer.

...my grades went up /significantly/ when the second professor took over.

*** Reminds me of my first Computer Science classes at University of Rochester a little bit. Let me share my horror story of badly taught college classes.

My professor was due to retire literally the next semester so the class that he was teaching was the very last class he would ever teach. Hence he had a bad habit of getting bored with what he was teaching and meandering off into tangents that was barely related to the material he was supposed to cover!

It was a very frustrating class where we would be doing HW assignments and taking tests on material that were either barely touched on in the class to not at all. The only reason I got a C was because of the amazing TAs who put a lot of time and effort into tutoring the students. I think the only people with Bs or As were people who already knew the material but didn't have AP credits.

To add another note to this story of woe, the very next semester, I had to take a specific CS requirement course that was only offered in the spring and I was all excited for a better professor......and the same professor came back for one more semester of teaching!!!!!

I am a student with minimal experience in CS; please explain the basics before jumping off into material that requires the basics to understand!?!?!

That semester I got a D in his class, and for comparison, an A in an AI Development class which was considered to be harder than the first class.

Whew, didn't mean to go into that much detail sharing my horror stories, but yeah, bad requirements and bad teachers are in every school.

** I'm nearing the end of Baba Is You, which I've been liking quite a bit. (It's a block-pushing puzzler where the words that make up the rules can be pushed, which changes the rules.)

My only real problem with the game is that some of the rules can only be found by discovery, since there's no manual. Normally I like that in a puzzle game, but the game has to teach you the rules in some other way. The Witness was really good about that. Baba Is You ... not so much. Two or three times I've been stumped by some hitherto unknown arcana of how the game works on a programmatic level, with no clear way to arrive at the solution aside from trying stuff until unexpected behavior occurs.

Other than that, I'm finding it really enjoyable, especially since it does that wonderful puzzle game thing of having two levels which are, on the surface, similar to each other, but vary in just slightly different ways so that different solutions are needed. It's also got some really bizarre/abstract puzzles in it that make me laugh before I get to the actual business of solving them.

** Ah, and one more thing before I leave. Years ago, my birth city of Rochester built a ferry to take people from the shores of Seabreeze to the city of Toronto. When it was built, it was touted as a major way to increase tourism in the area. But it turns out that, while people from Rochester wanted to visit Toronto, nobody in Toronto wanted to visit Rochester. So the ferry was sold, and political humiliation for those involved in the project was left in its wake.

Where is it now?

The way the riders hype themselves up to calm their nerves, doing their best to ride as hard as they could while struggling to avoid impaling themselves into a forest of spears, those that decide to abandon all self-preservation instincts and throw themselves and their horses bodily into the enemy formation, opening them up for their comrades following close behind. The mentality and the minute details described by a good writer are so vivid I can imagine the scene as if it was a movie.

Apart from the Sharpe series, I've been enjoying those parts from the translation for the Chinese webnovel the Amber Sword, and the Japanese light novel Girl Who Ate A Death God.

** After enjoying the Love Is War anime so much I decided to read the manga (my first ever, what a milestone!). These were my thoughts, as of the latest issue:

*The Good:*

- They didn't let the Kaguya/Miyuki 'conflict' grow too stagnant, and even though they were both trying to get each other to confess still after 100+ issues it was still possible to feel the progress in their relationship. They managed to make this changing dynamic work well with the humour too, i.e one of my favourite new gags was Kaguya trying to get Miyuki flustered, such as trying on a cute cosplay, and instead of Miyuki getting flustered he straight out admits what she's after/tells her how amazing she looks and /she/ ends up being the one flustered.

- The central conflict in general was handled well (up until after the climax) and the climax at the Culture Festival was great. The scene had a lot of feeling and was a great payoff.

- Whenever the side characters were featured /in conjunction/ with one of the main two, or when the entire student council as a whole as assembled, I thought they were used to great effect. Bonus points if they had their own little character arcs worked into the protagonist's arcs such as Hayasaka's, which was a personal favourite of mine. On the other hand when the side characters functioned as their own protagonists in an issue...

*The Bad:*

- ...When one of the side characters, most notably Ishigami or Miko, were the protagonists of an issue the story turned from this unique take on a rom-com with scheming, mind games, insightful social dynamics and comedic absurdity into...some cookie cutter generic high school angst story. Fujiwara and Hayasaka were great examples of side characters being used to better explore the main two protagonists and in the doing, to have their own hilarious character moments. Ishigami and (very occasionally) Miko were used like this at times but when they went off on their own they couldn't hold my attention without the core cast.

- What on earth is going on post-climax? What is the gimmicky garbage filling my once great manga with 'Chiba'(?) Kayuga and then some personality-shifting-ice-princess-contrived-drama bullshit? I was so incredibly disappointed reading the latest issue (142)(though the cold hands gags was genuinely funny) and hope it's not a sign of things to come. There still so much they can do with the two characters even after they've all but confessed; there's power dynamics at play in every relationship and there's a bunch of hurdles and milestones, especially in a first time relationship, that would make for great content. There's no need for such suspension of disbelief breaking contrived rubbish.

*The 'Wut?':*

What's up with how French kissing is treated? Is this a convention of anime/manga that French kissing is almost the equivalent of sex or is this some sort of Japanese social norm?

Overall the good certainly outweighed the bad and I intend to keep reading.

*** Yeah, I've noticed a lot of people are unsatisfied with how the plot is unfolding after 136, which is pretty understandable.

But, in my opinion, the author has managed to accrue a lot of goodwill with me over +130 chapters, so I'm willing to give Aka the benefit of the doubt and see where it goes. We do know that everything is building up to the Christmas party, and it doesn't look like he's stalling until then, so I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm just hoping that the payoff is good.

I actually do like the Ishigami and Miko segments, especially their big climactic moments (election and the sport festival). I do think Miko is a bit underdeveloped, but it looks like that's going to change soon, given the increasing focus on her now.

The french kissing thing is just Hayasaka being an embarrassed idiot, mixed with some jealousy I imagine.

Oh, and someone translated a recent volume extra (can't find it for some reason) which basically had the author apologizing in advance for the stupidity readers were about to witness and advising them to come back in three days (Christmas).

As the author seemed to be able to prediction people's response to recent chapters, I'm guessing he has a plan, so again, I wouldn't worry too much.

See my comment above, they're figuring stuff out as they go, so Kashiwagi might feel like that too, but her relationship is very different from Kaguya. They're not deeply in love or anything, they got together on a whim, and will probably break up sooner or later. My guess is they just were being horny teens, and as soon as it got to the point of them being in condition to French kiss - namely, alone, in a closed space, since that's not the sort of thing you'd usually do in public in Japan - they went all the way.

*** For me about French kissing, these are Japanese teenagers. It's not a convention of anime/manga because usually they don't even GET to French kissing in anime/manga. There's a reason why the "handholding? LEWD!" meme exists. Japan is generally very conservative about PDA. So the implication is that if you French kiss you're probably already so physical you're close to having sex. But in general, they're teens, and teens with a poor sex ed at that, they're just figuring this shit out as they go.

About the last developments, I think it's intentionally frustrating and it'll get solved soon. I don't mind for now, Chibi Kaguya was funny and probably meant as a gag 'breather' chapter. It's a pattern, after the huge climax of an arc you have some kind of unwinding, and that's where we are right now. I think there will be a better resolution soon enough, and hopefully we can move to more interesting interactions. Though I dread where the Miko-Ishigami thing will go, because honestly, I just don't see them as a good couple at all.
