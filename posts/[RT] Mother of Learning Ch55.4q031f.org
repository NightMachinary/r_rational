*** Yeah, my thought as well, but it's not very encouraging that their bodies were apparently in no condition to return after talking to the Guardian for less than an hour. If they want to use a black room there, they'll have to come up with a much better cover story than their current disguise they use to get in. I assume that any attempt to develop a black room on their own require too much in terms of time or resources to be practical, but I could be wrong.

It's good that the soul marker can help them find the pieces of the Key, but the four years thing still seems like it'll make things difficult, I don't think they'll be able to figure out who RR is while still inside the loop.

**** Can they figure RR at all?

If we assume RR is the passenger (Zach being the passenger is rather unlikely) then after RR exits the loop, his template is reset to the non-modified state. The person that became Red Robe is still in the loop, with his looping memory erased. He is not even missing, he is just a regular citizen. There is no physical evidence left in the simulation.

The only clue can be hidden inside Zach's mind. Huh, funny that Zach asked not to mess with his mind right in this chapter. I wonder if this is a coincide... BAH! I CALL FORESHADOWING!

  "Initially, Black Rooms could not prematurely terminate the time dilation field once it was turned on," said Xvim. "Once the Black Room was on, whoever was inside was stuck until the spell wore off."
#+end_quote

Implies that they can /now/ be shut down early, whether that means from the outside or inside, I'm not entirely sure. Either way, they'd still have to deal with people before entering and after leaving, and normally there's probably a years-long waiting list to reserve the usage of a black room, with a great deal of bureaucratic red tape. Basically, think of it as going to space on a government's official space shuttle, with less intensive physical training and tests. If they're going to forge their way into the usage of black room, they'd have to be pretty thorough. If they pull strings through official channels to use the rooms as themselves, that might actually be easier. If after spending a day/month inside the black room, there's a number of well armed guards waiting for them outside, things could get tricky, unless they decided to do a reset from there. Plus Zach and Zorian might not be able to stand each other for a whole month.

******* True, but it would make it easier to sneak in/fight their way out or bargain their way into one if they're working together.

In regards to convincing authorities to let them use it, they are the Noveda heir and Daimen Kazinski's younger brother and their magical skills are suitably impressive. They could even offer to cover some of the operational costs.

Plus, if they go in together, they can both reap the benefits of an extra month of training. But I think Zach would get bored out of his mind and Zorian would get so annoyed with him that one of them would hit the reset switch. Optimal training scenario? Send Xvim in there with them, with a vast supply of marbles. Alternatively, Zorian and Xvim only.

** Xvim is awesome, as usual. That little scene made all the suffering he caused to Zorian /worth it/. Start over, Zach.

I absolutely didn't expect one month length of the loop to be for moral reasons. Usually being capable of doing feats like the Gate are depicted above morality. it's also a possible clue that the system wasn't designed by gods, since gods were, according to Zorian "total dicks".

So, now it's Dragon Ball. Search for parts of the Key scattered through the world, increasing your power level in the process, +and have your wish granted when you gather them all+. Daimen probably has at least one of them. Time limit of 4 years seems challenging, but doable.

*** Divine Command Theory, look it up. Whatever Zorian deems moral a god may deem not.

I think it is heavily implied that the Gate is a divine creation. Let's break it up:

- Insane complexity. For example the Guardian is a pretty nice AI.
- Insane power levels. Recreate a world 1000 times over, with potential to sustain those worlds for prolonged time (remember, the 1-month limit was said to be set up only for moral reasons)
- Intricate knowledge of souls. I mean, does anyone besides gods have the capacity to create a copy of soul? I doubt that, because necromancers would be fundamentally different with such ability. Create a soulwell, populate it with copies of 1 soul -> profit. But no one does that (obv: they can't)
- The Maker is implied to be an immortal. The guardian suggested that the Maker could have marked Zach, but the Gate's activations are once in 400 years. If the Maker is anything less than immortal, he is guaranteed to be dead. The Maker and his 'agents' sounds suspiciously like a god and his subordinate angels.
- Excessive wastefulness. Creating 1000 simulations for /just one person but not for yourself/, that's insane if you think about it. But it's exactly the kind of move that Zorian would describe as "Gods being dicks. Again."
- Zach is a picturesque champion. He is just the kind of person that screams 'I am the Chosen One' and lo and behold, he is chosen.

The first two alone strongly imply divine origin.

**** Zack being both a prince and the controller for an unrelated reason (chosen one) is less likely than him being the controller because he is a prince(connections, wealth, politics).

Also, the spirit-serpent said the gate was unused for a long time. I think it unlikely that a god would have a device for his chosen, that is usable every 400 years, and then forget to pick a chosen every 400 years.

Why would a god with a chosen even have a gate? As long as you are spending attention on choosing him in the first place, just put him in a loop and give him a soul-switch to end the looping while you install the other ones.

I think the controller at least gets chosen my mortals.

The original maker of the loop may be a god, but that is far from certain. Powerful, certainly, but is that necessarily what makes one a god? For all we know "gets power from prayer" could be a criterion. "lives outside the simulation" could be a criterion. No matter how much power one gains in a MMORPG one is not more powerful than the guy who can unplug the server.

**** Occam's razor suggests this conclusion strongly based on the evidence we are given. However, in the context of a story I'm always skeptical of this sort of reasoning. If the author of the story chooses to emphasize certain facts and to /repeat/ them several times it is usually becauase he wants you to reach a certain conclusion. The author is a clever arguer. :)

Let's pick this apart, are the first two points really indicative that the gate is something no human in the story could ever achive?

The first - Zorian managed to build a pretty nice robot/golem with ... what? A few years of training? If you had someone train this skill for a ridiculous amount of time you could probably build something like the Guardian. Heck, in the real world you can build a chat bot with the same kind of interactivity. If anything, this would be easier in the world of MoL (mind magic, anyone?).

The second? There is this thing about the gate only activating every 400 years, and ideally only during a specific time where it is easiest to do so. Maybe the time in between is required for recharging? Remember, the thing is located pretty deep in the Hole which provides more power than everyone in the city could possibly use. The gate may need more power than that, but it's also better located and can keep charging for 400 years.

The other points are similar. In the world of MoL, if you had enough time (and we are talking about some agency which built something that looks like a time loop...) building something like the gate starts to look a lot more possible... as for obtaining enough time? Necromancers can apparently make themselves immortal, and if you can make a pocket universe you can have essentially arbitrary temporal distortion. Given these facts it's very difficult to rule out the possibility that the gods are really just human mages who successfully cheated the system.

***** The time may be needed for recharging to a certain degree, but mainly it's just using amplification effect for the dimensionalism magic. You can activate the gate at any time, but you would get significantly lower amount of restarts, if any at all. One month offset has cut down this number by an order of magnitude.

But the Gate /was not/ designed with the Hole in mind. It was functioning on another continent and was moved to the Hole /only/ because Tesen 'donated' it to the crown. It just was moved to a pre-existing top secret governmental facility. It was there for no more than just 15 years. Before that it was residing in Noveda coffers for centuries.

The problem with human cheaters theory is that there are no other signs of cheating. The gate is a breakthrough in dimensionalism, soul magic, mind magic and so on. Yet there are no signs of those breakthroughs bleeding into respective fields. Like I said, if the Gate was made by a necromancer, it would not waste millions of souls erasing them in each restart. It would collect them into a soul well and harvest mana for the necromancer to use. To put it another way, if the maker was not a god before the Gate's creation, he would certainly become one with such power.

****** I missed the part about the gate being moved to its current location, you are right this means that there has to be some sort of external power supply. There are also more meta level arguments against the gods being essentially human - such as the author stating that D&D was a huge inspiration.

Still, my thinking is that there are a lot of potential cheat codes built into the world of MoL. In fact, you are outlining one possibility in your own post.

As for potential breakthroughs not bleeding into their respective fields, didn't the Ikosian empire cease to exist before the story started? If this part of the story is realistic in any way, then that happened at the end of a long cultural decline. And who knows what came before that?

One thing that always bugs me about fantasy stories with functional magic is that it makes things too easy. Look at how fast the industrialization took off in reality. Magic would have made that /simpler/ (and more volatile). Who knows how often some things have been invented and forgotten over the years? Now add in some characters who are effectively immortal and you get a very volatile mixture - I'm reasonably sure that there are plenty of important events in the backstory that we (and the characters) know nothing about...

I'm not saying that this is my preferred theory or anything like that. I just wanted to say that we don't have enough actual knowledge about things that are /strictly/ impossible to rule out all alternatives.

******* I disagree re: industrialisation.

The world of MoL is still a giant collection of walled communities. Knowledge is hoarded and hidden, only rarely being shared fully. The academy is shown as a very recent thing. Their society just isn't set up well for knowledge sharing.

Most of the advantage of the loop is the looper being able to trick, steal or buy spell knowledge from other people a thousand times over.

Even the teachers only share their best knowledge with students who've become their apprentice.

Their entire society is structured so as to reinforce those restrictions. Despite duplication of books being quick and easy such libraries are rate and those that exist have multiple levels of access with the lions share of powerful magic kept from the majority and the government bans even knowing about many branches of magic.

It's also implied that these kinds of restrictions are somewhat justified. A few dozen nutters with access to the right knowledge can summon one of the elder gods from the dungeon dimensions and potentially destroy entire countries.

If knowledge was shared as freely as it is in our world then, yes, there would be a massive magical industrial revolution (or possibly the end of the world as every cultist can suddenly find the instructions for destroying cities)

The problem with DtRR was... well... lack of proper in-universe evidence. Damien is undoubtedly the biggest gun on the wall and personally I'm inclined to believe he will appear in some fashion.

Before the inner workings and restrictions of the loop were revealed, it was possible to assume that Daimen activated the loop using some awesome magical ruins of Ikosian awesomeness and that activation also pulled Zach in. Now we have evidence that only one person can be the initial controller. As Daimen has no reason to bring Zach in the loop, he can't be the controller. If Zach is the controller, it is not possible for Daimen to be brought in the loop. I mean it's technically possible, but it would require Zach seeking out Daimen (and remember, he is in some jungle, pretty far away from civilization and Cyoria) in the first 5 years of looping and then telling him about the loop and then Daimen mindraping Zach.

******* You've been thinking Daimen might have mind mage powers too? I imagine they'd be much weaker than Zorian's, enough to give him a little bit of an edge over others without the negative side effects Zorian was always getting hit with. And even with that, Daimen would still have to be extremely competent, both to use mental abilities to any useful degree and skillful enough at normal magic to have impressed almost all his instructors. Of course, that means Zorian would have an even better reason to hate him as well, since in that case Daimen should have been able to tell that Zorian's empathic powers were the cause of a lot of Zorian's problems, and Daimen never did anything at all to help him.

I do think this chapter has made Daimen as RR a bit more unlikely, but since the possible candidate pool is still so shallow, I haven't completely eliminated him. But Daimen shouldn't have any grudge against Cyoria, and RR does seem to have spent too much effort helping the Ibasans for it just to have been a distraction for Zach.

I'd like to know if they can grant the temporary marker to the same people multiple times, or if both Zorian and Zach could stagger temporary markers on the same person to keep them around longer than 6 months. It would make a lot of stuff a lot easier for them.

*********** Actually, I put a bit more thought into it while pulling weeds. If island-teleporting across the ocean is at all possible, there's probably an established route.

It is impractical for an individual to manually travel to islands with nothing of interest, just to familiarize themselves with the location for a few hours. But either governments or private trading enterprises would heavily invest in having at least a few mages who could make the trip across continents in a day or two instead of waiting however long it takes by airship. While it's true an individual mage can't transport much in the way of personnel or material goods, using a method like Zorian does for Kael's notebooks, they can transport a massive amount of information, plus, there might be times where moving a couple people across the ocean very quickly is all that a business or government needs. Initially, they would only need to have a few mages who can complete the route, because at that point it would only take those mages a week or so to each train another couple mages on the route.

So if such a route exists, Zach and Zorian would just have to pay/bribe a mage who knows the Miasina route the equivalent of a few thousand dollars to teach it to them as well.

In accordance to the Guardian's words, there's 967 past iterations and 52 future ones. For the sake of neatness, I will presume it didn't count the current one. That makes 1020 iterations in total, which equals to exactly 85 Earthly years.

Now, Shutur-Tarana, possibly the first time traveler, supposedly spent eleven lifetimes looping.^{ch.33} If we assume that 85 years is 'a lifetime', planar alignment amplifies dimensional magic by a factor of eleven, at minimum. No wonder Quatach-Ichl deemed it a great time to summon an eldritch abomination from beyond.

- Mind stealing knowledge. All of it.
- Black boxes and time accelerated training. Especially given how easy it was to find. Just hop in with as much food as possible close to the end of the loop and stay in there until the end / starvation-suicide.

...and these are just things that could have been done /before/ this chapter. After the revalations of this chapter...

- Mini-marker anyone you can convince to help you out and train train train.
- Find the keys and figure out how to speedrun acquire them and use them to restart the looping mechanic on the /actual/ alignment.
- Make use of Zach's brute force to mind-read everyone, since you are no longer worried about being found by RR.

  Soul sight is one of the rituals one would tackle first, most innate skills seem to not require much mana anyways. (and if this is really a concern, I'm sure there are rituals to increase his total mana pool.

  Enhancement rituals often have large drawbacks, especially if done incorrectly... and they are easy to do incorrectly. No, using the time loop to save scum doesn't make that irrelevant - Zorian hates dying, especially in a horrible, painful fashion. Also, many of them esentially turn the mage into a magical creature, and thus force them to spent their mana to maintain their enhancements. Hardly something a mana-conscious mage would be crazy about. Finally, most of those enhancements wouldn't carry over to other restarts, and require lengthy and dangerous procedures to apply, making them relatively unappealing to Zorian.

  Well he certainly wasn't pressed for time at the moment, Zorian had to admit. "I suppose that makes sense," he said.

Increasing the cap artificially after that point messes up the mage's shaping skills with no hope of ever regaining them.

Although thinking about it, he should be interrogating the Ibasian mages more for secret knowledge. They're bound to have some fun spells. Now he knows how to stop Sudomir he should be doing him. His knowledge would likely be immensely valuable. That would also be entirely within his morality. Working out how his anti alchemy wards work say would be very useful, or how to make that dragon troll transformation potion.

The reasonings just aren't fully explained in the story. I can't wait for when he releases his worldbuilding documents though.

Here's an interesting thought, special / innate abilities seem to be tied to a caster's life force instead of their regular mana reserves. Would it be possible to get use a mana boost ritual and shunt all that extra power, which your soul can't handle, directly into an special ability / innate power (potentially sacrificial) ritual? The extra, unstable, mana would thus be put directly into your lifeforce to sustain the ability instead? Just a thought, I'll probably should just ask on the Patreon page later instead.

Mana is useful because it's turned by your soul to be easy to use. It doesn't really matter where you put it, it's not going to be very useful unless your soul turns it to personal mana. You can just carry around crystallized mana for spells and such which don't need personal mana.

#+end_quote

I suspect that you can't do that. Originally I was thinking of the alignment as /powering/ the loop, and being further away meant less power, which might have meant that you could retry with more power at the peak.

But that's not actually what the Guardian said. It said that activating the loop early "made everything more costly, causing the time loop to degrade far more rapidly".

So it sounds to me like the significance of the planar alignment is to make dimensional magic cheaper, thus allowing you to get far more iterations from the same amount of power. Presumably that power was collected during the intervening 400 years. However it is obtained, I'm pretty sure it's all being consumed in the current loop (unfortunately in a wasteful fashion due to the early start).

On another hand, this timeloop seems to be unique in more ways than one: 1. multiple marked people inside, 2. still working after a Controller exited it, 3. activated earlier than supposed, 4. coincides with a summoning of a Primordial (which at least is coded into the loop as an early-reset trigger).

** There must be a reason that so much effort was expended to give a person an entire world as a playground. A quest, upon exiting the loop. To find out the quest, I think we should question what we know about Red Robe, the most informed person shown thus far.

RR probably found out about the loop and mindfucked Zach for all he knew. RR couldn't do the truly smart thing and turn Zach into a vegetable without risking the integrity of the loop, so he erased as much as he could, which is why Zach doesn't know anything he should about the time loop.

If we reexamine what we know of Red Robe's actions, the fact that he is fully aware of the gate's mechanics means spending time helping the invasion must serve a purpose when he exits the loop. If that's true, then it makes narrative sense that this quest is somehow about the invasion, more specifically, the release of the primordial, as it too is tied to the planar convergence. Add to that the fact that while RR helping the invasion is the first interaction the reader has with him, its actually the last thing he does in the loop before he gtfo due to fear of additional time travellers. He was so scared of this despite the high likelihood that feeding the invaders information and gradually improving it is an obvious tell that he was a time traveller to any other sufficiently intelligent person and especially to Zach (which raises the question: how didn't Zach notice that even with his foreknowledge they were always one step ahead of him? Was he being continually mindfucked with?).

Assuming the quest is related to the primordial, to me there are three possibilities:

1. The quest is either unknown or irrelevant to RR, and he is intending to help the invasion for his own reasons once he exits the gate.

2. The quest is to stop the primordial. It seems a bit too straightforward, but it would make sense given what we know so far. Less straightforward is that RR was aiding the invasion in order to infiltrate it completely, and he intends to quickly and completely dismantle it once he leaves the loop. It's a bit of a reach, but perhaps in order to supplant Zach as the loop's sole beneficiary then RR would also have take up its associated quest, or risk the wrath of the Maker.

3. The quest is, in fact, to ensure the release of the primordial, and RR is intending to do just that. This could make sense as a quest given to Zach's if we consider his backstory, which gives him ample reason to hate the establishment, but doesn't really fit Zach's temperament, which is why I think it strengthens the likelyhood of my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4d88fl/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_51_out_of_control/d1omer4?context=3][earlier theory]].

*** No matter how much I am amused by the rebellious simulacrum idea I'd have to say that the easiest explanation is probably the best.

The distinction between the Maker and the Controller suggests that the Maker doesn't need the Sovereign Gate for himself. Other than gods and godlike mythological figures I don't see anyone who would hand out tickets to SG.

Which brings me to the reason why Zach is the controller. The gods simply may be thinking in narratives too much. Zach is the chosen one because it makes up a cool story for him to be the chosen one. I don't believe he was tasked with assisting the release of the primordial. This goes against his character. Stopping the primordial OTOH is the perfect thing for Zach to do: the noble good-spitited heir yadda yadda wronged by his caretaker, performs a great feat and restores order in the kingdom, huzzah (Yes, I think gods amuse themselves by writing shitty fanfiction and making it a reality). Stopping a primordial is also something gods would want since they imprisoned it in the first place.

The next unexplained fact is that the Gate was activated under sub-optimal conditions. 1 month prior to the alignment cuts down its charge substantially. Perhaps the invasion simply forced the Maker's hand. Remember, divination works in the original world, therefore a primordial escape could have been predicted and SG activated as a countermeasure.

How does RR get into the loop? Well, we probably have the answer: /"[Zach] really meant it when you said you went to just about everyone with the [time travel] story."/ Zach told the wrong person, and with the amount of cranium rats and even cultist double agents lurking in the city this ended up badly. The specifics of the encounter could vary but if we keep it simple we get something like this: Year 5 or so of looping, Zach tells a cultist about the time loop and the impending invasion. The cultist pretends to believe him and maybe somehow manages to convince Zach to give him the temporary mark despite the boy's moral objections. For example he could lie and pretend to be terminally ill. "It doesn't matter if I die in the loop, I'll die in the real world in 2 months anyway. With this mark we can beat the invasion, though. Come on, pal, trust me." The cultist then has 6 months to prepare his betrayal. He drugs Zach and uses mind magic to pull the information from the boy's mind (we know he can do this), and then erases Zach's knowledge about the loop. He can't get rid of him entirely though because Zach's soul is the only real one in the loop, ejecting him would shut down SG entirely.

Red Robe doesn't have the Zach's marker, he uses a modified guest marker and therefore was unable to use the tracking ritual. This explains how Zorian is still alive. Presumably RR attacked Zach to use his marker as an input for the search but he failed. RR being lower tier cultist would explain his mediocre magic, would explain the way the Lich treated him, would explain his dedication to the invaders.

#+begin_quote
  how didn't Zach notice that even with his foreknowledge they were always one step ahead of him?
#+end_quote

He did not notice they were 1 step ahead of him because they were 10 steps ahead. Zach's strategy of choice was direct "1 on 1 me scrub" with the Lich. He would be unable to win this fight even against the original non-buffed version of the invasion.

**** I've thought about it overnight and I agree that a simulacrum is unlikely given the last 2 chapters, mostly because it would be anti-climatic. Zach exits the gate and assumes the body which his simulacrum had just recently possessed, end of story? Nah.

However, I think that Zach telling everyone about the loop would definitely have taken place after he was already found and mindwhiped by RR. Why? Because the alternative is that the maker/agent sent Zach in completely unprepared. Additionally, why would RR stop at selective amnesia? Why not instill some form of control on him as well, mindfuck him so that he's never a problem again? This guy is smart; he wouldn't leave the only remaining threat a viable one.

So whatever imperative Zach was sent in with is no longer there, which completely changes his motivations. Speculating on that is moot, for now.

They can't both be initial controllers because it is explicitly stated so.

That leaves the only option of RR being the passenger.

Yes, Zach was indeed sent unprepared because SG /is the preparation/. It's the perfect training ground. Plus he was probably instructed how to use the marker and all that briefly before entering the gate. So not completely unprepared.

As for Zach's motivations, Zorian had interacted with Zach before the loop and his character is consistent. He always was extroverted, friendly and optimistic. Another thing is that Zach mentioned that he had this feeling that he had to stop the invasion. Whether this is a mindfuck placed by RR or a remnant of his initial convictions that RR failed to completely erase is a question, but I think it's the latter.

There's a break in the causal link in that case. If Zach was aware that he was going into a time loop and was taught how to operate it, he wouldn't be going around telling everyone about the time loop.

** I was contemplating the behavior of the Guardian, and how convenient it was, and I had a Fridge Brilliance realisation.

The Guardian is currently operating outside its designed parameters, due to the presence of multiple recognisable Controller markers; yet rather than crashing, or wiping the protagonists, or randomly persisting a different Controller each time, it helpfully /added/ Zorian to the awareness of the loop. And when RR left, instead of erasing everything as he expected, the Guardian recognised the remaining presence of Controllers and kept the loop running.

At first, this seemed suspiciously convenient for the story. Why would the Guardian's broken behavior, like Zorian's broken marker, be conveniently broken in a helpful way? First rule of rational fiction in the sidebar, "Nothing happens solely because the plot requires it." But then I realised something. /Of course/ the failure mode in this case was to loop both Controllers, because /it was designed to handle multiple markers all along/! One Controller and an arbitrary number of lesser markers.

It's probably doing something like this:

INSERT INTO gate VALUES ( SELECT soul FROM copy_world WHERE marker IS NOT NULL ); TRUNCATE copy_world;

Ie grab everyone who has a valid marker, of either kind. Of course, only one Controller is supposed to exist, but this logic would continue to work for multiple Controllers.

And then it would do the check that caused the loop to persist after RR left:

if (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gate WHERE marker == 'Controller') > 0: create_copy_world()

There are still indications that the Guardian retains a direct reference to the original Controller soul, for the purpose of activating contingencies, because it treats Zach differently to Zorian. So the 'has the Controller left?' check /could/ have been implemented differently. But doing it this way is quite reasonable too.

Alternatively, if (as Kael once suggested) the difference is purely because Zorian's marker is broken - ie the loop ought to be resetting when Zorian dies - and if, as chapter 55 indicated, the Guardian doesn't seem to know anything about who is who beyond what marker they carry, then the abovementioned 'controller has left' check, which keeps the loop alive when one Controller has left and another remained, is perhaps the most logical implementation.

** Does it not bothers anyone that zorian might be a broken lesser marker that zach accidentally placed? Thats means that zorian might have a good chance of being wipe even if they managed to find all five keys and get out. Zorian marker is not complete. However theres one loophole in this time loop, which is memory transfer. Proven by the matriarch that memories and soul are link. if zach indeed left the time loop, maybe zorian could piggyback the same way the matriarch did.

"Some more variation of that question confirmed that the guardian had no idea when red robe left. /The Controller left, but didn't actually leave, and the guardian was hopelessly confused about the whole thing/" - Isn't this like a massive clue as to red robe identity?

It is stated throughout the questioning that there could only be one controller and yet red robe exist and was able to exit from the the time loop. This might be the biggest clue yet for the Dark Zach (Red-Robe) Theory. Whats more was that the Time loop iteration have a major deficit, perhaps the soul damage caused by the lich took dam long time to heal and for zach and Dark Zach might had recovered earlier than zach and zorian to learn the abilities of the time loop.

Meanwhile still itching for the world-building post. I super excited for it! God i love the world in the story!!

After rereading, I think you're right. The Guardian said that the marker can be placed by the Key, or by the Maker, or its agents. So the Key doesn't simply designate its holder as the Maker. It just allows them to "gain sufficient authorization to reopen the gate."

Perhaps the ability to un-bar the gate with the Key is a failsafe. We know that the Maker wisely included a lot of contingencies in the Guardian's design. Maybe the Key is meant for unforeseen contingencies, so that with enough effort, the Controller can still get out if something went wrong.

Given that the whole point of barring the Gate was to prevent smuggling of copies, I wonder whether the Guardian puts extra scrutiny on a Controller who is un-barring it. Eg checking whether their exit requires replacement of an original...that could become another challenge.

"The conclusion he settled on was that he needed some time to calm down and come to terms with what happened. Think up a new way forward. He would probably end up just wandering around the country for a restart or two. Or maybe a dozen restarts."

This was just after the end of Arc One. It is a bit different this time because he knows exactly how many loops are left before the time loop self-destructs, but Zorian also knew at the end of Arc One that the time loop was degrading due to the Matriarchs message. Zorian seems to be only prone to "sticking his nose to the grindstone" only after he has developed a good plan forward.

For the most part, yes. Discounting innate magical abilities for a moment, one's shaping ability determines how big and sophisticated your magic can get. Having huge mana reserves means nothing if you can't control them well enough. That's why Zach got as good at shaping as he did - he had to in order to cast higher ranked combat spells.

I feel like there's either a contradiction here or Xvim is laboring under a misunderstanding of Zach's mana reserves.

Basically Zach is really good at shaping or else he wouldn't be where he is, but Xvim expects a standard of perfection that Zach can't achieve, given the impediment of his mana reserves.

And nothing that Xvim criticized Zach was impossible for him to achieve. Just because Zach's shaping skills are good enough for what he wants them for doesn't mean they're honed to perfection. Zach feels Xvim's demands are just pointless perfectionism with no real-world application, though. And could very well be correct about that, but good luck convincing Xvim.

Having read up on content-validity bias a little, I'm not really sure how it applies to this situation. Xvim isn't judging Zach according to some static criteria - his test is specifically tailored to Zach and deliberately designed to be hard. He continually adjusted the test to be harder as Zach demonstrated better and better shaping skills, and intentionally homed in on what he perceived to be the boy's weaknesses. It's unfair by design.

And no, this is not a good way to teach/test people, but it's how Xvim does things. There is a reason why virtually all students avoid him.

Like nobody103 wrote, shaping skills are a good indicator of general magical skill. The test isn't unfair because Zach's innate disadvantage due to larger mana reserves, it's unfair because Xvim will always increase the difficulty to determine the actual limitations of any mage's skill. He's shown that he has a variety of ways to do this, so even a mage with a lower natural mana capacity and higher innate shaping skills wouldn't be able to satisfy his testing. He'd just throw in more distractions, or ask them to perform a different shaping skill until he found one they weren't competent in. If he could somehow test himself in the same way, he'd probably still be unable to meet his own demands. Actually, that might be the sort of thing he does for fun.
