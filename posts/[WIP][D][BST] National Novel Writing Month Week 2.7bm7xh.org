This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]], which starts November 1st.

- Want to check in on making some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?
- Just need to vent about your story?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

** Just passed the 15,000 mark today, and I'm realizing that I'm going to need a lot more than 50,000 words (or even the 64,000 I'm on track for) to finish up my outline. For context, I'm working on the same book I started in NaNo of 2015 and continued in NaNo of 2016 - against the NaNo RAW, I know.

So I'm about 135,000 words into my plot, and it feels like I'm only now tipping over the peak and on my way down. I.e., half way through. I've already gone through Part 1 and Part 2 and cut about 20,000 words, and I don't write a ton of filler to begin with. I think this book is just destined to be real damn long.

** I have a couple of other projects on the go at the moment (completing an Esperanto course, proofreading With This Ring), so not taking time for NaNoWriMo this month, but I'm considering trying it in another month. Anyone's thoughts on which plot idea to run with?

1) Alternative story set in Mother of Learning universe. This is one I'd quite like to do, but I'm not sure about the writing format. MoL is so carefully planned out that I'd hesitate to follow it with any kind of rush job.

2) Filling in one of the many untold stories from the Obernewtyn series. There's surprisingly little on ff.net, and what there is is quite short. Maybe explore how the world gets rebuilt afterward, maybe write something from before their apocalypse.

3) What if the physics of The Skylark of Space were slightly more realistic, resulting in the abrupt deaths of the protagonists /and/ the villain when their respective spaceships promptly crushed them into goo with massive acceleration? They left behind technical details of what they actually built, but what would a lowly engineer actually do with a substance that can turn a teaspoonful of copper into an atomic-scale bomb?

**** My MoL idea was very much about necromancy, actually, on Oreina (since a giant freezer seems like a perfect place to keep zombies). I don't want to say /too/ much, obviously, but it sounds like you might find it interesting.

Not sure what world building the author will still do, although I think there will be blog posts on soul and blood magic.

****** :D That's funny because I'm normally the one proofreading for other people. But I'll keep the offer in mind, thanks.

With This Ring has proofreaders?

**** It's written in a forum. Every reader is potentially a proofreader, and the author welcomes it.

But I'm also doing a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/9466662/][full proofread from the start]].

** I have managed my word count every day, but just barely, and I know there'll be a day or two later in the month when I can't write, so any advice on creating more words in a day would be welcome. It's not that I'm short of time, juts that I start to lose focus and everything feels stale about 1500 words in every day. Of course that could be because it IS stale, but I'm going to worry about quality next month...
