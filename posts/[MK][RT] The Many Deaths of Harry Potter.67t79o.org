  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.]]
#+end_quote

I first found this fanfic a few days ago, over on [[/r/HPfanfiction]], and having not found any mention of it in this subreddit, I decided I'd give it a plug.

The larger Wizarding World (including Dumbledore) remains about as irrational and opaque as it was in the canon Potterverse. However, Voldemort has received a major competence boost, controlling a larger organization of Death Eaters and making more intelligent use of his resources. Harry's only advantage is that every time he dies, he "wakes up" in the past, with another chance to escape Voldemort's frequent assassination attempts.

The story quality drops off over time as it clings to the stations of canon, but the earlier chapters are extremely enjoyable, and the story is rife with munchkinism throughout, as Harry learns to survive against ostensibly-stronger opponents.


** If we're going to have a repeating Harry, then here are my modest contributions:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]] - Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all. This is basically pure depression fuel, just to give a warning. Not nightmare, depression fuel just to be very clear.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh God Not Again!]] - So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN. Basically the anti-Sisyphus and recommended to be read for anyone who needs help coping with the previous recommendation.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] - The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. An endlessly looping Harry who turns to Voldemort out of desperation to stop the time loops.

- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] - A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again. Where it's Severus and Hermione stuck in a time loop and their relationship subverts fanfiction expectations in a novel way.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] - At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field.

I have a few other stories about Harry traveling back in time, but I specifically only posted time looping stories.

Wait, is that where the "If I break the time turner, will it trap the entire castle in an endlessly repeating loop of Thursdays?" line in HPMOR came from?

*** I remember "Oh God Not Again!" really rubbing me the wrong way. It's fine when it's just being a crackfick, but sometimes it tries to have more serious moments, which at best feel like a pointless diversion from the wacky hi-jinks, and at worst feel like the author unsubtly pausing the narrative to air their grievances with canon.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is good, with a bit of suspension of disbelief, Sisyphus is just a short, rather good piece and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh God Not Again!]] is a classic of HP fanfiction - good execution. Still, that being said nowadays I think that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] has the best execution when it comes to the time travelling concept.

**** I loved 'Getting the Hang of Thursdays', although when I first read it I didn't realise there were two endings and thought the story was incredibly depressing.

** My favorite Harry potter time travel fanfic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]: Harry has been in a time loop for a very long time, trying to defeat a much more powerful Voldemort before he causes the apocalypse, but this time something new happens...

Almost complete departure from canon storyline, featuring great worldbuilding and a journey to Atlantis.

*** I read most of it, but eventually I wasn't enjoying it enough to continue. Harry is moody, violent, womanising, and I'm not really a Harry/Fleur fan. Last I knew the sequel was in progress?

** Seeing as this has become a Harry Potter time travel fanfic recommendation thread, I figured I'd offer up /the/ quintessential Peggy Sue fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past.]] Most people are likely to know about this, seeing as it's the most popular Harry Potter fanfic on the site (the only thing more popular than HPMOR), but it's worth mentioning for those who haven't. It's not /completely/ rational, nor is it a crackfic, but it's still a very well-written Harry Potter fanfic.

Due warning: it's unfinished, and hasn't been updated in about a year and a half. The author updated his blog in January to say he's back to working on it, but there are still long gaps between updates, and he's working on another fanfic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2731239/1/Team-8][Team 8,]] which is also the most popular Naruto fanfic on the site) simultaneously.
