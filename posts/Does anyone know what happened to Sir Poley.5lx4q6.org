What happened to Sir Poley? Is he still alive? I just found out that he has his own forums. When I looked in the HPN20 section no one was talking about HPN20, and no one was using english. It did seem like they were all talking about a variety of drugs though, in russian i think? All the threads were about drugs. No one was talking about HPN20. WTF?

:(


** Mod here - for future reference, this kind of post would be better off in the weekly off-topic thread.

** Judging by his [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/5loink/alright_lets_have_a_look_at_the_populoh/dbxf1ig/][most recent comment]] (from yesterday), he's been sucked into Dwarf Fortress. This is death to a fic.

In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/59kpxu/what_is_the_most_original_harry_potter_fanfiction/d99akjc/][another comment]] from a couple of months ago, he mentions that he "hope[s] to get back to it one day". So, while he seems to be alive and well, I wouldn't be too optimistic about a HPN20 return in the near future.

** He went off to make a game and never came back, the drugs stuff may just be that they found a nice empty forum for their illicit activity. Sadly we probably won't ever see him finish that story.

*** What authority do you have to demand that Sir Poley do anything?

If you're going to ping him, at least be encouraging.

Sir Poley, if you read this, I really enjoyed your characters and story in HP and the Natural 20. I think you had a great thing going, and would love to read more! If you want to get back into it, but need help that I can give (Editing? Amateur LaTex typesetting? Amateur web hosting/site development? Fact checking against canon/HPMOR? A few bucks?), then please reach out - I would be happy to contribute. If you've moved on, then thank you for the laughs, smiles, and memories.

**** As much authority, and seriousness, as anyone randomly yelling about stuff on the internet.

These things are not serious business. I thought the triple-exclamation-marks would have made that obvious.

Sorry, I missed that cue. Honestly, I didn't see that there were multiple exclamation points. No sarcasm here. Argh, this is just making it worse.

****** Well I've added a few more exclamation points and a one, so hopefully that further reduces ambiguity ;p
