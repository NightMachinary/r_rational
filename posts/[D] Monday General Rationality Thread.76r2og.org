Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

** So I've been looking into designing a tabletop card game lately and I'm curious about what the [[/r/rational]] community thinks make good aspects of game design. A recent trend I've seen in gaming has been towards the extremely complex which I've enjoyed because it's a departure from the overly simplistic boardgames I grew up with like Monopoly where there isn't as much way to play the game mechanically consistently and succeed as a result.

The general model I'm looking at is a 1v4 game in which one player is making all the decisions for the dungeon that the larger party is exploring. Drawing from a single resource mana pool, the dungeon creates new rooms, spawns monsters, and tries to kill the invaders by modifying the monsters with evolution cards and equipping them with loot that the adventurers can steal.

The adventuring party on the other hand has a mechanic for fostering conflict within the party. Each player draws three secret goal cards that can affect party play and is competing to be the first to finish those goals and escape the dungeon. Some examples of this are things along the lines of Plague in your village: Escape the dungeon with three health potions to treat the epidemic affecting your village. Avenge your family: Kill five of the hideous goblins that murdered your family.

Would this be the sort of thing that would interest you in a card game? If not then what suggestions for improving gameplay or mechanics would you propose? I'm interested in seeing what you all think!

*** It's a neat idea, kind of reminds me of Munchkin, but you need to avoid the same pitfalls as that game did. It's fun the first few times, but you eventually get bored of how it always devolves into all the other players screwing over the one who's closest to victory until they run out of cards.

The immediate question I have is why players would keep their goals a secret for each other? It's not like they wouldn't want any help with their objectives. If it's more interesting when they keep secrets, you need to incentivize that behavior. Competitive co-op has been done well before, I suggest looking into examples.

I've heard the Bloodborne card game pulls it off well and there are subreddits dedicated to board game design that you can ask around.

**** Yeah I've definitely taken a lot of inspiration from Munchkin in the way that the adventurers develop and become more powerful. The idea itself came out of reading The Bound Dungeon and realizing that games dealing with dungeon management haven't ever really done the idea justice.

I think the secretive nature of the goals would actually add a lot to the competitiveness. Originally when I was thinking about it, it was just going to be the dungeon versus the adventurers, but I realized that wouldn't really make for as much fun from a competitive standpoint. A lot of the goal cards I have in mind will be things that are counterproductive to effective party play. For instance, collecting potions and trying to escape with them limits the amount of healing for everyone in the group and could cause intense conflict when everyone knows that you have been drawing a lot from the consumables treasure pile, but are refusing to help someone for whatever reason. Also, I think I'm going to make it so that only half of the adventurers can leave the dungeon or that there's a turn limit to escaping so that it will add tension to escaping.

I've also toyed with the idea of allowing people to draw more goal cards and assigning each one a point value, but I don't know if that would add more to the mechanic or just be an unnecessary complication.

Taking a healing potion out of the dungeon could be worth +100 points for anyone but only one player knows that and could trade other players to get it.

The simplest way to ensure this is to make some of the goals distinctly anti-social (example - the player on your right once stole your drink at a bar. Your aim is to ensure that he does not leave the dungeon alive.)

People who get such goals have strong incentive to lie about their goals, making such information unreliable at best.

***** Further down the line, like if I release the game and also release expansions, I want to make goal decks specific to the different adventurer classes. For instance, the Thief class might have a goal card that says that you want to murder another member of a party, but that would be completely out of character and setting for the Healer class. The support role classes especially are the ones I'm having difficulty balancing because they need efficient party play to work which is exactly what I'm trying to discourage.

*** Avid boardgamer here.

The overlord mechanic is a common one (Descent etc) but unfortunately it translates very badly into fun. Someone has to play the Dungeon Master; this means extra rules, an extra playstyle someone has to learn, it removes the DM player from the other players - in my group we've always had trouble even finding a DM! An easily exectuable ranomization mechanism like drawing from a deck that still provides adequate difficulty is hard, but worth it.

My No. 1 Rule of boardgame design is crispness. Clean rules. Its very tempting to add a thousand extra rules and exceptions to your game, eg. for simulation purposes, but ultimately they distract from the game. Someone has to remember them or look them up.

2) Having good tooltips and design conducive to gameplay are a huge part of learning the game. I always reference Vlaada Chvatil games from Chzech Boardgame Edition for this. In "Galaxy Trucker" you build spaceships from a multitude of parts. The function of the part can at least partially derived/described by its form/colour.

[[https://imgur.com/a/sgcTx]]

If its green, it uses energy, If its brown, it has to do with engines, if its pink its doing something with weapons. There are extra cards for each round you put on the board. Reminders of the most common events printed everywhere etc.

Or take "Galaxy Trucker" - they basically invent a whole new symbolic language that serves as a reminder. [[http://www.pixelpark.co.nz/images/categories/RaceGalaxy980.jpg]] No text on most cards! And on the cards where they do something new and use non-standard symbols, in the very low right corner an explanation text.

Even just printing cards for each person with the turn order and on the back the available actions is worth a lot.

/ahem/ I have strong opinions on boardgame design.

**** I appreciate the mechanical advice! That's definitely the area I'm least competent in. I've been consulting with a friend who is super interested in game theory and bouncing ideas off of him, but the more people I talk to the more refined the ideas get!

The issue that I have with a randomization element is that it takes away a lot of the intelligent opposition factor from gameplay. My example for this would be Sentinels of the Multiverse. On he surface it seems like an interesting game, but it quickly becomes very stale because of the limitation imposed by there being no shifting and evolving strategy because the opponent is fixed in the ways that they respond. I think what sets my idea apart from some of the other overlord style games is that the conflict won't only be Dungeon vs. Adventurers, but also Adventurers vs. Adventurers which could incentivize some interesting behavior from the dungeon player.

It's definitely feasible that playing the Dungeon will be something that not as many people will be interested in, but I think it's also necessary to have an intelligent opponent trying to divide the group. One of the ways I want to keep the dungeon side of gameplay both crisp and interesting is by having there only be one resource pool to draw from, but a variety of choices to make in how you grow that resource pool.

The mana pool will dictate everything about what the dungeon can buy: rooms, monsters, and modifications, but it will also grow depending on what each set of players does. Whenever a monster is killed, the mana cost of the monster will be completely refunded to the dungeon minus whatever evolutionary mods have been put on it, but for every turn it remains alive, the dungeon gets half the base mana cost back. So the adventuring party is incentivized to kill the monsters as fast as possible to prevent the dungeon from building up to much mana. Also, certain rooms would have mana pools that also add to mana production to make another type of key room.

In regards to the card design, I completely agree. The design needs to be as crisp and intuitive as the gameplay is. I think by sticking to the theme, hopefully the gameplay will be fairly easily understood. There's a couple graphic designers I know who I've been talking to about card design that I may end up pulling onto this project should it end up going anywhere.

*** I don't know if this is helpful, but the thing that makes Monopoly "complex" is the interactions between people. You're right in the fact that Monopoly, by itself, is quite simple. But when you add the human interaction and possible house rules on how trades and borrowing from the bank works you get all of the complexity of human trading and economics with very simple mechanics.

With that idea, you could try going that route, much like Settlers of Catan, where the mechanics are very simple but the mechanics force human interaction and trading or negotiation, which ramps up the complexity immensely while keeping the act of learning the game vey easy and approachable.

**** Totally! The human interaction in the trading and negotiating is what keeps Monopoly an interesting game despite the variety of board games that are now out there. What frustrates me about it however is that if the people you are playing with are out to get you from the beginning (as my friends tend to be when I play monopoly with them) then there isn't a way that you can win just by playing well mechanically.

Settlers of Catan is similar in that the human element of trading and trying to undermine the person in the lead is important, but its key difference from Monopoly is that you can win despite everyone being against you with sufficient skill and some luck.

I still want the human element of competition of the haggling and backstabbing which is why I'm trying to make it not just a strict 1v4, but also encouraging the inter-party strife.

*** Sounds cool to me!

Things that pop out to me:

-Tabletop Layout. For the sake of simplicity, presumably the rooms will just be square pieces that are set down on the table. Because it's a dungeon, after all - if you want both branching paths and permanence, you probably have to lay out tiles o' dungeon (though you could sacrifice those things). This means the rooms have to not take up much space - it can't be like DnD where you're moving around on a grid punching orcs on specific squares. Maybe the rooms could have a couple subdivisions, and you could put character and monster tokens on the map.

-Combat. You don't want the characters to be doing the same thing every time. On the other hand, you need simplicity for this to be a good game. On the third hand, if you're playing a swordsman, you don't want to have to draw the card "Hit them with the sword" to be able to hit people with the sword. So in combat, you want people (and monsters) to have access to some things they can always do, and some other things they have to spend resources to do. But that's sort of a DnD / Sentinels of the multiverse mindset. You might also choose to go with a more Munchkin route, where combat is decided on single comparison of numbers representing overall strength (or a few in a row), and there are some things that give you a permanent bonus to numbers, but also some resources you can spend to get a temporary bonus, and sides take turns spending resources until someone passes or runs out of resources. But this might make things too samey, especially if you want to support a ranged-melee distinction. Depends on how much you want the emphasis to be on the mechanical play of combat I guess.

-Making optimal play also fun play. In a realistic 1v4, the optimal play is almost always to take out one person first. But this is precisely zero fun for the person who gets targeted and then has to play dead. As a dungeon, killing adventurers is your goal, so it can't be too rare or being the dungeon sucks. Maybe when one adventurer gets killed, or discouraged, or even gets what they want and leaves, another takes their place, leading to a more roguelike feel? Or maybe the party share some sort of morale resource, which the dungeon can deplete by winning combats, so when they lose it's all at once.

If they're discovering loot in the dungeon, somehow you have to make it optimal for the dungeon to give them loot that is fun for them to play with!

-puzzles and traps. Classic dungeon elements! Breaks up the monotony of all combat all the time. Other events include resting, trading, and skill checks (if you have such a thing).

This is basically right, you'd be surprised how receptive people are to the dangers of democracy and progressivism, how much more eagerly they'll accept our views on the jewish question than you'd ever think. The internet is perfect for redpilling en-masse. You've already got people self-segregating by ideology, fandoms, etc, so it's easy to tailor specific messages to specific groups. I can semi-reliably redpill mainstream conservatives and libertarians on counter-semitism and race realism given what they think is an environment of civil debate, and leftists are generally very easy to convince that democracy is an abject failure, for example - just agree with them for the wrong reasons. The difference between us and our enemies is that any we recognise any ideological goals and principles can only reliably be accomplished after winning, so that should be the only non-negotiable principle, the sole hill to die on.

*** IIRC they call themselves the /Dark/ Enlightenment in direct contrast to the Enlightenment, which they think is a mistake and which they are trying to roll back. If it had been called the Endarkenment for some reason, then they'd be the Light Endarkenment, and if it had been the Doggishment, then they'd be the Catdoggishment. They aren't really looking at it any deeper than that.

*** Re: darkenlightenment, normally I'd be concerned about the radicalization of insular groups, but these guys are so ridiculously authoritarian/racist/sexist that they can't feasibly get much worse. So I prefer that they quarantine themselves, where the trend towards radicalizatiom will actually make them less likely to pull in outsiders.

  I'm not so confident. I don't think this is just a congregation of all the radicals who were already around, I think these are relatively young people who have been radicalized and are encouraged to radicalize others. I'm worried that Nazis are growing in number.

This is basically right, you'd be surprised how receptive people are to the dangers of democracy and progressivism, how much more eagerly they'll accept our views on the jewish question than you'd ever think. The internet is perfect for redpilling en-masse. You've already got people self-segregating by ideology, fandoms, etc, so it's easy to tailor specific messages to specific groups. I can semi-reliably redpill mainstream conservatives and libertarians on counter-semitism and race realism given what they think is an environment of civil debate, and leftists are generally very easy to convince that democracy is an abject failure, for example - just agree with them for the wrong reasons. The difference between us and our enemies is that any we recognise any ideological goals and principles can only reliably be accomplished after winning, so that should be the only non-negotiable principle, the sole hill to die on.

***** Eh, he's overestimating his own influence. Political groups do that a lot-- they ban all dissent, then take the lack of dissent as proof that they're popular. Yeah, they'll get the occasional convert, but they don't account for all the people who leave their ideology because, again, dissent is banned, so they don't realize it. And people /do/ leave radical ideologies all the time-- look at how much the KKK has shrunk over the past few decades.

To respond frankly, I'm not surprised at all. Antisemitism never really went away (did we even expect it to?), and besides, /merely ordinary/ right-neoliberal groups have been pushing "the Dangers of Democracy and Progressivism" /so fucking hard/ these past 20 years or so that they're actually pretty cliche.

What nobody's been spending on is defending the principles of /democracy and personal freedom/ as actual, affirmative goods.

*** Hey.

First of all, I hope that this problem has already been solved for you in the best possible way, but if not, I'm happy to give my own perspective; just, you know, realize that I'm a random person on the internet.

I had a pretty long stint where I didn't have work, and I was able, to a certain point, keep busy, but it was often not very satisfying how I was keeping busy, even when I was writing or trying to learn coding.

However, I did eventually get a job, unfortunately I had become, in many ways lazy, and I was concerned about that. I was also concerned about my job as it was undefined and the parts that were defined were not things that I had explicitly done before. It also was not a very lucrative job, but it was a job (minimum wage in California).

In terms of how to approach it; I would recommend reveling in the idea of learning and getting better. As you are part of this sub-reddit I assume that learning and understanding is something you find value in.

Maybe your job will be totally devoid of learning anything interesting or cool, although I kinda doubt that, but then, instead, learn about other areas, learn about those around you, and if things are still unsatisfying, create a plan where you can take that money, save it or invest, and find a better place to be.

For me, personally, my job was very cool to me but very challenging. I worked the first 23 days straight; I made friends with people that went on to do much greater things (at the time they were not in a very influential position and now they are).

There's a lot, in my opinion, to be excited about in regards to a job.

It also helps that if your financial situation is such that the job will prevent you from eating beans out of a can with some tapatio.

Best of luck.

**** Did you read the description of their ideology on the sidebar for that sub?

#+begin_quote
  Secular progressivism is the memetic descendent of Puritan Calvinism. Blasphemy, inquisition, indoctrination, and brainwashing still occur from the perspective of the progressive religion. Therefore, progressive culture is referred to as “the Cathedral”. The Cathedral consists of influential people in politics, journalism, academia and education acting in an uncoordinated manner to advance progressive principles in society; often deceptively. We do not imply conspiracies.

  Hierarchies are a natural consequence of innate differences and are necessary for societies to function. Stratified outcomes alone are not enough to prove discrimination or a failure of "social justice". There is no "social justice," only traditional justice.

That's just the first two Common Ideas, and they come after a specific mention of [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Racialism][race realism]]. This is not a community interested in debating morality or promoting a view that discourages absolutism. These are racists who have rationalized their prejudice with fake science and conspiracy theories.
