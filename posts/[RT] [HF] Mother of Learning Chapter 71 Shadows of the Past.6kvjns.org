** This was the smoothest chapter of the last several. The fewest amount of typos, the prose felt good, the characters were more alive, the tensions were believable. I'm not sure what changed, but I really enjoyed the overall quality of this chapter a lot more than a few previous ones. Is this just me?

If it isn't, what's the reason? Wasn't this chapter delayed a week? Maybe [[/u/nobody103]] should take the extra week of editing more often. Anyway, whatever it was, I hope it continues!

**** Besides the focus on character interaction, it was... oddly nostalgic.

We have Daimen finally meeting his family, having some uncomfortable truths revealed about him, and Zorian admitting that he was wrong about him.

We have Taiven finally returning, and kind of restarting their friendship, resolving old issues between them.

I'd say it was a somewhat special chapter, as it went back in more ways than one.

***** I'd like to think my [[#s][review]] in c69 begging for more time loop character development had some sway! (excerpt in spoiler)

But judging by how fitting Taiven's date acceptance was and knowing the author loves throwing Chekhov's guns everywhere, I'm betting it was planned in advance.

These kinds of chapters are what drew me into MoL in the first place. If I had to explain, it's probably the appeal of using a time loop in a wholesome way to gradually understand people on a level deeper than you could if you only had one chance - who hasn't fantasized about a redo for a chat, a meeting, or even whole years of life? And of course, it's been a pleasure following Zorian the sourpuss as he repairs relationships and achieves some measure of self-actualization.

July 2nd - Chapter 71 (4 weeks since previous chapter, a week of delay)

June 4th - Chapter 70 (4 weeks since previous chapter, a week of delay)

May 7th - Chapter 69 (2 weeks and 4 days since previous chapter, 3 days ahead of 3-week interval making up the Chapter 68 delay)

April 19th - Chapter 68

So as you can see, I was correct in saying the last two chapters were also delayed.

*** All the chapters are good but yeah I did appreciate there being fewer typos and stuff actually happening and characters developing. Some chapters are consumed by huge battles which don't actually progress the story much because even if something is learned after, obviously most of the results of the actual battle don't carry over to the next chapter. Zorian's relationships with those around him leave an effect on him so it's something that's permanent.

**** Huh, I've actually been liking his way of describing fight scenes, so far.

In many other stories I often find myself criticising the style in which fights are being described --- as well as the actual events themselves happening during the fights. Here, the underlying magical system feels well-balanced for powering fight scenes, and the actions [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry][(or inactions)]] of the combatants aren't deliberately made stupid for the sake of plot-railroading, etc.

If you know any stories that manage to present even better fights than MoL does, can you please drop them as recommendations? I really like myself some good fight scenes. ._.

***** Well it's a completely different style of fantasy but I think the best fights I've read are the ones in Joe Abercrombie's books. Both the trilogy and the standalones have really fluid fight scenes.

In a more puply vein, I also enjoyed the fight scenes in Will Wight's Traveler's Gate series. THe rest of the writings quality is... debatable.

Shot-in-the-dark hypothesis: He's trying to use rituals/potions/blood magic to make himself less of a failure of a mage, causing bouts of rage as a side effect. This resulted in his anger at Daimen (or maybe he interrupted a ritual) and the pushing of whatshername.

But we know that Fortov's pretty terrible at alchemy, and blood magic is rare enough that it's also very unlikely. Rituals are a possibility though, I guess. Doubt it, but it's possible. Also possible that Fortov has similar expertise in alchemy to Zach's, being an expert in a few specific areas but lacking general knowledge and expertise.

I'm skeptical of blood magic as it's both rare and extreme. Potions from an source, though? Maybe. Fortov may have something similar to ADHD, so his difficulties may be a deep and consuming part of his life.

A crappy mage with his only skill being his ability to socialize. Who has suffered living in Damien's shadow as much or more than Zorian. His hostile response probably made sense in Zorian's mind and he felt no need to pursue it.

  "The gods originally gave souls to living beings in order to record their thoughts and forms, so that their lives may be preserved after death and their deeds properly judged in the afterlife," Batak said. "For that reason, the gods, who had intimate knowledge of how souls worked, were capable of many miraculous things. So long as they had access to a person's soul, they could bring them back to life, even if their bodies had been reduced to ash and scattered into the winds. They could peer into their soul to examine their entire life from the moment they were born. They could restore a person's youth by regressing their forms to the state they once possessed. According to some stories, they could even create an identical copy of a person, indistinguishable from the original in every way."

*** haha yeah I've definitely been looking forward to that too. Soul Magic in general is definitely one area where Zorian has some major levelups left to get and Silverlake was introduced as one of the people who might help with that.

It's pretty clear that the Silverlake arc can't be completed until Zach & Zorian figure out how to cleanly kill the grey hunter, so reading the recent chapter about them fighting it (and still losing) was pretty exciting. I'm kinda surprised they haven't figured it out yet. You'd think a high powered gun or something would let them do it.

Given the difficulty of and general lateness-in-the-story of getting Silverlake's help, my bet is on Silverlake being the one to /finally/ provide Zorian with a way to get Soul Sight that doesn't require waiting 15 years outside the loop. Soul Sight really seems like something that any respectable archmage should get as it unlocks an /entire new branch/ of rare and powerful magic.

** There's nothing in the current chapter that points to this, but there's a theory I've been playing around with since going through a complete reread. I haven't seen this idea floating around, and wanted to discuss it.

Red Robe is the original time traveler, not Zach.

This would explain why the time loop was started a month prior to the solstice, rather than at the solstice when it would be most efficient. If the time loop were started by Red Robe, he would naturally start it early, so that he could optimize the invasion prior to the solstice and the priomordial-unleashing ritual.

This theory isn't perfect by any means. Quatach-Ichl seems unaware of the time loop and dismissive of Red Robe, when we see them near each other in Chapter 26. As an expert on dimensional magic, as evidenced by his design of the Ibasan gate, I would expect him to be involved with the Sovereign Gate. It also requires additional details to explain how Zach became attached to the time loop.

Zach also starts each loop in his bed which would be a strange place to start if you initiated the loop intentionally.

The reason why I say Zach may not necessarily be a direct heir (though I do lean in that direction) is because the Gate could have come into his family's possession in any number of ways. To give just one example, perhaps Zach's ancestors were friends with the last heir and before the last heir died, he decided to give the Gate to the Novedas rather than let the government take custody.

*** Unlikely, for the same reasons as mentioned repeatedly in the story. Zach never experienced a premature restart ending without his death before the early invasion (bar a few occasions where being assassinated is equally likely but unconfirmed), and he has a more complete version of the marker than Zorian has. If Red Robe had the same kind of marker, he could have easily tracked both Zorian and Zach with a similar ritual as the one Zorian learned from Alanic, and he could have immediately confirmed that there was just one new time traveler, and not the dozens of members of the Aranea colony. There would also have been essentially no reason to keep Zach as intact and free as he was, or to even include him in the time loop at all, if he wasn't related. And why would the Noveda hold an Imperial artifact like the Sovereign Gate in their treasury in the first place, if they weren't from the lineage of the First Emperor?

The most likely scenario is the stated one. Zach is the original time traveler, who eventually encountered Red Robe. Red Robe found a way to tag along, and pressed Zach for all the information he knew about the time loop. Red Robe then removed Zach's memory of the early restarts, of all time loop-related information, as well as of any encounters he may have had with Red Robe, and placed sanctions on his mind to distract him from thinking certain things.

Zach would have never been involved in the time loop if he weren't the original time traveler. And the reason the Imperial artifacts respond to him better than Zorian is probably because Zach's lineage traces directly to the First Emperor, which would also explain why he was the one chosen for the time loop.

**** Most of those depend on the particulars of how the time loop interacts with the marker, which we don't know yet. Regarding the premature restarts, it would depend on how the loop decides that it needs to restart. It could be either "No Marked individuals are alive." or "A Marked individual has died." In the latter case, if Red Robe has a complete marker, either Zach's death or Red Robe's death could restart the loop, but Red Robe had not died prematurely.

Similarly, the tracking ritual may fail due to minor issues as well. It tracks all copies of the reference object, not all copies of the marker. When Zorian's fragmented marker is used as the reference, it finds those fragments as part of the complete marker. When Red Robe's complete marker is used as a reference, it does not find Zorian's fragmented marker, because it is looking for a complete copy. This is completely untested, but would fit with how the ritual is described.

As to why Zach exists, I could imagine him as an intentionally antagonistic creation. That is, Red Robe creating one additional time traveler in order to throw a wrench in plans, in order to test them against unforeseen circumstances. We know that the invaders have additional allies in summoned demons outside the loop, and so a deliberate random element is a useful thing for testing. Alternatively, Red Robe may be a cultist-Zach who created an ensouled protagonist-simulacrum-Zach in order to take care of mundane duties. I'm iffy on why Zach exists if Red Robe is the original, and don't have a good answer for it.

I'm not convinced that ownership of Imperial artifacts has any major information content. Given the Splinter Wars, I would be surprised if major artifacts weren't scattered around.

Thank you for the critique. I am not entirely sold on the idea of Red Robe being the original, so I wanted to get more eyes on it. It explains the timing of the loop with the invasion, but raises other issues.

**** For the moment I'm still going with RR being a Veyers who is merged/possessed by a far older entity that actually had knowledge of the Gate prior to the 1 month early activation of the loops. I've been running with "a fire elemental/spirit from the result of the ritual to activate his Boranova bloodline".

But for some reason he himself wasn't capable of gaining the original Controller marker, so had to allow Zach to be the true Controller, but still had some method of faking the marker or entering the loop.

The timing of Veyer's disappearance is too coincidental, and the fact that despite all of Zorian and Zach's efforts, he was impossible to find means that it wasn't simple either. If he was dead or killed or soulkilled, they still probably should have been able to find some evidence unless there was heavy warding done or a pocket dimension involved.

One of the rules the Guardian gave was that 2 Controller markers were impossible. They couldn't be given inside the loop by the normal method, only by whatever stroke of luck Zorian had with the Lich's attack. Outside the loop they could be given by either the Maker or one of its Agents, but that would delete/override the former Controller Marker.

RR is the specialist mage the invasion is using for dimensionalism, and is responsible for creating the ritual to free the primordial. However, at some point he realized that he was in a pocket dimension b/c of something Zach did. Then, he befriends Zach, and gets one of the deranged invader-aligned soul mages (either Sudomir or Quatach-Ichl) to alter his soul and give him the stamp. He wipes zach, leaving the false trails.

Also, RR's "soulkill" ability shouldn't be taken as proof as his prowess with soul magic/as a necromancer, since that was a loop-specific altering spell. On the other hand, his ability to create an apparent simulacra can be taken as evidence to his abilities, and his statement about soul sight (although RR may have been lying and located Zorian through other means.).

**** I don't think Fortov is RR, but ...

I still think the "insta-kill" is more just telling the gate "don't recreate this item on the next restart". There's no reason to suspect that leaving would cause this to happen since we learned from the gate itself that the loop wasn't designed to continue operating after the user leaves. When the user leaves, their soul is copied into their outside world body. There's nothing about that process which tells us whether that would necessarily remove the original soul from the simulation. The simulation isn't expected to keep running so we're already well into areas that the original creators weren't planning for. Frankly it's a testament to the design (and they're just darn lucky) that it's "failing" gracefully enough not to just destroy them.

2. Terminate if the gate no longer senses a marker inside.

Both conditions imply the controller is done with the loop. If the creators never anticipated multiple controllers and if the second condition was used, then we'd get the current situation.

Also, what if the gate simply was not built to sense whether the controller enters or leaves the loop, but rather is built to monitor the health of the marker. We know the loop resets if the gate senses the controller is killed or if the marker experiences damage. I can see it making sense that if RR has a marker and leaves, the gate might not sense anything wrong because it's still sensing a healthy marker inside the gate---the marker belonging to Zach.

Not sure if that's indicative of anything, though. Might be that Zorian's right and Fortov's just being discouraged of looking for him, might be that the changes to Cyoria with the death of the Aranea changes the events enough that Ibery no longer gets pushed down in purple creepers (can't remember if we've heard about it even once since Zorian's been back from Knyazov Dveri).

While finding a way to operate the orb without a marker was not a priority for him and Zach, it would mean a lot for Daimen. He was probably well aware that Zorian had no intention whatsoever of revealing his abilities to Daimen outside the time loop, which would make those control spells absolutely crucial to his mission. Without them, even removing the orb from its resting place would be impossible, greatly complicating everything.

If Zorian does not reveal his abilities to Daimen outside of the time loop, how or why would he reveal the control spells for the orb to him, and what benefit is there for Daimen-inside-the-loop (the instance which knows about Zorian's abilities, no less) to figure out the control spells?

(I suppose this connects to a more general issue: among the people who accept the time loop at face value, why don't we see at least some instances of apathy or at least some degree of similar behavioural adjustment or suspension of long-term plans as they realise that what they are doing is entirely inconsequential?)

** GREAT chapter ! =) Really enjoyed it... was a bit worried because the last few chapter focused so much on the plot progression , and the actual character development seemed to get stuck, but now this chapter changed that again ^{^} please more like it. The way Zorian will interact with old friends and his family after the timeloop is very important so i want to see what he will make with it. The story about Fortov and Ibery, his friendship with the almost forgotten Benisek, Taiven, Akoja (one of the most developed characters but with not much involvement in the plot is actually interesting) ,maybe even a story involving Byrn Ivarin (i doubt it), maybe another story consulting the librarian searching for books (should be very easy to get a high level pass now) etc...

** Was the whole "teach me to control the orb" thing suspicious as hell to anyone else, or is it just me? It seems that learning to control the orb is similar to learning to replicate the effect of having the marker on your soul.

Combined with Daimen's private time with Fortrov and Kiri (and his perpetual mind blank), the whole chapter appears like it's foreshadowing future shenanigans on his part. Daimen is definitely on my radar.

*** lol There are clearly dates. I suspect that "won't write romance" mostly just means that any romance which happens won't become a focus of the story, and we won't be forced to read a ton of dialogue where they talk or agonize over how they feel about each other or what the other one thinks of them.

Which I'm super happy about because Twilight sucked. I wouldn't be surprised if there's still /some/ romance in the sense that we see a date or two, and we're just told in a sentence or two about any relationship status updates there are. It'd include romance in the way that PG-13 movies include sex--it just goes to a shot outside the house with just the bedroom light on after a kiss.

**** Exactly. The romance is unlikely to go far, because Zorian would probably feel that it'd just be torture to develop feelings for someone and then having that person forget all their time together the next day.

By the end of the Raynie arc, it was pretty much obvious that she'd developed feelings for him, since he'd become so reliable and a source of comfort for her. But it's very unlikely that their relationship will be explored further before the time loop ends, unless Zorian decides to actually meet with her clan.

The romance is in an episodal format, and never becomes a primary focus. And it's perfectly fine that way.

She thought they were fighting side by side, protecting each other, until it turned out he was so far above her level that he'd simply sent a copy of himself to protect her.
