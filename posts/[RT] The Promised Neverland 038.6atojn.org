** I got a few theories:

1) Those trees are ents or something and the roots swallowed up the kids. This doesn't seem too likely because not a single one of them managed to yell for help.

2) All the kids spotted some sort of danger that they needed to hide from, so they're all staying hidden until the coast is clear.

3) Diabolus ex Machina

** Horror movie mistake #1: "Let's split up". Both the older kids leaving the young ones without someone to keep the group together. Not even line of sight. The young ones are obviously not mature enough to not "go for a walk" in hostile territory.
