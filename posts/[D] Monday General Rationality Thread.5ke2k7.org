Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

*** I'm sad to say that I mostly just use the standard skeptics toolkit. Is the claim outrageous? -5 truthiness. Is the body behind it notably biased? Are the results hard to measure, or do they deal directly with physical reality. Do the authors support postmodernism?

I'm never getting any real certainty from research papers, outside of very specific fields (we built a room-temperature maser, here it is) but I am getting a lot of evidence.

Take a look at the psychology replication crisis, as an example. I think there are even odds that any given paper is going to be bunk, which are horrible odds for something that's supposed to be pretty solid.

You can find papers that support pretty much any viewpoint. The answer seems to be that you've got to use the rationalist toolbox to asses them. Which sucks massively becouse it's supposed to be more reliable then reason.

Raw data is nice though.

The big sticking point was when I tried to convince him that even if the Evil Spirit Hypothesis posits an evil spirit that acts like a smallpox virus in every manner, it's still better to take that final step of believing that smallpox is caused by viruses and not evil spirits, because even a small mistake like assigning it to the wrong category can lead you to develop other errors along the way, or make it harder to updates your beliefs when it turns out that you were ever-so-slightly wrong about potential vectors or something.)

*** I don't think there is anything that can replace personal experience in the field. Often, there will be particular plots or techniques whose quality can be immediately judged if you know what a typical example looks like, but will be difficult to compare without that knowledge. From outside the field, you can see glaringly poor presentation of data (e.g. different representation of numbers in the same table, switching between stddev and FWHM to mislead a reader), but have a hard time finding honest mistakes (e.g. a poor background model, leading to something erroneously being listed as a peak).

For me, personal relations help quite a bit. I have a number of friends on facebook who will post research papers from their fields that they find interesting. With their approval of the paper, I can focus more on understanding it, trusting that the conclusion is reasonably valid.

This has the interesting side-effect of reducing my perceived reliability of other news sources for research results that I had not heard of before. A research article will get picked up by personal friends if it is interesting and correct, but will get picked up by wider social media if it is interesting, regardless of how correct it is. Therefore, within the fields that are covered by personal friends, pop-sci articles that come out without me hearing of them earlier are likely to be interesting and incorrect. I don't discount them immediately, but they certainly get a greater level of scrutiny.

****** Well experts are going to do the hard work in any field. It's like saying "the people who are competent are the people who are competent".

There are two definitions of expert, as near as I can tell

- Someone accredited

and

- Someone competent

Of course competent people are competent. The problem is that accreditation doesn't seem like a reliable indicator of competence. Of course it's /evidence/ for competence, but not nearly as strong evidence as I'd like. Well actually I think a lot of post-secondary education is a crude stand-in for classism, so it being more accurate would be bad for breaking down classism, but accurate prediction of competence is probably worth that.

Anyway, I digress. The point is simply that I don't feel academic accreditation is a very good indicator of expertise or skill in a /lot/ of fields. It's often counterindicitive, in that I deal with a lot of fresh uni grads that don't know how to make a maintainable code base. And engineering is one of the disciplines that I imagine it's easier to measure peoples competence in.

Presuming that university prepares you similarly in other fields, and that the local universities are anything close to representative of the average, I predict that university only barely prepares people for solving real-world problems. Basically I expect people who do a lot of self-educating to be competent, and university doesn't really indicate whether someone has that tendency. It's a great resource if you make good use of it, but not much more.

** An Ny Mag article on what causes kids to stop believing in Santa [[http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/12/what-makes-kids-stop-believing-in-santa.html][(link)]].

#+begin_quote
  When it comes to evaluating information --- and separating the real from the bullshit --- kids aren't that different from adults, Woolley wrote. Over several studies, she and her colleagues illustrated the similarities between us and our younger counterparts: When learning something new, kids, like adults, take context into account; they measure the information against what they already know; and they consider the source, evaluating its trustworthiness and expertise, before deciding how much to believe.

  The question, then: If children are just as capable of seeing through nonsense, how come we adults have figured out that Santa doesn't exist, while kids still happily wait on line to sit on a jolly guy's lap and throw their energy into composing letters to the North Pole?

*** A. Similar =/= the same The fact that kids use similar methods doesn't automatically mean they're just as good at using them, just like with motor skills. Thus, they make more mistakes and believe more false things.

B. Children have less experience, less total knowledge of the world to sift through. If a baby was born with the same level of rationality as an adult, or if an adult from an alternate universe was warped into ours, they still would believe more false things than a normal adult does because of fewer reference points and general understanding of the universe.

C. One of the important methods of effectively learning in the real world is trust. Nobody has the time nor skill to derive all of science and mathematics and investigate all of history and art from scratch. Instead, many things that you know are learned from other people. Hearing or reading about things is much faster than experimenting for yourself, but carries the disadvantage of sometimes giving false information. The most reliable way of sifting through this is to gather information from multiple sources and weigh them against each other, and believe more strongly information that's provided by multiple sources. Additionally, some sources are more likely to lie than others, so you give more weight to sources that you deem reliable.

Since parents typically have their children's' best interests at heart, they have little incentive to lie, at least about anything important, and they provide an extremely large amount of correct information to their children. Thus children rationally categorize their parents as reliable sources. Thus, when their parents tell them that Santa Claus exists, and all of the adults around them, who are also trustworthy, corroborate this information. And the media tells them it's true, and all of the children around them also believe it, it's entirely rational to conclude that Santa is real. If you leveraged this level of conspiracy against any adult who grew up in some country isolated from the first world, they would believe it too.

When you tell someone the truth all the time and then lie about this one particular thing, they're going to think it's the truth too.

**** On a sidenote for C,

1. I find that the experience of actually going through & deriving Maths & Physics from the base up (as presented in text books) does wonders for your understanding & application, rather than blindly applying the end "short cut formula" derived.

2. I don't know if it's just me, but my science classes generally do have lab sessions to replicate out the experiments.

All in all, not much you can do about Non-Newtonian Physics (like fracking Relativity) though. I also admit that no-one really does the non-basic experiments that's too complicated to practically do.

They learn the basics much faster by simply trusting the teachers, and can gain many skills that way before eventually learning how to do things more rigorously many years later.

And I'm not just referring to "school" knowledge, but just general common sense about how the world works. I'm sure you know what cars do and have ridden in them and perhaps driven one without knowing how to build one from scratch. You probably use lightbulbs and washing machines without inventing them yourself. You probably eat all sorts of foods that you just assume aren't poisonous without having to do your own tests.

** Weekly Monday Update

In an effort to have no more zero weeks (see: zero days), I am now making a post in Monday general threads to catalog personal goings-ons and efforts. From what I've discussed with those on Discord, the post will be great. To that end, if you enjoy these or I don't make one one week, please pester me. It means I'm depressed or don't feel like anyone else enjoys these, and seeing someone care can make a big difference.

If anything I mention here seems interesting, let me know and we can discuss in more detail!

--------------

This week was Christmas, and I'll still be reeling from New Year's next week, so don't expect much.

*Story*

I have come up with what I believe to be a solid idea for a rational Pokemon story. With [[/u/DaystarEld]], [[/u/alexanderwales]], and the help of many of you on Discord, I think I have the underpinnings of a pretty good story! I don't want to go into too much detail on the story, but I can discuss the efforts in worldbuilding. My goal is to create a story first, and then kind of fit the world around it. So I have some main priorities that have to happen to fit the world, and then to have a world which can span from that and still feel like it actually exists. And as DayStar has mentioned in the past, the Pokemon world is full of terrible, terrible inconsistencies. Even the TV show and movies, in my experience, have only shown to keep things more 2-Dimensional. I just can't watch the shows and movies and see people living in those worlds, as they show enough to get me to start to ask questions, but not actually answer the questions either. How do trainers earn money? Can a trainer live in a pokemon world and still not know about Pidgeys by the time they're ten years old?

The plot holes are endless.

** So I wrote an answer to this CYOA: [[https://sli.mg/n1YlMv]] which ended up so long I had to put the full thing in a google doc: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbr8snCia58_2rjyUIn7oa768CS25VI8h1E8lYKWgEE/edit?usp=sharing]]

However I feel I really couldn't do it justice even in a few pages, so I'm actually considering writing a story about it. So I have to ask what some of the problems are with my plans in my answer, and how to improve them. Obviously I left out quite a lot of logistics, but I'm also kind of dubious about part of my plans, for instance how people would react to you suddenly launching hundreds of craft into space in a single day, as well as how well mass threat of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment]] from space would work as a way of forcing world governments to do what you want.\\
Earlier I also dig massive tunnel systems miles underneath the ground using magic, to launch coordinated strikes at the centers of government for a bunch of countries (sticking mostly to countries that don't have powerful allies). However i'm not sure how well that would work, or whether people might notice beforehand.

*** That's pretty good.

An ocean-spanning tunnel still seems like a pretty vast undertaking even with a perfect cutting tool and 90% weight reduction- but if the lizard people have muskets, then they probably have a reasonably advanced civilization, with the potential for an industrial revolution. Rather than trying to conquer them with the cannibals and some tame animals (which I don't think would go well given the technological difference), it might make more sense to sell them technology, found a company recognized by their laws, wait a few decades for them to get the hang of building factories and steam engines, and then use that industrial capacity for the tunneling project. At that point, though, aircraft might be more practical.

I do think that the idea that the island is located on present-day Earth is a big assumption. The island seems to have been constructed from a variety of different worlds and ages. It could exist in the far future, as part of a simulation, or somehow outside of time. That you'd leave the island only to find the rest of the world exactly as you left it seems like one of the less likely possibilities- although, if people and objects from different worlds and times can travel to the island, maybe it is somehow possible to travel to those worlds and times from the island.

My pet theory is that the island is in some other universe along with a bunch of other very crazy islands ("You're on a crazy island" was a popular subgenre at one point, with most examples having more or less the same mechanics). You can escape, possibly, but the odds of getting back to your original universe by chance alone are...not good.

**** See I wanted to use a strategy that could be done in a few years, because the more technology in the outside world gets to advance while i'm prepping the more difficult this sort of world domination scheme becomes.

Yeah the tunneling does seem tricky because of ventilation problems, and if you want to tunnel up to get air you would have to do it on an island and thus go through layers of soil/rock that will let through water, requiring you to constantly pump out water.\\
You know I might end up needing to make some excursions to the outside world early with some sort of "puller" based aircraft low to the water that wouldn't be noticed, I would have a wyvern rest on the craft most of the time, but when adjustments needed to be made (with the craft weighing 10%) the wyvern would replace any other propulsion system. Of course I need to be careful to remain totally secret to maintain the element of surprise. Still the fact that spell allows free energy ought to make a great deal of schemes easier.

As for the island taking place in modern times I think it makes sense to assume there is a great deal of time dilation style effects but i'm not sure any plan is workable without /some/ assumption about how the time effects work. Also keep in mind that most of the stuff on the island supports it being synched up to time normally, and there's nothing from the future as far as I can tell.

As for conquering countries with technologically primitive people, the training here isn't too useful anyway since I have less than ten thousand soldiers. Honestly I'm mostly banking on the element of surprise and the fact I would be tunneling directly into seats of government.\\
Also conquering the people on the island seems like obviously the easiest way to utilize them, they are preindustrial and thus probably pretty religious, so I can almost certainly leverage that by appearing to have godlike power, not so sure how well it would work with the lizardmen but it would definitely work with the cannibals.

Also as for wyverns/wolves being tame animals, i'm not so sure that applies to the wyverns: it says they can tear through the massive thick shells of titan hermit crabs like paper mache, also adult wyverns have a wingspan over 100ft based on my estimates (they can pick up dire wolves like mice). My point is their bodies are probably made of supernaturally tough material to allow them to claw through stuff that easily, and to just support their bodies. So I think it's probable that they can withstand small arms fire at the very least. Dire wolves can also grow to insane sizes so they similarly seem likely to be made of super tough materials.

IMO, of course, but I think your current story outline suffers from that particular type of Mary Sue-ism when everything in the universe works out exactly the way you want \ expect it to. For instance, this bit:

#+begin_quote
  Making objects immovable is also a great way of blocking off entrances, all you need is a sheet. If you cast it while moving a object you could also make it keep it's relative momentum which can be used to crush enemies to death in enclosed spaces and even use it to tunnel through solid rock.
#+end_quote

upon which you're later on essentially building most of your success and further solutions, established several major universe mechanics laws that were not mentioned in the original CYOA image:

1. that something that was originally distributed with the expectation to be used only as party tricks could be used as such a powerful weapon and tool (even if it was made in some Bioshock-type sub-verse);
2. that making an object immovable would mean essentially freezing its velocity \ momentum, and not, say, making it nailed in place in a specific (caster's?) frame of reference;
3. that the phenomenon which the pamphlet's author described as object immovability also essentially makes it indestructible (for instance compared to more commonly “known” form of immovability whereupon you freeze something up and are then free to start dishing out abuse at it at your leisure).
4. etc

You're free to choose to expand the canon's rules in your favour as much as possible, of course, but then the story becomes boring because most of the difficulty and conflict from the original setting disappear.

That all being said, I'm not too familiar with these one-image CYOAs and how the community around them expects them to work, so maybe making them as easy as possible /is/ the purpose, and your rendition on this one is actually doing rather swellingly despite my ministrations.

**** I'm just going with the rules as written interpretation that I think makes most sense. For instance since there's no absolute reference frame, the only way immovability could work is by freezing it's relative speeds. If it instead made it stationary relative to the caster, then you could do all the same tricks by briefly moving the caster as you finished the spell.\\
As for it being indestructible, well you can't cause damage to something if you can't move it, every conceivable form of damage would involve moving the item, remember it doesn't say it holds the item in place, it says /it makes it immovable/.

You could argue I'm not staying in the "spirit" of the CYOA even if i'm following RAW, but that's not really the point of this sort of rational munchkining.

***** Maybe my understanding of physics is incorrect if so please correct me: I think Earth's orbit isn't a straight line. Under your system, when you tried to freeze something in place, it would appear to move to you since it would continue moving in a straight line. It seems unlikely that a spell that makes an object start moving would be stated as making it immovable. Some options that are more likely would be: your planet is the reference frame (so it stops moving when the spell is cast); or there is an absolute reference frame in magic (eg. you're in a simulation that allows magic and the simulation has absolute coordinates).

I assume the spell must work in a way similar to how I describe otherwise the object wouldn't remain stationary from its own reference frame, and as I said in another comment if it uses the reference frame of the caster at the time of casting then it can be exploited in a pretty similar way.

As for a magical reference frame, that idea is pretty untenable. Even if the world's a simulation we can demonstrably see that motion within it works in relativistic ways that make the idea of an absolute reference frame incoherent.

  I said in another comment if it uses the reference frame of the caster at the time of casting then it can be exploited in a pretty similar way.
#+end_quote

I believe you misread my comment. I said to use the reference frame being the planet, not the caster.

#+begin_quote
  Even if the world's a simulation we can demonstrably see that motion within it works in relativistic ways that make the idea of an absolute reference frame incoherent.
#+end_quote

I feel a bit silly asking, but how would you demonstrate this? From my understanding, even if you could demonstrate it's not possible in our world, you can't determine that the simulator's world doesn't have properties that would allow you to simulate in a way we can't.

Objects can feel acceleration and deceleration so if the object didn't appear to keep moving with all the same relative velocities then it would definitely have to feel like it was moving. Though I should have worded that better because obviously it would still be stationary in it's own reference frame even if it was still feeling the effects of movement.

#+begin_quote
  I believe you misread my comment. I said to use the reference frame being the planet, not the caster.
#+end_quote

Right I should have also addressed that example specifically: The planet as a reference frame wouldn't work that well because the planet doesn't actually have a single reference frame. The whole thing spins and as a result different parts move at different speeds, plus the magma that /makes up most of the planets mass/ is constantly moving in convection currents.

I think it makes the most sense if you resolve things such that if you were on/in the object when it was made immovable you wouldn't experience any acceleration/deceleration even slight. The scenario that seems the least arbitrary seems like the one where you can't immediately tell when the spell is cast if you were sealed inside the target object. Idk I just feel like that's the most intuitive schelling point.

Is there a fileformat of that image somewhere that allows you to copy/paste texts from it, change text size, text font, etc? Reading blurry letters that've also been turned into unchangeable graphics isn't very convenient.

*** well, i feel a little like banging my head against the wall. He's just like every intelligent christian apologist, creationist or climate change denier I've ever seen.

First of all, he says that he isnt going to argue against whether people should be effective altruists or not, and then he goes on to do exactly that. He then mentions a slightly inaccurate definition of utilitarianism, puts emphasis on the words "happiness" and "pleasure" in his slightly inaccurate definition as if to imply that utilitarians are hedonists without explicitly making that accusation. Then he explains what consequentialism is and makes it clear that he doesnt agree with either, but then he goes on to explain why he thinks that effective altruism is a bad thing using clearly consequentialist reasoning!

One claim he made is that effective altruism contributes to economic dependency of "developing" countries on the "developed" countries. First of all these dependencies would exist whether money was donated to the developed world or not. Effective altruism does not make these dependencies any more or less likely to go away any time soon.

Secondly, when he talks about economic harm of lost jobs compared to lives saved, he's forgetting that human lives are more important than money, and that the only reason that jobs and economics are important are /because/ they contribute to human life and wellbeing. also, having a job is useless if you and your whole family are DEAD from malaria! And maybe if more people donated money for tents, the business who sold those tents wouldnt have run out of business!

The third claim he makes is that we have a greater obligation to our friends and family or to people right in front of us than to the wider world. Well, if there was someone tied to traintracks and you had a button that you could press to save their lives, and you didnt have to do anything but press that button, and you choose not to press it because you have "a greater obligation to your friends and family", that's just moral laziness. you dont have to sacrifice the needs of your friends and family to press that button, and how near you are geographically to the person tied to the train tracks has nothing to do with that.

Also, it's an unfortante truth that no one can sustainably donate most of their income to help important causes. There is indeed a point where you must prioritize your own and your family's and friends wellbeing above that of a bunch of random strangers, but that is because otherwise you would not be capable of giving sustainably. if you do not take care of yourself, then you are not a sustainable source of income to donate to effective charities and you will save less lives. However, that point is well beyond where Carneades thinks it is. 10% of your income isn't necessarily that much of a sacrifice (dependng on how much you make) and donating what money you can reasonably give effectively is better than not donating it at all, or donating it to whatever gives you the feels instead of what actually does the most good. And if one is not willing to donate that much of their income, how much are they willing to donate exactly? how much does carneades think is the limit to how much of one's income should be spent on effective charities? as far as i can tell he thinks the answer is $0. i think the limit should be /whatever one is able to reasonably give while still being sustainable as a positive net source of good in the world, where good is defined as increase in human well being and decrease in human suffering and death./ nobody is saying that you should donate all your money to effective charities and leave none for yourself. not only will that make you miserable and poorly adjusted, but it will also make it harder to save more lives.

***** welcome. though i doubt it will do much if any good since im preaching to the choir here. the chances that anyone who watched that video will stumble across my rebuttal this far down the page and then change their minds or even consider what I said at all if they didn't already agree or partially agree with me on this seems pretty slim--for the same reason that i doubt a creationist would stumble across a defense of evolutionary biology and consider what it says at all or change their minds. Some positions are so reasonable and accurate that in order to maintain the opposing viewpoint you must either not ever be exposed to any more reasonable perspectives, or use weird motivated reasoning with linguistic loopholes and irrelevant knockdown arguments etc. This is the case for anyone who would defend slavery or who would say that the earth is the center of the solar system or that climate change is a hoax. /Maybe/ there's some sort of evidence that reasonable position is wrong on these things, but if that's the case it's really unlikely that some joe shmoe on youtube has access to super special secret knowledge that the rest of the world does not. Even if he were right, random joe shmoe on youtube does not know that.

**** Thank you for your detailed response. Sorry if this video annoyed you.

I thought it could be used to indicate some ways for improvement of current implementation of effective altruism. I don't think that economic harm from donations is large (it is likely to be the opposite, especially in comparison with positive effects) but it might be worthwhile to study this aspect further.

*** Tried to watch his "Are Faith and Reason Contradictory?" video. Was not impressed. He does the usual thing of playing fast and loose with the definition of "faith" so that he doesn't actually say anything meaningful about it, and so he can claim that reason can't justify its own axioms without faith.

Not a particularly rigorous or analytical thinker, in my view. Sorry: maybe his others are better.

***** The Faith vs Logic/Science argument is one that a lot of supposedly smart people are either really bad at understanding or fairly bad at articulating, so I wasn't particularly surprised that the video failed at it, and I particularly checked it to see if the channel stood out in that regard. I really need to get around to writing my own article on it.

As for good channels, QualiaSoup tends to be well done, and I particularly like their "Burden of Proof" video, especially since so many people, particularly religious apologists, are really bad at understanding it:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KayBys8gaJY&t=1s]]

Another good channel is This Place. They made the "How Does Do Science?" video, which is a great, quick overview of scientific and rational epistemology and why it makes sense:
