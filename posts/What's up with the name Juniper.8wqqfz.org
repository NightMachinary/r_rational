I've never met or heard of a Juniper in real life, but it seems like the name shows up in every web serial. Is the name that popular? Is this some kind of in joke?


** It's in honour of Vilod's special mead.

** Doesn't seem too rare

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper_(given_name)]]

#+begin_quote
  In 2011, Juniper entered the top 1000 list of given names in the United States for the first time and is quickly becoming a popular girls name likely due to the popularity of a wide assortment of well-known fictional works (...)

*** It's likely a fad-name. Here's the [[http://www.babynamewizard.com/voyager#prefix=juniper&sw=both&exact=false][US baby-name data]] on it. The most recent data has it as the 352nd most popular girls name in the US.

** Hm, now that you mention it:

- Main character's name in Worth the Candle.

- Name of a dryad in The Gods Are Bastards.

- Name of an Orc in A Practical Guide To Evil.

Edit: Also the name of a pokemon trainer in Origin of Species.

Am I missing any?

****** I'd say so. If a bunch of stories from the same author use a name a lot it doesn't show that the name is weirdly popular in a certain kind of fiction, it shows that a single person has a (conscious or unconscious) fixation on it. In that case the only person who can be asked for the source of the trend is the author.

Of course there are only two stories sharing an author, making that not the case. On the other hand there seem to be only four stories showing the Juniper trend, so there's not much of a trend in the first place.

**** Juniper is the name of an ocean in The Dark Wizard of Donkerk. 'The Juniper rebellion' was probably named after the ocean but I don't think it says so anywhere

***** This is correct, the Juniper Rebellion is named after the Juniper Ocean. IIRC, it was named the Juniper Rebellion because it happened while the king was abroad, and there was a period of time where he ruled from the waters, but I don't think any of that is explained in the text.

*** Not only where you live, but when you were born. For the same reason you wind up with multiple kids with the same name who wind up in the same class as school, authors of the same generation will be fond of the same name. It's some form of cultural osmosis.

When an individual is seeking a certain name to associate with a particular sort of person, they reach into a basket they share in common with a lot of people.
