This is a concept I often struggle with when reading (especially rational-adjacent) stories that feature time travel, Alt-history, techno-uplift and technology focused isekai.

Is technological progress INEVITABLE? If left to their own devices, humans always going to advance their technology and science, or is our reality just lucky about that?

In fiction, we have several options, all of them heavily explored by rational-adjacent stories:

1. Medieval Stasis: the world is roughly medieval-ish or ancient-ish in its technology, often with no rhyme and reason to it (neighbouring kingdoms could be Iron Age and late Renaissance for example). Holes in tech are often plugged with magic or its equivalents. The technology level is somehow capped, often for tens of thousands of years.
2. Broke Age: the technology is actually in regression, from some mythical Golden Age.
3. Radio to the Romans: technology SEEMS capped, but the isekai/time-traveler hero can boostrap it to Industrial levels in mere years, as if the whole world only waited for him to do so.
4. Instant Singularity: the worlds technology progresses at breakneck pace, ignoring mundane limitations like resource scarcity, logistics, economics, politics and people's desires. Common in Cyberpunk or Post-Cyberpunk stories, and almost mandatory in rationalist fics.
5. Magic vs Technology: oftentimes there is a contrived reason that prevents magic from working in the presence of technology, or vice versa, but often-times there is no justification why people do not pursue both or combine them into Magitec. The only meta-explanation is that it would solve the plot too easily.\\

So what is your take? Is technological progress inevitable? Is halting of progress even possible without some contrived backstory reason?


** Inevitable? No.

Inevitable given certain social conditions, like sufficient food and shelter and safety that people have time to mess about with things; sufficiently large population; sufficient communication that people can talk about the neat things that they found while messing about; sufficient education that people can understand and replicate good results (however they decide to define 'good'); and sufficient resources to spread around newly-discovered Neat Stuff? That's /probably/ yes. (There may be more conditions that I'm missing out on)

*** War is also a factor for rapid progression into technology because it provides more avenues for applications of using stuff. The stuff invested into it can be later diversified into other research areas which repeats itself into more.

The inevitability here is actually guaranteed because there will always be problems and solutions and better solutions to those solutions.

The only conditions where I can see tech progression stopping or slowing down to a level where it doesn't seem to progress at all is when everyone has all they need, no one has greed or suffering or ambition or a sense of adventure or a willingness to want more than they have or in need of some protection against anything or wanting to impress someone or they lose intelligence and become more instinct oriented beings which in case they'll start to evolve biologically. Too many things needed to be constrained to stop it completely from progressing.

But it's still possible to take a backward enough setting which has a limited resource pool to stretch that to a ridiculous slow tech progression.

So it's inevitable yet inevitability itself is relative is what I believe.

As soon as that slows down, technological progress is going to slow way down. If it's human-driven at all by then.

***** I vaguely remember reading 4th hand parables of China having learnt about glass, but it not having caught interest as much as in the west. Supposedly, this was because wine (in Europe) is best appreciated in a glass, whereas tea (in china) is best kept warm in ceramic pottery. This developed infrastructure for glassblowing was then instrumental in a lot of enlightenment age progress.

Just because the stuff is created doesn't imply that it will grow. Take Rome/Greece for example, they were incredibly developed, but that development was largely lost until 2 millenia later.

Now, the development of gunpowder is definitely a step up the technological tree; but there must be further steps up, one cannot just stagnate. And, as for the Rome/Greece case, one needs to be able to maintain records of advances and spread them around so that /everyone/ has them...

** I'd say no, technological progress is not inevitable. There are examples such as isolated human tribes which still exist today such as the Sentinelese who don't seem to have advanced their tools much. In fact, modern humans have existed for tens or hundreds of thousands of years and didn't start agriculture until the last ten thousand or so.

Sometimes useful applications for ideas aren't even thought of. Native Americans used the wheel in toys but had no wheeled vehicles, the ancient Greeks had a sort of steam engine but the train didn't arrive until thousands of years later although that's also probably due to resource scarcity since they didn't have enough coal to power their engines. I'd like the opinion of a historian, but a lot of knowledge was lost after the fall of Rome as well. One example being their formula for concrete.

Isolated families or groups abandon technologies simply because they don't have the critical mass required to maintain them. Sort of like how the Swiss Family Robinson simply don't have enough people to even maintain (let alone build) all that stuff they build in the book.

*** Someone already commented on it, so I'll bring one small addition. The full story is, we don't know exactly how far American Indian technology got in some areas. They didn't work in metal due to an abundance of other useful materials never creating the drive to create the far more energy intensive process. (Basic rule of thumb, a society will ways use the most energy conservative path to produce the goods it needs to maintain the current momentum. Metal working takes far, far more energy and resources to develop than obsidum or flint, which means it's a net loss for your economy for a pretty decent junk of time. The steam engine you mentioned is another grand example of the same thing. The Romans never bothered to develop it because why would they? You can buy a whole cohort of slaves who don't need any special resources or caretakers to do a hundred times the labor for the same cost. Another example, we still use coal power even though Oil, Solar, and Nuclear are far more potent. The economics of cost will ALWAYS determine the path development ultimately takes).

Well, I got off track. Anyways, American Indians didn't leave behind great records of where they were and what they were doing, so it's kind of a mystery. Almost every scrap of civilization that wasn't named Aztec or Inca was decimated by the American Plagues centuries before any Westerner saw them to write them down, and the written records the contacted cultures were destroyed. We know they had advanced trade networks, highly developed math for the Era, HIGHLY developed beaucracies that we're only recently starting to match, land development techniques that in many ways exceed the ones we have now, and finally, they made bulletproof shirts. They're not a very good example of restricted technology because most of the records made of them weren't from a point of natural development.

The American Plagues were horrific. Quite possibly the largest loss of life in human history. It's not extreme at all to suggest that between 1500 to 1600 90%! Of the human populations of the American continents died. (Most recordings dating from that Era and from later contacts with groups not immune to modern diseases show a death rate of 95-98%.) Compare that to the Black Plaugue, which possibly got about 35% of Europe. When the Europeans were contacting the native populations, they were basically interacting with the survivors of century long apocalyptic comditions.

*** I feel like the Sentinelese may just be a few thousand years behind the curve because they didn't hook into the global tech-sharing network, rather than because they're immune to the idea of doing things better. Sure, there's not much difference in the day to day between stone age single-tribe progress rates and 0 progress, but I wager if the rest of the world died off except for the Sentinelese we'd /eventually/ see the descendants of the Sentinelese reinvent all the stuff we have.

As for your examples for useful applications, I caution that you keep an eye out for hidden challenges that may not be evident in the design. You mention coal scarcity, but the Romans may also have faced problems with the material strength of their metals, or bulk production of the necessary metals. You can make a 'steam engine' with the weaker materials you have at the time only to find that they simply aren't up to the task for any meaningful innovation, and so it remains only an idle curiosity.

*** My understanding was that Native Americans had no land animals to pull wheeled vehicles so their use was limited. It wasn't that they were incapable of figuring it out or something like that. I don't know about the Greek steam engine. As for Rome my understanding was that when it fell the Eastern Roman Empire should have still had most if not all technologies. It outlasted the Roman Empire proper for 1000 years, and by the time it failed I don't think it particularly had any technologies over its neighbors to be lost.

** There are three things that, when combined, make technological progress inevitable:

- Proper application of the scientific method
- Reliable, accessible records
- Pressure

As long as you have the first two, you're not going to regress, and pressure will make you go forward.

If a group came to power which compromised one or both of those first two aspects of our society, then absolutely, we could backslide. Modern humans have been around for, what, a hundred thousand years at least? Agriculture has been around for about a tenth of that, and scientific progress didn't really start in earnest until then. If "grow food more efficiently, to free up people to do other things than hunt and gather food" didn't occur to people for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, it doesn't seem obvious to me that technological progress is some biological imperative rather than a cultural value.

** I think there are reasonable possibilities of techno-regression scenarios. Arguably, this is the case in any post-polymath civilization like today's society. There is not a single person on Earth who could build a computer alone from scratch and unaided by modern technology. If there were suddenly a large-scale catastrophe like an enormous solar flare or cosmic phenomena that instantly destroyed the vast majority of electronics on Earth, production lines would instantly shatter and the world would be thrown back centuries as people struggled to adapt. Modern tools and things that are only produce-able with factories (notably things with replaceable parts) would become artifacts that can't be repaired, only patched, and are extremely valuable. Still, this world would by cyclic. Eventually, technological progress would kick off again, probably faster than last time because there are artifacts lying about to reverse engineer and learn from.

As for the Medieval Stasis, I think it's achievable without too much "contrived backstory reason" if you include beings that are immensely powerful without technology such as gods or very powerful beasts. A divine pantheon for example, who maintain their control by projecting force, would be against technology because they're wise enough to know that if left alone, the puny humans could eventually ramp up to an industrial base that shoots nuclear warheads out of a rapid-fire canon at the pillars of their pantheon--something they don't want. Similarly, it's easy to underestimate how much globalization and large-scale work an industrialized society needs. If we had large Kaiju running about or areas of the world that are extraordinarily hostile to life, it's possible that the agricultural base that enables members of a society to specialize could never form due to constant human attrition.

** Of course technological progress isn't inevitable. We have plenty of examples even in our current reality of how technological progress can be halted.

For example, in point 5 you bring up fictions with magical laws that interfere with technology, but there isn't even any need for magic. Just look at dolphins. They are really smart, arguably even sapient creatures. But they live underwater, and water is an extremely hostile environment for the most basic of technology: fire.

Without fire there is no boiling, no melting, no baking, no drying, and no smelting. There is no steam engine. There are no convenient large and stable energy sources to power any technology, because even though there are places that the dolphins could get oil and coal from, they can't actually burn the oil or coal underwater. The simple fact that the dolphins live underwater has pretty much completely halted technological progress for them, no magic required.

If humans had evolved to live underwater (which I imagine could happen if the sea levels\\
of the planet slowly rises until all the land creatures either re-evolve their underwater living organs or go extinct), we too would not have been able to progress technology. We would still have sticks and blades and tribal medicines and some ranged weapons (though water resistance makes them really suck), and various other basic stuff, but that would be it. The vast majority of all human technology depends on fire, and they would all be locked out to the humans of this underwater alternate reality.

** One way to stymie technological progress is to put your story on a planet which lacks the resources. We're pretty sure that humanity could not repeat the industrial revolution from scratch now because all the surface coal and oil has been burned. So unless there was some other massive energy source which could be exploited at low tech levels, you could halt tech progress in your story by just decreeing that cellulose-digesting bacteria evolved hundreds of thousands of years after cellulose-rich life did, rather than hundreds of millions of years after as it did on Earth.

** 1. Medieval Stasis: Sword fights are fun. Guns win against Swords. Gun fights aren't as fun as Sword fights. Magic sword fight is a lot funnier than magic gun fight too. That's all the reason you need. Rationally, there's no reason to be stuck specifically in the medieval-ish (tech wise) setting.
2. Regression to the past is basically impossible. Humans are a diverse bunch, with different triebs. One tribe invents sticks, kills other tribes. All tribes descend from stick tribe. All tribes have sticks. One tribe invents swords... and so on. Mostly, technology progressed as a mean to reach one end. Kill other tribes (instead of tribes, read "nations" or "religions" or "other social group which is not YOUR group"). Technological advance does happen also for other reasons, obviously, like when you get better medicines, better autos and so on. But that too, is a competition, who gets the better auto will keep earning money, the rest may go bankrupt (grossly exaggerated here). Either all humans die, or technology progresses. Or you kill all the scientists, technicians and so on, and also destroy their researches, and all books related to that. That's some carefully planned catastrophe that has no chance to ever happen. If technology progress is stopped you don't have to worry about it anymore, because chances are you're dead. With the rest of humanity.
3. Yeah that's unreasonable. Isekai single-handedly bringing about an industrial revolution? Even though he's basically from the future? Not gonna happen. I know I wouldn't be able to do it, and I know my way around some stuff...
4. Technology Singularity has a chance to happen. Many chances actually. Superintelligent AI, Selfreplicating nanorobots, brain-enhancement drugs/operations/technoshitwizardy, and who knows what else? Chances, that is. The probability of each being maybe a little low, but in many years, who knows if we won't reach one of them.\\
   Already getting people to have a life expectancy of 80+ years instead of the 40ish f 17th century should be considered a start to technological singularity imho. People can learn for 30 fucking years how to be smart and get to contribute to society, and then get something going for 50 years, instead of learning things in 15 years and having only another 15 years to put it into practice! Again, extremely oversimplified, so much that it's almost not true, although it is, but it's not :P. Got you confused? Chances are you have 50 years to figure out what did I mean, instead of 15.
5. This one depends on the rules set by the writer of the story.

- Rowling's Harry Potter simply stated that technology didn't work near magic because of some unspecified "interference", which I read as a Deus-Ex Machina in rule form, if that makes sense. (so either tech or magic, you can't have both)
- Worth the Candle (spoilers) stated that the god of the world (Dungeon Master) probably halted technological advance of the world because of not yet spoken reasons. Given this is a rational rpglit, there's going to be a reason. But it was not an inherent "technology won't go on after a while" thing, but more like a "technology would have progressed normallly, weren't for the interference of Dungeon Master"
- Mother of Learning integrated technology and magic together, and they seemed to be progressing hand in hand at times, while sometimes one or the other got a good discovery in the field that helped itself or the other. They got better magics than their ancestors, and better technology. No Golden Age. There's a bunch of divine artifacts which can not be reproduced by humans, but they're called divine for a reason. One hint: they're not made by humans. THIS is actually what I think a universe would look like if magic in one form or another existed.
- The series Final Fantasy heavily features a "Magitech" theme to it. Not exactly paragons of rationality, those games, but that they got right. If magic was in the world, people wouldn't consider it something separate from the rest of the Laws of Physics. They would incorporate it in everything. There's a floating crystal? Well, heck, let's make a ship out of it and put it in the sky! Fire stones? Get them to heat things. Steam engine? Mh... those fire stones could be useful for that, right? That's the mindset people would have. If magic existed, it wouldn't be magic anymore, it would be simply another set of rules in the universe, coherent with the rest. Just like we don't consider electromagnetism "magic", or gravity. Magic is simply something that doesn't already exist in the universe. As soon as it comes into being, it stops being magic.

In short, Magic and Tech don't cohesist in literature only when the writer already has his/her hands full with the plot and the rules of magic already and can't add another thing to juggle with (tech). Unless they add something to the rules to explain that, though, it's really just not explainable. In that regard, the Rowling did the right thing. Say at the beginning of the story (well, relatively at the beginning, it was in the fourth year that we found out... that's more or less half the story done... o.o) that magic and tech can't marry because they can't. Otherwise... plot hole, or at least "world building hole"

Tangential, but I love how people in MoL think that divine artifacts are always extremely durable and last forever, but in reality that's just a survivorship bias where the only divine artifacts that lasted this long are the ones made to be extremely durable and long-lasting. It took the trope of 'divine artifacts are impossible to destroy' and managed to both subvert it and play it straight at the same time, in a way that looks completely natural in restrospect.

Another tangent, but electricity is pretty much genuine irl magic. It's a fundamental part of our world coursing through nature up to and including violent natural phenomenon. It behaves in mysterious ways that, when properly harnessed, can do wondrous things like create light and sound, cause things to move, or allow telepathic communication. And if you look close enough you find it within every person, an inextricable part of life without which you're nothing but an empty husk. The only thing it's missing is that you can't harness it without tools, but other magic systems do that too.

The evidence that magic would be seen as a mundane technology if it existed is all around us; we already found bonafide magic and integrated it so thoroughly into our conception of science that it became /archetypical/ of science.

That is an interesting dynamic wherein technological progress is seen as akin to deploying nuclear weapons. Everyone can, but chooses not too because of how calamitous the results would likely be. Even if it is in an individual nation's immediate interests to do so, they understand that it would eventually bite them and all of humanity in the backside.

1. [[http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/age-amp-science-do-scientists-make-their-best-discoveries-during][Scientists produce their biggest discoveries and high-impact work early in their careers]]
2. [[https://www.nature.com/news/scientists-can-publish-their-best-work-at-any-age-1.20926][Scientists can produce their best work at any age]]

They don't contradict because the younger you are, the more work you produce. Or, the older you get, the less work you produce. However, the key point is that every piece of work you produce has an equal chance of being your magnus opus. Because this means that a scientist's work doesn't improve over time, or accumulated knowledge does not equate to better outcomes.

If anything we are "wasting resources" on older researchers who hold onto their positions necessarily blocking younger researchers who are able to produce the same quality of work at a faster rate. We're extending the lives of older professors and researchers who fill finite research positions in universities and labs. Increasing age is impeding progress.

******* So to poke holes in what I've said, I took a lot of liberties and conveniently omitted certain factors. In source #2, it discusses a "Q factor" which they find is constant per scientist. Or, the value of an individual doesn't increase over time (which kind of does reinforce that scientists don't improve the value of their research over time).

However, survivorship is a thing. Older researchers are those with a proven track record, those with a high Q factor. When you replace an older researcher with a younger one, you're rolling the dice on the young one's Q factor (and to play devil's advocate to my devil's advocate, you can find a relatively younger researcher with a high(er) Q factor and replace the older one anyhow).

Another factor is that the type of research done by older vs. younger is not clarified. The value they're measuring is citation, or basically how popular what you did is. But who's to say that the type of research a young scientist does is *the same* as what an older researcher does? Each may produce different types of work. If anything, the rule of diversity is probably good to observe if we don't know definitively.

Lastly are the abstract effects of older researchers. Older researchers are heroes who inspire the younger generation. How many younger scientists are inspired by Albert Einstein? Most of Einstein's greatest discoveries were from before he was 30. How many pictures of Einstein do you know of where he's below 50?

Actual history contradicts this. After the Roman Empire fell, almost the entirety of Europe /did/ lose technological knowledge. They couldn't support the prerequisites for the advances which were SOP for the Roman Empire, and over the course of generations of /still/ being unable to support it, they stopped maintaining the knowledge required to rebuild it. (Rationally so, because after a couple generations it was entirely obvious there wouldn't be a replacement any time soon.) The roman roads are the most tangible example, but crop rotation was a much more impactful one; crop rotation disappeared from Europe until it was independently reinvented centuries later. (The reinvention also was the /three/-field system, instead of the /two/-field system Rome used. A superior variant, to be sure, but it was de novo, not an incremental improvement.)

There has never been a /global/ Dark Age (at least, not yet), but most stories don't cover the whole globe, so that doesn't matter.

If the cross-oceanic containerized trade network was severely disrupted, say because Leviathan existed, we would lose the ability to produce /a lot/ of things, because our supply chains are brittle and because we couldn't get the necessary rare earths for most of our computing and other technical equipment, so replacing them would be very difficult. That would be *much* harder to endure and recover from than a mild catastrophe like the destruction of the Internet, and would probably result in a global Dark Age. A similar event once happened: the Bronze Age Collapse, where shipping around the eastern Mediterranean sea and the Black sea was disrupted, leading to the destruction of all civilizations active in the region. Advances could be made eventually, if the raw materials were available to start fresh and re-climb the tech tree, but it would be centuries at least. If fuel was too scarce to power a new Industrial Revolution, possibly millennia.

Sometimes though, I wonder if at some point we'll just... run out of big new things, and innovation will be limited to iterating on ideas we've already achieved.

A fairly basic and believable example of this: it's entirely possible that we never find a way to travel to planets outside our solar system. FTL is impossible, cryogenics doesn't pan out, and generation ships are just fundamentally non-viable.

Many scientists argue that we are in such a slump now. There are several exciting paradigm changing technologies on the horizon, but the price (in money, but also effort and resources) is tremendous.

An easy example: look at Elon Musk. He tries to push for paradigm changing technologies and adventures, but so far, his ideas are yet to bring real profit, and encounter unsurmountable hurdles. If these things were easily acheivable, we would have 100000 Musks all over the globe competing for it.

** I feel like there's an inflection point where rapid technological progress becomes possible because the right tools have been invented. The steam engine, microscopes, printing presses, those kinds of things. Reaching this point is driven by different factors, like

- Population growth necessitating agriculture refinement.
- Economic competition leading to advancements in manufacturing, or inventing new/better products.
- Trade and travel over longer distances needing better methods of travelling and shipping.
- Conflict/war driving the development of weapons.

Of course, there are factors that hamper technological development as well.

- If a people live in a climate that leads to a nomadic lifestyle, or a harsh climate, their energy and resources are spent more towards survival than R&D.
- War could also lead to shifting resources away from scientific development.
- An upper class trying and halt the rise of those under them (who would threaten their power).
- Political persecution of of the "intellectual class" like we saw in China/Cambodia.

And then there's when technology is lost, which is even rarer IMO, and depends on the destruction of a civilization, either from war, disease and/or a natural disaster.

Basically whether technology develops, stagnates or even regresses it depends on which factors align.

*** On the contrary, I strongly suspect that limitations on resources actually hinder technological progress instead of help.

First, less resources means less total population, since there is less food available. Fewer people naturally means fewer ideas. Not to mention shorter expected lifespans due to starvation/war.

Then there's the competition. Which pays off better? Training strength or doing science? Any time/money/effort you invest in technological research is time/money/effort not invested in making your armies stronger. That means you become weaker than your neighbours who ARE investing in becoming better at warfare, and will lose to them in the various competitions for resources and die off.

Indeed someone will always want more, and the others will need to keep up *militarily* or be eliminated. Not technologically. (Technological progress does boost military, but those boosts are neither obvious nor guaranteed. Science is about testing things, and many of those tests will just eat resources without giving any results. To focus on science in such a situation is to literally gamble with the lives of your countrymen.)

****** I think you're significantly underestimating how influential technology is on warfare. It's not just weapons either, it's better manufacturing, better agriculture, better logistics, etc.

The only reason it isn't always the major determining factor is because historically wars have mostly been fought between neighboring countries, and its fairly rare for there to be a huge tech gap between them. Most wars have both sides at a pretty similar level of technology. Whenever there HAVE been wars with a major gap in technology, the side with the tech advantage wins. The colonial era is a great example.

If a nation simply refused to allow technological advancement, they'd be screwed when war eventually broke out with significantly more advanced neighbors. Technological advancement doesn't necessarily require government investment in it at lower tech levels though, it's quite possible to remain at approximately technology parity without any investment until you start getting to the industrial age.

** I would say that technological progress is inevitable. Don't get me wrong, there exist necessary conditions for technological progress, but those conditions inevitably come to exist over a large period of time and a large body of people.

1. I have large problems with this setting. I can accept stasis for hundreds of years or even thousands of years. But tens of thousands? Unless there is a controlling religion (and I don't think any controlling religion would be able to keep such a hold for tens of thousands of years) or divine force that actively impedes progress, technological progress is inevitable.
2. Smaller scale events have occurred in history, such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse][late bronze age collapse]]. But from our current information age, can we regress? Sure. There's plenty of ways. As long as a large portion of the population is killed off (>99%) then a technological regression occurs. e.g. nuclear war, climate change, global pandemic (like covid but airborne and deadlier). In fiction, I wish that authors dived further into the reason why they're in the broken age. But really, I do accept that such a type of event is possible. Especially in the presence of magic.
3. This is just pure fantasy that everyone's dreamed about. Even an eidetic memory genius isekai into king of ruling country wouldn't be able to bring a nation to industrial revolution within their lifetime. Industries take time to create and the market to consume also takes time.
4. The effects of a singularity is hard to predict because there's no real life analogue to compare to. Authors trying to write it are stuck in the pattern of attempting to write a being that's infinitely more intelligent than the writer themself. I truly think of the technological singularity as a being that's, in comparison, a human whereas actual humans have the intelligence of ants.
5. Magitech is just too much work. Yes, people /should/ and /would/ combine magic and technology. But then the author would need to invent an entire society and incorporate society around said magitechs. No, it's just easier to keep them separate.
