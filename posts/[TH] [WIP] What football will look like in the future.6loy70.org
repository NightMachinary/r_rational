** Started off fascinated and intrigued. Slowly...deescalated from there.

It's a fun idea, presented in a really intriguing and unique format, but...at the end of the day, it seems to be a story about football. I've only read about four chapters in, mind you, so I may be wrong, but... [[#s][Spoilers]]

*** This is one of those things I'd use as the first onion-layer in a setting. Show us all the "nothing has changed" future.

Then start peeling off the layers, and show us that the people we've seen are just the particularly conservative folks, and that the rest of the universe is bigger and weirder than we've been shown.

**** ...This would work really well if your protagonist is a fish out of temporal water.

In Transmetropolitan, people who were awoken from cryogenic suspension generally suffered from massive, debilitating culture shock. However, "reservations" are a thing that exists. The government doesn't seem to care all that much about its citizens, but if it did then a pretty quick solution would be to wake up cryosleepers on appropriate reservations and slowly acclimate them to the future.

In a setting without preexisting reservations, these might be set up for the express purpose of helping people to adjust, so our protagonist wakes up, finds that the world is only a little different, and...the onion starts getting peeled back, layer by layer, as quickly as our protagonist can adjust to it.

That's precisely what I was planning it for. Also a kind of multilayered social commentary.

*** Now that some more chapters have come out, it seems like that question of "why has nothing changed?" is an explicit mystery of the story that's going to be addressed, rather than just an aspect that wasn't thought out.

**** It hits on many of the themes found in lots of rational fiction and so far none of the characters have made any actions or decisions that are unjustifiably stupid.

I'd say it could very well be a rational story, though it doesn't seem like it will be a rationalist story. It meets the qualifications listed in the sidebar. It's just really unconventional.

Ten's initial messages to Nine did not make a first impression that seemed intelligent...

  Nine? Can you hear me? If you can, please be patient. I promise that I will answer you. I understand that you might be afraid.
#+end_quote

126 characters to say not much of anything. This does not seem smart. But perhaps psychology was important. After that, though, the second message? Or the third? Ten had 217 days to think about it. But instead seems to have spent about 10 seconds composing it.

****** I agree they didn't pick the best message, but I think part of that can be blamed on the lack of urgency.Time pretty much means nothing to them in the long run. And I get the feeling that she was sending messages like these long before she got her first response.

But yeah ultimately the opening could have been handled better. The author milked it a bit for the sake of dramatics. Though I'd say this one instance doesn't really detract much from the story.

** I found this really interesting towards the beginning when Nine and Ten were first coming into contact, but then it seemed to lose some of what originally made it exciting later on.

One part that did keep my attention was the people trying to collect every autographed Koy Detmer ball; this seems like exactly the kind of thing people would do for fun in a future where everyone is immortal. It sort of reminded me of Alicorn's short story [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/will.shtml][Will]], in the sense that when people have all the time in the world then they have the time to explore every obscure thing that interests them, rather than focusing on things they think are important.

Anything that uses media in creative ways like this is a good thing, though, and I'll probably keep reading to see where it goes!

****** It's a fundamentally flawed model of humanity. People aren't built to be complacent, sooner or later we try for more. It's not impossible for sentient beings to act like that, but unless there's some gene therapy going on that no one mentioned humans can't. To act like they can sours it for me.

******* I mean, I don't think we actually know what humans are like in an environment where all of their needs are met and they live forever and there are never any new generations to shake things up. It's a fairly /bleak/ take on immortality, sure, and you're well within your rights to find that unpleasant to read about, but I don't think we can accuse it of being unrealistic. It's just speculative fiction that is speculating a scenario that doesn't appeal to you. I also don't think it's necessarily true that "people aren't built to be complacent"; there are all kinds of circumstances where people become complacent.
