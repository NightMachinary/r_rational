Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** A mysterious being appears in your dreams, and tells you that it is selecting 10 randomly chosen humans to be its apostles in collecting human followers. Each apostle gains the following abilities:

1. Whenever a human swears an oath of devotion to an apostle, that oath is magically binding. From then on they are magically compelled to obey any command given by the apostle to the best of their ability. The oath of devotion is irrevocable (even the apostle cannot cancel it), and can only be sworn once (a human cannot be devoted to multiple apostles).
2. Dominion over an emotion. When you become an apostle, you must choose an emotion that hasn't been chosen by any other apostle. Henceforth you and your devotees will only be able to feel that emotion, while all other humans are unable to feel that emotion.
3. Whenever an apostle dies, their consciousness takes over the body of one of their devotees (randomly chosen). So an apostle only truly dies if there are no more devotees to take over. But even then they can be revived if someone later swears devotion to them.

​

Note: An oath of devotion can be given to an apostle even if the apostle remains anonymous, the potential devotee just has to identify the apostle indirectly in their oath. For example, they can swear an oath of devotion to the nearest apostle, or to the apostle with dominion over emotion X, or even to the apostle that their friend A has sworn devotion to.

​

By chance, you are the first human this mysterious being has contacted. If you refuse its offer, it will simply find other humans until it has 10 apostles. Do you accept its offer? If so, what emotion do you choose and why?

​

EDIT: It seems the original rules had effects that were too drastic to properly munchkin, so let's make some changes:

1) Total dominion over an emotion takes time. An apostle that chooses an emotion gets only 10% (additive) dominion over it per year. What that means is, if the apostle chooses an emotion like "hate", one year later, all non-devotees will feel 10% less hate whenever they feel hate. And 10 years later, only devotees of the apostle will be able to feel any hate.

2) Apostles and their devotees can feel every emotion except those claimed by other apostles.

3) Whenever an apostle dies (even if there are still devotees to take over), the dominion of the emotion resets to 0%. So an apostle has to stay alive in one body for 10 years in order to gain total dominion over an emotion.

I know this sounds narratively interesting but I suspect it is mentally crippling to everyone involved. I think you've underestimated the role of emotions in normal human behavior. There's evidence that having preferences is inherently emotional, and that having a damaged capacity to experience emotion impairs decision-making.

**** This sounds like one of the more evil mysterious beings.

An apostle chooses happiness. Every human not sworn to them...becomes depressed? Until they and all their followers die?

Fear. Sadness. Awe. Love. Joy. Curiosity. Nostalgia. Grief. Remorse. A desire for change. Complacency. Contentment. Enlightenment.

The only way an apostle exists and humanity still exists is if

1. The apostle says "humanity" or "human" and they get the full complexity of experience - and everyone else loses it until they swear to them. (Humanity is reduced by a current scale factor of several billion.)
2. An apostle meets aliens, and chooses one of their emotions that humans can't feel (already).
3. An apostle makes up an emotion humans don't feel, or finds a way to make the deal without the emotion aspect - just ~immortality + control of those sworn to you (after they become an apostle).
4. Someone manages to come up with an emotion that doesn't exist anymore, or currently exists only in nonhuman animals.

1. Instead of specifying the emotion directly, the apostle uses a condition like one of the ones above or "an emotion which humanity is not reduced without, if any".

**** /Extremely/ crippling, because even the apostles get shafted. The first apostle to get joy/happiness is going to give literally the entire human race depression, the first apostle to take fear is going to give the human race the capability to commit suicide without second guessing themselves to say nothing of the other stuff that happens, etc.

Emotions are basically how we weight decisions: does this make me happy or sad, will this lead to happiness or sadness, how guilty will this make me, how does this affect other peoples emotions, etc. I'd say that it's impossible to make logical decisions without properly working emotions (see: depression, drugs)

As to the prompt: I'd ask whether the being defines joy and happiness as the same thing, and then take it. I'm probably going to horrifically die from compromised decision making, but at least noone is going to take my happiness away. I'd also hope that contentment is covered under that, or that noone thinks to take it.

Another strategy is which emotion would cripple the other apostles to the point that they're incapable of choosing an emotion. Happiness is probably too general to do that, so hope or excitement might cut out large swathes of the populations. That still leaves anger, spite, and hatred as motivations for choosing an emotion, which might not be the best if you're trying to keep yourself as unmodified as possible.

How fast is it? Is it instant, takes real time, or something else?

I'd also use the fact that I have a monopoly on happiness to get the other apostles to swear an oath to me, simply to find out if killing them will end the curse they inflicted on humanity.

It won't, they have total dominion over an emotion, so even killing them and all their devotees won't return that emotion.

Edit: changed the rules so that this now works. Killing all apostles and their devotees will return the emotions to humanity.

*** As others have pointed out, losing emotions is crippling. With that in mind, I choose "Desire to Become an Apostle" as my emotion, ensuring that no one else will accept the deal and humanity can continue mostly unharmed. Hopefully those closest to me take good care of me, thinking I had a stroke or something, but I worry that anyone too motivated to help me will accidentally swear an oath and become another victim.

But let's not think in such absolute terms. Maybe apostles are merely masters of emotion, and while other humans seem muted in comparison, they aren't actually brain damaged. In that case, choosing something like "willingness to work hard" or "intrinsic motivation" seems like a safe bet. Your enemies will have a harder time working against you, your followers will all be effective, and a random person has an incentive to join your slice of the cult because it makes them a more capable human being. And, should you ever be exterminated, there is a decent chance people will accidentally revive you by wishing to be more motivated in the future.

Of course, that selection sort of depends on the human experience requiring intrinsic motivation, which might be a modern development. I'm not sure.

It wouldn't really work, since there are plenty of ways to get the same result using different emotions. Even if you feel no desire to be an apostle, you could feel extreme apathy and just accept because you don't really care one way or another. Or feel impatience and accept because you just want to get things over with. Or feel fear about letting other people become apostles and so accept to be one yourself. Or feel disbelief and say yes to challenge the mysterious being to see if it can really make you an apostle.

Good idea, I've changed the setting so that the dominion over emotions is gradual, so other humans are merely muted in comparison at first. An apostle must stay alive in one body for 10 years before the dominion is complete to the point where other humans are actually incapable of feeling that emotion.

You're probably right. :/

This made me think about what it means to want something. Say I was hungry, and I was going to go buy a sandwich--until I noticed I had no money. In that case, do I want money, or a sandwich, or just to not be hungry? Perhaps I want all three?

If I stole the emotion of "desiring to be an apostle", would people be incapable of wanting be an apostle even to fulfill other goals?

Anyways, the other important thing I should remember is that the absence of desire is not desire of absence.

*** I looked over the list of emotions on Wikipedia. Any of the choices seem like they would resemble brain damage. The least-bad one I could find was interest, but even that would resemble brain damage if you are always interested regardless of appropriateness for that emotion. Should you feel interest in every advertisement you see? Every bit of gossip? Every meme? Every idea or plan? Every drug? There are times when it is reasonable, appropriate, and even necessary to be disinterested to avoid getting dragged into stupid, useless, self-destructive crap.

Depression and anger without reason for it are both studied as psychological disabilities. I suspect that you would be unable to pick any emotion that could be present at all times and not appear to be a form of brain damage.

*** To repeat everyone else, using this for the being's purpose probably can't go well. With that in mind, if I'm limited to things most people would consider emotions (i.e. nothing incredibly specific), the only thing that seems moral would be to pick hate, attempt to direct it at the being, and kill myself immediately to combat its plans. This would still have a huge impact on humanity, but at least I think it would be a change for the better. Now, the other 9 would be likely to ruin the world, but I have to hope that they would also do their best to limit the damage from removing an emotion entirely.

** [Dungeons and Dragons 5e]

I posted in here a little while back about defending the town, but that endeavour was ultimately successful. By turning the enemies on their own siege engines and decapitating the leadership, the opposing army was turned away and the city saved.

Now, we are the effective rulers of a badly damaged city of 8000 people. With the /Fabricate/ spell, I'll finish rebuilding the destroyed houses and walls in about 4 weeks, but that's not a very time-consuming endeavour. I personally have about 4400gp of wealth, and even that is flexible as I can /Creation/ up gold to give to shopkeeps.

I have about 7 weeks of downtime. I can either [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLdgN05CeM1ZTIInmorsBhDkOdz6RIS-/view?usp=sharing][craft magic items]] or alternately [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RavNnZ3eyD6K3Yosz6dph5vZdotORVvThZI8IXaSl3U/edit?usp=sharing][conduct spell research]]. Crafting magic items (according to the existent ones from WotC seems fairly useful, as for instance a Broom of Flying provides permanent non-concentration, non-attunement flying at the cost of one hand used to hold on. On the other hand, conducting spell research /potentially/ has new and incredibly useful effects. In the spell research document above: * I first list out all the spells I have and brief comments on how they can be used. This is probably not useful to you. * I then list out how those spells can be slightly modified or combined for more effective results. This is what I need help with. Given the base spells that I have available, what avenues of research would be most valuable? What creative applications of old spells in combination or with slight alterations could lead to powerful results?

There are two objectives in particular to optimize for. First, at some time during the downtime, I need to destroy a castle. It's filled with Cthulu cultists who are doing bad things to spacetime, so ideally the destruction of the castle also kills all the cultists but I'm okay with a 2% survival rate. This would be trivial but for the fact that my wizard has sworn to do no harm (hit point damage) personally, so it needs to be outsourced to proxies. Second, the next section of the campaign will involve fighting dragons. A lot of dragons. Anything that's optimized specifically towards that is helpful as well.

So yeah, in summary, I have a lot of free time, and I have to either make items or make new spells to let me destroy a castle and fight some dragons. Any ideas?

Unless you're using some weird house rule, precious metals made with [[http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/spells/creation.htm][Creation]] only last one hour, so they're worthless for most purposes other than cheating people. Your idea to use Fabricate should be fine though, as long as you have appropriate raw materials to work with.

Your best munchkiny usage of Creation is probably to create vegetable-based fuel materials, like coal, wood, etc. and burn them. For example, a five-foot cube of coal would weigh about 6,250 lb. You could burn it for about ~85 GJ of energy (~24 MW⋅h), enough to continuously sustain about a megawatt of output if you cast the spell once per day. You could use that to run a lot of smelters, forges, and kilns, allowing the town to produce large quantities of weapons, armor, tools, and pottery at somewhat reduced cost. The 5E SRD doesn't list a cost for wood or coal, but in 3E and PF it's 1 cp for 20 lb. This would make the spell worth about 3.12 gp in terms of money you could save by not needing to import or locally-produce the coal or firewood.

**** Yup, that's right. Creation cheesing supplies for research, etc, out of shopkeeps is fairly doable, but more nuanced cons won't work. Still, with Disguise Self, I can do the transaction with any face I want and get away with it.

I hadn't thought of using Creation to produce coal for fuel. Because I'm an illusionist with Malleable Illusion, I can refresh the coal ash into fresh coal /every round/, so the potential for cheese there is waaayyy higher. If I spent a 6 level slot, I can get a 10 ft cube of coal, or 50,000lbs by your measurement. That's potentially 8000lbs of coal fed into a furnace /a second/, supposing all of it gets burned. What munchkinry is available with that kind of matter throughput?

The main Creation-cheese idea I had was (spoilers if you want to chew on the problem)producing tightly wound up springs and using them to fire projectiles, which according to calcs might hit Mach 15, so definitely in the range of castle-demolishing. More ideas there are always helpful though.

Not exactly, at least not the easily getting away with it part. If you brush into anything or if anyone touches you with an illusion around you, the illusion will 'clip' through. If you use it to change your apparent height, then merely breathing on a cold winter day or in a smoky or dusty environment could also give away the illusion. As a first-level spell, I suspect most merchants would be fairly aware of it and alert to it.

Creation is a higher level spell, so less common, and I doubt most people capable of casting it would use it to cheat people, simply because of the likely consequences. As such, most merchants will probably be less aware of it. However, once a few merchants start having gold coins disappearing, they'll likely start to understand the scheme and refuse large sales until your money has sat for at least an hour. If you cheated people out of enough money, they might even hire specialists to track you down and force you to pay. You can probably get some use out of this, but don't expect that you'll be able to con people out of 5,000 gp without repercussions.

You're right that cheating people out of any significant amount of money with Creation has negative consequences though. Would it be better to try to run many cons quickly so people don't have time to adapt, or use Teleportation Circle to run cons in many towns at once spread out over a long period of time so that it doesn't draw much suspicion?

I've stocked up on techniques to deal with dragons, mostly limiting their 1. Ability to breath weapon, 2. Senses, 3. Ability to flee. With those limited, the first dragon should be possible to fell. From there though, we'll need to keep on pulling new tricks. If these dragons are worth their salt, nothing is going to work twice. Part of why I want to stock up on tricks.

On the other hand, illusions are explosives for socials. If we knew what the dragon in question wanted, we could easily be anyone with the promise of anything at all between the illusion magic I have on hand. And mechanically, the senses that a dragon has aren't different from other senses, things that fool a human with 120ft darkvision and 60ft blindsight and a +12 to Perception will fool a dragon.

for the dragons, 1st suggestion would be a ring or cloak of protection for everyone on your team. the +1 to save is a nice bonus, and everyone will be making wisdom saves vs fear and dex saves vs breath. generally you want to find solutions that help solve those two problems. there is a level 1 reaction spell that will give you resistance, absorb elements (xanathars, p.150). have that prepared and you will be able to take half damage when the dragon breathes on you- it can save your life (unless its a green dragons poison).

**** Yeah, transmute rock was my big idea. The castle is on a cliff, so if I can subtly Transmute away most of the cliff face, then the castle would presumably collapse. Though I can't cause the collapse myself, so I would just have to render it dangerously unstable and make someone else collapse it. I wonder how bad of an idea it would be to make a small tunnel in the cliff face to start working on that.

I feel like +1 to saves won't be that much. We sadly don't have a paladin to boost up our saving throws, and not everyone has Wisdom save proficiency or wants to get Resilient (Con). I will have Absorb Elements prepared and I will probably try to produce items of Absorb Elements for my allies so that they can take half from the breath weapons.

When the bulb is powered, everything within line of sight of the bulb becomes visibly darkened, with the darkness falling off over distance just as light does, and also reflecting off objects. The darkness feels cool on your skin, and the bulbs become very cold after extended use.

The box comes with 8 bulbs, each rated at 60 watts and 800 fuscens. The brand name is "Moon King", and there is text on the back of the box explaining how to install and use the bulbs, and a support address for somewhere in New Zealand. The package design is functional yet amateurish, and lacks any legal information about the product or company.

What do you do with these bulbs?

*** Various science experiments of course! Since they are anti-light and anti-heat, check if they have other anti-properties. Do they have a (very weak) anti-gravity field? Could they be related to the dark matter in the universe? When electric current runs through the darkbulb, does the electromagnetic effect have reversed polarity? Are there any supermagnetic effects? Since they are some kind of negative heat energy, can they be used to reach temperatures below absolute zero? Is it more energy efficient to cool temperatures with darkbulbs as opposed to other cooling technologies? Do they allow */backward/* time travel?

If all those experiments fail to produce anything useful, these darkbulbs can still be super useful, so find a way to mass produce them. Shining darkness has all kinds of uses, especially for war. There's a reason why night attacks were so common in wars, because darkness is awesome for hindering your enemies.

You can even launch satellites with lots of solar panels to collect sunlight to power super strong darkbulbs, and place those satellites over enemy countries, creating a permanent night where they live. Without sunlight, their crops will fail and they will slowly starve to death without you needing to send in a single soldier.

** I've been thinking about a magical system that would allow for some magic users to have Skitter-esque abilities and I'm looking for ways to exploit the abilities or minimize things like latency. Let's say certain magic users can only make their magic interface with the cells of biological organisms of a certain “kind” (this part isn't that important). To make physical alterations to an animal physical contact must be made at which point any changes you want to make on the cellular level can be made (no genetic changes except through breeding). A different form of magic (mind magic) can be used to copy and/or induce neuronic functions which does not require physical contact but travels slowly through the air, this can be circumvented to some degree by attaching the magic to sound or light waves. Most animals can produce sound waves so that tends to be what animal users utilize to send intentions and sensory information from themselves to their minions and from their minions back to themselves and between minions (but this means they have a pretty large amount of lag when using animals at long range). So some obvious exploits are using an animal that produces light (like fireflies) to reduce latency but with some drawbacks like not going through opaque objects or if the “kinds” of animals one is using allow for it, sending sound through water would increase the speed sound travels.

​

Something I'm currently brain farting on is if animals with faster reaction times could have some effect on latency or perception of time (Dolichopodidae has been shown to have a visual response time of 2-5ms, human VRT is .25s). I'm also kind of curious if all these interconnected minds would create a low-level superintelligence, maybe not with insects, but if you had one human and a bunch of dogs all communicating their senses and intentions between one another what would be the result?

*** Could you have minions you direct, direct other minions?

Like, from a management and latency standpoint, have a collection of say, monkeys, or maybe octopi, directing groups/swarms of dumber/harder to directly control animals, like maybe bats or something?

**** Well, I'm thinking of having the "kinds" of animals a magic user is limited to be a subsection of the animal kingdom and how narrow/wide that section is is determined by average brain size (neuron count) within that section. So, someone might get access to the entirety of the phylum Arthropoda and someone else might only get access to a specific family of animals in the phylum Chordata. Also, the number of minions you can control decreases depending on how intelligent the animals are (more complex brains require more magic). You basically either have a large number and variety of dumb animals or a relatively small number of more specific smart animals, so you couldn't have smart animals directing dumber ones.

**** Hi there! 'Octopi' as the plural of 'Octopus' is usually incorrect. Consider using 'Octopuses' or 'Octopodes' instead. You can read more [[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/270/what-is-the-correct-plural-of-octopus][here]]. ^{^{I}} ^{^{am}} ^{^{a}} ^{^{bot}} 🐙
