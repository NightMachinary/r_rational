Moving into (if all goes as planned, which it seldom does) the last third of the book now.

Pyrebound is a fantasy serial that's been running about a year now; I'm less prolific than many, so it's still "only" about 150K. The world is struck by disaster (literally--"bad star") every four days, and human society has adapted by becoming singularly brutal. Rammash im-Belemel is doing his best with the bad hand life dealt him. The start of the story is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][right here]]. Thanks as ever to one and all for helping me along.


** Another great update with one hell of a twist!
