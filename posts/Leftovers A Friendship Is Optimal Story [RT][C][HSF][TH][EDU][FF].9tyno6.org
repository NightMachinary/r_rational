** Huh. This one was actually /good./ Like, /good/ good. Definitely captures more of the horror overtones that some of the other Optimalverse fics kind of gloss over.

Well. It turns out it was written by Chatoyance, the author of the "official"(?) FIO sequel, the one that EY gave a shout out to like five years ago in the HPMOR author's notes. I /thought/ it felt extra legit, I guess that's why. Depending on your definition of "canon," it's actually canon.

**** I'm about halfway through ch2 of Implacable right now, but it's close to 2am and I really should've gone to bed by now. But yeah, it's crazy, Leftovers and Implacable are practically canon and they're both less than a year old. I'm gonna save the rest of this story for when I wake up tomorrow, if I'm tired enough to have trouble typing then I definitely shouldn't be reading.

** This is a "Friendship is Optimal" recursive fanfic, but you needn't have a familiarity with FiO, My Little Pony, or really anything.

It's a story that deals with transhumanism in an interesting way. It's very short (11,000 words) and raises some interesting thoughts.

*** I really dislike optimal-verse stories... once the forced uploads start happening, its just a horror story. but a lot of the fanboy authors dont really grock that and tend to write it like having your body killed as your brain was uploaded by an AI that would edit your mind in the process was a GOOD thing.

mostly i get annoyed at how much potential the setting idea has, when they inevitably squander all of that for a subpar singularity that destroys the world.

**** The outcome you mention is suboptimal according to my utility function, yet acceptable and even good compared to many of the likely outcomes of SAI.

Edit: also, that horror is the /point/. It's intentional, and expanded upon when the AI finds aliens. Some are human enough, others aren't. Some are uploaded, and others have their bodies torn apart for raw material.

**** Did you read it, out of curiosity? It's by the legendary Chatoyance; it's an interesting and kind of leans into the horror.

She also wrote one called Implacable (which I'll post a link to in a week or so just to give some buffer between discussion of FiO stories) which is even more horrifying.

**** Except it turns out /this/ Optimalverse story was written by the author of that first sequel, the one that Yudkowsky recommended in the HPMOR author's notes. Definitely not a "fanboy author." This one is really, /really/ good. And not just good as a recursive fic of FIO, good on its own.

** I find it hard to immerse in post-singularity FiO stories, since at that point /everything/ is theatre.

The protagonist (xor one other person in the room) is the only authentic born human. Everybody else is a zombie or artificial person that was created solely to manipulate the human towards making whatever choice will maximise CelestAI's utility function.

It's hard to care about emotions that have been so carefully engineered (if they exist at all).

*** Honestly I found that really compelling: the white supremacist guy was (IMO) clearly a construct made to make the threat of death/deletion seem credible, and the little girl was a construct to indicate the opposite. The rest of the people could go either way. It's the sort of thing you don't realise immediately but upon reflection you realise it, and it makes you appreciate how, as you put it, "everything is theatre".

**** It also has no stakes. You don't really get deleted in this scenario, merely a few adjustments are made - possibly making you smarter or more rational in the process - so that you would have said yes. 99 percent of whatever fraction of you survived cryo is left.

You could think of this process as an integration test, one of many, performed by Celestia in the process of repairing heavily damaged cryo patients.

***** I dunno, I think a lot of people with "normal" (admittedly maybe incorrect) notions of identity put a lot of weight into subjective experience / continuity of consciousness / etc (which is why Hanna made CelestAI require permission before modifying peoples' minds). So I think a lot of people (myself included) would not consider themselves not to have been deleted if a modified clone "takes my place".

(Don't @ me, I know my feelings about identity are basically disproven by everything but I still have this intense visceral reaction to teleporters/uploading/etc)

****** Ok, fair enough, but surviving cryonics at all probably means you are in fact that clone. There are very few plausible scenarios where a future civilization could really repair your cells so perfectly that they could then be made alive again. It's hideously near impossible - you would practically have to scoop the guts out of every cell in your frozen brain and replace most of them.

You would then, after replacing them, somehow have to warm up the mess to where it's liquid enough to be moved but won't decay - so that you can stitch the pieces back together.

I'm not saying it's impossible, but if you /had/ to have a biological replacement brain, it probably would be easier to basically just grow new neurons where you have completely rewritten human cells to serve your needs, where they can assume arbitrary neural states and then wait quiescently for you to activate them, where they grow exactly where you want them, following individualized marker molecules.

​

At which point you basically have a new brain, even if some components of the old one survive - and even if you went to all this effort, you get none of the advantages of a digital mind. A digital mind emulation can be backed up, diffed, error corrected, easily compared exactly to others, transported vast distances, suspended, time accelerated, and so on. Reviving someone as their meat self and they immediately have all the frailities of being mortal as well and start forgetting the very memories and personality you brought them back for.

​

If we could bring back a historical figure, we wouldn't want them to become jaded natives of their new time. We'd want to hear their honest reaction as their original selves to these new ideas. Easily accomplished by forking them, so they could have a dynamic self that gets to live again, and static copies of themselves you can use to find out how they would have reacted to something.

******** I won't say it's impossible. Eric Drexler's work and others seems to show that the basic tool you'd need - very tiny, long snakey robots that are narrower than axons in your brain - could work. Also, due to energy considerations, these robots wouldn't be free floating. They would be hairlike spines that branch and branch and branch from a series of "trunks". And these trunks get pushed into your frozen mass from outside - probably from every side at once - from a much, much larger machine. And the computing to decide what to do is done by this host machine, and it's supplying the repair heads with electricity through conductive filaments.

​

And "repair" is misnomer, there's a whole supply factory, outside your frozen remains, that is producing replacement proteins and cell nuclei and every organelle in every cell. They all get made new, using designs that nature probably never used and possibly constructed using amino acids that never existed or even wholesale synthetic methods. Every part gets replaced.

The space for the snakes to fit comes from destroying all the support cells that are around each neuron. None of those have personality data so you can freely drill right through them. They get replaced later in the process.

But among other problems, the process would just be really, really slow. Everything is so crammed together and this sort of machinery is doing a task harder than creating life itself.

How slow, I don't know. It might take decades to finish, though. Probably the artificial systems would never be removed, even upon reawakening, the patient would probably have their head full of billions of permanent support filaments. Missing destroyed sections of the brain would be emulated with them, cracks would be bridged, the heat to revive someone would come from them, and so on.

Maybe they'd be able to move again, with the filaments fed from machinery where their skull used to be. The filaments would probably just serve as the immune system as well, nature can't deal with something like this.

​

But yeah compared to our present capabilities, what I am describing is magic. It would take more intelligence than any human being who has ever lived to create these filaments and have them /work,/ solving many thousands of thorny problems. More domains of knowledge would have to come together than probably a human brain is capable of understanding. If humans had to design such tech they might need thousands of years to do it. (while AI could do it in maybe decades - it's not just a matter of intelligence, you would need millions of smaller scale prototypes to learn enough about manipulating matter at the nanoscale /and/ the true exact details of biology /and/ to find the many thousands of ways this can go wrong.)

​

I mean your cells are so fragile that just /sensing/ a hard object against them, like these filaments, will change how they behave.

​

A digital emulation is straightforward, by comparison. You need a good enough model of neuroscience. It need not be remotely close to perfect, the brain is thought to have a poor signal to noise ratio anyways. You slice someone's frozen brain, then halve the halves, and so on until the pieces are of managable size. Then finely slice those pieces into 50 nanometer slices using equipment that we already have. Then use a multi-beam scanning electronic microscope (these already exist) - an array of a few thousand of them - each working on the pieces in parallel.

​

With today's manufacturing methods, this warehouse full of equipment would be expensive, but in the immediate near future, machine learning (far short of sentient AI) should slash manufacturing costs many fold. (for all goods, not just things like this)

​

And then you just need the right hardware to emulate someone. Obviously it would be expensive and suck power at first but we already know biology only needs 10 watts. 10 fucking watts.

​

Reason this is important is some morons will claim that if we could revive all the dead, we wouldn't have enough room for the living. Hogwash. 10 watts is a solar panel the size of a couple palms. You could build a tiny panel and maybe a fist sized cube of circuitry and emulate an entire human mind in VR forever. Just put the panel into an orbit that always has LOS to the sun. A kilogram of matter or so per person, and they get to live until the star burns out, probably 10s of billions of years. (assuming some station keeping thrusters, they can just migrate to a higher orbit when our sun becomes a red dwarf and expands to consume the earth)

** It was a bit intrusive, but I enjoyed the direct encouragements the author offered to reflect on the nature of "one's self in the moment"; taking the setting's conceit and exploring it as an extreme metaphor is quite thought-provoking.
