You have the ability to speed up your relative perception of time- That is, things appear to move faster around you when the power is active.

Suppose the power has a variable, controllable speed with no real maximum (Minimum?).

Your natural bodily functions continue at a subjectively normal pace, and the power has the secondary effect of making sure linear or angular speed is kept between time shifts (Slowing down won't cause the Earth to rotate under you, or a car you're riding in to suddenly crush you in subjective acceleration)

You can apply your powers to another person, object, or space of up to 27 cubic meters at a time. You must make physical skin contact, or have your hand in the space you want to time-shift.

A few ideas:

1. Cheap suspended animation

2. Faster subjective space travel (Or any travel)

3. Light lensing from thin, time shifted slices of air that now bend light via Snell's law.

The combat implications are obvious.


** It's going to be pretty powerful regardless, but exactly how it could be leveraged depends on how the power resolves the resulting inconsistencies with physics. Some possibilities:

1. Chopping/fracturing things by making one part of them go slower while the other part is subject to sonic vibrations and so on.
2. Making soft objects and liquids brittle enough to fracture.
3. Reverse entropy: Turn warm to cold by slowing its atoms, then after it warms, negate the effect and it becomes hot again.
4. Free energy: apply to a hot object to slow down the rate at which it becomes cold or to a cold sink to slow the rate at which it warms.
5. Juggernaut: Make something maintain its momentum for a long time due to slower deceleration rate while plowing through a heavy object, escaping a gravity well, etc.
6. Projectile: Apply to an object prior to launch and/or impact to harden it against outwardly high / inwardly low gee forces.

Definitely a power you could leverage for space travel and so on, unless very carefully nerfed.

**** It's free energy if the object stays the same temperature as measured externally for a longer time.

IOW If you were to heat something to thousands of degrees then slow it down, and it was to stay there glowing and pumping out heat for days on end because the boundary has a filter to actively prevent temperature changes, that would be energy that didn't exist before.

A thermos makes the object seem cool (close to the ambient) on the outside by reflecting heat on both sides. So that's another possibility. But if the temperature differential is extreme, that implies something extremely hard and reflective, which could be munchkined in other ways (for example, making a sword with ridiculous strength and durability out of thin air, or concentrating solar power and storing it at absurdly high temperatures.)

** This is similar to the metals Bendalloy and Cadmium in the Mistborn series, specifically the Alloy of Law book. Someone burning those metals creates a time bubble around them which slows or speeds up time depending on which metal they burn.

In the book, the character Wayne could burn Bendalloy which was very good for slowing down everyone else to plan inside the time bubble or whatnot. The character Marasi could speed up time outside the bubble with Cadmium, but she felt it was quite useless compared to the Bendalloy. It did turn out to be useful in keeping someone in place for the cavalry to come help you.

With your idea, when you apply the power to someone else, does it also affect you or just them? Being able to affect either does sound like Clockblocker from Worm as [[/u/Gurkenglas]] mentioned. That was not as controllable and made the object immovable as well which had tactical uses.

** I think you're going to have a problem--if you ever slow down a lot anywhere other people can get at you, the first little kid that decides to poke at the funny realistic statue with a stick is going to kill you because of the rules for kinetic energy transfer. And you won't be able to stop it because your reaction time is too low.

*** True. You'd want to be able to set up triggers and traps in the field, so that things penetrating it with more than a certain amount of energy switch you into a safety mode where you're sped up compared to the rest of the world and have more time to deal with whatever it is.

** I'd make a particle smasher out of a rope, a shield of some kind, and a gun with a piece of string tied around the trigger.

First, set up the rope so one end is in the control room and one end is behind the shield, in front of the gun. Next, grab the rope and slow it 1000000x. Fire the gun. It will hit 1000000^{2} times as hard because of the time warping, which could probably beat most particle accelerators.

** The behaviour of the power isn't specified enough. As it stands, any object you use this on will quickly subjectively heat up, because of radiative heating. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law][Black body radiation intensity goes with temperature to the fourth power]], so slowing yourself down by a factor of 16 will increase apparent ambient temperature by a factor of 2 (300K -> 600K). This is not a defensive power, it is the power to destroy anything within that 27 cubic meter volume.

Well, unless your hand has to actually be inside the volume, because then it's the power to blow up (sublimate) your own hands.

#+end_quote

You didn't provide limits on the shape of the volume. This turns it into a power which works at arbitrary range, except for a nanometer-thin strand of slowed-down space spanning from yourself to the target.

Ergo:

1. Any matter other than iron-56 can be made to explode like a nuclear bomb.

2. Use activation/deactivation of your powers to play Maxwell's demon, producing arbitrary amounts of negentropy with the right set-up.

3. Destroy (heat stress, ageing, nuclear detonation, localised immobility, etc.) anyone or anything you have line of sight to, or perhaps even just know the location of, at the speed of thought.

**** Sorry, I didn't mean to attack you personally. I realized I sounded slightly bitter. I'm mostly just curious why many different people here have taken a sudden interest.

There have been discussions of super-speed, discussion of some of the Alloy of Law powers, discussion in a post about "useless super powers", and at least one other. Your ideas were all new to me, so I'm not saying the post was unnecessary. :)

** What happens if you slow yourself down by some absurd degree? Can the universe end before you have time to switch your power off?

How do non-slowed-down things interact with slowed-down things? Are you invulnerable while slowed down? Or does everything in your environment seem to be moving at absurd speeds and kill you if you're not in a sealed box?

*** Yes, but you have enough control that that isn't a real danger, unless you feel suicidal.

During the slowing, the power messes with your momentum a bit in order to prevent the earth from starting to rotate under you, etc. Once at your final speed, things generally interact with inversely proportionate momentum relative to you- That falling rock that hits you on the head now hits four times as hard since it's traveling twice as fast, relative to you.

At lower speeds, the time field extends a bit more from your body in order to prevent random air molecules from tearing your body to shreds, but you're still not invulnerable.

** Can you apply this power to electronics? If the device in question draws power from an external source--say, a laptop plugged into a wall outlet--will there be any weird effects? Say, would the device fail from being unable to pull power quickly enough, or will it seem to pull more power from the perspective of the power source?

In either case, could you conceivably save on your utilities bill by slowing down most of your house to 0.9x, or would even this be enough to cause disasters?

(You'd of course be able to save the most money by using your power on the air, and therefore not needing so much costly temperature control.)

For that matter, can your power double as autotune, or a voice changer, etc?
