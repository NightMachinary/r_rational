** Pretty much. Quicksilver's power, at least in that movie, was both over-powered, and horrendously under-used.

**** You should read The Metropolitan Man by-oh, wait, nevermind.

But really, if someone like The Flash was actually trying, they'd instantly win forever as soon as they gained their powers. As soon as he understands the Speed Force, Wally West could essentially freeze time and spend as many eons as it takes to read every relevant book on the planet and build up a friendly superintelligence.

***** While this isn't true for the comics, what I'd write as a balancing act would be that while their reflexes (kinesthetic ability) keeps up with their speeds, the rest of their aptitude is only above average for humans and only occurs slightly faster than a normal human being at an average time scale - or, they'd have to acknowledge that logical flaw eventually.

You might have read it already, considering it was this sub that recommended it to me and you're on here more than I am.

It's still good though.

**** Superman: Red Son kind of does this. Of course, he has other powers, but that and super-senses come across as the main ones.

*** Both of Magneto's children are over-powered. To the point where both of them break the setting entirely.

Quicksilver is actually much weaker than his sister Scarlet Witch. Who has the ability to control probability, in such a way that it is always beneficial to her. Even if she doesn't consciously think about how to make it beneficial. She can make this effect even more powerful by concentrating, to the point where she can even use it to resurrect the dead by making it unlikely that they're dead.

Never mind the fact that she re-wrote all of reality to her whims one time. Yes, really.

**** Don't forget that she's also a literal witch -- she studied magic under Agatha Harkness. And she can use her mutant probability powers against others instead of just for her own benefit.

We can expect a huge surge in activity during the following [[/r/hpmor]] finale, though, so that'll be good. See how that sticks.

** One thing that I didn't quite get, why does Prof. Xavier look so happy when wolverine forgets everything that happened for the last 50 years? I think I was quite drunk when I saw the movie, so I don't really remember it.

*** .. Because he's a dick? Seriously, one of his teachers just mostly died. I don't think the writers actually gave it much thought, but loosing that much time is pretty bad. That ending really could have a few more minutes added on in which his wife, kids and students all go "Aw, shite".
