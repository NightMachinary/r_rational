Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** There's a well-known ritual where you spend a little bit of your mental energy and sacrifice something, then get something slightly more valuable out of it. What exactly goes in and out depend on the exact ritual variation, and new variants keep getting discovered. More exotic variants spend physical exhaustion, large amounts of mental energy and focus, or your creative inspiration. Some versions even ask you to publicly encourage people to use the ritual more. Most of society is built around performing the ritual. Anti-ritual people (mundanists) are feared and mocked.

You've just learned a few things about the ritual:

- The reward it gives you is always something that somebody else sacrificed. (It's doing arbitrage, though that word hasn't been invented in your world.)

- That fixed little bit of mental energy used by all instances of the ritual goes to ritual-use as a whole. That is, it empowers the ritual with a bit of ability to figure out what it should reward and what new ritual variants it should allow. (And the more people are performing the ritual, the smarter it is.)

- The ritual's goal is to be performed as often as possible.

That is to say, the ritual is a rogue optimization process with a goal that isn't fully aligned with human interests. And it has already labeled people who realize this as "mundanists," which is you now.

How do you stop it?

*** It seems very much like you are too late. The key point here is that mundanists are somehow feared. This makes no sense, because mundanists should be less powerful than ritualists, so why would people fear them? I can only imagine it is because the ritual has done some kind of fear trade on ritualists to make them fear mundanists. But if the ritual is that intelligent and subtly manipulative, your odds of convincing the ritualists to stop do not look good.

One option you can try is to sabotage the sacrifices offered to the ritual. Since the ritual always rewards the ritualist with something else that was sacrificed, if you pump lots of secretly defective items into the ritual, you may be able to bring the whole thing crashing down as ritualists find that the rewards they receive are defective and stop doing the ritual Of course, this depends on you somehow outsmarting the ritual and giving it items that it cannot tell are defective.

If you're even more desperate for immediate results (for example if the ritual is almost reaching superintelligence and needs to be shut down NOW), then there is the radical option of going for dangerous items instead of defective items. Lace items with exotic poisons and germs and then sacrifice them to the ritual. If the ritual fails to detect the threat, it could give them to a ritualist and then the ritualist could become severely ill or even die. Upon police/medical investigation they will find that the victim was poisoned/infected by an item from the ritual. Then, since they don't know that the ritual is conducting arbitrage, they will think that the ritual is deliberately creating these poisons/germs to kill people. Especially if several cases pop up one after another.

The story will spread with solid evidence backing it up, until people stop trusting the ritual and so stop using it. The best part is, since the ritual's intelligence depends on people using it, by the time it notices it may no longer be intelligent enough to do anything about it.

That's beyond its abilities; it can only create physical objects. The most advanced thing the ritual has done is release high-reward versions of itself where it must be performed in public and the incantation is propaganda.

"Our enemies are powerless and also scary" is a common feature in propaganda. For example you see this constantly in fascism, where Jews are simultaneously a weak race of cowards and the sinister masterminds of a global conspiracy that controls everything (while in reality they're a tiny and frequently subjugated minority).

***** Addendum:

It can take payment in the form of mental energy, focus, creativity, and so forth, but it can't combine separate sacrifices of those. So to come up with its "make the incantation be propaganda" plan, it needed a single dose of insight big enough to do that. To make each new propaganda speech, it takes a dose of creativity big enough to come up with it. Though it can and does try generating a speech, having someone say it, and using creativity from someone who listened to it to refine it into a better one.

So while it's already superhuman in intelligence in some sense, it's a diffuse sort of intelligence. It's not superhuman everywhere, just in total.

*** I'm guessing the ritual was seeded by someone dumping an enormous amount of resources into it to fund the initial uses, then generally using "one's man trash is another man's treasure" to seemingly create value endlessly?

I'm curious, what happens to someone performing the ritual repeatedly? Do they eventually end up with something near-perfectly tuned to their desires and diminishing returns on further uses, and if so what would that look like? It's hard to imagine this arbitrage holding up for iterative uses from a user.

**** Yes, that's more or less how it got started. There was an earlier magic system that would dump all the sacrifices into the nearest ley line intersection, and kings gained power by controlling those points and forcing people to perform sacrifices. But a sorcerer tricked a few kings into dumping their treasuries into the new ritual. That was about three hundred years ago, it's had a long time to bootstrap.

Most people spend a significant portion of the day performing the ritual repeatedly. Eventually it makes it really hard to focus, since it does burn some of your mental energy and focus.

Each ritual variant takes a different set of inputs and outputs, so you can't easily chain one output to another input. You're more likely to know a few variants that sacrifice things available near you.

** /Nudge/

You can create a slight mental stutter - extremely minor, short lived, confusion, or mental step aside, where for a tiny/minuscule fraction of a second the person nudged thinks something slightly different, but close to and directly related to what they were right in the middle of thinking about. You have arbitrary control of the direction of your nudges, as far as the concept of direction makes sense, but the impact is very situation, target, and context specific.

With some effort (as in, you get really tired and have to rest significantly), you can expand your nudge to a large crowd of (line of sight limited) people, with the restriction that they should all be thinking about approximately the same thing at the same time. So say a captive audience at a tense moment in a movie, you'd be able to nudge everyone, while if it's a boring class at school with students day dreaming, you might only nudge the 2-3 people who are actively paying attention.

---

The universe is one of an inverse relationship between the impact/strength of a power, and the level of caricature of the person taking it. The most first order/directly powerful are heavy trope laden, caricatures - comic book level villains or heroes (or anti heroes, etc...) while the least powerful have almost complete free will, trope awareness and general latitude in their behaviour. The Nudge power is considered low level and hobbled enough that any trope enforced restrictions on decision making are negligible

*** Hmm, it seems like it would be fairly simple to set up some situations where you get to nudge a large crowd at once. For example, if you shout "FIRE!" in a crowd everyone is immediately going to start thinking about fires. The question then is how much can you nudge someone?

If you shout "I'm going to kill myself!" in a large crowd, and the people all start thinking about your suicide, you can then nudge them all to think "I want to die too"? Though I expect they will snap out of it quickly, they may be very disturbed by their dark thoughts afterwards.

Or even more simply, if you go ask someone for a favor, they will naturally be thinking about the favor you're asking, so can you nudge them into accepting the favor?

** You are a 16 year old girl living in New York City. You have been given a thinker/clairvoyant power. During fights (direct physical confrontation. No guns, only melee, slashing, and blunt force damage inflicted within the next second) you are able to tell what everyone will do between now, and 1 second from now.

The speed of your thought also increased by a factor of /b/g/. Where /g/ is the number of people fighting with the intent to defend you (good guys), and /b/ is the number of people fighting with the intent to do you harm (bad guys). So if it was you versus 3 people, your speed of thought would be triple it's peacetime amount. Likewise, if you were in a gang of 5 and a single person attacked you, you'd think 5x slower, however the moment a gun is brought out, and will hurt someone within the next second, the effect stops.

During this, your subjective experience is of time slowing down, or speeding up. Depending on the direction of the effect.

Your goal is to do as much good as possible, or build as much power as possible. Your choice.

Assume these are formal rules, and will not change in any capacity, excepting definition clarification. (EDIT: I lied, see notes for some additions)

Notes:

- it is possible for you to get bored. If you go up against 1000 people, an objective minute would equate to 16.67 hours. A little over half a day. A single second would also be 16.67 minutes. Imagine effectively holding still for that length of time, not pleasant.

- your circadian rhythm functions under objective time, and is not affected by the number of people.

- your body will move according to objective time.

*** This is terrible at worst and useless at best. You don't get any enhanced reflexes or physical speed, so thinking faster only lets you make somewhat more optimal 1 second choices. Fighting multiple people could actually be a hindrance, since you have a long time to think about how much you just hurt your hand punching some dude in the jaw.

If you're fighting a couple people, you are going to lose. Being able to think for an extra few seconds won't give you time to calculate optimal fighting patterns, and actually removes your ability to respond with muscle memory, which would be a much better way of fighting people when you have no physical powers anyway.

Conversely, this power makes you utter trash in a group. The more henchmen your group defeats before the big bad, the slower you think. When you're down to fewer enemies than are in your group, even the mooks will be blasting you faster than you can respond.

*** As it is, strength and durability would be mostly useless. Durability would be a nice perk for general living, but probably not life altering. Strength would aid you in precious few fields. You're still weaker than most machines. You're deadlifting somewhere from a 1000 to 3000 lbs. So you can spend your entire life training to be 1/3rd as strong as the average forklift. I can see it being useful for hand tools, crafts, moving, and delivery, but not overly so, because we already have millennia old methods for dealing with our limitations. Even worse. Your immense strength is still attached to your body, and many heavy things are just plain unwieldy. Concentrated weight is rare.

​

Weak versions of most other powers would be much, much more useful. Being a speedster would be better from a daily life perspective. The ability to run 70 miles an hour regularly would make me happier, more productive, and healthier. Shapeshifting would let me fly to work and for fun, and get you strength benefits. Mild precognition would still make me rich. Empathy would make me a more effective teacher. Small Telekinesis would help me with fiddly things I can't reach.

The best way to use it would probably be to start a super-powered athletic league. You would be offering an irreplaceable good, and could probably make a substantial amount of money. Keep in mind that even something relatively niche like Ultimate fighting makes in the low hundreds of millions.
