** Last Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: last-week
   :END:
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3clxme/weekly_challenge_ever_after/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Ever After". [[/u/eaglejarl]] is the winner with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3clxme/weekly_challenge_ever_after/csx3z7h][his story]], and will receive a month of reddit gold, super special winner flair, and $50. Congratulations [[/u/eaglejarl]]! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week's challenge prompt is "The Chosen One". [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne][See the entry at TV Tropes.]] This is what happens when destiny says so, or when the last of his kind needs to do what only he can do. Sometimes, the Chosen One is picked by his community, while other times it's the universe itself. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, July 22nd.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]], and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][in the meta thread]].

** Next Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-week
   :END:
The prompt for next week is "Rational Horror". We've had a few discussions in this subreddit recently about what that might entail, especially [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3bxvav/rational_horror/][this thread]]. Is it delightfully existential horror? Lovecraftian unknowability? People responding reasonably to a serial killer stalking them instead of running down into the basement? Genre-awareness? This is your chance to show your vision of that definition.

*Next week's thread will go up on 7/22.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]].

*** This was chilling. And it makes a really good explanation for a lot of things about Superman -- things like: "why does he do this?" and "If he does it because he's Good, why does he take breaks?" And so on.

Thank you for writing it.

**** Thanks man. Appreciate the feedback! And it almost feels like canon, because Golden Age Superman was killing people all the time. Not to mention the collateral damage from any big fights probably took out a few innocents each time as well. But we never see the Man of Steel bothered by that at all, despite him being a paragon of good and justice.

**** Not a fan of the language (although whether I GET to be not-a-fan there is debatable, as that's part of the point of the story), but I do appreciate the attempts to accurately portray certain rational thinking methods in a young child. It seems likely that they would employ them in this manner. So props for that.

**** Maybe I'm just not in the right mood for it and/or not the right audience for the story. The language was a turn-off for me and the plot of a child applying rationality wasn't appealing to me. I ended up making it about halfway before skimming the rest.

Something I'm wondering: is this meant to be Teppia's writing, a transcription of her speech or something else? The story started with "Hello class" which made me think it was speech, but it lacked punctuation that would be there if it were transcribed (eg. he thinks /its/ because).

**** I realize the whole point of it was the ending, but it left a seriously awful taste in my mouth anyway. Of course she can break herself out of one self-alteration of questionable morality, but if she self alters into a paperclipper clearly she is automatically doomed forever and will never be able to see the error of her ways. If she was going to get herself stuck with her changes, the first thing should've stuck her; this result just feels inconsistent and forced.

Basically, it's the same thing that irritates me about Alex Beyman ([[http://www.inkitt.com/AlexBeyman]]) stories.

***** Sorry about the taste!

My idea was that some decisions will lead to other decisions that may end up being irreversible. Just like with life, it's not always a single, defining decision, but rather a series of decisions that then leads up to the one decision that you cannot turn back from once made.
