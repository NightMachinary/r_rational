I am uncertain to what extent my work qualifies as ratfic or ratfic-adjacent. I can say that I'm the sort of author who obsesses over worldbuilding consistency, and has to stop himself from adding loads of extraneous info about (for example) the way magic affects the economy of a mining town. But I'm told that this community enjoys all sorts of unusual and thoughtful fic, so I'm giving it a whirl. Apologies if you've already seen this via the Slate Star Codex Classified thread, etc.

​

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com][pyrebound.wordpress.com]] is the name of the game. The world's culture is quasi-Mesopotamian, with a hefty dose of magic and monsters. It's been up for five months or so, and is presently twenty-five installments long. The blurb: "The world has not been kind to Ram's family. Father just lost an arm. Mother can't work. And if Ram can't find a way to make money fast, a life of forced labor is the best any of them can hope for. His only way forward is through the darkest side of their dark world--fighting on the front lines of war against the demons, hiding with thieves and assassins in the shadows, wandering the wilds where the monsters rule.  How much more will the god of the pyre ask him to sacrifice?  And why, Ram wonders, should he be the one to pay?"

​

Thanks for taking the time to read this!


** I guess it would have been sensible to specify how/to what extent it could be considered ratfic, huh? The whole human civilization in this story is organized around the use of magic to survive a catastrophic event that recurs every four days; all the society's institutions and culture are rooted in the ways they've had to adapt to this central problem. I have tried to work through the implications pretty exhaustively; however, they do not take center stage in the novel because it would feel mildly ridiculous to have Ram stop and think at length about aspects of life that are as basic to him as democracy or corporations are to us. Ram's problems are ultimately rooted in the deficiencies of a society shaped by brutal necessity, and I try to explore that, along with the many different ways you can acquire power in such a society, and what it does to you.

*** Ratfic, I reckon, is all about character. Consistent world is more of requirement not the central theme. After all, if not for consistent world, how else our character can get their reward from acting rationally? From your description, I think you got it pat down. I'm interested.

Knowing how the world works make readers understand whether the characters make correct decisions, or ultimately, go the right way to solve problem.

*** I know i'm super late to the game, but be aware of the difference between rational fiction and rationlist fiction.

The first is about consistency, characters (good and bad) not acting as morons just to forward the plot (if they aren't generally morons), worlds that take actions and give realistic consequences...etc. Which sounds be what you are talking about above.

Rationalist is more focused towards talking about modes of thinking, techniques for applying rationality...etc in addition to the rules listed above. Which seems to be what you are worried about in this comment.

So it sounds like a good fit to me.

** My, my. Technically well written, no glaring grammar mistakes, good world building, and understandable characters!

Plus the characters act reasonably with realistic motivations. They're not wish fulfillingly clever nor are they dumb bricks for plot convenience.

That's really all that I can ask for in a rational fiction so thanks for this post! I'm on 3.2 right now and I have enjoyed the story so far. I'll be following it now.

I love the setting with the Mesopotamian influence and naming. I really appreciate when authors decide to use naming that goes beyond boring, overdone English names in Western Fantasy and actually dip into to countless other cultures that exist.

*** I write fantasy as a hobby, and names are one of the hardest things for me to come up with. I want names my readers can pronounce, and sometimes I want a particular sound or feeling from the name, but the problem of naming a character still feels open-ended enough that I have no idea where to start. Now that I think about it, I'll probably make a post on a writing subreddit to ask this question, but I'd like your input as well since you seem to have strong feelings about names.

Some of my names are weird inside jokes to myself (all four non-human races' names in PB are derived somehow from relevant Sumerian or Babylonian mythological figures), but for the most part I slap together legal sounds until I get something I like.

It seems fairly clear to me that Ram himself was chosen by a spirit, rather than his sword.

I wonder if he's the first of his kind.

Also, I really want to see his "girlfriend" find out about the rumors he's spreading. My bet is she'd show him off as her boy toy to get back at him.

The gap between 2.4 (when a certain character is introduced) and 4.1 (her reappearance) was something like a month and a half in real time. Suspect some readers forgot her in the meantime.

** On my first read, I understand Kindling (once every 10 years period) as the high priest sacrifice himself, ending his life, thus his position is inherited by his son. Would that makes every son of priest must produce a son of their own at 10 years of age? Potential plot hole or did I read it wrong?

*** The sacrifice is every ten years, yes, and the position is hereditary/family based. I think I will probably change it to "brother or son." Or "kinsman" in general. The age would crawl inexorably downwards over time with strict sonship, yes.

(in the original draft of the story, kindling intervals were significantly longer)

EDIT: Glossary updated to fix--and a number of other concepts added as well. I think the monster's more than a hundred terms long now. Anyway, thank you for bringing that to my attention! I had a vague notion that I should fix that some time ago, but it slipped my mind.

You have tetrants as 4-day weeks, blooms as years, and kindlings as decades, but there's also a mention of "months" which doesn't have a name or conversion ratio. So should we know yet how many days or tetrants there are in a bloom?

It would have been nice to have the duration of a bloom and a kindling spelled out a bit more clearly early on.

​

As to whether it's rat-fic. Honestly my vote would be "no". The wold-building appears to be there, but the main character has so far taken a "head down, don't make eye contact" approach to any opportunity to engage with the mysteries he's encountered and appears to operate more on common sense than rational methods.

**** No keeping your head down is a good idea. Not all good ideas are arrived at rationally. Ram has shown a distinct lack of curiosity, or willingness to change opinion in light of new information.

The difference between a rational protagonist and a successful protagonist is whether they succeed because of rational thinking, and so far Ram doesn't.

Now don't get me wrong. I think Ram is well written, his motivations make sense, his lack of rationality makes sense in light of his position in society, and his reliance on common sense makes sense as it's until very recently worked well for him. Additionally given where the story is right now it's entirely possible that he's about to change, and post character development Ram might be more rational. But, there's noting in his past actions or thoughts to suggest he will become rational (he might just trade "what would father think" for some form of black band club rules).

But based on his actions and what we've seen of his thinking so far, he's not currently a rational protagonist, and the story is centered on him to a degree that I'd argue that makes it not rational fiction.
