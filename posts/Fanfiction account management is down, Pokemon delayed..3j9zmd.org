Hey all, after waiting for most of last night and today for Fanfiction to re-enable its account management page I thought I'd make a post explaining the holdup on the latest Pokemon chapter. For those that aren't aware, Fanfiction's having some maintenance at the moment that makes it impossible to log in or access your profile. Apparently it was up for a couple hours earlier today, but I was busy with work at the time and missed the window.

I'll be checking on and off whenever I can to see if it's up again and post as soon as I can. Thanks for your patience!


** The saddest thing I've heard ever.

** Yeah, same here. Support ticket is going nowhere and all the functions that would allow a person to post a chapter are 503 even if you're already logged in.

But hey, maybe they'll take the opportunity to fix whatever's been wrong with the view counter.
