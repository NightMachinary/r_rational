and yeah, i would agree that this is scott's greatest fiction. or at the very least, most satisfying; everything was tied together incredibly nicely and there weren't any loose ends, which is pretty rare. also enjoyed the (literal) twist, which was just brilliant.

The most obviously underpowered person here is Pinkpill. Unlike the red pill you don't need to be pretty stupid to pick it, since shaking hands before and after a meeting is common practice. This allows you to manipulate pretty much everyone you encounter, so you should be able to work your way to being King William's rival.

Graypill made the obvious mistake of being too greedy too soon. His powers could easily be leveraged into something that makes a lot money legitimately.

Okay, okay, maybe I misspoke when I said that they all could be used to generate energy, but according to the laws of thermodynamics, it breaks physics to be able to do things without any energy cost. Perfect energy efficiency is impossible, otherwise perpetual motion machines would work.

*** You are talking about some thermodynamic stuff and it's not totally wrong, but it can be made more precise. Also, Physics is harder to break than you may think.

When you are talking about "energy costs," it isn't exactly clear what you mean. In Thermodynamics, there are many "energy functions," which are often referred to as "free energy." Each of these describes the amount of accessible energy of a system as a function of certain parameters. The common free energy functions are Helmholtz free energy and Gibbs free energy.

The point is that the important quantity in thermodynamics is really an "accessibility cost" rather than an energy cost.

The Maxwell's demon paradox does bring attention to the connection between thermodynamical entropy and information (information entropy). However, to get physical implications out of the paradox is somewhat difficult. It's not as simple as, "free information = free energy".

There are many interpretations of Maxwell's Demon and it remains one of the most contentious thought experiments in Physics cannon. However, Bennett's resolution of the paradox (and I agree with his analysis) is that measurements can be made in principle without any entropy cost (and therefore without any energy cost).

An older resolution of the paradox (Szilard's) relied on the assumption that measurements increase entropy but I think modern research has overturned them. This implies that mind-reading powers do not violate thermodynamics as they are just another kind of measurement.

Interestingly, I don't think that Black's powers necessarily violate the second law either. There is a restriction in physics that information cannot be transmitted faster than is prescribed by the light-cone of two events. This is really just a restatement of the special theory of relativity. Of course, Physicists think about how any theory (including relativity) may be violated, but there is no known implication that such a violation would impact thermodynamics. There is actually a paper that considers tachyons (I think called the Tachyon Antitelephone) that rules out any violation of special relativity from first principles. Interestingly, Scott Aaronson has considered the informational dynamics of CTC's (Closed time-like curves) which he interprets as time machines under a self-consistency restriction. He concludes that they would have strong computational powers but not quite godly.

** Surely pink says "can be turned off", not is turned off by retouching.

So it's a choice. I think that could have been done better. Equally pink suddenly becomes "touch bare skin" instead of touch someone. If I grab someone who is wearing clothes, I'm still touching them. You then also totally abuse it by implying love = mind control which is not how love works in the real world.

Blue for example, it doesn't say instant so you would expect that travelling to Alpha Centurai would take at least light years, so when he came back time would have passed. However you don't do that, so really the obviously solution to negative entropy was him.

Also the shapeshifter guy, shape shift into ant, or something like that, easily avoid death. Or like a dinosaur of some sort. He was also available for abuse.

So overall great, but pink was a real let down there, especially considering the really interesting ways you can go with that.

*** In bold defense of Pink!

Yes, Pink's description notes that it "can be turned off", which is a very /helpful/ little clause that I'm pretty sure Scott Alexander, of all people, noticed.

Either he chose to blatantly ignore it and at the end, Red just learns to love Pink on his own, OR he subtly implies with the below quote (which might also have just been a joke of little importance) that Pink was just discovering that her power had always been so much cooler than she ever realized.

#+begin_quote
  It took them a few hours of fawning over each other before she realized that nothing had happened when she touched him a second time. Something something true love something the power was within you the whole time?
#+end_quote

Maybe!

I also find the power interesting if Pink /doesn't/ have the ability to touch her love-slaves. Perhaps God, the creator of the pills, would rather she not used her God-given gifts for intercourse?

Maybe!

Anyways, next you have to define 'touch.' If you grab someone's clothing, you could say you're touching the person, but you could also say that you're merely touching fabric. If you grab someone's bare skin, you could say you're touching a 'person' or you could say you're just touching dead skin. Even if you touch someone's brain, God seems to exist in this universe, so you might not be /technically/ touching a person because the brain does not /necessarily/ have to hold the soul. If a soul contains who a person really is, you might not be able to touch a person at all, because of a soul's nonphysical nature.

Sidenote: Even if touching skin wasn't required, one of the things that makes Black insanely powerful is that he can easily find out the specifics of powers by strongly precommitting to a course of action and seeing how the future looks then. If clothing didn't work, he wouldn't have done it in the first place. He would have just told Pink about his power and that if she tried to touch him, he would know beforehand and taze her into submission without warning.

I would also argue that a strong enough love is functionally equivalent to mind control. Think wireheaded patients, fighting to be stimulated again. Except Pink's victims instead have a strong desire to make their mistress happy.

*********** Well, there's no "absolute" time frame within the universe, right? It's all relative, mediated by apparent fluctuations in wavelengths, always moving at c. So, what does instantaneous transportation mean? Going to a place at the same time you leave, just a different location? If you went far enough away - a few billion light-years, say - you'd end up at the spot where we see the big bang, only not really, because the big bang isn't anywhere meaningful, because it's the origin of everywhere meaningful.

Edit: To be clear, from your remark referencing relativity, it doesn't sound you mean that Blue could ever visit the same spot at an earlier time. The reason I'm confused is this doesn't make sense to me in the context of the comment you agreed with about FTL leading to broken time travel.

Red, the character (not "red pill", the ideology) is shown as being stupid; but also loyal and lovable and, in the end, the hero. The "red pill advice" he reads eventually leads him to true love and saving the universe; whereas a true redpill would be trained to recognize and resist "oneitis" toward Pink, hold frame and keep spinning plates.

It might be that we're meant to just see Red as too dumb to internalize any of the bad parts; but that seems (to me) overly convenient and [[http://web.archive.org/web/20100620113208/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood][tropey]].

By "gender roles" I meant things like who took what pill, and everyone apparently being straight.

He didn't save the universe (by turning the crank, and by taking the red pill to begin with)?

Are living an enviable life, having high intelligence and never being the butt of humor all requirements to meet the definition of "hero"? You seem to particularly focus on his intelligence.

Do you disagree that the implied contents and results of the "red pill advice" Red read were idealized, as compared with the depths that actual online "redpill" communities can sink to?

I defer to your judgment that Red's "true love" for Pink was unreciprocated.

Given that non-heterosexual make up around 10% of the population (that's with generous estimates and in a country that's relatively accepting), there's a 43% chance that out of 8 randomly selected people 0 would be gay.

However we don't learn about the sexuality of Green or Black, and the story doesn't rule out any of the male characters being bisexual, so it's more likely than that. Roughly 53% chance for 6 randomly chosen sexualities, more if you account for the potential bi characters.

Oh, but the bigger kicker is that Yellow is female and there's no mention of any discomfort at her being attracted to pink (conspicuous by its absence compared to blue) so she probably isn't straight.

So you agree that it's an improbable outcome, even if the story existed in a vacuum. There are also technically more than 8 characters. In particular, Pink's narration mentions her dealing with unreciprocated romantic interest from "a couple of guys"; only Pink's, and only guys.

There aren't very many characters and the sexuality of most of them wasn't directly mentioned or relevant so far as I remember. Although, I suppose it can be inferred from the male characters not thinking it's weird when they abruptly fall in love with Pink, in contrast to Blue's mention of "You're not a lesbian".

But then, Yellow seems to be female, at best guess by the surprise exhibited at how gross men are inside their brains (and also I just double-checked and there is one instance of "she" being used to refer to Yellow), and she has no surprised reaction when Pink suddenly seems very beautiful. Could be Yellow is non-straight.

It's not much to go on, but reactions to Pink make up almost all of the available information about their orientations. We also don't know anything either way about Green... unless I've missed something, I can't even work out an implied gender there.
