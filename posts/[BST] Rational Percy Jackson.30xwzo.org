So my first thought is that mortals are p-zombies, because apparently they can't accomplish anything - almost everything in history was caused by demigods.

Not sure what else could be changed.

The irrationality of PJ seems interwined with the universe a lot. You can't, say, overthrow the gods, because they have prophecy and Fate on their side, and you can't trust them to be nice, because they're Greek gods.


** Maybe you could have the gods be reflections of more abstract concepts. Less pop culture, less human. You'd also need to add way more demigod infrastructure, because only having a summer camp is unrealistic.

The real meat of the setting though, are the monsters.You could go the diskworld route and make them gods with almost no belief, a hivemind of some sort, or even genuine individuals

***** no. However, if the HPverse was only hogwarts and some scattered magical creatures, then you would at least give a watsonian reason for this, if not add a larger wizard society. Plus, in the PJ series, the god's true forms are physics destroying monsters that nuke their surroundings just by existing. They could easily be re-interpreted as personas designed to let the underlying entities interact with humans.

** How do you define fate? Do Gods control fate or does fate control the Gods? If fate is just the inevitable course that history takes, is it inevitable BECAUSE the Gods are making it that way? Or does it just happen to be consistently inevitable in the Gods' favor?

If it's the former, thwart the Gods manipulations by figuring out how the Gods ascended in the first place so you can ascend other humans. If it's the latter, you might be able to do the same, depending on whether fate favors all Gods or just the first ones. If you can't, find a way to escape to another world or universe where the gods don't have jurisdiction. Otherwise you're just screwed. If Fate is actually a character and one of the gods, then that makes Zeus a figurehead with Fate as the real power behind the throne, so to speak. Keep in mind that none of the Gods are all powerful. They can be outsmarted, since their minds are still human.

That being said, I haven't read the Percy Jackson series, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

*** I don't know about in the Percy Jackson series, but in canon fate beats Zeus. It's why he's legitimately threatened by prophecies like "Thetis will have a son more powerful than his father," threatened enough to /actually keep it in his pants for once/.

See also Aeschylus:

"Who then is the steersman of Necessity?

The three-shaped Moerae (Fates) and mindful Erinyes (Furies).

Can it be that Zeus has less power than they do?

Yes, in that even he cannot escape what is foretold."

They don't actually rule the world. They could, if they wanted to, but (mostly for Doylist reasons) they don't. Zeus is ruling in his own right and not on anyone else's behalf, and that's fine, just like the President of the United States doesn't become a figurehead for not being able to ignore gravity.

If you want to do rationalfic Greek mythology, there's a clear link between struggling with your flaws and struggling to think clearly. The Greeks were pretty clearly on the "inescapable double edged sword" side, whereas now people seem to at least want to think of people as mutable. Where on the spectrum you fell would be up to you.

There's a much larger conflict between the Big Three which dwarfs World War II.

It's not Greek myth if your flaws don't fuck you up, and Percy should know this. Rational Greek heroes would be constantly watching themselves to make sure they didn't do anything unjust to the gods, because it would absolutely screw them over.

And according to Plato, the Demiurge shaped the material universe, including the Primordial deities, out of ideas. The ideas themselves could be unmade platonic ideals or something. Maybe the Olympian gods just want people to think that they're invincible and have always been around

** Making mortals p-zombies is a bit depressing.

How about just making it so that magic is required to get anywhere in the world.

The mist prevents mortals from seeing monsters and magic. That means that any magical being can use their powers freely. Suppose a non magical person tries to gain power in an army. A magical being can put on their magic mask and beat the crap out of them, or twist their senses and drive them insane.

This is a world of entrenched power structures. Magical beings held every position of power in society, were at the top of every social pole with few exceptions. To get anywhere in life you need magic so you can see through the mist and tackle the problems you face in life.

As to why you can't overthrow the gods, that doesn't seem irrational. They're much more powerful than mortals and have dominance over most social structures, the camps included, so to defeat them you'd have to be immensely powerful and rally every weaker being to your banner. They have control over the fates and control over every major position of power.

How about a story where Percy allies with Kronus to save humanity from the gods?

What really horrified me when I read the books, the way Dementors horrified me as a kid, was this. At the end of your life, you're judged by people you didn't believe in to see how heroic you were. If you were a dick, you get sent to Punishment; if you were heroic - and you're a mortal, so you're not - you get sent to Elysium or the Isle of the Blessed. If you're a monster, you reincarnate as a plant or as a target. Everyone else gets sent to Asphodel, where they promptly do nothing forever.

So you live your life not understanding the real universe because of the Mist, and when you die you just stand there forever. Unless you were shitty enough to be punished.

You can *totally* overthrow the Gods, though. Fate doesn't /protect/ them, just warn them via prophecies. There's literally a prophecy in the books about the protagonist possibly overthrowing the gods IIRC.

Also, it's a major plot point that the gods have, themselves, overthrown the last batch of gods (as is standard in Greek myth.) Maybe they actually started out as humans/demigods? That would explain a lot, actually.

*** Artifacts that may work against the gods:

A Gorgon's head. There are two immortal ones still out there, and Medusa's head worked on Atlas. Writers are split on whether the other two even have the petrification ability, but if they do then it might work on the gods.

The Hydra. It has an immortal head still producing poison. Heracles buried that on the road between Lerna and Elaius, and helpfully marked the spot with a big rock. Digging it up is probably suicidal (when it was alive, its /footprints/ were poisonous enough to kill) but if you can manage to use it, it might work on the Olympians. Can't directly kill 'em, but it permanently incapacitated Chiron. (Chiron: Zeus' half brother on one side and Athena's cousin on the other. Should be high up the superpowers chain.)

Hades' helmet of invisibility: Used in battle against Titans and Giants, it almost certainly works against Olympians too. It's held by the nymphs of the Styx, who have given it out to mortals before but only with a direct command from a god. Hades lets mortals walk into his domain (/out/, not so much), but he will know you're there. If you can steal this helm, you'll probably be able to get away. Then you can steal...

Hermes' sword. Usable by mortals and absurdly sharp. If you slice a god into pieces while invisible and seal them in multiple bronze jars, they'll stay out of play.

Eros' arrows. For if violently dismembering the enemy is too harsh. May or may not only work on opponents of opposite gender.

*** Yeah, think of it -

The gods are truesapient, and they keep seeing these naturally-arising machines going around, modifying their behavior sometimes, and sometimes not doing so. They're not people, really - they're more like works of art. And some of these art pieces are ones you find interesting, or beautiful, and you /want/ them. It's not like you'd hesitate to take an unowned rock from the ground, so why would you hesistate to take a p-zombie from the Earth when no actual person has claimed them?

Sometimes your family steals art you wanted, or your husband gets too obsessed with the weird hobby, so you get mad at them, but the art? It's worthless compared to family, just set it on fire or something so they stop obsessing over it. If it annoys you a little? Destroy it, another nice one will come along soon. Finished admiring it, and got bored? No reason to keep it near you.

It's amazing how much more the books and myths make sense if gods don't think of mortals as people.

The weird intersection is demigods - they're a bit like you, but a bit like mortals. And monsters/nymphs/etc, of course, which are truesapient but weak - maybe they're just puny gods.

It'd also make it a little less horrifying if mortals didn't have souls - they don't get sent to Asphodel and Punishment. The flipside's that Hades would seem a lot weaker.

********* I think most of the other gods get a tithe of souls, for people that belong to them strongly. In canon, Ares got Confederate skeletons crewing a ship as minions for his daughter without going through Hades. It'd make sense if other gods got their own souls as they died.

Hades might get last pick of human souls, which pisses him off the same way that he was pissed in canon - no respect at all, even if he doesn't have to manage a hundred billion people. He gets a bunch of demigods who couldn't ascend to godhood and whose parents wouldn't keep them, but no decent mooks.

Thing is, everyone's a demigod, and he'd have them all - George Washington, Alan Turing, etc. But he wouldn't have any menial labor drones.

********** Rational!Hades would be able to deal with that, I'm sure. >:]

I'm not sure how things are in the series, but original!Hades was definitely the nicest of the Top Three, and I'd support any motion to set him on the throne. He didn't hate mortals, it just happened to be his job to rule over the underworld, and it was the way of things that mortals were gonna die.

Now, there /was/ the Rape of Persephone, but (1) we're comparing this against the far greater number of assaults committed by Poseidon and Zeus and (2) some early versions of the myth contest the idea that there was a kidnapping at all, and suggest that the problem was just that Demeter couldn't deal with her kid growing up.

** The only optimal solution seems to be to suck up to the gods and act all "Greek Hero"y in the hope that they apetheosize you.

** This is a really interesting idea. The Percy Jackson world is very grim if you start to think about it. Its nice that souls exist and there is a verified afterlife but it all goes downhill from there. The majority of people get their memories wiped and sent off to Aphsodel (sp?) Only the truly exceptional get admitted to Elysium which isn't really most people.

The worst part is you can't really overthrow the gods. They are deeply conceptually tied to western civilization itself and have authority over domains such as fate, wisdom, war etc. Good luck getting one over them.

The p zombie idea is interesting but I find keeping the mortals sapient makes the story more meaningful because there are real people who are suffering.

Maybe instead of your protagonist trying to overthrow the gods to bring about change they can work within the system. Maybe try to convince the gods to be less assholish and maybe convince Hades to be nicer to the recently departed. It would be nice to see a rationalist deal with a universe where all their assumptions about how the universe works is basically wrong.

Good luck with your story.
