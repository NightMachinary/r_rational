** I think calling it a deconstruction, or even a rational fic, is overselling it. I like this series quite a bit, but it's xianxia played completely straight, and not particularly rational. What it /is/ is solidly-written.

*** Maybe that's what I meant. It's such a higher quality story than almost every other Xianxia novel I've read. Seeing the formula played out in an actually well written story without the 20 syllable long attack names makes it feel more rational than it is, I guess.

**** I think a large part of that is that most xianxia is either 1) available only in amateur translation 2) English-language original written by amateurs for free, and almost all of it is serially-published. "Amateur" doesn't mean "bad," but it usually does mean "rough around the edges," and everyone in this sub is probably familiar by now with the issues with serials. /Cradle/ is significantly more polished than the web fiction, and because it's released a book at a time, we get things like "arcs" and "closure" and "not a constant back-and-forth escalation for hundreds of thousands of words without room to breathe" (looking at you for that last one, /Pact/).

Wight wrote a blog post about the genre which I think is very illuminating for understanding what /Cradle/ is and where it's going: [[http://www.willwight.com/a-blog-of-dubious-intent/the-ancestors-of-cradle]]

(Speaking of 20-syllable-long attack names, I was super charmed by Yerin's commentary about the Blackflame technique names in the third book. I'm guessing Wight isn't a huge fan either.)

** I do not recommend this series. Characters are one-dimensional, non-sympathetic and lacking the empathy. The plot is straightforward and predictable. I tried to like the books... But after the third book I just felt hollow. I'd rather not live at all than live in that world.

*** I enjoyed the books but this is a fair criticism. The characters do not seem to grow very much from book 1 to book 4 (especially Yerin). Also, all of the main characters are obsessed with self-improvement, to such an extent that they their personalities feel hollow as you say.

**** Yeah, but it's so much better then other xiania, which pretty much all have main characters that are judge mental revenge obsessed jerks that are basically a genre change away from being a mass shooter.
