  “This is not,” Kairos Theodosian guffawed, “the last you've seen of me.”

  Mismatched eyes going wide, he looked up and waited. A moment passed and he did not die.
#+end_quote

May I reiterate my undying enthusiasm for this character ? His first reaction to being utterly defeated and /most inconveniently cursed/ is to test out to what extent he can munchkin that curse into guaranteeing his survival.

*** It's so him to put it to the test just like that, i mean it would be kind of narrative-ly unsatisfying for him to fall over dead immediately, but gods for that one moment of uncertainty. I think he lives for those moments.

** Does the fact that Cat didn't get the crown mean the story wasn't at her back and she would have died? Think about it, Sve Noc and Mercy are duking it out to help their champion, Cat loses track of the crown for a few seconds and that's enough for RS to swap out the crown for a glamour, glamour the actual crown and then pass it to Pilgrim? That seems unlikely if you're fighting against a story as well.

*** The weight was with Pilgrim. Cat might've been able to talk the story towards her wearing the crown but I can't see her surviving it.

Ultimately narrative weight comes from sacrifice. Cat dying and reviving just has too little weight to be a sufficient conclusion.

** Hah called it. was really not expecting the whole fighting over who gets to make the sacrificial play, but probably should have seen that coming too. Man while a geass would come close without a fantasy-England(?) counterpart i guess there's not really good one word comparison for what's been done to the Tyrant. I guess like a forced oath is close.

​

So does that ending lead to the God(?) being created or was the implication earlier that simply putting on the crown was the part that was more or less apotheosis and now they have the opportunity to take over the realm? Or is this the beginning of the metaphorical boss fight?

** I'm not sure sufficient explanation was given as to why Roland was not crowned? The Grey Pilgrim, even should his death not cause the ending of Cat's hopes' at alliance, will surely make such an alliance against the Dead King more difficult. He is also one of the premier Named on Above's side and would be incredibly useful in the conflict with the Dead King. Cat mentions all of this and the plot unfolds in such a way that he never counters these points. Roland holds none of those attributes, was a willing "sacrifice" and even had a shot at resurrection.

*** I think it wasn't a sure enough thing that he would have been resurrected, and also, Cat mentions the one who wears the crown 'shaping the realm' (I forget what they're trying to use the realm for). Roland might not have enough weight behind his Name and legacy to shape the realm in the way they needed, whereas the Grey Pilgrim... well he's the f**kin Grey Pilgrim.

**** In regards to resurrection, it was not a sure thing but it was a possibility. The Grey Pilgrims death, in comparison, is final.

As regards to shaping the realm, Cat was willing to put the crown on /Tyrant/, so I think Roland would have sufficed. I'm sure that the realm will be better shaped due to Pilgrim's passing but i don't think, given what we know, that that compares to the downsides of losing him.

**** Wasn't "shaping the realm" only a thing with the option where the ruler would be left alive? That was made impossible when the crown was wounded.

But I guess it's possible the realm could shape itself simply by the nature of the one who is crowned.

***** The realm was shaped by a lot of things. The person who abdicated had a lot of significance, and Saint's gung-ho swordswomanship also affected how the realm will manifest.

I'm pretty sure that donning the crown and immediately sacrificing yourself will also affect how the realm will look once the dust settles. Wasn't there an epigraph about how "blood is more potent when willingly spilt," too?
