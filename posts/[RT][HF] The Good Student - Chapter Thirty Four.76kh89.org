** A pretty solid chapter. I wonder what Nic's going to do with the headmaster. I liked that it was from Brill's perspective. The back and forth between the boys was fun, it does feel a bit contrived like every character has got a perfect comeback if it was just two characters going back and forth it would have been less obvious but still I liked it because it creates this Sherlock Holmes-like aura around the three that makes them seem like intellectuals. I guess Brill is sort of Watson-like character as he was out of the loop and a foil for the audience in this chapter.

*** Yes, it feels like living with Nic for a few months has alrealdy deeply changed them, to the point that another supposedly bright kid cannot help but feel left behind. It's not that they have always been amazingly intellectual, but that Nic dragged them upwards.

Or at least I highly doubt that either Davo or Fanny would be able to keep pace with Dizzy at the start of the series.

*** I have noticed that with some of the group dialogue it feels like the author has a â€˜banter quota' he wants Fanny or David to meet that does make the scene feel a little contrived at times. To be fair this didn't stand out to me in this chapter specifically and the banter certainly has its moments.

On a related note, something I've noticed in the group dialogue of a few serials - not necessarily TGS - is the need to give every character something to say, presumably to remind the reader they're present in the scene, regardless of how jarring and contrived it is. The Gods are Bastards in particular falls to victim to this, where there's ten characters in the scene and every single one has to throw a couple lines in.

***** Well, it should at least be clear that whatever you think of HTADDB it is written that way deliberately. If you don't understand why, or don't approve/appreciate/enjoy that choice, you should still be able to tell it's that way on purpose. I'm not brilliant on the weekends and then lose my mind during the week (although there are some weeks...)

Colin, for all his faults, is consistent. His personality enables me to go to some dark places, which I find interesting. How successful those storylines turn out to be is secondary to my need to just try stuff. The whole time travel storyline, for example, was a huge mess I barely held together, but it taught me a lot. One of the (few) advantages to writing for free is that I can do that. I'm not going to lose customers. I don't have any.

Similarly with the rape you mentioned. He was in a position where the girl he has regular sex with is under a spell that took away her memory and to break the spell he has to have sex with her, which she isn't willing to do because she has no idea who he is. Once he has sex with her, she'll get her memory back and won't care, but how he gets to that point is both horrific and darkly funny (to me at least). That sort of mindfuck is not something I can write about in a conventional story with a conventional lead. Nic would not do well in that narrative (plus I would get put on some sort of register).

****** That time travel part was really a mess, I especially didn't like that time-reset at the end. The funny thing is that if I remember correctly Colin says he doesn't like time travel as a plot device either. On another note, Colin kind of reminds me of Hikigaya Hachiman from Oregairu.

**** FYI, I'm liking the direction the story is taking. It wasn't bad before, but I didn't enjoy the plot-heavy chapters quite as much, somehow. Interested to see what happens next.

** Holy cow, that [[http://gravitytales.com/]] website is terrible to read at. It keeps playing a Jeep ad, and keeps jumping to where the ad is at, then I scroll back, find my place, start reading again, the ad starts over, and jumps back to its place again!

Hitting the pause button on the ad doesn't do anything, and neither does hitting the mute button. I had to mute the sound on my computer to stop hearing the ad.

I can't keep reading this story on this website.

Not to mention, after leaving and coming back after ten minutes, it takes a full 10-15 seconds for the page to scroll after I hit page up/down.

*** This website is killing the battery life on my phone. I installed firefox and a Javascript blocker, ad blocker... and that doesn't seem to help. I don't know what they're doing, but its bad.

Yes!

I go there, I hit Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, immediately close the webpage, then paste it into Notepad and read it there.

  How you turned a mass of confusion into a sharp pointed thought that could cut through stone.
