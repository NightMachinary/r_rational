** "Finally," thinks Catherine "a place that isn't under time pressure from an ongoing war or genocide or disaster or magic! I can take my time relative to the surface problems and do this properly! Minimal murder and arson, maximum professionalism."

Meanwhile the story logic running reality is snickering behind its hand.

** Well, on the bright side it will be easier to get a drow alliance if she figures out a way to save their civilisation. Now all she needs to do is turn back a massive invasion, decades in the making, by the most powerful force in the continent and she can't be seen to kill a single one of their soldiers....and it has to be done before one of the other great powers in the world invade Callow since they all have reasons to do it.

At least it's unlikely that the rats or gnomes will get involved.

We had a lot of worldbuilding about the rats in the last arc, and they are one of the bordering nations to the dead king and drow, so I suspect they'll turn up at some point sooner than later.

Agreed on this one. The gnomes are more like an [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem?from=Main.OutsideContextVillain][Out of Context Problem]] or Existential Risk for the nations we've seen so far in calernia. There's nothing they could do to meaningfuly fight them.

** It would be horrifically hilarious if this entire dwarven invasion is the result of a drow killing a single dwarf some time ago. The previous chapter mentioned that killing one dwarf would cause the entire race to come down upon the killer's location and wipe it out.

It also means that Cat & Co's hands are tied when it comes to assisting the drow. Either they do so while hidden, or kill all witnesses (much like the dwarves are doing to the drow, actually...). I think the smartest thing to do would be to find some way to destroy the dwarven lanterns that the main army has, which would cause them to get lost in the Gloom and be unable to meet up with the vanguard. Then make sure none of the vanguard escape alive. But that still means having to deal with 15k+ dwarves who have already slaughtered at least three sigils seemingly without issue...

*** Seeing how the lamps are fragile sunlight devices, Cat's title as the Duchess of Moonless Nights should be a pretty scary thought for the dwarves.

Still, I don't think Cat can afford going against them. From what we've heard, they'd burn down Callow and salt the ashes if anyone ever caught a whiff of her actions resulting in the deaths of thousands of dwarves and the failure of their astronomically expensive invasion.

So what is the alternative? She evacuates a warlike race as they're under attack, or she just leaves and returns to the surface? Or she enlists the dwarves - a "Good" race - to her cause?

I think your objection makes sense, but narratively it's a dead end. Cat will almost certainly do something to the dwarves, and it won't be backing down or befriending them!

***** I don't see any way where a fight against the dwarves ends well. We've heard over and over again how powerful they are as a nation and how easily they can be angered, and no amount of spit, vinegar and horrific self-mutilation from Cat's part is going to help if the cities of Callow start sinking into the earth because she stepped on the wrong toes.

Unless something really drastic comes up, she just can't afford to give them a reason to spite her. Even if she just tricks them in some manner which gets her what she wants, she has to do so in a way which leaves them either satisfied or unaware.

** So in a lot of comments on the story, people are expecting her to end the invasion and kill all the Dwarves. I agree that's likely considering the way the story has gone so far. However, wouldn't it be much smarter to see if she could side with the Dwarves and get a favor or three? She didn't really have a dog in this fight and the Drow are fucking terrible.

  They're going through in massive caravans carrying hundreds of them, like a giant snake of light.

  One of the lamps further in went dark just before I left a place, and what must have been thousands in the distance just... vanished. The dwarves weren't happy about that
#+end_quote

Not sure how to describe this really, but what if the only way to avoid getting lost in the gloom is to have an unbroken line of light to the exit? Like a tendril reaching into the gloom - and when one of the connecting light sources break, the "tendril" is cut: everyone who was after that point is now lost to the enchantments of the place

So then, the best way to deal with the dwarves - all of them - would be to destroy the very first lamps, the othes that all the rest are connecting to

That said, the lanterns are definitely a legitimate target, if destroying one will take out a thousand dwarves. However, they're certainly aware of that, and I'm sure the lanterns will be guarded proportionally to their importance.
