** So it's a Fiona chapter. Gotta say she has rather rotten luck, losing all her identification documents like that. I can emphasize somewhat, finding it impossible to obtain post packages due to not-having-a-driver's-license.

Wonder what's happened to all the rest of her colleagues? Hope they're not dead...

*** Not really a big deal. A new copy of your (or anyone elses) birth certificate costs a tenner. You're not required to carry your drivers license with you and have three weeks to produce it at a police station if needed.

***** Usually you find the hospital that you were born at and get their records. But even then it's a process. I've had to get a new social security card (my first one was misspelled and made the government think I was an identity thief) and it mostly involved going to a lot of different offices and producing documentation that reduced the odds that I had just faked all that stuff.
