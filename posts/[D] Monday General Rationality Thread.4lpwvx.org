Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I binge read Mother of Learning last week and I'm enjoying the story a lot. I do wonder about some things though.

- Why doesn't Zorian try to find a way to shield his friend's mind from the cranium rats. He tells the truth to them and a lot of that information pieced together over several iterations could give a good idea of what he's up to, especially to someone with the time and resources of [[#s][Mother of Learning]]. They don't have good protection from mind reading and he has been shown them pieces of the puzzle.

- The mana batteries. While he says that most forms of magical combat rely on making them explode from pressure and they can't be carried across iterations, he knows a lot more about spell formula that it may be possible to protect them from attack. And having more mana to cast more stuff would help him learn faster rather than needing so much rest along with providing reserves for more complicated spells.

I've been thinking of the concept of self replenishing batteries like the well of souls that could then be mounted on golems and use the communication disks as relays to have them act like support. If he was smart with it he could have his own telepathically controlled "mage squad" to go against bigger threats and avoid risks. For example send them against [[#s][Mother of Learning]] while he remains away from harm and focuses on other plots. Heck I wonder if they got AI stuff in their universe given that they possess mind magics. He could given them a bigger degree of autonomy so he could focus on his own things without having to control everyone of their movements. Maybe dissect some cranium rats could give a good idea of how to build a basic rudimentary decentralized AI?

Another interesting idea is learning if its possible to attach other stuff to his soul like shifters do. Maybe there's a way to bring artifacts across restarts without having to craft them from scratch?

I've been thinking of an optimal strategy to get the most out of the cycles and I think spell formula, memory packets and soul magic were vital. Along with shaping but Zorian didn't know it was that useful until recently. I think if I was stuck in the cycle I would approach the problem like this:

1. Learn everything possible about the cycle and try to uncover how time travel is possible.
2. Learn some useful combat spells to stay alive, probably remain as far as possible from the city and monitor the invasion in case I didn't know I could survive being killed.
3. Learn magic formula and focus on crafting enhancement artifacts to increase stats like strength, intelligence and mana.
4. Find a way to create self replenishing mana batteries. I think it would take quite some time but the costs would be offset if I can use them to practice and replenish reserves along with using them to power constructs.
5. Focus on golems and other constructs to scout and scrying/divination for information gathering.
6. Provided I learned of the aranea, start working towards building up mind magic. Also memory packets would be useful by this point given that so much information would be building up.
7. Start checking on soul magic and ways to protect myself from attack given that it seems to be the most dangerous threat after mind magic, offset only by not being as common as mind magic.
8. Learn more advanced combat magic and only then after being sure I can defend myself from most basic-intermediate forms of death plan on the invasion.

I think attacking the time traveler that could have about as much if not more experience than Zach was a mistake. They just didn't have deterrents and Zorian could have focused on more exotic spells that would be harder to counter so that he could surprise the third time traveler. It showed that unconventional strategies work very well against people that are used to seeing the same tactics over and over and aren't prepared for something like being shot with a gun.

Honestly I think I'd be a lot more paranoid if I was stuck in a cycle with a conspiracy at work and potentially more time travelers tagging along. Then again in his shoes I'd probably not venture as far and learn about the aranea even later, if at all. He is a big risk taker I have to say.

What are your thoughts on the fic so far? I've enjoyed it, so much that I couldn't find a good spot to stop reading but I still wonder how rational some of Zorian's actions are. Also ZorianxTaiven FTW :P

** I don't know who recommended me Shinsekai Yori here, but I just finished watching the whole 25 episodes and am pretty pissed off at him/her.

The anime is definitely not rationalist, the characters are definitely not competent in any way or form, and I'm seriously starting to doubt there is any rationality at all in it.

The sheer amount of idiot balls held through the whole series is maddening and, while it might be understandable considering that the structure of their society was not exactly conducive to free thought, it's unacceptable in any product that's touted as being RATIONAL.

*** Wasn't a fan of the series either. A friend of mine recommended it to me because he said it was intellectually stimulating but I found it hard to finish.

I understood that their culture had gone through a dark age after fighting the espers and had developed some rather retrograde doctrines which coupled with the loss of knowledge and the passing of generations turned into something more of a tradition with people forgetting why they had to perform those rituals or do culling in the first place.

In the end the elders seemed to be the only ones in the know and the others just followed orders.

By the way I found the idea of the elders of [[#s][elders plot]]. Saki doesn't seem particularly fit for a leading role either so I never understood what they were aiming to achieve with that.

About the rest, I took it as them being under conditioning for so long that some of their creativity and curiosity were dampened in a way reminiscent of how 1984 created humans with a limited intellect to serve as cheap labor, except more subtle.

Not to mention that the safety mechanism against human on human attack was a very evident vulnerability and I'm surprised no one had created countermeasures, especially since they had suffered from it beforehand.

Overall I'll agree in that I also have problems considering it rational.

If at all I'll say the [[https://youtu.be/LV31EHwtayo][Ending Song]] was its most redeemable trait.

*** I don't remember the series well enough to argue against all of your points (and some make sense anyway), but here are at least some weak points in your reasoning:

#+begin_quote
  powers themselves don't seem to have a power limit beyond the capacity to maintain the image in your head
#+end_quote

The idea /I/ got was that constantly maintaining focus on the intended “magic” (please ignore my possibly inaccurate terminology) was necessary, but not sufficient. So there would be more requirements involved which the authors didn't elaborate on for various reasons (e.g. because world-building would require much more work in that case, like if JKR had to write whole books on magical theory for HP).

#+begin_quote
  [range limits are] shown to be very inconsistent [..] unconscious planetary-wide power use.
#+end_quote

Unconscious and conscious types of “magic” could operate principally differently enough for ranges to vary so much between them. For instance, the unconscious effects of multiple individuals could “stack” together if they were directed to affect the same thing, the lack of requirement for focus could somehow factor into it, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Fiends [..] it's absolutely nuts that NOBODY attempted to kill the Fiend by simply switching the point of view 'That is a monster, he's not human anymore, he has to die'. [..]
#+end_quote

If you think about the psychological block as of a very powerful instinctual aversion to [killing], then it starts making more sense. It's like how in our world most humans will be avert to kill or torture creatures of the in-group (other citizens of their country, other humans, pets, large animals in general, etc), only much stronger in effect and harder to “double-think” around. Though I feel like this would generate a certain percent of “psychopaths” in their world and much higher in numbers than the handful of canonic gouma and akki.

#+begin_quote
  [Sensory] .. I wonder why it was never used and developed further for this purpose.
#+end_quote

/(Not really a weakness, this one --- just wanted to add an opinion.)/ My doylist understanding was that they just wanted to focus on the societal and psychological aspects \ ramifications of the story they wanted to tell.

#+begin_quote
  [Bakenezumi] .. Why did they have to splice Naked Mole Rats into the human genome when they could have just added the same attack inhibition they already have?
#+end_quote

As explained in the anime and quoted in the [[http://shinsekaiyori.wikia.com/wiki/Queerats#History][wiki:]]

#+begin_quote
  [.] queerats [..] are actually descended from humans without psychokinesis. When humans who were able to use psychokinesis inserted attack inhibition and death feedback into their DNA to prevent acts of violence against each other, humans without psychokinesis became a problem, as death feedback depended on subconscious Cantus to stop liver and thyroid functions. The balance of power would then shift towards the non-Cantus users as they could freely kill without dying in return. To avoid a reversal of the existing power hierarchy, naked mole rat [..] genes were inserted into those humans' DNA until they could not be recognized as humans and thus would not trigger death feedback.
#+end_quote

This also supports my counter-point of double-thinking not being something easily achievable for PK-wielders: if it were that easy, they wouldn't have to change a significant chunk of their population on genetic level just to be able to attack them \ defend against them.

Also, in case it'll be relevant for anyone, the correct title is Shi*n*sekai Yori (“[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%97%E3%82%93#Japanese][shin]]”=“new”, “[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%9B%E3%81%8B%E3%81%84#Japanese][sekai]]”=“world”).

Thing is, they are not part of the "in-group". The PK users distanced themselves from the "killers" so much that they called them Demons/Fiends, and even the anime itself shows them not as humans but as masses of black swirling energy, or half-haf. It's a classic dehumanization tactic that should have allowed the other PK users to murder them.

#+begin_quote
  As explained in the anime and quoted in the wiki:
#+end_quote

Yes, but wouldn't it have been easier and more humane to just implement the same do-not-kill limitation in all humans instead of splicing naked mole genes into part of them and do-not-kill in the other?

The don't have to be, the in-group part was just an example.

Doing that wasn't possible, since that limitation\blocking technique (the death feedback) depended on subconscious [[http://shinsekaiyori.wikia.com/wiki/Cantus][Cantus]] (PK).

*** This reminds me of Kiritstugu from Fate/Zero. He's basically a utilitarian magical Batman that always chooses the needs of the many over that of the few. His arc is about him coming to terms with all the horrible shit he's done and accepting how flawed his philosophy is. There's also Code Geass, where the protagonist decides to take on all of humanity's evil by himself in order to create a peaceful world for his sister.

For non-anime examples, try reading about Nietzsche's philosophy. He's the one who said:

#+begin_quote
  He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster, for when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you
#+end_quote

Edit: I forgot to mention Psychopass! It's kinda the inverse your situation. The protagonist refuses to kill anyone, even if it meant letting the villain get away with horrible crimes. At some point, one has to question the use of a moral code that allows further harm all for the sake of not killing. If not killing leads to more death, is it really that good in the first place?

His argument goes out the window as soon as he tries to kill L. It's very hard to take him seriously when he goes about reaching his goals in such a childish way. Lelouch actually believed in what he preached, where Light just cared about how superior he was to everyone. He didn't have any consistent beliefs, he changed them to suit his ego and needs whenever necessary!

***** Please don't take it that way! There's nothing naive about having a utilitarian stance! It mostly displays some flaws inherent to the philosophy, but that doesn't mean that it's naive or wrong because of it. Every belief is bound to have some imperfection, otherwise we would've already solved all of mankind's plights.

The main argument that it presents is that in a system where you always maximize happiness (or minimize pain), you're already conceding that someone has to suffer. You're shifting the goal from completely removing suffering towards only minimizing it. The character's naiveness came from the fact that he applied a utilitarian mindset with the objective of removing all suffering, not the fact that he thought in a utilitarian way. He believed that by always choosing the lesser of both evils he would eventually reach a righteous solution. He never saw that if you're always choosing the lesser of two evils, you're still not removing evil from the equation.

It actually reminds me of the other anime I mentioned. In Code Geass, the protagonist straight up says that if the only way to destroy an evil is by committing another act of evil, then you're not destroying evil, you're just changing its form. He solves this problem by [[#s][Huge Final Episode Spoiler]]

Still, from a pragmatic point of view, utilitarianism has some worthwhile ideas on its side. The fact that suffering/evil might be an unchangeable side-effect of living means that we shouldn't focus on completely removing it and put all our efforts towards minimizing it instead. Of course there's a bunch more problems to consider in such a complex matter, so there really isn't /one/ solution. I'd say preference utilitarianism (since it focuses on self-interest instead of pleasure/pain) might be the best we can do for now. We should focus on finding a better alternative, but at this stage of humanity's development there's worse things we could do.

I don't believe I can do this subject much justice since I'm not THAT well read on it. I'm more of the Zen Buddhist mindset in that we should just believe in nothing, but that isn't very practical when taken to the extreme. Honestly, just ignore me. I'm just an idiot on the internet.

*** Blood magic is a pretty obvious candidate, especially if it's for vaguely mundane things. Something like being able to trade the death of 20,000 people for a wormhole, enabling colonisation of other planets and great increases in transportation efficiency on earth.

** I literary just ran into to the [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeh-pJYRZTBJDXMNZeWSUVA][Artifexian YouTube channel]], but I think you folks might enjoy it. It seems to focus on discussions of the practical considerations of astronomy and geophysics when it comes to world building along with strangely language design considerations. Apologies to everyone who's also subscribed to [[/r/worldbuilding]] and probably saw this there already.

*** Conlanging isn't /too/ strange, considering that IIRC he's going for a complete worldbuilding suite, rather than just one part of the hobby. I think he's got a couple of ecology videos up, somewhere, and I recall that he's going to eventually work on building cultures as well.
