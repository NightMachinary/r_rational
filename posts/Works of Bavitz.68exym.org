I'm looking for other works of Bavitz, author of Madoka fic Fargo. Author's notes imply that there are such works under different name. I ask here because previously I've seen the most substantial related discussion here.


** For the sake of convenience: */Fargo/* *([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][fanfiction.net]] | [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Fargo][TV Tropes]])*.

I have no idea what else Bavitz may have written, but I do have an idea on how it could be determined if a work is his: using the methodology [[/u/gbear605][u/gbear605]] had used [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/461h03/d_who_is_wertifloke/][here]], i.e. stylometric analysis. Anyone has a backup of all stories from fanfiction.net? It would be a start.

*Edit:* by the way, the author of /Fargo/ recently posted another story under the 'Bavitz' account, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals][a /Homestuck/ fanfiction]], which updated... 19 hours ago.

Well, well, well. Interesting timing, [[/u/AndrasKovacs][u/AndrasKovacs]]. You mean to imply you didn't notice them posting it? Or... are you in fact 'Bavitz', and you've posted this thread to get us to find any obvious holes in your anonymity? Hmm?

*** Based on what I found from the sylometric analysis, I think it's pretty unlikely that this will be able to definitively say that any works are by Bavitz, since you can't test /too/ many stories at a time, since IIRC the time it takes to process is exponential with the number of comparative texts (literally exponential, not polynomial). With just the number of texts I had in that analysis, it took about twenty seconds, but trying to do the hundreds of thousands of stories on fanfiction.net would probably take decades.

If you had a small number you wanted to check it with, that would be feasible, but at that point you could probably just read them all.

**** Interesting. Well, we can maybe buy a few hours of a supercomputer's time to do it? I seem to recall an offer to buy an hour of a 80-teraflop one for $1500, which isn't /that/ much.

*Edit:* ... Or maybe we could give this money to Bavitz instead in exchange for them telling us where the other stories are. But that's way less fun.

*Edit 2:* I did the math, under the assumption that you were comparing 27 stories. Unless I'm mistaken, it would take combinatorially large (as in, larger than the universe's lifespan) amounts of time to compare even one /thousand/ of stories. About forty stories would take a year. Okay, so that particular idea is indeed not feasible.

*** Well, I ask this because the homestuck fic has been so far a blast and thus I was again reminded how good Bavitz is. He/she reads like someone with extensive literary knowledge and experience.

**** Uh-huh. A likely story!

But speaking seriously, I agree. I didn't read the /Homestuck/ story yet, but /Fargo/ was fascinating, with interesting characters and a rather complex plot. Finding more of Bavitz's stories would be good.

** I would also be really interetsed to know, /Fargo/ was obviously pretty competently written and the suggestion that there was a lot more by the same author out there somewhere that I wouldn't find out about is pretty annoying.

** This is weird, I totally forgot about him despite loving Fargo, I just resigned myself to never finding out a story of his again and now this thread pops up and turns out he has a new story which looks really interesting.
