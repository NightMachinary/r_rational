Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So I'm currently thinking about a setting where a GAI has reached effective omnipotence. Of course, this GAI has a few built-in failsafes. One of them is that while the AI can help provide the technology needed to create entertainment, it cannot itself create entertainment. And when it comes to wireheading, it only operates at a two-level remove: it'll give you the tools you nees to build a distillery, but will not actually build you a distillery.

There are a few different ways to turn this into a plot, especially since I've thought of another failsafe that makes things interesting, but my current thinking is to have a sort of "superhero" scene around this. The "heroes" are the anti-wireheaders who want to tear down distilleries and labs, and the "villains" fight to protect the drug dealers. Of course, the AI supplies both sides with equipment and "superpowers", and resurrects anyone who dies.

So, the challenge here is determining how this culture develops. Are there only a few, likely relgious fundamentalist "heroes" making guerrilla strikes on targets of opportunity? Are there far more "heroes" than "villains", because, it's easier to destroy than create, and besides the heroes can loot anything they find? What do you guys think?

*** I think some implicit details need to be made clear here -- this GAI is nigh-omnipotent but doesn't have it's own obvious primary agenda, instead taking requests and also resurrecting people?

My first thought is: how does ethics change fundamentally in this world compared to ours? I'm sure there are more interesting things to consider but you specifically evoked imagery of "heroes" and "villains"...

**** Its goal is to fulfil human values +through friendship and ponies.+ However, it has a few restrictions put on it by the team that was developing it, just in case it ended up poorly aligned. For the record, I'm writing it as a succefully friendly AI, with a few quirks.

As for ethics, I had initially conceptualized the world as more of a way to explore the implications of a GAI on society, but then I realized that the amount of people who want to read navel-gazing is, while not insignificant, much smaller than the people who wany to read about superheroes. So I decided to use superheroes as a medium to do navel-gazing in. (After rejecting a few other possible conflicts; there's a post by my a few months back on the same world.)

*** I think there's justifiable leeway for whatever ratio of heroes or villains you want. Maybe we continue on our current sort of society but with super-cops and super-drug dealers. (actually, 99% of people will have superpowers). Maybe there's a progressive revolution of pro-happiness sentiment resulting in the small number of fundamentalist heroes you suggest. Maybe it's anything in between!

How does the AI work? It exists to fulfil human values - does it carry out its own assessment of human values, or only take explicit instructions?

How does it balance “I want to blow up that stuff with my superpowers” with “I want to not be smeared across the dirt and have my stuff blown up by some superpowered asshole”?

A combination of both. Within the context of the work, it'll take action based on the set of constraints imposed by its creators and what it's learned about humans. Within the context of me trying to write a story, it'll take action based on what I suspect most people will recognize as a "good" AI, (that is, being strictly better than the current world) that doesn't have any way to be visibly be more "good," with a few clear exceptions obviously imposed on it as constraints. Which isn't a particularly rational way for a GAI to work, I suppose, but it's the one "gimme" the setting gets.

That's the tricky bit. I considered having the whole "superpowers scene" be sort of consensual, in that only people who implicitly agree to be targeted can have their stuff destroyed, but that makes the character trait pool heroes can draw on a lot shallower.

On the other hand, I'm not sure why defense by obscurity wouldn't be stronger than offense in a world where boths sides can get superpowers anyways, so even an AI allowing unprovoked destruction on the logic that it'll rebuild everything anyways (except for stuff that directly enables wireheading, which the AI technically doesn't allow anyways) wouldn't necessarily enable a superpowered dynamic.

(Though for the record, the AI autonomously disables pain and rapidly revives you, so "dying" is less than a big deal.)

Yeah, half my problem is that my canvas is so dauntingly large I get decision paralysis.

***** I think the consent issue is a key confusion to resolve to be able to work in the setting. If the defenders have consented, the whole thing is an insignificant game - there will be drug manufacturers who aren't participating who enable everyone to have all the drugs they want. Obviously it's possible to have a compelling story about a game, but it's pretty difficult when there's literally no stakes.

“Defense by obscurity” all depends on how the AI and the powers behave, I guess. X-ray vision? Super senses? Precognition? Post cognition? Or maybe you can just ask the AI all the places in the region where heroin is being produced.
