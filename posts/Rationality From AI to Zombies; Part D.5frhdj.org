Alright: discussion post 3. First post is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5cn7s4/d_rationality_ai_to_zombies_intros_and_parts_a_b/][here]]; second post is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ekjvd/rationality_from_ai_to_zombies_part_c/][here]]; third verse is near-exactly the same as the second. Please do revisit the previous threads for comments on anything from the intros thru part c, or to download the book.

Past that: have at!
