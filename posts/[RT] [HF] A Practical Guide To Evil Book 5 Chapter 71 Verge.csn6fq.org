** I am quite curious about what happens if those stones or runes are destroyed (or someone tries to destroy them) with brute force.

I do not think 'demimonde' means what the author thinks it means...

*** I'd argue it both does and doesn't. In French (which is EE's first language) it literally means "half-world" which fits fine enough in the context it is in.

 

It was nice to see Akua interact with the /provincial/ wielder of the Half-Hornet. Seems her opinion of him hasn't changed mucb

** I'm not sure where it is going but with the reveal of Masego's third aspect we have three power thieves on the scene now. That's one Dead King aspect each.

**** Are you wondering if the Dead King is a villain? He's a God, bound to service of Below. He's an existential threat. He farms humans. I don't think the Cherabim whisper in his ear.

*** I think he already had it by then, it was just that he couldn't /Wrest/ away something that already belonged to him, used it up for an earlier working or simply was too tired:

#+begin_quote
  And so he had ruined the realm, and from ruin gained mastery -- aspect pulsing, breathing, pulsing. It was... unpleasant. His body ached, and so he had withdrawn from it

****** I think you're on to something. I think "aspect pulsing, breathing, pulsing" is almost definitely describing "mastery" and not "ruin." I think the shapeless bundle of power that is an unrealized Aspect was responding to the situation, growing and taking shape.

However, I would argue that it only crystallized into *Wrest* until his declaration in this chapter. For two reasons, this quote:

#+begin_quote
  The word sang, and the world with it, as my old friend found the truth of third aspect
#+end_quote

which seems to imply that this was new information even for Masego, and the fact that Aspects generally seem to crystallize at narratively weighty enough times: at the climax of a battle (see *Struggle*, *Stand*, *Ruin*), declarations of how a Named intends to use their power (see *Take*, *Witness*), etc. I don't think there was such a moment for Masego until this chapter, since he barely even had control over his own actions.
