**** Thanks for the summary. That sounds interesting, I might check it out.

What do you mean by attaching a description? This is a link submission, so you can't add text to it beyond the title. The general convention seems to be to add any extra information in a top level comment after posting. Possibly you wrote a description in the text tab of the submissions page?
