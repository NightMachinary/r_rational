After an apocalypse, the mysterious AIs left behind some piles of nanotech here and there, some of which aren't even lethal. One has been discovered to be a bit controllable - and can rebuild your body at whatever age you tell it to. How many ways to munchkin this can you think of?

(It works on any animal that's been tried. It seems to successfully stuff adult minds into baby-sized skulls. There is a minimum age, for humans, of about minus one month. There appears to be some sort of limit based on how much spare biomass has been absorbed by the nanotech. There's something approaching a 1% error rate, in that the requested age isn't the one that's applied. The nanotech appears to be fixed to a site. Other transformation nanotech tends to be much less accommodating and pleasant.)

Why pick 5? It's even harder to escape when you're minus four weeks old, and dependent on an umbilical cord for survival.

#+end_quote

Is there any particular reason to wait for a famine to start? Why not apply some of the ideas you've mentioned for livestock, and determine at what age humans put on the most weight per year, and generally have people stay at their age of fastest growth?

#+begin_quote
  What happens to a pregnant animal when it is aged?
#+end_quote

Complications. The nanotech doesn't induce births (or youthen a pregnant animal beyond what can carry its young). As long as the 1% error odds don't pop up, then a fetus is only aged to roughly minus one day, plus or minus some, depending on how long a fetus can safely remain unborn. There will have been a few cases where immediate caesarian sections were necessary to protect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postterm_pregnancy][the health]] of both the mother and post-third-trimester offspring, but so far, no cases of mothers pregnant with toddlers-or-older.

#+begin_quote
  A foetus?
#+end_quote

While it's younger than the equivalent of an eight-months human pregnancy, the nanotech seems perfectly willing to age or youthen it, to the point of returning to single-egg stage (and possibly even putting it back in the ovaries). If a fetus is ever aged past that point, the nanotech won't youthen it beyond that point again.

**** Glad to be of help.

1. Five mainly so they could feed themselves and take care of themselves without requiring excessive manpower. Three would probably work just as well. I'm not really.. sure how foetus incarceration would work, but wouldn't it be really awkward for the mother? Especially if she starts feeling protective.

2. Humans are inefficient at adding biomass compared to animals. If you've got spare food, better to feed it to animals if biomass is the goal. Plus teenaged humans are rebellious at least partly because of hormones.

So you could inseminate a cow for example, age both to term, then do the birth, then age the calf and de-age the mother for extremely rapid husbandry? Allowing you to change species extremely quickly?

Well that's even better. Run hornets through a few thousand generations until they instinctually defend humans and attack anything else in a particular area around the hive, and give them massive stingers. Then use them as a defensive/warning measure against rampaging abominations (I'm assuming you have those). If the particulars of Hornet farming make that impractical, do it with type of bug. Like a wasp, or a scorpion.

Say that after the occasional oddball 1% accident, and some further experimentation, it's learned that the nanotech is able to manage cross-species gestation, as long as the sizes are reasonable. So if you wanted to put your prisoners inside goats, that could probably be made to work.

Almost, yes; the nanotech doesn't really add new information into an aged-up brain, so the rapidly-aged calf might barely know how to breathe, let alone stand, let alone breed. But if you're going for rapid species modification, that's probably a tolerable state for the intervening generations, as long as you aren't too worried about the lack of any selection pressure on the species' mental abilities.

#+end_quote

It would take a while, and probably be quite painful. You'd need to have different species in an area they could access, then only breed from that ones that prioritise attacking other species than humans. Then you'd need to iterate until they no longer attack humans at all. It would take bloody ages and involve a lot of people getting stung.

Other potential methods involve covering humans in don't-attack pheremones, then slowly reducing the level of pheremones and breeding from the ones that continue not attacking humans until the levels are so miniscule that you can spray someone once and have it work for weeks.

I'll be honest, the whole hornets thing is slightly dubious. It may or may not actually be possible. Someone with more knowledge of bugs would have to step in.

Doesn't that have a rather large risk of miscarriage killing your prisoners? Also, for a 10 year sentence they'd need to run that 1% chance 120 times, which is rather poor odds. To say nothing of sensory deprivation sending the inmates mad. There's a reason solitary is used as punishment. Solitary with no lights or possibly even a sense of touch would be hell.

If food is /that/ much of a concern you may as well just call it a death sentence, and de-age em for the meat.

(Technical pedantry: As we're dealing with fetuses in the late-30's-weeks instead of pre-20, the preferred term seems to be 'stillbirth' rather than 'miscarriage'.)

Fair enough - those are all good reasons not to set your prisoner's ages to the minuses. Do you have any thoughts on sending them through the nanotech to end up somewhere between 0 and 1 year of age, with or without an option to age them back up after a certain length of time?

You'd need to wetnurse them and change their nappies, and babies require feeding every few hours. Plus they're really fragile and freeze to death or overheat comparatively easily if you're not careful. And they have special dietary requirements. Can't feed em on just grain or meat. You know how new parents look about 6 months in? All haggard and like they haven't slept since the dawn of time? All the jail guards/nurses would be like that. Plus, the screaming of babies is basically programmed to be really annoying and un-ignorable. Your guards/nurses would not be happy bunnies, and you'd need a lot more of them to keep all the inmates fed/changed/healthy/warm. Plus the inmates would suffer mental deterioration from being unable to turn pages to read or use their voices to talk. It would not be an effective way to rehabilitate people.

On the flipside you'd save on space. Maybe food as well depending on if more guards/nurses eat more than the difference between how much babies and 5 year olds eat. I wouldn't use it for people you want to still be useful members of society afterwards though. Maybe as some kind of particularly horrible punishment for people who society has decided deserve a fate worse than death. Basically solitary confinement except also with a complete loss of dignity. Personally, I think fates worse than death are immoral and inefficient but who knows that a post-apocalyptic society would decide.

If I were to be an inmate in such a system, being turned into a baby would make me resentful in a way that just being a kid wouldn't.

TL:DR I don't think the benefits outweigh the downsides.

As interesting a thought as that might be, I'm trying to describe a line being drawn at the 8/9ths of a pregnancy mark, a line which can be crossed by making younger fetuses older, but can't be crossed the other way. So you don't have to worry about trying to fit an adult's mind into a blastocyst-or-smaller.

If the nanotech runs out of that reserve, it loses some of its functionality - it can't make anything bigger without the biomass to make it bigger /with/. The point of keeping the livestock at the age where they put on the mass the fastest, is to put as much biomass in the nanotech's reserve as fast as possible, to maximize the uses to which the nanotech can be put.

The nanotech pulls some tricks so that a full set of skills, experiential memories, associations, and all the other parts of an adult mind fit into a smaller skull, and will still be in place once the youthened individual grows back up. Maintaining the person's full mental identity comes at the cost of the advantages that usually come with a younger brain.

That said, there are still a /few/ tricks that can be played with brains. If I'm not mistaken, if a person spends years studying a particular skill, then associated parts of their brain may grow larger than they otherwise would, which is something that can be played with by anyone willing to experiment with letting the nanotech do more to their mind than keep it intact. (And remembering that there's roughly a 1% chance that the nanotech will do something other than what was requested.)

When a 1%-chance error hits, and the nanotech decides to age the subject critter-or-person without following the usual standards, it has a number of options open to it. The nanotech might age up the subject as if they were a complete couch potato; or as if they'd spent the intervening years training for marathons; or as if they'd gone everywhere by hopping on the left foot. Each such scenario leads to a somewhat different bodyplan. The extent of the mental changes I suggested were the ones that most closely follow a similar pattern; and, mostly, are ones which are tied to physical development, such as the brain's sensory and motor homunculi.

When an error occurs that results in a younger age, the only known examples involve the subject ending up at an age other than the desired one. Eg, if someone wanted to drop 20 years, they might just drop 2; or if someone wanted to be de-aged a week, to just before they broke their arm, they might end up back in diapers, or pre-natal. Assuming that the subject isn't inside a womb, then being run through the nanotech again, whether to de-age or re-age, seems to incur the same chance of error as usual.

"Pound of flesh" or "biomass"?

If the former: different meats are of different quality. A hive of wasps is now several steaks, etc...

If the latter, then a small-medium tree is worth a cow. Hell, you don't even need to cut down the trees. Collect several tens of tons of leaves in the autumn, feed you and your family on high quality meat and have lots left over for sale. Start paying people 1kg of beef/chicken/pork/mutton per 50kg of leaves/grass they bring you. Hire people to operate your slaughterhouse.

The only way that's been found to replenish the nanotech's reserves is to send someone (or some critter) through and make them young enough to be smaller. The nanotech doesn't seem to bother doing anything to plants. Wasps could work, according to what's known; cut leaves wouldn't.

A lot can happen to a person when they grow older - different amounts of exercise, or injuries, or food intake, can lead to radically different bodies. For about 2/3rds of that 1%, the 'error' is the nanotech's reconstruction assuming you were a couch potato, or something similarly benign and easily reversible. Many of the remaining errors are, apparently, the nanotech picking an age at random, again with reasonably benign results. Almost all of the remainder involve setting the target prenatal, which is rather awkward for mammals even if a female with a large enough uterus is within the nanotech's range. There are a few individual outliers - eg, a chimerical lifeform having one part of their body rebuilt with the genes from another part, or someone set to old age with a dementia that remained even when their age was brought back to young adulthood.

After checking a few quick references, it appears that the effort required to keep an immortal cell line like that alive in a controlled medium, let alone reproducing to the point of adding a full pound of such cells, is moderately significant; at least, in comparison to the amount of resources required to get a goat to add a pound of bodyweight.

If someone's goal is to add the greatest amount of organic stuff to the nanotech's reserves for the least amount of effort invested, then as best as I can tell, livestock handily beats out cultivated cancer. (Post-apocalypse, agar is a bit hard to come by; and even if it weren't, putting together a proper growth medium would seem to require a few more human work-hours than letting some goats graze in a field.)

*** In theory, there's some potential there, but in practice... <scratches head> Is there actually any known way to build, say, a half-adder circuit out of organic parts that are part of a living animal, let alone anything as complicated as a Commodore 64's CPU? Or are there any oddball organisms, such as some sort of starfish, whose nervous systems can be tricked into doing computations?

**** Well, slime molds are cool, but I admittedly wouldn't be able to tell you how something like this would work. On the plus side, if you use an asexually reproducing animal, aging it is identical to making more of it.

** Well, the mind goes through different stages and different levels of maturity. Does the machine alter brain structure as well?

If yes, then you could get young, back to when your brain was more plastic. There is a specific period in your youth when you pick up language very quickly. You'd find core aspects of your personality more malleable. Build habits as a young person, then age back up again.
