*** Sufficiently Analyzed Magic is a take on the on the trope that any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science. It explores the themes of trans-humanism, magic as a replacement of technology, and explores a society that discovered magic instead of engineering and the effects that butterfly would have. It features a mankind that has reached the stars using a combination of pilfered alien technology, ruthless ambition, technomagery and applied phlebotinum.

I currently update weekly. I'm missing this update because I have an increased workload from school and day my day job
