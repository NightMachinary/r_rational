** You kinda gotta feel for Velika. She's an asshole, but Westbridge really did fuck her over.

Well this neatly narrows the plot down. Rain has 6 weeks to figure out how his soul works and turn off the barrier. I just wonder how many chapters it's going to end up taking.

The possible interesting developments are what Ameliah is doing, where that empire army went and what Val is up to. Fairly sure we'll get enough plot development for there to still be some major objective even after the barrier is down, so something's gotta happen other than Rain just meditating all day.

*** Did Mlem try to use his special skipper plates or whatever they were called already? That is still one way Rain might skip out of the barrier without actually bringing it down. also I don't think he has six weeks. Velika is probably willing to try killing everyone else to escape. But she would need time for the mana to drain out.

once out of the barrier though I feel like with what has to be a rank shift happening, that will play a role in what Rain has to deal with. Maybe leading to his next blue kill?

I am pretty interested in what will happen when he gets another chance to meditate and reach into the chaos he caught a glimpse of.

**** I doubt Velika would kill everybody. She's pretty insane but she looks to be really out of it, there's really no point in killing everyone. If she does do that and is the only one that escapes, every faction is going to scapegoat her. She's the DKE representative that took over a Watch city and slaughtered a bunch of guildies and Watch members. They'd definitely kill her, and the DKE was already plotting to sacrifice her as the Sadanis rep anyways, so they'd likely kill her too. The only real concern is the food problem and rising temperatures, Velika is most likely going to be passive.

I really do wonder what's going to happen from here. Is Rain going to discover something from his meditation or from whatever's going to happen to Dozer, or is he going to find a higher level blue? I'm curious to see how the barrier is going to be handled, since there appears to be a powerful guardian and difficult to even turn off.

** Prediction: The Artifact runs on something like a programming language, which nobody else in this setting has had any experience with. This lack of familiarity is part (but not all) of the reason why using the artifact is so difficult. Rain attempted to get a degree in video game design (or something like that) so he should have some understanding of coding.

That, combined with his overmana boost to learning, will let him learn enough of the programming language to use the artifact. There will also be one (1) to three (3) other complications making this process a bit more difficult.

** *Rain should've chosen Worker instead of Dynamo*. He gives up the tripled base mana regen and the ability to get XP from combat, but gains a 50% boost to Purify, Winter, Detection, Velocity, Essence Well, and all Aura Metamagic and Magical Utility skills.

While running Winter on himself, he would have much higher mana regen than as a Dynamo, and there would be a whole host of other advantages.

- Winter would get a 50% boost to its effects, going +150% (from +100%) and increasing its base range to 15m (from 10m).\\
- Combined with the improved Extend, it would reach 30m (vs. 20m).\\
- Aura Synergy would be acting on the same number of aura ranks but has a greater effect, (2.2x instead of 1.8x), bringing us to 330%@66m (vs. 180%@36m).\\
- Amplify is boosted: 825%@66m (vs. 360%@36m),
- as is Channel Mastery, for 2062.5%@66m (vs. 720%@36m).\\
- Aura Compression is boosted twice, from the increased range and the increased bonus per meter, bringing us to 6146.25%@0m (vs. 1238.4%@0m)

Overall, he has given up 3x mana regen from Dynamo and gained 5x mana regen from Winter with increased metamagic.

If he chooses to use Aura Focus for a Singularity, then things start getting silly.

- Start from the Channel Mastery calculation for 2062.5%@66m (vs. 720%@36m).
- Aura Focus is 4x instead of x3, which gives us 8250%@264m (vs. 2160%@108m)
- Aura compression is doubly boosted, which gives us 73590%@0m (vs. 6825.6%@0m)

Furthermore, Intrinsic Clarity is a x4 bonus instead of x3, and Intrinsic Focus and Cross Coupling are similarly boosted. Immolate and Refrigerate only directly benefit from the increased metamagic, but Aura Synergy being 2.2x instead of 1.8x is a 22% boost to damage and range regardless.

--------------

*TL;DR*: Rain has a synergy-build, not a mana-regen build. He would've been better served by taking a 1.5x boost that stacks half a dozen times to almost everything rather than a 3x boost that applies once to one thing.

*** There's just one issue. The text for the Worker Class says:

#+begin_quote
  *Worker* (+)

  Common

  Requirement: None

  Effect: 50% boost to non-combat skills

  *Warning*: Experience may no longer be gained through combat
#+end_quote

Meaning that the 50% boost is only meant for /crafting/ trees. So it wouldn't apply to Offensive Auras, Defensive Auras, or Aura Metamagic trees at all.

There could be an argument that it can apply to Utility Auras and/or Magical Utility but they are support for other combatants or improves the user's mana.

So while Worker is better for Rain's build by the numbers; in practice, it's very doubtful that any of the skills would be considered non-combatant.

EDIT: Oh wait, you explicitly only talked about the Utility Auras, metamagics, and Magical Utility. So you were already aware.

It really is not. Read the comments on RR or on his Patreon. "Rain hasn't raised his cap in forever" is in the top three comments about the story, if not /the/ most common. Drop into the Discord and you'll see constant discussion about alternative ways that he could raise his cap.

Up to this point? Maybe. But he is as strong as plot dictates. Maybe worker would be weaker if he was actually planned to take that?

And hey, you can be happy he did this instead of some other weaker build and consider the numbers have gone up as well.

We don't really have much information about how the dome's mana works do we? It announced and drained at the start but doesn't seem to have been draining anything since, even when the Empire was trying to crack it. For all we know it could be single use, is now discharging, and is at an unknown percentage.

Also Rain may be able to drain the barrier using mana manipulation or area damage.

  “You know her so well?” Rill said, raising an eyebrow at her. Melka scowled, but did not respond. “As I said, she is not stupid. Her commands thus far have been reasonable, and she will listen to reason if it is presented to her properly. Citizen Westbridge is the greater mystery. I would have thought he would have honored Halgrave's request to allow the Guild to depart.”

  “Yeah, me too,” said Rain, nodding. “At first, I thought they wanted us in here to fuel the barrier, but the math doesn't check out. There's too many unawakened for a hundred or so Bronzeplates to matter.”

#+end_quote

Rain might produce as much mana as the rest of the Awakened in the town, even excluding his effect on others via Winter.

Compared to a Mage with balanced stats, he has double the clarity and 3x the regen per point of clarity. This is an x6 multiplier.

If he keeps up Winter (13.38x mana regen) half of the day, it would be another x7 multiplier to the mana he generates in any given day, bringing him to 42 mage-equivalents of mana regen. (Winter Singularity gives him 70x mana regen, bringing him to 420 mage-equivalents if he uses it 24/7).

I'm assuming that most of the mages have Intrinsic Clarity, Intrinsic Focus, and Cross Coupling. This would be a more effective boost to them than to Rain because they would get +25 Clarity compared to Rain's +2.5, but they likely don't all have it, or aren't all fully-leveled, so I'm saying it's a wash.

Warriors have essentially zero mana regen compared to Mages. They have 1/10 the Clarity and 1/3 the regen per point (due to lacking Intrinsic Clarity), giving them 1/30 Mage-equivalent mana regen.

Are there 21 Mages and 630 Fighters around level 18 left in the town after the big fight?
