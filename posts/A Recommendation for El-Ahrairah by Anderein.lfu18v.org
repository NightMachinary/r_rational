A review of HPMOR; I replied to a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/ldy560/weekly_rwormfanfic_discussion_what_have_you_been/gm8ivyg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][post]] in [[/r/wormfics][r/wormfics]]. They were recommending a Worm fanfiction named [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/reader/][El-Ahrairah]] to the larger community. I recommended HPMOR in turn, for reasons detailed below.

I'm here to recommend El-Ahrairah to anyone who hasn't yet encountered it. For context, El-Ahrairah is what got me onto rational fics to begin with, is what brought me towards HPMOR. All this to say, if you are familiar with the larger Parahumans universe, frequent this sub, and haven't yet encountered this fic-- give it a gander.

The comment:

#+begin_quote
  Hey, if you liked El-Ahrairah, then you'll probably also enjoy [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] (HPMOR). It's a complete fic (with a high-quality sequel called Significant Digits) wherein a /weirdly/ intelligent Harry Potter gets his acceptance letter to Hogwarts after eleven years of being raised by an Oxford Professor of (some unspecified) Science. Among his goals are to discover the underlying laws governing magic, achieve omnipotence, and defeat Death and all of it's manifestations upon the planet Earth. +Hijinks ensue.+

  Later in El-Ahrairah, Taylor notes that James and Jacob have a similar fighting style, both owing their roots to King. I feel the same way about these two fictions-- the fics both touch on similar themes, similar beats, and similar writing styles, even while being two separate works of fiction with their individual voices.

  I'll give you three examples:

  1.) Ambitious protagonist with heroic intentions who nonetheless must be cautious that they don't follow their good intentions too far down a path of villainy.

  2.) A web of interconnected schemes and plots. A significant part of the appeal of both these fics to me (El-Ahrairah first and then HPMOR) are those moments when a hidden plot element is revealed to the reader, and the story as you know it is recontextualized completely. Or even better, you predict the hidden element and wait for the shoe to drop in-text.

  3.) Intelligent characters and /meaningful/ dialogue. There is so much packed into these stories, with /so many/ critical conversations that you don't fully understand until you give them a re-read. I've read both El-Ahrairah and HPMOR many times over in the past few years, and I'm /still/ having moments where I think to myself, "/Ohhhh./ I understand that character's motivations a bit better now. /Fuck/, that's clever writing." It seems like every character has /texture/. I can't explain exactly what I mean by that, except to say that I rate both of these stories' handle of character on a similar level that I rate Wildbow's stories'.

  And of course, there's also the fact that +Anderein is obviously the author of HPMOR writing under a psudonym+ I seem to remember Anderein referencing '[[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][The Abridged Guide to Intelligent Characters]],' which is written by the author of HPMOR. Though to be fair, I've also spent 15 mins looking for the exact reference in the El-Ahrairah thread and haven't found anything yet. Make of that what you will.

  In any case, I personally rate HPMOR and El-Ahrairah on the same level of quality. I think that anyone who enjoys one will enjoy the other.

  Edit: Another thought-- I came into HPMOR having only read bits of the first half of the Harry Potter series a decade ago. I think that a person will be able to get into it with only passing knowledge of the main series.

*** SB is a place where munchkins and worldbuilding addicts gather, which made it a natural home for Worm fans. Once a platform reaches critical mass for fandom, it becomes very hard to move off it, since you want to be where the fans are to participate in the community. So Worm fans post their content on SB, which perpetuates the assumption that SB is the place for Worm fans. A loop is born.

** I was trying to get into but it was making me cringe how hard they were trying to make the protagonist into jack Slash v2. Like why would they all come to that conclusion? Feels so forced too

They even joked around calling her Jacqueline Cut as if this guy isn't a torturous psychopath killer that's probably killed and tortured everything from children to old people. Like what? Why would they even do that, that's like me attributing someone to Richard ramirez or Ted Bundy because they're charismatic. In universe it's a really bad decision for them to make, legit someone worse than Hitler

*** Taylor is a psycho too, just not one with a career as distinguished as Jack's; Weaver 9 worked for a reason. Wildbow's writing hides it somewhat, because she doesn't see /herself/ as a psycho, but she terrifies everyone around her. So yes, they're comparing her to the scariest known monster that /definitely/ was born human (well, except Sleeper). Because she is /fucking scary/.

And the thing where she was permanently tarred as Jack Slash 2 was Jack's idea, and part of his price for not cheating in their endgame. She arranged the Vegas duel to prove she should scare villains everywhere; he decided part of his price for 'fighting fair' was to leave her marked as a continuation of his story, since he was all about narrative.

**** Yeah that would be the case but that was not the tone taken in this fanfiction. They openly and forcibly (she hadn't done anything comparable to JS at that point in story) compare her to Jack Slash who commits so many known atrocities, some beyond what another human being could literally physically do to another. You take into account what Jack Slash means and all the really really bad stuff he's done against other heros and their family? Not to mention kids? It's as if I complimented someone for their ability to lead and said they're alot like Charles Manson or Hitler. It's ridiculous, unrealistic and cringey

Yes it was? Everyone was scared of Administrator, except Cauldron. She's powerful and utterly ruthless, and doesn't try to hide it. Even the /Triumvirate/ found her unnerving. The fear starts well before anyone makes the comparison. She scares /Glaistig Uaine/ a little, for hell's sake (and then more than a little, when she sends her Jack as a present, but that's neither here nor there).

****** You just proved my point, they were scared of her because she was terrifying in scope of ability. That doesn't equal Jacqueline Cut. People are scared of Jack, not because of his ability but of the fucked up shit he's liable to do to any infants, kids and even heroes . That's a complete different type of fear, trying to equate it is being intellectually dishonest.

******* No, it's not a different type at all. People's reactions to Administrator are largely "I'm glad I'm not in her way", because she gives off the - accurate - vibe that if you /are/ in her way very bad things will happen to you. And no one is really sure that 'very bad things' will actually stay north of Jack Slash (probably not even her). She's terrifying, not because she has /Administration: Coordination, Control-Locked/, but because /she is the kind of person who would be given that/. She is psychologically a baby Catastrophe, and only Contessa's direct recruitment preserved the 'baby' part. And that is a trait canon Taylor shares: she gets a powerful shard because psychologically, she can be relied upon to wreak havoc with whatever power (super- or mundane) she has available.

Jack Slash is not the only other Catastrophe in the world. But in America, he's the one people know. (Most also know Nilbog, probably Sleeper, and maybe the Machine Army guy, though in that case not by name. But everyone knows Jack Slash.)
