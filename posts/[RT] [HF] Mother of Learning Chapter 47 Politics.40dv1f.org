  He was also steadily trying out new shaping exercises, writing down which ones were easiest to work with, which ones had a trick to doing them right and which ones became much easier if he did some other exercises before them. He was surprised how lacking the various exercise manuals were in regards to crucial information like that.
#+end_quote

It'd be pretty cool if the resets gave him the insight to become a legendary teacher for “younger” generations when (if) he successfully exited the loop.

  Was Sudomir somehow adjusting the warding scheme on the fly or were the wards itself somehow intelligent?

Maybe Kandrei managed to re-purpose extracted human brains as an additional intelligent defensive element to his wards, preserving some form of smouldering semi-consciousness in them for that.

  - the sentence's structure is “Oozes [were] [property1], [did action 1], [property 2], could [action 2], [..]”. Imo, would be better to move properties together and then switch to actions, for the sake of coherency. Something like:

From the perspective of something that is unaware of the time loop Zorian never had any business with any colonies of Aranea. More importantly this "Spirit" either disappeared like all the angels and demons and the colony are just covering for it by refusing visitors or isn't extraplanar and thus is one of the terrestrial spirits like the fey or elementals or potentially even a lucid/intelligent primordial (but not likely). Could be an interesting area of study, but again it could just be missing.

That seems more and more likely. Zorian has expressed concern that his previous choices for career paths are inadequate at his current level. His initial bad luck in mentors slowed him down, but time loop negated that obstacle. Since he had to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, he has a fundamental understanding how many things work, also a plus.

And he will be teaching at least two people (Taiven, Kiri) once the loop ends. And he expressed desire to at the very least write a book on mind magic, because his experiences in mastering that field were dangerously painful. Literally and figuratively.

That would explain him being bad news, not worst news.

*** Seems to me like the wards are self-adapting, and Sudomir can direct if he wants to as well. Zorian thinks that the level of intelligence is too high for a mindless construct, so I imagine Sudomir has some souls or captive minds powering it.

My guess: It's related to the angry Iron Beaks that he's loaning to the Cyoria invasion efforts. "Hate. Grudge. Kill." was the reply Zorian got from an iron beak back in 43 when he asked if it wanted to kill more Ibasans. Their loyalty is being forced, and if you look back to chapter 40, Sudomir Kandrei is the one supplying both the iron beaks and winter wolves to the Dragon Cultists, and not even the Ibasan forces directly. We'll have to wait three weeks to find out the rest of Sudomir's secrets though, which will probably also tie in to the organized killing of soul mages, since none of the people Zorian mind-delved knew anything about that either.

When intruder is detected, system goes from dormant into active mode and its intelligence is woken up. Zorian starts picking it up, but since it is probably some not-so usual mind (necromancer warder? probably some disfigured souls trapped or something similar) he can't yet connect the dots.

add: which, by the way, if true, opens avenues for mind attack on ward scheme. For Zorian the mind mage this could be a godsend.

The higher level bad guys Zorian tangles with, the more chance that he'll start to encounter someone who talks to Red Robe for at least a bit every restart.

Plus, there's the whole thing where Zorian is actually the more capable mind mage than Red Robes.

If I'm Sudomir who is secretly Red Robes, and a mysterious invader with power over the time loop enters my home /again/, I'd stay the HELL away, but also try not to let the invader discover my secret (which means behaving similarly to the way I did the first time, within the limits of safety)

This one though- I have an answer for. Iasku Mansion is like Sudomir's personal fortress. It's a hidden location that, as far as he knew until recently, no time traveler be interested in or even know about- and on the off chance that someone comes along poking around he's got layers and layers of defenses (as well as a very handy escape route).

Why /wouldn't/ he be in Iasku Mansion? And in future restarts (like the next chapter), he's got an amazing opportunity to lay a trap that can really hurt his only serious enemies- the other time travelers.

What? A crucial transportation hub for the largest event taking place in direct vicinity of the time traveler zero (Zach) is of no interest for time travelers? I mean, come on, that's how Zorian got there, by investigating the invasion. That's what Zach should have done instead of dragon hunting and screwing around.

If I am Sudomir the Red Robe I will not under any circumstance allow my mansion to be used by Ibasan invasion. No, nope, never. If I am somehow bound to assist them due to an arrangement (foolishly) made prior the loop, I will make everything to distance away, erase as much connections as possible.

At the time, no one had any knowledge of its existence. Zorian didn't stumble into/become aware of the manor by actually investigating the invasion at first- he did it because he happened to be hired to rob that one guy's rival, who happened to have documents saved that indicated Sudomir was tied to the invasion. That's just sheer random luck.

Later on, when Zorian actually breaks into the manor through the gate- he's doing it by infiltrating what should be an extremely well guarded and dangerous (even to time travelers, as Quatach-Ichil will protect it) gate.

If I am Sudo-Robes, I assume the manor is basically the safest place on earth for me to be. Even AFTER it gets invaded. The first time, I'm surprised and caught off guard. The second time, I've prepared in advance, and test the invaders skills/methods without exposing myself directly, and without giving away the fact that I was expecting him to arrive. Try to figure out who the hell he is and what he wants.

The third time, I prepare for the invader to come again, and spring a much better trap- one that will catch the time traveler off guard as he's relying on me behaving the same every time. Then, its soul/mind magic time to neutralize the threat permanently.

Except for the Cult and the Ibasans. Which makes it irresponsible from StRR POV. He should anticipate the possibility of someone investigating the invasion. Then, being connected to the invasion StRR would have perfect understanding how vulnerable Cyorian gate is. Zorian got in on the first try, solo but it was not a miracle.

Now, I've criticized in the previous thread that storming in was utterly reckless on Zorian's part.

If I am StRR I know this:

- Cyorian gate is poorly guarded.
- Cyorian gate is known to the invaders
- The invasion is not unknown by Time Travellers
- The invasion is a major point of interest for TTs regardless of their alignment: it's just too big of an event, it's worth investigating even for Evil TTs. Evil TTs get a bonus for their investigation techniques, by the way.

From this StRR concludes that competent TT will get to the gate, eventually.

Now, limits of magic are not entirely known to us, they aren't a given for StRR either. Thinking otherwise would be, again, a poor judgement call on his part.

There could be a possibility to track gate's destination without exposing oneself. I am thinking about throwing something/someone through the portal and then trying to divine their location right away. Maybe throwing in someone with soulmarker like Zach has and tracking him with the same ritual. Unless mansion defenses take out intruders in under a minute (they don't even /detect/ the intrusion immediately), the location is busted.

Or, you know, since there can be more than one TTs looping, TT1 throws in a really big explosive charge, detonates it immediately, while TT2... TTn physically scattered throughout the Highlands try to detect the explosion footprint.

Based on this, StRR concludes that it is impossible to hide mansion location and his connection to the invasion. Based on this he should sever the link, if possible.

tl;dr: I am certain Sudomir is not RR or he is dumb and the story loses its appeal.

This wouldn't work, as the manor is specifically warded against this. Also divinations.

The fact that time travelers might eventually get in through the gate is a possibility that I would consider very remote were I Sudomir. If anyone does come through, the defenses make the manor serve as an effective honeypot.

In any case, it's clear that the gate and invasion were being set up way before the loop ever started. It's not a practical option for Sudomir to sever it based on concerns he's developed during the loops. Would you defy Quatach-Itchil and all the Ibasans if you were him?

Except it's not? It's not warded against explosions in dormant mode, it is not warded against explosions in active mode, and it's warded only against spell formulae explosions in supercharged mode. We throw in a ton of alchemical goo, an nuke it the instant it is on the other side. Good luck suppressing shockwaves that strong.

  They need ambient mana to survive, and lots of it. They couldn't live on the surface for long, and even shallower portions of the Dungeon are uncomfortable for them.

The golem+ alchemy combo is obviously immensely powerful for storming positions and fighting. It's worth experimenting with ways to enhance this. Can he convince his classmates to make him potions and golems in return for limitless cash, for example? Can he learn how to do mass alchemy, perhaps from the witch, so he can make a huge quantity of attack potions?

The iron beaks and super trolls are both powerful weapons and enemies. Next time he's in Cyoria he should do some research on such magical creatures, see if there's an expert who could help him. It's very wasteful losing so many of his expensive resources fighting them. I assume he's pretty good at handling undead from Alanic, but check with people there to see if they have any cheap ways to handle undead. Maybe go ask Alanic if he has any good tips on handling liches beyond don't.

The lich summoning amulet warrants further investigation. If he can reliably summon the lich that's a good way to target an assassination attempt or a grab and mind rape attempt. Perhaps he could mass produce it and jam the summoning signal. He could either investigate it at the end of a loop or teleport far enough away and underground that its signal won't reach the lich under lots of wards.

He's facing powerful wards that can defeat a number of his spells. It would be worth next time he's in Cyoria asking the resident ward master Ilsa about them, to see if there are ways to better punch through them or evade them.

He's facing a necromancer now. It's worth finding the location of all these shifter tribes and asking them for soul magic help, as with the Aranea. Some heavy duty soul wards or defenses would help a lot, and if she knows useful stuff about soul magic they should too- there surely are shifter mages who specialize in messing with other shifters.

******* I guess it depends a bit on the details of soul ecology. Presumably there is a large (although not infinite) supply of dead souls to draw upon from graveyards, battlefields, etc, and using them in this manner does not affect them across the resets.

So my thinking is that these could be summoned into golems or other suitable hosting objects assembled by golem labor. Then they would be reprogrammed with either mind or soul magic (initially by the original caster, but later by a "parent" undead creature that has already been programmed) to do what the original caster wants, including recasting spells at given intervals. Checksums could be used to make sure no deviations are introduced during replication.

Now that you have an exponentially expandable supply of undead servants, you can use them to enchant as many golem bodies as necessary.

But hey, whatever, let's say that sitting in a room having marbles thrown at you without being told how to dodge for months was vitally important. He still could have bribed, mind controlled, convinced or otherwise manoeuvred literally anyone else to teach Zorian useful things. Remember he spent quite a few loops not even knowing he was a natural mind mage? Could have solved that with with five words or an anonymous note. Being told "you get access to the library by doing /this/" would have helped too, or even just agreeing to take books out for his younger self.

As far as anonumous notes-receiving one of them would be a huge sign of "HELLO THERE IS A TIMELOOPER WHO KNOWS WHO YOU ARE", and if Xvim doesn't want to tell him outright, there is hardly any reason to do it anonymously.
