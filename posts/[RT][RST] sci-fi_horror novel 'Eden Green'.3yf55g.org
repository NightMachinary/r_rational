Hey, all! I've been meaning to post here for a while, but wanted to wait until this week's giveaway. [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010ON836U/][My novel, /Eden Green/, is free on Amazon]] for the next few days.

I wrote it with the help of my good friend [[/u/FeepingCreature]], who also got me into HPMOR, Luminosity, and rationalism in general. The plot blurb is below; when we were outlining it, we wanted a main character who uses her brain and doesn't do stupid things for no reason. There's more info on [[http://homework.never-ends.net/edengreen/][the book's official page]], including a soundtrack and TVTropes link.

Here's my big question: I definitely think it qualifies as rational fiction, but what about rational/ist?/ I'd say Eden uses a lot of amateur rationalist/scientific methods Ã  la Luminosity, and if you were a complete newcomer to rationalism, it might teach you a few things.

But the bit about the story being a 'puzzle' doesn't fit; if anything, I intended it more as Lovecraftian, where a lot of what happens is ultimately inexplicable and horrifying. Without spoiling anything, all the rationalism in the world won't be enough to completely solve the problems Eden faces.

Anyway, I hope everyone gets a kick out of this and lets me know what they think. There's also an audiobook, if anyone would like to PM me for a free Audible code. And I'm [[http://homework.never-ends.net/newnight/][currently working on a semi-sequel]], in which the new main character is less 'over-analytical nerd girl' and more 'former cop and only sane man around'.

*BLURB*

/Warning: Contains body horror, contamination, implied eternal suffering, gun use, needles, and spiders./

In a single drop of contaminated blood, there writhe millions of needle-shaped cells. When introduced to a host, they spread --- healing wounds, replenishing fluids, patching bone. The host becomes unstoppable; even complete destruction of its brain isn't necessarily the end. All their cells are gradually replaced, enhanced.

Eden Green is the third human to see the needles in action, after her best friend Veronica accepts them without thinking. Patient Zero is Tedrin, a shady manipulator who offers the corruption as a path to immortality. Only Eden, a rationalist by nature, questions Tedrin's motives; she can't help imagining an eternity as a human weapon trapped in a body made of needles.

Armed with reason, humor, and a shotgun, she sets out to learn as much as she can about the parasite --- and how to save her sanity, Veronica, and the world.


** Rationalist fiction can /absolutely/ be set in an irrational-seeming world (see: HPMOR). That said, it's a fun-sounding premise - I look forward to reading it.

Ohohoho.

That generally goes without saying when the technological imbalance includes nanotechnology.

*** I may have [[http://i.imgur.com/3WhHRo8.jpg][clapped my hands in glee]] when I got that review.

I don't think the needles count as nanotech, since they're organic, but yeah, same principle. Glad to hear (so far) that this still qualifies as rationalist! I guess I was putting too much weight on the 'plot puzzle' element.

**** Emotional punishment and body horror are both fun for me to read (and write, my god), so I'm prioritizing this story. c:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_nanotechnology]["Wet" nanomachines are a thing.]] Ribosomes and enzymes qualify as nanoassemblers, though they aren't quite general. Have you seen the animated renders of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-uuk4Pr2i8][organic molecules doing their thing?]]

The sidebar is more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules. But the plot puzzle element doesn't necessitate that the problem is actually /solvable,/ just that the information that goes into character conclusions and decisions is made available to the reader so they have competitive ground with the main character.

***** Oh man, I remember those renders. That's pretty much what I picture going on with the needle symbiote, albeit a lot faster and pointier.

I get what you mean now. I really hope I pulled that off in the book!

** Finished your book, it was good. I really enjoyed that all three of the main characters felt real and like they were making the best decision from /their/ point of view, which leads to fucked up conflicts and situations.

Reading your book reminded me of the same mental beating that reading Blindsight or Echopraxia gave me, and I'm starting to think I might be an intellectual masochist.

I look forward to reading a sequel if you end up writing one!

*** 50% of the way through. I'm liking that Veronica's secret isn't actually stated (so far), but it's not exactly hard to figure out, either, unless I'm making a hilarious mistake. I also like that she's a shitty person regardless, I expect no special treatment from RT authors.

The mock murder was agony, even worse than Ted's bowels being turned to soup. There's something about teeth caving in and/or breaking that seems so much more horrifying to me.

*** Awesome! My partner in crime is a huge fan of /Blindsight/ (I've never read it) and I enjoy being cruel to my characters, so I'm glad we managed to replicate the torturous experience.

I'm definitely working on a sequel, and you can subscribe to updates [[http://homework.never-ends.net/newnight/][here]] if you want. I also always appreciate reviews!
