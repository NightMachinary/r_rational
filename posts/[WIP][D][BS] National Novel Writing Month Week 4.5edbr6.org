This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which starts November 1st; we'll have four or five of these posts throughout the month.

- Want to check in your some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

(This thread will be pinned after a day or so.)

** Still going on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]], with a word-count of 56,000.

Just today, I've figured out how to get from where I'm currently writing to the finale; in other words, I've finally got a plan for the entire plot. Now I just need to keep up the writing to finish narrating the whole thing - a detail that I'll admit I've had some trouble with in the past.

*** Okay, suddenly an issue.

Yesterday, after watching a cartoon with an emotional impact, I felt unsatisfied with how I've been writing Extracts, and decided to take the day off to work on putting myself into the headspace of remembering that making the reader care about the characters is at least as important as the plot. No big deal - I took another day off narrative writing earlier in the month, thought up some worldbuilding elements, and I'm still ahead of NaNoWriMo's wordcount.

But today, I've been looking at the story draft... and it's not that I'm unsatisfied with it, I just have no /desire/ to get back to writing out what happens. I've done the basic tricks - carried my laptop to various places, put on various background music and/or noises, tried thinking about other parts of the story, tried /not/ thinking about the story, and so on. I think I've got an actual ugh-field developing.

I have thought of one possibly unpleasant possibility: this extreme drop in my desire came just after I figured out the story's complete plot. That is, as soon as I knew what would happen, I ended up with a day-and-a-half(-and-counting) of not having any interest in typing it out. Not entirely sure how I'd go about testing to see if that's actually how my brain is working, or if it is, how to deal with it.

Anyone have any alternative hypothesis, or possible solutions?

**** It sounds like you were absorbed in the story /because/ you didn't know how things were going to work out for your character and had fun making it up as you went. Since I doubt that you actually have the entire story in your head and only remember the majority of the plot through notes, I suggest throwing out all of your notes (just for the parts you haven't written yet) and start writing again when you think you have forgotten what your notes were.

It's a rather dramatic suggestion I admit, but it's an incredibly useful one. When someone is stuck for one reason or another, if he is forced to restart from an earlier point, then it can be very easy to push past the blocking point when one reaches the block again (as if he was building up momentum to smash it).

PS You may think of just keeping the notes and simply not look at them to be able to keep from losing them if my suggestion doesn't work. But I really recommend just either throwing them out or putting them someplace where you won't be able to read them until at least a week in the future. The reason is because whenever I had an easy way to retrieve my prior efforts, I kept falling into old patterns and couldn't be creative in doing something new. You need pressure to be innovative.

That seems all too plausible; for many years, my creative output took the form of participating in RPGs, particularly the collaborative storytelling kind, and my mind may have imprinted on and canalized that approach.

#+end_quote

Mm, maybe, maybe not; it's actually not that complicated a tale, and if I had a metaphorical gun to my head, could probably rewrite it from scratch without many significant changes.

I can run the existing story-notes through ROT13.com.

#+end_quote

That's what I was trying for with NaNoWriMo in the first place, but it seems that pushing for simple word-count isn't what's holding me back. :)

Okay: possible plan: Set aside "Extracts" for a /short/ time (as opposed to letting myself procrastinate it into indefinite hiatus), and focus on something else for a week. Maybe start toying with a background for another Solar System scale setting, with the assumption that an EM-drive-like reactionless thruster is workable. And then jump back into Extracts to see if I can give it a proper wrap-up.

Sound workable? Anyone have a better suggestion?

****** You have a problem with endings (see: tonnes of your prior stories). The titanic amount of writing that went into S.I. suggests that you do indeed enjoy making shit up as you go along. While there's nothing wrong with that, actually finishing is something of a virtue.

- Suggestion: in the future, try writing a piece of short fiction, the entirety of which you have in your head, and muster the willpower to finish writing it in an hour or two.

- Suggestion: think about what you're trying to accomplish as an author.

- Suggestion: the deadline of November 30^{th} is ridiculous and arbitrary. Agree to finish it when you're ready, and then absolutely don't renege on that agreement.

- Suggestion: finish writing out the plot details of the story, in the bracket-style method you've already started using, then fill in those brackets at whatever pace you so desire. Put yourself in the mindset of a person reading that part for the first time, and think about a) what they want to read, and b) what you want to tell them.

- Suggestion: re-read /Extracts/ from start to where-you-are-now, and improve. This is not a good idea, but it is an idea.

- Suggestion: what other projects are you working on? Organize and/or schedule all of those (the way you would if it was part of your job), then finish /Extracts/.

*Concluding thoughts:* it's probably important for your personal development that you finish /Extracts/, however that is accomplished. I dunno. I'm not your psychologist.

**** Good news - I've gotten rid of the ugh field!

It turns out that my problem wasn't nearly as much of a personal special-snowflake issue as I'd feared, but a fairly traditional minor writer's block, and all I had to do was murder a darling. Well, it wasn't even much of a darling, but I'd written myself into a minor corner about the next fully-narrated scene, and even when I tried to focus on writing some other part of the story, my attention kept getting drawn back to that one thing. So, as it turns out, all I had to do was come up with a quick way to write that scene out of existence, and I'm once again eager to jump back into the whole story-writing thing (as soon as I clear up my daily errands and have a couple of hours I can dedicate to focusing on writing).

You may now feel free to slap me upside the head for getting bogged down in and worrying about lower-probability possible causes instead of figuring out the higher-probability obvious thing.

Oh, and I now have further confirmation that I do my best writing in the shower. :)

A related note; I finally kicked myself in the rear hard enough that I managed to add a few words of first-draft narrative, instead of a writerly note enclosed in square brackets destined for eventual deletion. It wasn't /many/ words, but some is better than none, especially for my main goal of maintaining the habit of doing some writing daily.

** Welp, this is the final stretch.

I keep getting Facebook "memories" from my progress in 2013, which is somewhat demoralizing since I hit 50,000 words by the 19th. I'm at 41,000 (exactly) right now, which means that I need 9,000 words in the next 9 days, a rather sedate pace.

Plotwise ... there will be some massaging needed in editing. Sister Miriam and Sister Constance, what is even the point of you? You are going to get edited out of existence, or at least out of the final stretch of the story. Or maybe I will find something for you to do when I have more time to reflect. I really liked the idea of a tiny wrinkled old lady kicking ass in complete silence, but I might have to save her for the sequel, since this seems like one of those darlings that Stephen King is always talking about killing.

There aren't many chapters to go until the story is done though, and nothing /too/ serious has fallen apart. I think I am leaning toward the fight/retreat/fight option, which will require more than my 9,000 words remaining, especially if they're as dialogue-heavy as recent chapters have been. (Though I think much of that talking gets cut in the edit.)

And in the final few scenes, I'm just going full on 'member berries. 'member that wolf made of porcelain shards? 'member that ritual that let Adrianne walk on the bottom of the bay? 'member that onyx altar from the opening scene? 'member that ritual where they were going to kill a baby? 'member? 'member Ibrahim's locked away mindscape? 'member the secret wards around the castle? 'member that lighthouse in Sofia's mind? 'member that seed Sister Marigold put in Henry? 'member how Ventor took an oath not to eat or drink?

Not entirely sure how all the pieces fit, but I think I have most of it at this point. Tonight will have time set aside for final plotting.

Edit: As of 11/26 I have 2,500 words until the NaNo deadline, but 11 scenes left in the plotting document, which probably means more like 15 scenes. Based on my current pace, the fact that I'm traveling for Thanksgiving, and the funeral I'm attending, it's probable that I finish NaNo with room to spare but don't finish the book until about a week into December.

Edit 2: Reached 50,000 words written on 11/27!

The story updates (roughly) once per day and will for the next however many days it takes to complete, but there's nowhere to talk about it and it's only just barely available for people to read.

******* I'm another one of the people who checks daily (and did the same last year and the year before when it was published on fiction press) :). I haven't commented much because you mentioned that you preferred not to.

I'm really enjoying this story, it's my favourite stories of the ones you've written so far (closely followed by Glimwarden). The characters are well developed and each have their motivations and their voice. I feel that everyone acts as they do because it fits with their inner motivation and the way they define themselves instead of acting to go along with the story (which is something I sometimes felt with Shadow of the Limelight). And talking about character interactions, the banter between Henry and Sofia really works well and often made me smile.

** Whelp, I failed miserably when it came to writing anything for this month. Only a few thousand words to make a first chapter, and a lot of notes on how the rules behind a time-travel power work. I definitely plan on writing the story, but it's going to have to be another time since this has been a terrible month for me.

However, the good news is that I think I have outlined the power well enough that I can base a scientific RPG game around it. It will be something that starts with people finding a strange device and they have to test it via the scientific method to learn how the time-travel ability works. The hardest part is figuring out how players' actions affect future events which retroactively influence the beginning of the quest.

I think I'll start in late December.

***** You're fine, you're not a jerk. I just assumed you weren't interested which isn't a bad thing. And if you're not interested, I already have an accountability partner, but I can always have more!

I'm comfortable sharing my writing but I wouldn't want to force it on anyone so I'm happy just sharing word counts. I was planning on starting 1st of Jan, but starting earlier will get me a headstart on beeminder so I think that'll be good.

My story is rational (not rational/ist/) feminist glbt supernatural romance, so you know, not the genre typically most associated with [[/r/rational]] . A 1500 year old vampire and an American deserter meet in ww2 Italy, and fall in love. The soldier is a cowardly man who is scared of death. It's about adjusting to the reality of living with an immortal being you can't begin to understand, participating in Bad Occult Things, and learning to understand each other as their relationship changes as Supernatural Stuff Happens (he's made into a supernatural servant-thrall, then into a vampire, both of which create big discontinuities in their relationship, and he goes from being viewed as we might view a RealDoll to an equal).

Looks like about 50% of it will take place in ~1944-1948, 50% in "present day", and an epilogue about 100 years in the future.

Here's a little context-free 600 word taste of part of it, if you're curious: [[http://pastebin.com/w77NDT3H]] Context: broadly, William has just turned Red into a vampire, and their relationship has grown quite distant as a result. Note that Our Vampires have a thing about giving gifts and writing letters. They have a very rigid set of social norms, and if it is disrupted, the result is often rather bloody.

** Sitting at 45,000 right now. Ran into the first major roadblock this week, a piece of the plot that I realized I really dislike how I'd planned it. Wrote it anyway. I'll come back to it after, like I'll come back to a lot of things. First: finish the smoking book.

This is the second part of the book I was working on for last year's NaNo, but this year I decided to start doing interludes. Interludes are awesome. I get to take a step away from the single-PoV narrative for a few seconds, show something interesting happening elsewhere/elsewhen in the incredibly expansive world, sprinkle in some hints to the plot and/or introduce some character/worldbuilding that'll show up later, and then step right back over to the main character. Also helps me get back on track when I lose steam.

What are your guys' thoughts on interludes in Epic Fantasy?

** Well I made it past 50,000, so I am technically a winner! Go me. I don't have a novel, or a first draft, or anything I want to revisit except the two short stories though. Things I have learned include:

1. I can still actually write every day, so I should keep doing that. I have signed up for 750words.com as an incentive to that (they have stickers!)

2. I am good at world building and conversation and mostly terrible at action and, er, plot

3. It doesn't count as planning if you don't stick to the plan or even refer to it very much. Also 1b, it's hard to find time to refer to a plan when doing that many words. Perhaps I need practice doing this at slower speeds?

4. It was good to have some other goals in mind, I had a terrible mood slump as soon as I hit 50k, but I am cheered to have hit my other goal of actually posting a thing on here and winning a not terribly hotly contested challenge :-)

5. At least a few people like the stuff that I've been prepared to share, and some have made useful suggestions. I'd like to build a bit of a beta reader group who aren't my bestest mates.

6. My spelling is terrible when typing at speed, and scrivener is largely annoyingly pointless for me at this stage
