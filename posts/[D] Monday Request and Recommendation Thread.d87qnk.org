Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18304/infigeas-online][Infigeas Online]] - Second favorite on this list, might not even be dead, the author said he would come back. Do not be driven away by the litrpg tag, this is way better than any story in that genre that I've found.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20472/monstrous][Monstrous]] - My favorite on the whole list, I think it really would have gone somewhere if it kept updating.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18724/a-sh-ai-el][A SH AI EL]] - This one was really good while it lasted, and it actually lasted a relatively long time.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16075/a-broken-world-dropped-pending-rewrite][A Broken World]] and its dropped [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24374/a-broken-world-rewrite][Rewrite]] - In the first one the protagonist went crazy and the second one has almost no chapters before it was dropped.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18633/jadepunk][Jadepunk]] - Really good writing, but not that many chapters.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/znt-the-sea-of-knowledge.236443/][The Sea of Knowledge]] - Really only good for me because I expected an industrial revolution, it was dropped before this even came close.

Few grammar mistakes, consistent pacing, interesting rationalization of the gamer trope. That's why I check up on it frequently.

** I'd like to recommend Joe Abercrombie, a relatively popular mainstream fantasy author. He's just come out with a new book in a new trilogy, so it seems like a good time for it.

His books are cynical, but not for its own sake, and he has some quite amazing characterizations. He's also quite genre-savvy, and plays with the form of the fantasy novel and forms and genres in general. He has a truly amazing talent for describing escalating chaos, situations spinning out of control in ways that are highly detailed and have a kind of verisimilitude.

If I had to suggest an entry point, I wouldn't start with his original fantasy trilogy, /The First Law/. Read /Best Served Cold/ instead. If you have a soft spot for YA, his YA series is quite good, it starts with /Half a King/.

/Best Served Cold/ is a revenge plot that takes the form of a series of heist-like setups. It's shockingly well executed. Here it is on Goodreads:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2315892.Best_Served_Cold]]

and here's Abercrombie's Goodreads page:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/276660.Joe_Abercrombie]]

I get the sense that we're in the middle of a bit of a drought on the subreddit for recommendations, and perhaps the web serial space is a little mined out. So I thought I'd focus on something a little different this time, hope someone finds it useful.

*** I entirely agree with this recommendation; Abercrombie writes the best characters in published fantasy today. If you're a fan of the larger-than-life but still believable characters of PGTE, their banter and the witty, sarcastic POV voice then there's a good chance you'll enjoy Abercrombie's works because he's the best I've ever read at that.

He also writes some fascinating and unique concepts including a Fantasy Kill Bill, a fantasy Western, a fantasy story where the entire novel solely covers a 3 day battle and his latest trilogy is a fantasy industrial revolution; all of these within the same fantasy world too.

I agree with starting at Best Served Cold and then looping back and reading the rest of the First Law books in published order.

(His very latest novel A Little Hatred was brilliant as well and i'm Interested to hear from others who have read it).

*** Second the author recommendation. However, I would actually recommend The First Law trilogy over Best Served Cold. Perhaps it's just the order I read them, but I found Best Served Cold to be a bit boring. The First Law is IMO iconic and has some great characters.

Half a King series is also good.

Another author/series I would recommend is Richard Nell's Ash and Sand series [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise?ac=1&from_search=true][(first book)]]. Like Abercrombie it has pretty good characters and a crappy world, but is more of a coming-of-age arc than straight grimdark. The way it's done doesn't give of that feeling of pointless hopelessness that a lot of grimdark stories do. For me that feeling is a hard block against reading "grimdark" fantasy - I can't read some series that many people seem to recommend highly like NK Jemisin The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, anything by Mark Lawrence, R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing etc.

#+begin_quote
  On one hand, the book is great - action is engaging, characters very fun, writing good. The first say 80% of the book was splendid.

  On the other, it's another The First Law book, and it treats its characters similar to the previous trilogy. They get their small successes, minor victories, and invariably are later punished with a grander defeat.

  If you're a fan of that, this is a 5-star book. I struggled through the end, and so taking a bit off.
#+end_quote

In particular, the ending of The First Law (the entire trilogy) I found unsatisfying. Consistent and (if you share a certain bleak outlook on how the world works) realistic, but unsatisfying as hell. The supremely overconfident bad guy gets away with it, breaking any remaining backbone of the main character in progress. Fuck that shit :P

** Have a couple odd requests:

- A work that features real-world scientists or engineers with legitimate understanding of How Things Work coming into contact with those Who Claim To Understand How Things Work But Really Do Not (but can still maybe do amazing things, so they're not just cranks). So, for example, something with interactions between mundane engineers and Worm tinkers, where the latter spout off some bullshit technobabble, but on further probing are revealed to have a barely passing high school understanding of mechanics or circuits or whatever. Basically exploring /why/ tinkers can't just make a vastly simplified technology in their tinker specialty, or describe with connection to existing theory some of the basic principles under which their machinery operates (or, if further theory is needed, describe /that/ theory until you eventually build up to the understanding necessary to figure out their tech)
- A crossover between Harry Potter & Naruto, where Naruto was orphaned as a baby foiling the plot of the evil Madara Uchiha and goes to ninja school in Japan, run by headmaster Hiruzen Sarutobi, where he takes classes from the sketchy potions master Orochimaru and befriends muggleborn know-it-all Haruno Sakura etc. etc. etc. Or maybe Orochimaru is a better Voldemort surrogate (given the snake theme and obsession with immortality), but he'd be harder to tie into the Kyūbi plot
- A work of fiction where one's power is inversely proportional to peoples' expectations. So to use another Worm example -- if you go up against a very self-confident Lung who believes himself able to trivially crush you beneath his heel, you're actually able to do the same to him. But if you appear the scary, strong monster to a small child, you're powerless to harm them. The updating happens in real-time, so if Lung takes note of your strength and invulnerability, you become proportionally weaker

Some recommendations: I've been enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/1/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic][this]] lately and think it might appeal to the sensibilities of some here. Pretty funny, too!

A non-written recommendation: the website aliexpress.com! Has pretty much become my go to for all purchases of little electronic dongles, cheap plastic doodads, or really anything small & lightweight & generic. Most everything I've bought there is like 80-90% off what I can find elsewhere, you just have to wait a few weeks for shipping. Recent purchases have included a replacement Pixel 3 screen ($40 vs. $80), an NVME/PCI-E adapter ($2 vs $15), a cat backpack ($20 vs. $150), & a bunch of cheap, novelty jewelry (pretty much everything you'd find for $5-$20 when searching, say, 'science earrings' on etsy can be found on there for $0.5-$2, and afaict it's completely identical).

** I've recently come up with a solution to a worldbuilding problem I posed to myself a while ago: Is it possible to create a hard magic system around the magic system of Harry Potter (a series which intentionally leaves a lot unexplained about magic) while following the spirit if not to the letter of the magic system that J.K. Rowling layed out in the books. In other words no direct contradiction but some minor indirect contradictions.

People have definitely attempted and succeeded before:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/death-by-water-harry-potter-the-culture.44788/][Death by Water]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10446022/1/Continuing-HPMoR-Hacking-the-Source-of-Magic][Hacking the source of magic]]

But saying that magic was the prank of an ancient post-singularity alien race or where spells are programs and magicals users didn't feel satisfying and seemed to (figuratively) take away the magic of the setting.

I was wondering if anyone has come across a Harry potter fanfiction or even original fantasy that has a magic system with a similar range of effects to harry potter's magic system but give more details on how the magic system works in a way that satisifies the following conditions:

- All of magic (hopefully with many varied effects) is at least implied to have come from one source.

- Magic is at least implied to be created in a process and doesn't just exist. This doesn't necessarily mean that magic is created by something intelligent, it can result from natural phenomena just as life resulted from evolution.

- The explanation is satisfying and makes sense both before and after you think about it.

- I'm not saying the system has to be perfect, there can be gaps and for magic to exist in story in the first place you need to have some level of suspension of disbelief.

*** Unsounded has an excellent and internally consistent magic system. It is functionally "magic as programming," in that (for example) the way spells are cast emulates the process of giving instructions to a computer, but it's handled in an organic way that doesn't negate the magical-ness. The comic is ongoing so there isn't yet a full explanation of how it originated, but it is strongly implied that the metaphysical "network" that manages reality and carries out instructions from mages was created and doesn't just exist. There is a decent amount of info on the magic system in the comic itself, and the author answers fan questions about the finer details on her Tumblr.

While I'm asking for a hard magic system that is not the only thing I'm asking for. What I want is a magic system that has a satisfying explanation for how it came about or how it works. Preferably both.

If you introduce a plausible technology based on current understanding of the world and extrapolate it is science fiction. Magic is independent of that, magic is when you create a new rule, set of rules, or sets of rules and then extrapolate. I'm asking for a story that gives a single rule and runs with it.

An example would be Break Blade, a story whose magic system is basically the ability for humans to telekinetically manipulate quartz crystals. There are countless complicated technologies that descend from this rule, with each type of quartz having the capability to be manipulated differently. This isn't explained like a technical manual in the story, instead the readers are given bits and pieces throughout the story (this quartz is good for vibrations, this one for spinning, this one for floating.)

***** I promise I'm not trying to be intentionally obtuse.

It sounds like I you want a hard magic system where the rules have been explored and codified for (or by) the characters to at least some extent.

I'm just not getting what you're looking for when you start talking about the /source/ of magic, though. At best, a story can just make the source one more step removed from the reader (à la "if God made everything, who created God?").

If I'm on the right track, some contemporary fantasy might be:\\

****** It's a little complicated because I'm asking for a lot of different things. The one you're confused about I didn't explain very well.

What I meant when I said it would only have one source was that the suspension of disbelief is only possible to break once, when the magic system is introduced and explained. This is a fundamentally different criteria from asking for a hard magic system which only requires that the magic has limits.

What I was trying to get at in my previous comment was that I still want the story to have an element that doesn't make sense in reality, it wouldn't be fantasy otherwise, I just want this element to be restricted to a single element. For example if magic was divine in its origin then to fill my requirement would be for it to only originate from one god. You could also have it come from multiple gods but then you would have to explain their existence as originating from the same explanation.

What makes my request complicated is that I am asking for the magic to follow that one explanation and be a hard magic system, both of these requirements are difficult to do alone much less together while still having a good story. Especially when what I mean by good story is that the magic makes sense according to the explanation.

This might make it sound like I'm asking for science fiction, and there are a few science fiction stories I've read that meet these criteria, but it is possible for fantasy to meet these requirements while still staying fantasy. Admittedly there is usually some overlap of the genres when these requirements are met.

*** David Edding's /Elenium/ series (and its' sequel series) might provide a solution.

Magic in there is due to the direct influence of the gods, responding to the prayers and requests of their followers. The gods have the ability to hear any requests their worshippers make, incredible ability to move and reshape matter and create illusions good enough to fool each other, can mess with time, and in at least one case it's pointed out in-story that a certain spell works a certain way (despite not making logical sense) because that's how the god in question /thinks/ it works (the Troll-gods being poor logicians).

The gods, in turn, get /their/ power from their worshippers; they feed on emotions, especially when intensely felt (usually positive ones, like love, adoration, etc., though one particular evil deity seems to subsist entirely on the less wholesome parts of the psyche) Some of this energy goes into sustaining the god, and the rest the god is free to use to grant spells to their worshippers - or to use for any other reason (it's worth noting that some gods, for various reasons, explicitly do not provide spells). Among other things, this acts as a power limiter; a god with only a few worshippers can only provide very small amounts of magic, and a god with none is powerless.

Any given spell is thus a polite and somewhat formalised request to a given god to do something, which that deity might or might not honour (but generally will because they like to be considered reliable, lest their followers convert to other churches). People with a particularly good relationship with a given deity might even make direct requests outside the scope of a formal spell.

...there is one particular macguffin which runs outside of these rules (i.e. the source of its power was from something else) which has a lot to do with /why/ it was a macguffin, but most of the in-setting magic ran by the above rules.

It's not until at least once they reach the oasis town that the MC's personality gets any detail other than "I don't want to die.", but in the most recent chapters there are some interesting bits of both social shenanigans and casual uplift attempts (funding the alchemist trying to make cheap healing potions). It also helps the writing's technically good enough that I don't get a headache trying to parse it, unlike a few other RoyalRoad stories I've tried to read.

*** I can think of four of good quality:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25962/cultivating-earth][Cultivating Earth]] - My favorite at the moment, if the premise sounds good to you I heavily recommend giving it a try. Has not updated recently but the writing and story quality is excellent.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/incompatible-system-mass-effect-au.777778/][Incompatable System]] - A side project of a well respected fanfic writer, you can read through the intro to see if you'll like it. Very good writing quality.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26574/a-major-in-necromancy][A Major in Necromancy]] - Author does a good job at describing this one, good writing quality.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/unnamed.57272/page-2#post-12985753][Unnamed]] - original story I found, pretty good, if a bit weird so far.

** What would you recommend to someone as an introduction to pro-immortality ideology? Preferably stand-alone stuff; fanfic would be counterproductive for this purpose, I think. Fiction or non-fiction, blog posts, whatever. I'd like something short (think large pamphlet) and something a bit longer (think short-story).

*** Not sure I subscribe fully to the ideology, but Bostrom's "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant" seems like a no-brainer here.

Not that I'm pro death, just that we might need to get our house in order before immortality as a priority ceases to look unseemly. Ecology, inequality, etc.

****** You're missing the others. If everyone's immortal, wealth hoarding will eventually be seen as the evil it is. After a few hundred years you're going to ask why there has to be an overlord at all. And then comes revolution.

******* I think the main difference comes from how you imagine immortality is obtained. If it's some kind of pill that needs to be regularly taken to stop Death from claiming you, then it seems likely to me that only the rich will be able to use it, at least for a while. Meanwhile, if it's some kind of virus that spreads among all humans and gives everyone 'infected' with it immortality, then the world as a result of that would be very different.

***** Unfortunately, I think the issue is more complicated. Most people in their 30s are likely to experience relatively catastrophic climate change and have to deal with startling inequality right outside their doors, right now and in the moment. I doubt adding immortality to that equation would make people overcome the coordination problems that exist now, and make the insulated elites anything but more insulated an elite.

**** This sentiment is exactly what the fable is arguing against. We should do everything in our power to end aging as soon as possible. "But the problems..." Meh. We'll figure it out. Honestly, life extension is technology I'm least worried about by far. Climate change, war, etc. will kill some of us. Aging kills all of us.

***** Climate change isn't really bad because it will kill some humans, as it already has. It's irreparably bad because it represents a squandering of biodiversity and ecology. Basically, we have a huge endowment left to us by millions of years of evolution that we're throwing away for little gain. If we survive as a species (I'm not saying climate change will wipe humans out, because it won't, but there are other existential risks) we'll feel the loss of the ecology quite keenly. The loss to science alone is immeasurable.

That said, these aren't either/or problems. It does make sense to work to research and slow or stop senescence and we waste money on much more trivial things.

** *Request:* Stories in with main protagonist major motivation to do hard or/and heroic things is love or friendship, like in the Good Student where Nic studied hard all his life for the chance to enroll in the school with his childhood friend/love interest(can't recommend this story, begging is cool but second half is just no good in my opinion). The "purer" the fellings the merrier. Fantasy preferred.

*Recommendation:* [[https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-61792][Domestic na Kanojo]] --- romance manga with great characterisations, quite believable unlike-manga-and-more-like-a-good-book overall quality of the world, plot, characters and theirs relationships (although still with a few not so great manga tropes). Trigger warnings: low key pedofililia, low key suicide themes, sex scenes. (There is anime filmed this year but I didn't watched it)
