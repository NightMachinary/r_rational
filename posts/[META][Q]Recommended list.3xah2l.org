Recently found this subreddit, and already found 3 good things to read from it. However, it is hard to find more- most of paging through the subreddit is posts of each new chapter, and thus you have to go through many pages. Could we get an overall list, sorted by source material(With original items having their own section)?


** There's a list on the subreddit's wiki: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][Link]]

** Responses in the order in which I thought of them within each category (don't take it as an order of preference or anything). Lots of fanfic in this list because it's what people tend to write. Assume they're rational unless stated otherwise.

Note that "rationalist" means "rational + demonstrates analytical techniques", so I note where that's applicable (if I remember; a lot of this is fuzzy due to sheer quantity).

Finished:

- [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Waves Arisen]], rationalist Naruto fanfiction
- [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] (HPMoR), rationalist Harry Potter fanfiction, possibly the ur-example of the concept of rationalist fanfiction (probably wrong about that however)
- [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]], original story (it's true, I do read original stories) about a world where fame literally grants superpowers (by one of this subreddit's moderators, [[/u/alexanderwales]])
- [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]], original story about an alternate Earth where superheroes are forged from "trigger events" (moments of intense emotional or physical trauma) by [[/u/Wildbow]]
- [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Pact]], original story about modern magic users and creatures where words have power and consequences (also by Wildbow)
- The Two Year Emperor, original story (kinda) about an ordinary, albeit clever man transported to a world that runs on Dungeons and Dragons rules as written by [[/u/eaglejarl]]; (this one is no longer available for free, there's a purchase link on Amazon [[http://www.amazon.com.au/The-Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74][here]] if that sounds like your thing)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]], Superman/Lex Luthor fanfiction (by alexanderwales again; the next three are all by him)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][A Bluer Shade of White]], Frozen fanfiction (yes, it is rational)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][The Last Christmas]], Santa Claus fanfiction (ditto)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], Terminator fanfiction
- [[http://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]], original story about superheroes that appear yearly, doubling in power (and the damage done in their tumultuous "trigger") each time; the whole thing is so much more than just that, but I don't want to spoil it (by Sam Hughes, who wrote the next two as well)
- [[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], original story about magic analysed as science; again, it goes on to be much more but I don't want to spoil it
- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/qntm-s-author-page][Sam Hughes' author page at the SCP Foundation wiki]], I recommend reading his entries from 2015 (you may want to read the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/about-the-scp-foundation][Foundation's about page]] and some of the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/top-rated-pages][top rated pages]] from the wiki to get a feel for the setting first if you're new to SCP)
- [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]], My Little Pony fanfiction about an AI that is definitely not horrifying, no siree, just your average friendly AI over here
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442][Cenotaph]], Worm fanfiction with a small deviation from canon
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2417525/chapters/5347754][Wake]], sequel to Cenotaph

Updating often:

- [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]], HPMoR metafic which is very different in character (it has a [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/previously-on-harry-potter-and-methods.html][summary of HPMoR]] if you don't want to read it, but obviously heavily spoils the plot of that fic)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]], rationalist Pokemon fanfiction
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][r Animorphs: The Reckoning]], Animorphs fanfiction by [[/u/TK17Studios]]
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], original story about a student mage caught in a time loop
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]], Naruto fanfiction by eaglejarl (who wrote The Two Year Emperor above, so you can take this as a free sample of writing style if you wish)
- [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/taking-root-1-1/][Twig]], original story about emotionally savvy, enhanced children fighting biopunk monsters in a world where the British defeated the American colonies using biological superweapons (by Wildbow)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up the Dark]], Naruto fanfiction by [[/u/Velorien]]
- [[http://junctureserial.blogspot.com.au/2015/08/juncture-11.html][Juncture]], original story about all sorts of time travel tropes by [[/u/AHatfulOfBomb]]

Updating rarely, possibly abandoned:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]], Harry Potter/Dungeons and Dragons crossover fanfiction (protagonist is an original character and a munchkin to his core)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine][Weaver 9]], a Worm metafiction which swaps the role of two important characters (casting a significant villain in the role as, er, "hero")

I can go into more detail about what separates the Naruto/Harry Potter fanfictions on request. They all have their charms but differ quite a lot in theme and characterisation.

I've also probably forgotten a whole bunch of things. Apologies also if I got authors wrong or missed somebody who's active on this subreddit (I don't remember usernames for everyone who is, sadly).

There's also a lot of great one-shots on the subreddit, some in the challenge threads that get posted every two weeks.

Funny you should mention that, because [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][it's back]]...

And thank you for posting the Amazon link.

*** Wait, why haven't I heard of The Waves Arisen before now?? This is so good, everything seems close to perfect. The characters feel slightly more unfamiliar than what I usually read, but nothing about it has disappointed me yet. I guess that's what I get for spending so much of my time on FFN

*** (Selfplug): If you already know dangan ronpa canon, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10630743/1/Light-in-Despair-s-Darkness][Light in Despair's Darkness]] has been pretty well received by that fandom.

** I've written a few stories for the challenge threads. All short stories, can be found [[https://kishoto.wordpress.com/][here:]]

I only use that blog for posting for the contest, so it's pure content (not the best formatting though, the search bar is your friend!) I'm not a very experienced author, but you're free to take a look and decide if you like my style, although it's not very rationalist in some cases.

Particularly, I think my favorite ones up there are Clark, Requests and Cryonics with Claptrap.

**** I can't speak for others, but The Maker's Ark is the third novel in the series that starts with The Fall of Doc Future. I include a short bit with links to the start and my other work at the beginning of each chapter. The prologue of Fall has a brief preface on what it's all about.
