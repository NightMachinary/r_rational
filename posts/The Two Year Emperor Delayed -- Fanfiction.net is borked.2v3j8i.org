I just tried to upload today's chapter and I'm getting a 503 "No server is available to handle this request" error. I'll try again periodically through the day, but no promises when it will be available.


** Thank you for letting us know.

*** Thank you so much! I really appreciate it.

What's your opinion on Book 2 vs Book 1? They are extremely different and Book 2 is a bit of an experiment for me, so I'm curious what the audience feels about it.

**** I'm worried about Suze. I wasn't so worried about Jake, because as dire as things seemed, I thought he could make it through. Suze, while she is (or at least was) a wonderful person, I'm not sure she's got what it takes to be Death.

Given the previous mentorship role, I'm a little surprised Suze hasn't asked Jake for help. But I guess part of it is that this is her show, not his now.

**** I found book one intriguing with the munchkinry problem solving. Honestly book two has failed to connect with me so far, and if not for book one I would not have continued reading. To me book one read like an action adventure and book two is more of a character drama, and that just isn't as much my cup of tea. Your writing is excellent in both though.

***** Adventure story / character drama: yeah, that's fair.

If you liked the first book, "[[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com/2014/05/greendog-press-is-open-for-business-our.html][One Hot Night]]" is likely to be up your alley. </shameless_plug>

**** I'd stopped at the end of book 1, reasoning that it could only go downhill from there (I mean, how can you up a singularity?). Of course, after having done the meteor stunt, antimatter, and all the other infinity exploits, you didn't really have any other way to climax the story.

As a hint, you may want to tone down your book-2 disclaimer (where you say it'll be radically different), that's what made me say , "the end!".

Of course, I may continue reading it going forward.

** Thank you for the heads up. ff.net doesn't always have the best internal workings.
