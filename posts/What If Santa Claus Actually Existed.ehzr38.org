** They understated the utility of wormholes. They could just as easily move across time as space, so he could spend an hour at every house if he wants.

They never explain how they find the average distance between houses. People always seem to assume they're evenly distributed, which isn't even remotely true. People tend to live in high-population areas, which will make Santa's job much easier.

*** If he had easy access to wormholes, he'd basically have a time machine. That would still mean he would need to be immortal or die working the first christmas. Would explain why he needs rest of the year for vacay, except that he could sleep on work because of the time machine.

Maybe the elves are not elves, just timetraveling Santa?

He was born in 270. He'd have to be immortal regardless.

***** Well there are other options. Like it being hereditary or other kind of traveling title. Was the movie "what happened to santa claus" the one where he fell from the roof and the MC became the new santa? But these problems are mostly solved by the timetravel stuff again. Except if there is some snag and it doesn't transfer and that's why Santa is gone.

That's /The Santa Clause/, a movie I will forever hold in contempt for no other reason than because it vastly increased the rate at which people misspell "Santa Claus."

******** Might be whooshing, but the Santa /Cklause/ is alluding to the fact that the main character became Santa Claus, because of a clause stating that anyone putting on the suit becomes Santa Claus, thus it being called the "Santa Clause".

That, and the writers at Disney probably wanted to use the silly pun.

** I think we can all agree that Santa is a very Christianity influenced creature, being loosely based on St. Nicholas. In that case there are some more things we can infer:

One of the superpowers saints get in Christian lore is bilocation or multilocation; implying that St. Nick doesn't have to visit all homes sequentially.

Jesus also famously fed hundreds of people with a single loaf of bread and two fish, which all fit in a single basket, so if we allow Santa sa similar power he only needs to carry one copy of each toy. Most kids will want fairly similar things as others within their geographic area. A bigger concern is whether his copying ability creates exact replicas or if it's capable of some fuzzy logic to account for things like height and decorative preferences. For example one generic tricycle may be enough to get copies for a short girl who wants pink and a big boy who wants orange flames on blue, depending on writers' interpretation.

As for getting fat, maybe he's reverse copying the milks and cookies he collects and then bringing them back out when he gets back to feed the elves, or maybe multilocation just burns more calories than you'd expect.

*** But yea. If he was real, magic would be real, or I guess he could do that shit with tech too. So probably aliens or something instead, because it would be more probable than he figuring out all that tech himself.

UNLESS maybe if he was immortal and just had enough time, which could work, but he would really need some industry stuff because making shit from ground up yourself is /hard/. Like those youtubers making toasters etc from nothing have shown us.

But Santa has elves. Small little slaves slaving away. Made by magic? Are they aliens? Maybe Santa used his tech to gather the small elves that some countries traditional lore talks about. Like in Finland we had all kinds of elves, home elves, sauna elves...

So he might have enslaved them to work in his industry and that's why we don't see and believe in the elves anymore.

But... the toys kids get tend to be made by these huge corporations nowadays. No way elves make iphones and shit. So maybe the US army already got Santa. The spying game of elves is good as Santa kept lists of who is good and who is bad.

If supernatural entities exist, they are either in a bunker or have been dissected by US forces.
