In CYOA prompts, I've frequently seen the Inspired Inventor perk. Essentially, you get five "charges" a day, and each of these charges can be used to learn a specific subset of knowledge. For example. If you put one charge in augmentation, you'll get a completely understanding of cybernetics and how to create them using nothing but a box of scraps. A couple of charges in medicine, and you'd be able to cure cancer.

So, the prompt is, you wake up one day on modern day earth with this ability. How do you use this to change the world?


** Day 1: 5 charges in Prioritisation

Day 2+: Whatever your new knowledge of prioritisation says you should take

*** This is a good idea, but with something as nebulous as Prioritization, what does that mean exactly?

Does this knowledge change how your mind works, or does your mind change how this knowledge works?

You could set out to change the world, except you get distracted and instead you sink charges into cooking and molecular gastronomy to create the world's most advanced soufflé.

**** it's your promt that's nebulous, you said it gives you a specific subset of knowledge and then immediately exceeded that ability with your example. Augmentation is extremely vague, complete understanding of cybernetics and how to create them and the ability to make complex medical grade machinery with garbage is far outside the scope of just having "a specific subset of knowledge". And apparently the ability can be used to get knowledge that humanity doesn't possess, because we don't know how to cure cancer.

Just saying, you gotta clean up your own mess before you start throwing around words like soufflé.

***** It's not "my mess". This particular CYOA has been around since 2015 at minimum. I copied the examples of inspired inventor directly from the prompt.

** AI alignment, however many charges it takes. AGI, however many charges it takes. Basically done.

Otherwise, there are the usual bunch of tech that would be world changing, you listed two. Longevity, cryonics, cheap space travel, safe genetic engineering, nanotech (which probably do everything on this list if it can be used safely)

** What the Inspired Inventor perk lets you do is bootstrap up from basically nothing in a very short amount of time - but whenever stories are written using this perk, the authors immediately run into one of two common dilemmas:

- They need resources, so they have to spend charges on knowledge that will let them build the tools that will build the tools that will build the tools that will let them build what they want. From a narrative perspective that tends to get boring, so either the author commits to making that interesting, or handwave it all away, OR:

- Instead of all that, they jump straight into artificial intelligence, software, and/or computer programming, since you can basically start that with a laptop/desktop/smartphone. Then they let their daemons and VIs and AIs handle all the minutiae.

Another comment chain already talked about AGIs so I won't rehash that too much, but maybe we can talk about a possible set of beginning steps regarding charge distribution and the Tinker tooling-up cycle, at least.

Day 1: Energy, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biology.

Inspired Inventor is our fulcrum, but we need to first build the lever by which we move the world.

We start gaining knowledge of the fundamental fields of science - it's useless to start tech-ing up until we know what we want to tech-up *in.* We assimilate the knowledge, and then we start thinking about paths we want to go down.

Day 2: Software engineering, hardware engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and manufacturing.

With this, we can start building the tools that will help us build the tools we need. 21st century Earth has a lot of very sophisticated tools if we know where to look and have the money, but if we're starting with scant resources, this will help us tech up.

We siphon funding from ultra-billionaires and criminal organizations, and use them to buy raw goods and/or machines, sending them to discreet locations for us to work on.

We dismantle electronics, make power tools, 3D printers, CNC mills, etc. We program VIs (maybe AIs) to help us with the minutiae of resource gathering and drudge work.

Day 3: Nanotechnology, genetics, microbiology, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry.

We take a day to dive deeper into the small-end of the length scale - we use this knowledge to suss out viable paths for biological healing and manipulation. Maybe we make molecular-manipulation 3D printers, maybe we make DNA-based nanotech to synthesize custom proteins for chemical/organic materials, maybe we modify plants/animals to create beneficial byproducts.

We combine macro-level manufacturing with micro- and nano-level manufacturing, to make self-replicating nanomachines that can then make more of themselves (all under our control, of course). We can use them to make physical goods, or conduct biological repairs - we've officially solved material scarcity as well as cracked the immortality problem.

Day 4: Astronomy, stellar mechanics, aerospace engineering, gravity, quantum mechanics

By now we should have a small army of self-replicating synthesizers/replicators/manufacturing devices that will take any input we give it and make it to our exact specifications.

It'll take time to build up to critical mass, but we can now start moving up into the large-end of the length scale, as well as areas where the lines start to blur. We want to hedge our bets and spread out into the stars, but we need to be able to get there, and communicate with whatever we send up.

We launch a discreet rocket to the moon, and begin converting it into a base. Our stellar haven, home away from earth. We begin Von Neumann probe construction, to exponentially multiply and conquer the universe.

... Maybe we'll hold off on launching the Von Neumann probes until they've been given a safe mind-upload and/or properly-vetted AGI. Regardless, the capability exists.

Honestly, by Day 5, we'll likely have all the infrastructure in place to fundamentally uplift the entire human population, and charges can just be used to shore up knowledge in niche areas not covered by the initial set, i.e. brain-computer interfaces, mind uploading, picotechnology, etc.

Enjoy ruling as god-emperor of the universe!

** First, use your charges on Inspired Inventor perk to max out the perk itself.

Then, with your increased knowledge of how the Inspired Inventor perk works, max out any related subjects.

Once Inspired Inventor is as good as it can possibly get, then sociology, human psychology, politics, etc. Achieve world peace, universal basic income, etc. Stop people from killing each other. Create a planet of Friendly Human Intelligences.

Next, neurology, cybernetics, computation, etc., and then brain-machine interfaces. Figure out a way to make the most human robot brain & body possible, and then give eight billion people the opportunity to upload themselves.

Finally, space transport.
