** I like where this is going!

It also, honestly, really makes me want a Worm/Matrix-eqsue crossover.

What /weird/ kind of powers would manifest in a primarily uploaded society? How would physical powers effect the digital world?

** I don't actually know if it qualifies as Rational, but so far (only 3 chapters in) it seems fairly rational.

Worth being posted here at least, because of our wanking on and off about AI.

*** Fics from Spacebattles come up here pretty often actually, but the vast majority of them are not intended to be rational or rationalist and only cater to the general munchkinry and nerd culture of SB itself.

And the fact that spacebattlers aren't fond of rational culture and fiction is an understatement if I ever saw one. I've seen people bash and make fun of MoR even in threads that aren't related at all to these kinds of things. I remember that there was this average, nonrational fic in which some commenter simply wrote "I like this character because he's rational" which in the general context probably meant the casual definition of "smart". Literally the next post was MoR critique.

**** I've seen a lot of people on SB/SV that seem to dislike the genre as a result of some of their own personal biases.

One, the foremost example is usually given to be HPMOR, which has its own writing flaws and there is valid criticism to be made against the stylistic design vs it's intent as a work of (fan)fiction.

Two, it is seen by many to be an attempt to "STEM-ify" fiction. I think a lot of people who are into literature are naturally adverse to this since many of them have preconceived notions of the efficaciousness of science, mathematics logical reasoning etc. as well as some inherent dislike for these subjects (on average).

Three, many people just don't see the appeal. It's like a joke that gets lost in translation to the average audience member instead of playing to the common denominator of that particular audience. I would hazard a guess that many actually don't want to really think too hard about their entertainment if they just want some cool explosions or action scenes (the success of any Michael Bay film would suggest this), neatly regurgitated horror tropes, etc.to pass the time.

****** You can dislike something due to personal preferences or plain lack of interest and thats fine and dandy.

That doesn't give you a blank check to talk shit about it. No one is starting a forum thread about why rational or rationalist fiction is just a label given a posteri that's trying to "co-opt" or "steal" well-written fiction, if they don't already have some serious preconceived notions 'bout the subject that go beyond "I'm not a fan of the constant science related stuff"

Pretty sure it does.

EDIT: I mean, unless a mod actively intervenes, there's no rule saying that somebody isn't allowed to talk shit on the SB/SV forum about a subject they dislike.

EDIT 2: There are rules against threadjacking though, so some of the posts may be in violation of those. I'd have to see the actual thread to tell.

******** Well there's a large difference between claiming that "You personally don't like XYZ facet of this book/song/game, and that's why you don't think it's very good." and "X is a steaming pile of shit that is horribly written and has unrealistic protagonists."

The first is fine on all accounts, can't fault a person for having a differing opinion.

The second... if you're claiming that something is just inherently /bad/ as a whole or in some facet, then you need to bring some more ammunition to the argument if you want that claim to be remotely justified. You're no longer saying your dislike of the media is a personal opinion, but due to some inherently poor quality of the media itself that's just /objectively bad/, which is always open for debate.

You could say that HPMOR is bad because the pacing is glacial, some of the science is absolutely shoehorned in, and that the justification for Harry's scientific background (his stepdad's a Biochemist at Oxford) is a super flimsy excuse for his context knowledge (Biochemists wouldn't really have a reason to know any of those things that Harry talks about throughout the fanfic...).

Edit: Like, anyones welcome to just spout their opinions on the internet, but if someone preps a five page diatribe on "Why genre X is shit." without showing their work or at least providing some reasoning, then that's just terrible debating by any standards.

**** Spacebattler don't like most of rational fiction thanks to sturgeon laws and the tendency of rational authors to defend mary sues by claiming that they are simply rational.

like quite a lot of rational fiction treats intelligence less like an attribute but more like a super-power that let's you do literally anything after talking about a few vaguely connected to science words

This is, as far as I can tell, untrue.

I know Reddiquette says you're not supposed to use downvotes like that, but let's be honest here. We all do it.

******* I'm not quite sure what that means (some specific examples from the story would be nice), but even if that were true, your previous comment said "quite a lot of rational fiction" does the thing you describe. Do you have any examples other than HPMoR?
