** Not only is this an excellent story, but the author updates every day, super regularly. Also, he's managed to keep two storylines running parallel, and I'm still not sure where they're going to meet.

On a related note, if the time at the top is in red, it usually means that that chapter is a renegade (from mass effect, if you know the reference,) showing what would happen if the main character made an evil/rash decision.

*** I wouldn't say that renegade is evil, more like dickish. Renegade!Paul still has the same goals as Normal!Paul, but doesn't care about people's opinions, and so chooses to take the non-socially acceptable options.

I see the stories as similar to two Mass Effect play throughs - the same overall story is happening, but Renegade!Paul has different advantages and disadvantages because of the way he acts. I think that the renegade story-line is one continuous storyline, but you have to fill in the blanks from the main storyline sometimes.

I like to use [[http://www.printwhatyoulike.com/pagezipper][Page Zipper]]. It's a bookmarklet, inserts a javascript into the page on clicking.

Also, not just for reading. It's great for archiving interesting forum threads in one fell swoop too. You have to scroll/PgDown all the way down so all the pages get to load (Not Ctrl End.. learned that the hard way)

Then save the page and convert to Pdf. I think I saw a few other thread saving methods around if this doesn't work for you.

** Just read through this in the space of a day. Pretty fun. I can't speak for how rational it is, and perhaps my taste isn't the best, but I certainly intend to read more.

[Edit] So, any fics of similar quality around? 'cause I really wanna read more, and clockwork daily updates just aren't enough anymore apparently.

** I like it so far.

Rationalism is an avarice, where avarice is /very loosely/ defined as 'I want it,' based ideology. Spacebattles is crashing on me at Pg 2, but so far we have a fairly standard lesswronger given superpowers, and only the starting of the munchkindom that is to be expected. Our hero is a bit of a twit, but that's standard.

** So, this isn't bad. Finished what's been written so far, as it is a WIP. Strong writing, at its best when going off-canon. Just wish it would do so more often. It is currently following the TV show plot closely, so I'm looking forward to the S2 time jump to see what happens after Paul's deal is over.

That's the story I really want to read -- someone who knows details about the Big Picture dealing with intergalactic threats with a SmartRing approach. Hopefully this has all been planned as an introduction to the setting and characters, and it'll go in original directions soon.

Let's see, what else. I think the "Renegade" path stuff isn't as good, but there is some reason for it, I'm guessing. One that goes beyond feeding the forum dwellers. Especially given how much DC loves multiple universes and crossovers from them. There is /zero/ chance that RenegadePaul doesn't meet ParagonPaul at some point.

** really cool so far, but is there a guide to what the various font styles mean? I have picked up that the orange usually means something to do with his avarice/ring use but I can't figure out what the other colors mean.

Also, is the font size just supposed to represent how loudly something is spoken?

** Great point besides the obvious munchkinry, after every mission the protag reviews and updates his modes of operation.

On the other hand, if you want to hide your glowing body and posses telekinesis, use chunks of rock or metal or cloth to cover yourself up, especially if you have x-ray vision, enemy is a bit weak so far.

Overall great thing to read. Go read now.

*** Yeah, rehosting another author's work without permission, even like this, it a pretty rude thing to do.

You can simply go to the user preferences and choose the xenforo default theme if it's that much of a bother, or if you must convert it into another format, do so for personal use only and don't distribute it without consulting the author first.

**** I could absolutely see that if it was a work he was making revenue on, but as it is posted on a forum that's clearly not the case. It's an unlicensed derivative work of copyrighted material, so he cannot claim his own copyright on it legally. There isn't even a review function or similar which would provide feedback.

I'm not seeing why this is rude, aside from as an instinctive possessive response. If you create a work under these circumstances, presumably you want people to see that work. Everyone who is anyone is aware that anything you post on the internet immediately and irrevocably spreads out of your own personal control, so there is no expectation of that.

"Don't rehost even though the original is difficult to read (to the point of being physically painful for some) and only do things in the author approved way." is almost the same argument used by media copyright companies to prevent piracy, remixing, rehosting, and the whole Youtube Content ID mess. Or arguments by the developers of PC games against modding their game or in some cases even displaying it at all on Youtube or Twitch.

It makes no rational sense to support one version of this argument and to not support the other.
