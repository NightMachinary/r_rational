Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Is it too soon to talk about The Last Jedi?

Screw it. I'm talking about The Last Jedi. To be more precise, I want /to talk about talking about movie/, because the discussion of the film is filled with fallacious reasoning and hardly any communication despite the enormous quantity of dialogue occuring.

First, a disclaimer: I never watched any trailers and wasn't spoiled on anything which happened before I saw it. Even so, I personally didn't like the film very much, but that's mostly because I didn't like The Force Awakens or anything it did with the franchise. However, I really do feel that The Last Jedi did many things which only exacerbated those problems without actually doing much that was "courageous and praiseworthy".

Anyway, here's what I've observed of the film's reception, both online and offline:

- The film is truly polarizing. By the time credits roll, you have a pretty strong opinion of whether it was a good movie or not. This seems to be by design, and if so the creators certainly succeeded. However, this quality also means that there is very little middle ground to be had.

- There are/were vocal hate-mobs on both sides. It's stupid but true, and definitely colored the immediate reception and discussion of the film moving forward.

- The original Star Wars trilogy is more of a sacred cow than ever This is one of my biggest dislikes of the new trilogy. If someone says "it's like poetry, it rhymes" one more time, /I am going to vomit/.

- The movie has high highs and low lows. Liking or disliking the movie largely depends on which one outweighs the other for you.

With that out of the way, let me talk about somewhat spoiler-y things:

As for people /telling me why I hate it/... screw you guys. I hate it 'cause it's bad, and I can develop a very extensive case for why this is. Bad storytelling, poor characterization, stupid messages and themes. What's confusing is the [[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi][92% of professional critics]] who gave positive reviews. I'm not sure whether it's kinder to suppose they're lying, or that they have bad taste. I suspect they're trying to rate the movie as they think a fan would rate it, but not being fans, they really can't.

Is it possible they're reviewing it objectively as a film, whereas you're looking at it through the eyes of a hardcore fan?

Not to say individual reviewers can't be biased, or have bad opinions, or "be lying".

But if I hated a movie that 92% of professional movie critics gave a positive review...I would just figure that movie must not be for me, not that it's objectively terrible and that 307 of the 334 critics who reviewed it are either wrong or liars.

*EDIT:* And note that just because 92% of critics give it a positive review, doesn't mean it's a 92/100-scored movie; it just means 92% of critics recommend seeing it over not seeing it. I found it good enough to say it's worth seeing, but I'd still only score the movie around a 6/10.

While that distinction is worth making, I'm not sure it's useful. As a movie-goer, my question is: should I spend my money at this movie? The critics said yes. They served me poorly. While I would eventually wish to see the movie regardless, I could have waited and seen it at the cheap-seats, or rented from Redbox.

****** I think that says less about critics' general utility/ability, and more about their specific utility to you. In other words, your tastes clearly do not align with those of most professional film critics.

But just because they served /you/ poorly in this instance, doesn't make them bad at their jobs, or liars.

A better approach might be researching the critics who DID agree with you, to find those whose tastes more closely align with yours, and listening primarily to them for future films.

**** Personally speaking, while not a fan of star wars in general (I've only seen bits and peices of the original movies, and read through a novelization of #3 ages ago, but most of what I know is through cultural osmosis), I've loved the 3 most recent films. Part of that's just the fact that I fetishize dogfighting (Poe is easily my favorite character), but the rest of it is for reasons I suspect fans would feel the exact opposite about.

Number one: Rei. I like that she's a competent character who drives her own plot, makes her own decisions, and in general is a "strong independent woman who don't need no man +except kylo ren+." In that sense, she reminds me of Taylor from Worm or Catherine from A Practical Guide to Evil, works I am also very much a fan of. Sure, she takes up a lot of attention from the plot, but that's fine because she's a deuteragonist anyways, but I think that attention is well deserved because of her tendency to be proactive. It's for those same reasons that fans think she's such a mary sue, and maybe she is. But I'm signficantly more tolerant of mary-sue-ness than most fans would be, so it's a non-issue for my enjoyment.

Number two: plot similarities to the original star wars trilogy. This one is pretty simple. Fans aren't very interested in seeing the exact same story repackaged, but I'm seeing this plotline play out for the very first time (excepting for all the other hero's journeys I've seen, anyways), and the CGI and SFX is miles better than the originals.

Number three: thematic issues. I personally haven't spent enough time talking to fans to understand why they don't like the themes in rogue one, but for me it's fundamenally a non-issue. There are a number of themes that I disdain (anti-technology hippy dippy stuff, predestination, and of course the laundry list of stuff I'd vote against at the ballot box), but aside from that I'm willing to swallow a lot. A /good/ theme enhances the story, but otherwise I just ignore thematic elements. For reference, I enjoyed Sucker Punch purely on the basis on its fight scenes. That being said, the whole "actiony characters taking action" thing (Rei, Finn, Poe) thing /is/ a theme I enjoy, so I'm all for it.

Overall, The two main-series star wars films have been (depending on how I'm feeling at the moment) 7.5-8.5/10 films for me (would recommend to a friend; would recommend they shell out to see them in theatres) and Rogue One was an 8-9/10 film for me.

/Themes/ shouldn't be things one agrees or disagrees with. They aren't /policy preferences/. One of the themes of /The Last Jedi/ is the need for leaders rather than heroes. I'm fine with that theme /in isolation/. But not in *the middle of a freakin' heroic tale*! The story ends up undercutting it's own theme (like when Rose stops Finn from his suicide run against the cannon; she saves him from his heroics at the cost of everyone else's lives).

#+end_quote

What? The Last Jedi in no way had that theme. There was some dialog early on that made you think that it would, but that dialog gets contravened since in literally every scenario, personal heroism won the day, it didn't actually had that theme. The masterminds (Leia, Snoke, the purple-haired lady whose name I forget, the FO general) had their contributions dwarfed by the personal prowess of the characters who actually got the majority of the screen time. Snoke gets offed by Kylo, not some elaborate plot. The purple-haired lady's plan to save the fleet only works because she goes full kamikaze, rather than any tactical genius. Leia does no leading when unconscious.

This star wars movie, just like all the previous ones, has a theme about how the actions of a few are what end up deciding everything. Incidentally, that's not a theme I like (because despite your protestations, themes are subject to personal taste), but one I tolerate because it's so omnipresent I'd have ignore the majority of works if I wasn't willing to consume stuff including it.

******* Were we watching the same movie?

In literally every instance, personal heroics led the resistance to its destruction. When they end with numbers in the single digits, it's hard to say that "the day was saved". Every time someone tries to do something heroic, their actions made the situation worse and brought defeat closer.

Let's go with that same case: purple-haired lady's plan to save the fleet. She fuels up the transports so that the resistance can hunker down in the old rebel base while the FO goes past. And then, when the FO exposes the transports and begins targeting them, instead of recalling the transports to the cruiser where they can devise a new plan, she decides to go out in a blaze of personal heroics by sacrificing herself to "save" the transports. But her plan had /already/ failed. It no longer matters if the transports reach the planet because the FO knows that's where they are. Her personal heroics cost the resistance their last chance to get away.

*** I have mixed feelings about TLJ. It's flawed, but I think I'd rank it in the top half of the "main sequence" SW movies (not counting /Rogue One/).

Here's the thing: a lot of common complaints (or variants thereof) about TLJ, could apply to /any/ of the SW movies, even the sacred original trilogy.

In the fiery trash heap that is TLJ discussion, I came across [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_3_W4GRb44][this very level-headed review]]. One of the narrator's best points, I thought, was this:

#+begin_quote
  Every /Star Wars/ movie sucks. I'm one of the biggest SW fans, but you gotta admit, this shit's dumb.

  But, it's still awesome.

  We just make different excuses for the SW movies that we enjoy.

  I've talked to people who hate TLJ, but then they say they love the prequels; they come up with all sorts of excuses for why those movies are good.

  Basically, this is the kind of series where you really need to just accept the dumb stuff, and enjoy the stuff you like.
#+end_quote

It's disappointing to see people throwing such extreme hate towards TLJ. It's perfectly fine if you don't like it, but you can't point at every flaw in the movie for reasons why it's "bad", while ignoring similar (or much bigger!) flaws in the SW movies you like.

/Empire/'s one of my favorite movies of all time, and is now critically acclaimed, but it's got plenty of problems. Heck, when it first came out, [[http://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/15/movies/moviesspecial/15EMPI.html][the New York Times reviewed it as boring and pointless]].

*** There were so many utterly baffling things about the movie. I feel like my recollection of the other entries in the series is inaccurate enough that I can't really judge its relative merit, but I didn't come away with a great overall impression.

There was one moment in particular that immediately undercut all the explanations for the way things played out in previous movies. No spoilers here, but regulars here may work out what I'm referencing.

Imagine if, in the sixth book of Harry Potter, Harry used his dose of Felix Felicis (liquid luck) to devise an improved version of the potion, iterating upon it until he had attained an alchemical Path to Victory.

The audience would probably have otherwise assumed that that wouldn't work, even if no explicit reason for that was apparent. After all, if the solution was so easy, why was it not already done? Why didn't the Order of the Phoenix use it, why didn't Voldemort? And now that the secret is out there, won't everybody just do that all the time? Shouldn't this massively change the world of Harry Potter?

The new Star Wars movie has a moment like that. I can only assume some writer needed a way to get themselves out of a corner, but in doing so they made so many triumphant moments of the series seem utterly pointless.

I think Star Wars, especially Disney Star Wars, isn't really my style any more.

** I said many months ago that I was going to release the first 10 chapters of /Harry Potter and the Irrational Odyssey/ all at once on Christmas day. That's three days from now.

- We've been trying to sell our house for the last two months. At one point I tiled and grouted the kitchen floor all on my own and I got sick of it by the last day so I sped through the grouting, but that requires a lot of force to force the grout between the tiles, so I impinged my shoulder or pulled my rotator cuff or something and couldn't lift my right arm for like two weeks. Not, like, lift it up over my head, I mean lift it from its resting position at my side. It was excruciatingly painful. It's still sore most of the time right now, and it's been over a month since I regained full range of motion.

- TMI, but I've had an internal hemorrhoid for like two weeks.

- Also, stress and seasonal affective disorder and sh*tty life circumstances don't make good bedfellows.

I haven't been mentally and emotionally in the right headspace to edit. I don't just need to go through and line edit and clean it up, I need to do developmental editing, restructure things at the plot level. I'm just not willing to put out what I have right now, it's not "there" yet, and it's mostly the fault of chapters two and three. Those two chapters are going to make or break /the entire story/. I've been working on this goddamn thing for over two and a half years at this point and I'm not willing to eff it all up now just for the sake of meeting an arbitrary deadline that most people aren't even aware of in the first place.

Sorry to disappoint the maybe like 0.01% of you who read this comment and felt disappointment.

I'm going back to binge-watching Stranger Things now.

**** Oh don't worry, I'm not stressing out over the fic itself, it's just the stress from life preventing me from finding the correct chain of events through chapters 2 and 3. I complicated it for myself by requiring that I show and not tell, so instead of Quirrellmort delivering a three page long expository infodump there's going to be a Pensieve involved. I already have all of the topics of discussion and all of the events, what I don't have is how to order them chronologically.

And yeah, I remember you offering to beta this thing all the way back in January, I apologize for teasing it too early, I should've known better than to think I was getting close to the finish line lol

For what it's worth, I think based on everything I've experienced in the past year that I only really need two really dedicated months to get this thing edited to the point where I think it's publishable, it's just that I don't know when exactly that two-month period begins yet.

** Modular origami provides an easy way to make gifts that look /significantly/ more impressive than they actually are. You don't even need to be an expert in paperfolding.

0. Get a few hundred Post-It Notes (or generic square sticky notes). (Tip: It's okay if the side lengths are unequal by a millimeter or two, but any worse discrepancy means you should look for a better brand of sticky notes.)\\
1. Make a [[https://www.origami-resource-center.com/waterbomb-base.html][waterbomb base]] with a sticky note. (Tip: Start with the adhesive strip on your right side and stuck to your folding surface. Use valley folds for the diagonals, then take the paper off the surface and into your hands and make the first non-diagonal fold by squashing the paper up all at once. Rotate the wings around and repeat for the other non-diagonal fold.)\\
2. Make a [[https://www.origami-resource-center.com/preliminary-base.html][preliminary base]] with another sticky note. (Tip: Follow Step 1, then invert the result.)\\
3. Slide the preliminary base on top of the waterbomb base. Try to ensure a snug fit---but not /too/ snug. (Tip: The preliminary base should have its adhesive strip on the inside of one edge. Fit the edges of the preliminary base to the wings of the waterbomb base in this order: First, the one with adhesive; second, the opposite edge; third, the other two edges.)\\
4. Fold the protruding corners of the preliminary base inward, over the edges of the waterbomb base. This is a /module/.\\
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until you've made twelve modules. (Tip: /Do not/ stop at eight modules and try to make a square antiprism or a gyrobifastigium in Step 6. The angles will be too tight, and the finished model will look bad.)\\
6. Assemble the modules into a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron][cuboctahedron]] by sliding the tips of the waterbomb bases underneath the edges of the preliminary bases. (Tip: If a connection is difficult, /be gentle/. This goes /double/ for the insertion of the final module.)

Steps 1 through 6 should consume about 45 minutes. Examples of the final product can be viewed [[https://boards.4chan.org/po/thread/558840#p559188][here]].

Some actual code progress!  I finally was willing to admit that I had bitten off more than I could chew in selecting Ember and Symantic UI, so I tried to figure out what to move to next.  I considered just doing it all in Unity targeting WebGL, WebForms in ASP.NET, and saying screw the web and just doing it in a mono-friendly WinForms app.  You might (or might not) notice that all of these are in C#; I was certainly pining for something familiar.

After about a day's worth of waffling I sucked it up and took the recommendation of some of the kind-hearted souls on Discord and just started doing basic html/javascript using first bootstrap and then jquery/jqueryUI.  It was certainly nice to have a system simple enough that problems were obvious again, and throwing things together has been much faster:

[[https://i.imgur.com/1lM9TIf.png]]

So not much to look at, but functional (for all of the two things it can currently do).  Now that I have a foundation to iterate on, and a workflow that, well, works, things ought to move much more smoothly. Over the next couple of weeks I think I can (with the help of our friendly neighborhood Discord) knock out a decent visual port of the old Bill's PC and start hammering out some functionality.  I'll also get a web server set up, I think, so that people can start tinkering and offering feedback.

I'm going to skip next week's update, since we've got both Christmas and New Year's coming up.  See you in 2018!

** Not sure what to do with my life and I think I should probably make a decision.

Current qualifications:

- Engineering degree and ~5 years experience in project management (traffic engineering)
- Computer science degree but with no coding experience
- Speak French OK (B1/B2)
- One third of a health degree (focus in nutrition)

Current work situation:

- Very stable full time government job with a boss I don't like working for very much
- Very likely to get an opportunity to work a very similar job in terms of pay/stability/etc by doing job
- Take 1 day a week off during semester times to study completely unrelated nutrition degree because I find it really interesting

Current academic situation:

- I've gotten a high distinction for every unit I've studied so far and per above I've finished a third of my course, which includes units across several difficulty levels but does not include much of the complex chemistry I'll be doing starting next year.

- For the most part I really enjoy it but assignment season can be very stressful

Current living situation:

- Poly, two stable partners (5 years / 10 years respectively)

- Really shitty house that has lost some but not value since we bought it, needs expensive repairs in the medium to long term, really just needs to be bulldozed

- Love the area we're living in

Current extended family situation:

- Me: Things are pretty good

- Partner #1: I hate his family for Complicated Reasons, but we're hopefully going to patch things up over the next 6 months

- Partner #2: His family doesn't accept us for being poly, his sister hates us, his parents side with her, it's very sad for all concerned.

Current financial situation:

- Me: earning a decent wage but taking a 30% pay cut to attend uni; essentially supporting the family

- Partner #1: Lost job this year, will be studying full time to be a maths teacher in 2018 and in 2019 will be fully qualified teacher with basically a guaranteed job. Comingled finances.

- Partner #2: Doing phD (his second but who's counting), not expected to earn money until 2020, doing part time data science job. Finances not combined, pays "board" to cover his room in the house and all groceries/bills. This is about half to a third of his weekly income.

My current general desires/stream of consciousness:

- I want to spend ~6 months in a francophone country and become fluent (C1/C2) in French, this is a childhood dream. Achievable: in the middle of next year I get 3 months of paid time off, I should be able to take that at 50% pay and make it six months. I am planning on taking this time in 2019 after P#1 has finished his teaching studies (both partners want to come with).

- I am aware how unachievable this is, but I want my supernatural romance thing I'm writing to become the next Harry Potter. However I don't think I care enough about this goal to put the time / money into it that would be required so I am mostly content: but I feel I should mention this?

- I just want to be able to do whatever I want without worrying about money but due to the household's financial situation I'm very much forced to keep working my engineering job.

- Although I'm studying "to be a dietician", I'm not sure I actually want to be a dietician in terms of what they actually /do/, even though that field is hugely varied (you can be clinical/hospital/corporate/public health/do online stuff/etc the possibilities are really endless). I just want to have the knowledge a dietician has.

- I probably want to do the 2.5 kids white picket fence thing and my government job is definitely the place to spend my reproductive period due to the excellent benefits

- I should probably do EA or earn to give or whatever?

- I feel like I'd be happiest living an "independently wealthy" lifestyle where I just study a lot of different things and then work in the field for a while and then get bored and go learn new things???? Or maybe I'd really enjoy being a housewife?? I like baking and wish I had time to keep the house clean????????

- I actually really enjoy project management but feel underworked in my current job, this is unlikely to change as I really struggle to get my boss to give me more work to do for some reason ???????

So yeah that's where I am at the moment. Going to take it one year at a time. Starting on the complicated chemistry units next year to work out if I even want to do organic chemistry for the next 6 years of my life. 2019 we'll do the France trip. Then in 2020 I'll have some idea what my white picket fence will look like...

#+end_quote

The idea I get, looking at the relatively-recent crop of massively successful, trendsetting books (e.g. harry potter, hunger games, twilight) is that they share a number of qualities:

1. They have widespread age appeal. Your book should be, in effect, PG-13. You don't need to get 8-9 year olds in your net (they don't buy books anyways) but you should have something that precocious 11 year olds want to read, without being so aimed towards kids that middle aged people don't read it. This is a bit of a truism, to be fair, because if it was easy to make your book appeal to everyone, everyone would do that. But hyper-popular novels seem to follow a few guidelines: cursing should be censored, fantasy-fied (Odin's nutsack!), or used very sparingly; sex scenes shouldn't be in the first book, and should be fade-to-black or be extremely vague; violence should be thrilling, rather than graphic; no puzzle that readers are expected to solve should require education beyond a straight-C high schooler; and no moral conflict should have more than three sides (the viewpoint character's side, the antagonist's side, and optionally an "objectively right/wrong" side).

2. They contain escapism tailored towards the era these books were released in. Different varieties of escapism work under different circumstances. The hunger games started getting released around the time of the financial crisis, so the rebellion of the lower classes against the exploitative bourgeois resonated. Twilight has similarities, in the sense that the vampires are rich as shit and don't have financial issues. I can't really speak about harry potter (I'm not qualified to do in-depth analysis of the late 90's) but you can look at a lot of fiction released in the wake of either the great recession, or earlier, 9/11 that provide a way for readers to escape from the realities of the world we find ourselves in.

3. They have widespread genre appeal. To make a truly popular work, you need to appeal to the greatest amount of people possible. That means an action/adventure plot with a romance subplot (or a romance plot with an action/adventure subplot), plus a dash of slice of life for decompressing after action scenes. The amount of romance versus action should be tuned based on whether you're trying to apply to a predominantly male or female readerbase, with the understanding that men are stereotypically less tolerant of romance than women are of action.

4. They're the trope codifiers, not the trope creators. There were magic academies before Harry Potter, postapocalyptic YA dystopian novels before Hunger Games, and vampire supernatural romances before Twilight. But what these novels did was take an existing genre, and codify it so well as to make it mainstream. More recent works in their respective genres are now compared to those works, not necessarily because those works are shining beacons of quality writing, but because those works did such a good job of assembling the right components together, and welding them together into a cohesive, commercializable whole.

5. Extending from #4, while these works were at the forefront of new fad genres, these works weren't the first works in their genres to get attention. The genres they belonged to were already making headway and already attracting readers; and these works took advantage of that to get initial publicity, and helped the genres reach critical mass. Let's look at rational fiction, a much smaller phenomenon, for comparison. With stuff like Clarke's third law gaining prominence, we've already been seeing much more intelligent worldbuilding in recent works. Works like HPMoR and Worm didn't singlehandedly cause a revolution. Instead, they took advantage or an existing trendline, and then crystallized these trends into a recognizable formula-- the rational/ist fic-- and in turn, these books get more famous as people read other works in the genre because they're so central to it already.

So in sum, to become a worldwide hit, a work should follow the following strategy:

1. Find an up-and-coming genre that's still underground (for now.)
2. Write a work that codifies the genre in its modern state
3. Tweak it so it's maximally commercializable.
4. Hope you roll a nat 20. If not, restart from step 1.

Note that nowhere on this list is advice about writing /well/. Because the thing is, only writers really care that something is written well-- most everyone else just wants to be entertained. You need technical accuracy because easily apparent mistakes will cause you to lose credibility, but you don't need to write /Infinite Jest/ to get popular.

Now, the question is, can your paranormal romance fulfil these criterion? And even if it can, do you want it to? Targeting a niche market can be both less risky and more (emotionally, albeit not necessarily financially) rewarding.

**** Thanks for that, it was a wonderful post and a great writeup about "how to be JK Rowling" and has basically put into words while I'll never be able to do that: much like someone who sings in the shower and dreams of being on stage but doesn't want to go to the effort of attending open mics, taking vocal coaching, etc, I just want the stupid crap I'm going to spit out naturally to somehow be met with reverence and awe that I've done no work to earn. So, I will stick to singing in the shower :)

So yeah, my writing project is going to be a vanity project and I might chuck up to $1,000 into it to get some fancy covers / professional editing / vanity print a copy or two. More realistically goal-wise I will honestly feel like I've reached a huge measure of success if I get 10% of the following animorphs the reckoning has, or sell, like, 10 copies on Kindle to people I don't already know.

The big problem is, again, I don't want to do the work, I'm that wanky artist sort of persona who wants to produce stuff to make themselves happy rather than to make ends meet. I've lurked [[/r/selfpublish]] for a while and it's insane all the time, money and effort that it takes to publish a book (things beyond what you've already laid out, because once you have written an awesome story that ticks all the boxes you have to market the hell out of it so that way someone will pick the damn thing up...).

More generally it's probably some sort of general female empowerment niche that is hitting all the "strong female character" that is happening these days - though what I'm working on now has very few female characters, sigh.

It's in a weird place because it's both got very elaborate worldbuilding and vampire powers that make sense (if I do say so myself) but it's mostly focused on characters me and my BFF think are cute couples getting together and smooching. We joke that the whole thing is slash fiction of something that is actually good.

Yeah, it being slash unfortunately kills any chance of mass market appeal-- hetero men basically won't read it, and a large contigent of the older-women population would prefer straight romance so they can self-insert. On the plus side, now that you know mass-market isn't in your future, you can maximize author appeal to no end! Good luck.

********* The thing is, most of the time, readers of your book /won't/ be buying it. They'll be reading it for "free" with kindle unlimited (there's a flat monthly fee), and you'll get revenue depending on how far they read. So the trick is, you get a summary good enough (or with enough niche appeal) to get people just browsing randomly to check out your work, and get the quality of your work high enough that those readers keep reading, and eventually advertise your book for you via word of mouth and 4/5 star ratings.

I've seen a bunch of ebooks on amazon that I would under no circumstances purchase, but would probably at least check out if I had a kindle unlimited subscription.

And as a tangent to that, while pretty much no straight male would /buy/ a yaoi work, speaking from my personal experience reading fanfiction, some might at least check it out if other parts of the story look interesting enough. They might drop it halway through, but you'll still have made money.

So you can just say "paranormam romance slash" (albeit more elegantly) and immediatelly convince the contigent of readers who like that stuff to check it out. That lets you use the rest of the summary to draw in the people who don't necessarily like yaoi, but might overlook it to get what they want.

I did something quite similar a while back-- I knew the contigent of readers who liked log horizon would be so starved of content they'd read basically whatever I wrote, so I was free to jam all the rational/transhumanist appeal I wanted into my fic to (hopefully) capture that audience as well. (But also, I confess, for author appeal.)

Really, probably the best example of this stuff is eaglejarl's work. I know going in that there's going to be polyamory, and in all likelyhood a long author's tract about how its great, but I can tolerate that because I'm hankering for all the other elements he puts in his work.

#+end_quote

So... a copy of my resume? Here's my list of skills in my resume:

- Very experienced in project management, including scoping, budget management, design reviews, management of external contractors, and consultation with internal and external stakeholders
- Financial management skills, including managing budgets, forecasting expenditure, and reporting
- Aware of OSH policies and legal obligations, with experience on construction sites
- Able to prioritise, organise, and complete work within set time and manage conflicting demands
- Reliable in meeting deadlines and producing high-quality outputs
- Highly organised to complete projects on time and within budget, meeting scope and quality requirements
- Comfortable working in a team, including supporting others and seeking expert advice
- Skilled at thinking laterally and recognising opportunities to deliver projects in innovative ways
- Communication skills, including interpersonal skills, report writing, and preparation of contract documents
- Keen interest in technology and desire to use it to streamline processes and procedures
- Typing speed over 100 words per minute
- Good working knowledge of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and macOS
- Familiar with the Microsoft Office suite (including Project and Access) and \LaTeX
- Familiar with programming, especially macros in Microsoft Excel
- Experienced with automating and simplifying existing processes
- Familiar with a variety of specialist software packages, including ArcGIS and AutoCAD
- Conversant in English (native), French (advanced), Italian (intermediate), Thai and Esperanto (novice)

Probably have others - I'm quite charismatic, really good at writing/communication, very quick at doing things, etc.

I really do enjoy project management. I also wish I was experienced enough to be able to make money consulting, set my own hours/etc, since that would be ideal - could work less, charge more for my services, and attend classes on the side. I think that might be something I could do with a dietetics qualification more than my engineering qualification.

I also think that there'd probably be some people who would think a dietician who is also a qualified traffic engineer is a big selling point, so I might be able to leverage that somehow? I'm sure there's a startup that would love me-in-5-years.

I meant it as "What else could you do if you quit your job?", but sure.

I definitely get the urge to just... get more skills, even if they don't directly translate into a new job or raise. Consulting does seem pretty in line with your other objectives, money aside.

Have you seriously explored that possibility? Maybe you've left it aside on general principles, but if you looked deeper into it you'd find a better-paying consulting market for your skills or something? (I'm kind of grasping at straws here; your life seems optimized beyond my abilities to give useful advice)

****** I've not seriously explored the possibility of consulting, I probably should. I'm not sure how to even start, unfortunately. I have a friend who is an IT consultant and I might pick her brain about it. I think I'd love to do some sort of nutrition consulting online (diet plans or something), though I don't have a qualification for it. Then again 90% of nutritionists are less qualified than I already am so maybe I should look into it. I wonder if any of them do work on Fiverr?

I've got 6 months before I earn my 3 months paid leave from my job so not going to think about leaving until I get that sweet sweet paid leave.

#+begin_quote

Well, apart from "similar job somewhere else", I'm good at cooking so I could probably do some sort of cafe type thing. I love trying new recipes so a food blog would be great but that's so much work and so unlikely to be liveable so put that in the "famous author" pile. I don't know. This sort of stuff was on 80,000 hours and I didn't take it seriously enough even though I really probably should given how I'm feeling right now.

** Two days before Christmas, two days and a week before 2018. I'm mostly taking a vacation and being burned out (only one day before I get back to Paris, yaaaaaay!), but I've been thinking about my New Year resolutions, and I want to write my thoughts down.

I feel like I've been getting into a rut last school year. The excitement of being in a coding school, working on actually interesting projects has faded, the projects have started to feel less like challenges and more like /work/; same thing for my internships.

Since September, I've been trying to get myself back into the mindset of having dreams and working to achieve them. I've started to work on my video game project and to exercise regularly, but next year I'd like to pick up the pace permanently.

Wildbow's advice for personal projects is "do something and stick to it"; where you commit to following a schedule, and over time you gain enough momentum that it's harder to break your record than to keep going. I've never managed to get into that kind of momentum for more than a few weeks. I'm going to try again in 2018, hopefully taking into account the errors of the past and all that.

Which means I need to figure out what I want to have achieved by the end of 2018. My tentative list is:

- Learn about important computer science fields: system administration, networking, machine learning, package managers, sandboxed package managers, computer graphics, modern UI, and advanced programming language theory.

- Get a distributed network of back-ups and VMs so I don't have to constantly re-install everything.

- Release a playable, "I would pay money for this"-grade version of The Tesseract Engine.

- Participate on at least one Open-Source project; I'm leaning between Atom, Dlang and Battle for Wesnoth.

- Learn about and learn to use as many useful applications as I can; whether phone apps, web apps, Windows apps, or browser extensions. Learn about and set up self-hosted versions of apps I already use.

- Work with a friend on one productive project per month. These projects would be anything from blog posts, RPG scenarios, drawings, mini-webcomics, animations, small games, small maps for a game editor, fanfics, etc. Every project would have a hard one-month deadline, after which we'd switch to something else.

- Keep exercising on a regular basis. Practice parkour out of a gymnasium on a regular basis (I've only done it indoor so far).

Also, learn at least three music instruments, two martial arts, six foreign languages and star in the lead role of a box-office Hollywood movie.

Seriously though, I think I have a fair shot at keeping to at least half of these resolutions. I'm trying to find commitment mechanisms that are more opt-out than opt-in, and to set myself up with reliable friends who will keep me working when my motivation falters. A lot of it depends on what I manage to get done in the two next months of free time I have (January and February); whether or not I manage to get on the right track.

By the way, The Tesseract Engine updates will resume next Saturday :)

** Heroes Save the World has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7lkgw0/heroes_save_the_world_ch_63_michael_williams/][returned to life today]]. The current Sequence of chapters is going to be completed over the course of the next week, and then it'll go on a brief hiatus as I continue writing the next bits, attempt to not flunk out of grad school, and so on.

--------------

As some of you may know, I write worldbuilding supplements and related resources, which I publish through DriveThruRPG.

Earlier this year, I told the sub about Species Shock, a Kickstarter campaign for a book that would dig deep into a fictional alien species and its world, evolutionary history, culture, and other characteristics, and release the whole thing into the Creative Commons.

The campaign went well, and I'm pleased to announce that [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/227722/Agloanikoi-The-Gameplayers-Species-Shock][Species Shock is available for free]]. It's 74 pages long, so there's a lot of meat there, and while it's written from a hard scifi perspective I have heard of at least one person planning to adapt it for fantasy.

You may also be interested in [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/200950/Strange-Nations-A-Worldbuilding-Resource][Strange Nations]], a collection of "drag-n-drop" cultures that can be easily inserted into most settings and a wealth of supplementary information on such topics as low-tech methods of long-distance communication and the many uses of cactus. Strange Nations is also free.

I know I can get all A's if I work hard enough in almost everything. The only class where I really didn't feel like that was true was German. I can get an A. I know the steps to doing it and and general despite my focus and motivation problems I even manage it the vast majority of the time.

** So, imagine the USA were a dystopia where Mexican immigrants are summarily executed by the cops if they're caught, and it is the official policy to do that.

Then one day, Trump decides "You know what, reading the Mexican immigrants' rights is a huge wast of time, let's not do that anymore". And it starts a HUUUUUUGE controversy, with thousands of people protesting online and making Youtube videos with titles like "Miranda rights are for EVERYONE" or "Mexican deserve to be read their rights too!".

Being unfamiliar with the US' situation, I ask "Does it really matter if Trump wants their rights to be read? If they aren't read, it'll come up at the trial and the judge will be constitutionally required to let them go, right?". To which people tell me "No, you don't understand, Mexican immigrants are actually executed without a trial, so they don't have an occasion to invoke their constitutional rights". I say "Wait, what?" but it's too late and the other guy is already back to shouting "Miranda rights for everyone!"

This is roughly [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/18/links-12-17-silent-site-holy-site/#comment-580111][how I feel]] about the net neutrality scandal right now, and about [[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/10/us-internet-is-slow-expensiveand-the-fcc-has-proof/][the "Internet in US" situation]] in general.

--------------

This is an area where I'd appreciate explanations from anyone familiar with the logistics involved: why does the US have so many regions under oligopoly as far as Internet access is concerned?

I'm still looking into it, but as far as I can see the answer is "because the FCC never seriously enforced its local loop unbundling regulations". Local loop unbundling is when whichever company owns the cable that connects your house to its network has to lease it to any company that asks. Unbundling your local loop and not doing it is spectacular. It seriously reduces the cost of setting up a new network, which allows competition on a "unattainable libertarian fantasy" level.

So of course the US doesn't have it. Or does it? I'm guessing that some states implemented it better than others. Again, I'd be very open to better info if anyone can provide it.

(also, apparently setting up your network can be way harder in some states than others depending on their [[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/verizon-supports-controversial-rule-that-could-help-google-fiber-expand/][utility pole legislation]])

Because on one side, we have libertarians (regulatory capture is the great evil! Monopolies don't exist!) and on the other side we have the socialists (Monopolies are the great evil! regulatory capture doesn't exist!) and never the twain shall meet. Or more explicitly, because gerrymandering + the primary system partially cancels out the chief advantage of first past the post voting (a trend towards centrism) and since pork barrel spending got outlawed, there's no incentive for true compromise.

How dull, unbearable (or, in contrast, interesting and rich with potential of making social connections that are valuable and interesting to you) do they generally end up being for you? 2) Have you noticed any difference in quality depending on the industry that the event-organiser corporation was operating in (e.g. governmental sector v.s. financial \ banking v.s.

My only contribution to industry differences is that the type of company to throw a big event is the kind of company who thinks that by so doing they don't have to pay as much, since after all, fun is a compensation of sorts, right?

You're supposed to be angry toward *the moderators*. This conclusion seems too obvious to be stated, since anger toward the moderators* is /the default state/ for all people who frequent moderated forums, so you won't need to change anything about your opinions.

*Or the administrators, if the moderators are merely subservient enforcers of admin-created rules

****** I mean, I made a post and responded to a few other people, then came back at the end of the day to discover hundreds of comments that got pretty uncivil so people just threw up their hands and called it off.

I have depression so of course I immediately blamed myself for all of it, but even if that weren't the case I still wouldn't feel wronged by the mods. They aren't obligated to give me what I want when they never promised it to me.

******* The purpose of moderation is to remove items that obstruct on-topic discussion. However, on a platform like Reddit, much moderation is redundant, because the users can moderate /themselves/ with upvotes and downvotes. A person that dislikes political discussion can downvote and hide it because it isn't relevant to the thread or to the subreddit.

#+begin_quote
  Many people don't bother to consider relevancy when deciding whether or not they should upvote or downvote a [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7jj0h5][submission]] or comment, and instead vote based on whether or not they like the item.
#+end_quote

If the users don't want their discussion to be constrained to a single topic, why should the moderators impose it on them? Maybe this is representative of a transition from a distinct, topic-defined subreddit to a vague, community-defined subreddit. Anyone who doesn't like this transition can upvote and downvote to oppose it, and can leave if he's overborne by the will of the majority.

******** I think we have different ideas of what an ideal forum is like, but I'll offer two points (personally, mod hat off here):

- empirically, moderator-less voting does not work at scale to keep an active subreddit on topic, and they tend to devolve into general community spaces and then low-effort memes. Essentially, there is no /distinctive/ will of the majority related to particular topics, even if many people would like a topic-specific space. One of the mechanisms that users can use, as a supplement to voting, is... moderators! [this is how AlexanderWales was added and eaturbrainz moved down the list]

- almost all of our users arrived under the current moderation policies, and all of them have stayed. I think this is at least partly attributable to the moderation. If you think a different policy would be better, I encourage you to start a new forum for it and let users decide which to use!

This is not the case. Unmaintained, vote-only subreddits deteriorate into what you see on the default front page - the voting mechanism is not strong enough to keep subreddits unique. People make too many exceptions for "this doesn't belong here, but I agree with it".

I think it's important that some subreddits are loosely moderated; but also that more niche ones are moderated much more invasively. In th end, if the moderation of a subreddit doesn't agree with many people, they will make their own fork.

I have tried to persuade them and all attempts have failed.

My past experiences with people like them mean I do not trust them to be rational and several have openly admitted to taking pleasure from seeing me suffer while attempting to reason with them. I am confident that engaging with them again will only worsen my mental state.

******* Hmm. This does not seem to me a satisfactory answer to the question of "Why not join the Discord to continue having these discussions" if the source of distress is that you want to still be able to have conversations about politics with rational people.

If instead your main concern is that people you've had discussions with have openly mocked your suffering and seem unable to engage in reasonable discussion, then you should be trying to avoid those conversations or people as much as possible. I suggest blocking them, as engaging with them sounds like a waste of time at best and actively masochistic at worse.

If their very /existence in the world/ is what's causing you distress, like you cannot have peace as long as you share a planet with people that vile and unreasonable, that is the much more important thing you need to figure out how to address than how you should feel about the subreddit ban.

I face crushing despair every day, the key to coping with it is focusing on something else. So for the past few days I've just stopped thinking about politics. It helps that I've been too mentally exhausted to think about anything.

Lol, but seriously, mind giving me a summary on what exactly went down? I find it somewhat impressive that a topic in a sub based on rationality was so divisive that the mods banned it. Like we could probably discuss the relative merits of bestiality and not get that topic banned, so I was very curious to hear about American politics getting the axe.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7j2qas/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dr3mk8b/][Nothing much.]] It was pretty civil, except that at one point [[/u/trekie140][u/trekie140]] looked through the opponent's post history and noticed thons participation on [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]], which u/trekie140 assumed makes thon inherently unsuitable for rational discourse. At that point [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]] posted in mod-colour, with every appearance of agreeing with u/trekie140 and declaring thons intent to look through u/trekie140's opponent's contributions to that thread "to see where the propagandistic shitposting begins". [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] argued against u/eaturbrainz's possible abuse of moderator privileges; [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]] agreed with u/CouteauBleu, then suggested the ban, to u/CouteauBleu and u/eaturbrainz's agreement.

Personally, I think that blanket ban is an overreaction, but I didn't read all previous discussions (immediately prior to and immediately after Trump's election, for example), so maybe it's justified in the light of past incidents.

As a mod of other subs, I've had to deal with propagandistic shitposting before (Likudnik rather than Trumpist). /It was unpleasant./ I'd rather have a blanket ban we can enforce without trouble than have to spend my own time writing constant little notes to some absolute jackass arguing about why one propaganda post is intellectual enough to fit on the sub and another is too shitposty and got removed.

I agree that political discussions turned notably divisive even here, and that /if/ "propagandistic shitposting" starts happening on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], a blanket ban would be a reasonable response. Still, I don't think that [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s political discussions turned unpleasant enough to warrant this /so far/, whatever happens on other subreddits.

But... fine. I don't really care about USA politics, and there's [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]] for people who do. But I'm trying to be genre-savvy, so [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...][I'll be keeping an eye on you, our Powers That Be]].^{1}

And please note that we haven't banned discussion of politics! There are six-and-a-bit continents^{*} full of interesting political events, and even larger scope for (rationalist?) fictional politics.

^{*} depending on how you count Antarctica, Canada, and Mexico

To summarise, I put a fairly high value on keeping [[/r/rational]] as a neutral venue as far as possible consistent with the aim of discussing and promoting rational[ist] fiction. Discussion specifically of US politics was harming that without commensurate benefit and is banned. Blanket bans are themselves also quite harmful, of course, and I do not want or anticipate ever needing to institute another. So /custodiet ipsos custodes/, Noumero, and if in doubt just send us a modmail (or start [[/r/rationalusapolitics]]!)

I would say that you shouldn't feel regret or guilt for bringing it up. The fallout is on everyone who said unpleasant things. Also the discussion didn't seem too terrible, but rather it was just the last straw in a long line of political discussions leading to an unhappy conclusion.

*** I'd prefer the creation of a politics weekly thread or more probably a politics top-level comment that's automatically made on each Friday off-topic thread under which all political discussion must be contained. From time to time I enjoy discussing politics. It disappoints me that this is no longer a possibility on this subreddit.

That being said, I have seen bad expansions of politics into places where it ought not to go (such as the Monday General Rationality Thread) and I understand the rationale behind the ban. It's certainly simplest to go with an outright ban.
