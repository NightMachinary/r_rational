I have been writing rational Supernatural and have just started writing out my final draft of my first arc. I should be finished with chapter 2 tonight and I was hoping to get some advice on the first two chapters and intro. I am not happy with some of my conversation formatting and could just use general recommendations on improved quality.

Let me know if you are interested, especially if you have some previous writing experience. Thanks!


** I'm definitely interested. :)

*** I may contact you if I feel like it still needs polishing. Thanks! Otherwise I welcome comments when I publish it. I will probably do constant edits based on recommendations if people offer them.

*** Honestly I got about 7k words in and realized I needed to rewrite about half of it because everyone who read it was being bored by it. The original couple of episodes are hard to make entertaining in written form. (I was starting from the series' start and then diverging) I got frustrated.

I have an outline of the entire story and background that I think is really good but I am utterly godawful at dialogue. It takes me hours I don't have. For the moment it is stalled unless I can find another fic writer who can do dialogue well to work on it with me. I really should get back to looking for somebody.

**** I bet if you put the draft out there, other fic writers would be more apt to find out about it.

***** Yeah. I got distracted from this around Christmas b/c work intervened. I'll try and put it up sometime this month.

******* I don't know if it will get finished though. I really need to find a partner for it. Regardless thanks for the reminder.
