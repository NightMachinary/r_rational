Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

The Powers:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /clearly/ defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

- The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

- In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, /powerful/.

The Problem:

- In which we solve problems posed by other users. Be smart and expect other users to be smarter.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have been thrown back in time and somehow became ruler of a small feudal territory in a medieval era, and other lords and barons are watching to see you fail and take your territory. No one is going to outright invade, but you need to keep your territory running smoothly and producing wealth despite potential sabotage. What would you do?

If you can't tell, I'm desiring recommendations on stories where a modern day person is sent back in time or to a more primitive world and attempts to improve it.

P.S. [[/u/gods_fear_me]] have you considered letting the auto moderator do the posting from now on?

*** Assume England at 1200 C.E.

Pasteurization would be a big deal. I fund the building of small civic centers in every moderately large hamlet. Under a new law, all cow farmers may sell their milk on the market only if it has been "treated" by someone at a civic center that I have told how to pasteurize (the treating is free of charge).

The civic centers also offer smallpox vaccination by cowpox. Before that, tests are done to determine the correct amount of cowpox dosage to insure smallpox immunity. The vaccination is distributed among the largest urban centers to begin with, but eventually are made available to the larger population.

I believe that I could design a gravity based plumbing system that would be a moderately large boon to sanitation in urban centers. It wouldn't be perfect, but it would do much to slow the massive death tolls in cities at the time.

These benefits to the health of my subjects would allow for larger cities. Using the funds from the "magic milk" that my farmers produce, I would begin further development of the central city of my territory. I don't know enough about engineering to allow for huge buildings, but a better plumbing system combined with sensible urban planning would allow for a continuously growing city larger than its neighbors. I fund the development of a few more large schools and offer tax breaks to literate citizens. The environment of the time wouldn't allow me to introduce chemistry or advanced biology yet, but it would still provide a greater base of educated citizens to generate innovation.

To generate more wealth, I could provide a base form of insurance to nobles of the surrounding fiefdoms; they pay me money every year, and when their grain harvest isn't enough to feed its citizens, they get grain supplements from me, among other things.

I'm not a huge military tech buff, but I could plant the idea of the cannon into the heads of some local craftsman and see what happens. Within a generation, I might have cannons (or something similar) at my disposal. I think I'm reasonably good with diplomacy, so that could reasonably suffice for a time.

From here, I aim to alter educational, social, and economic systems such that, after my death, innovation and urbanization would continue. I get an heir and have him or her co-rule with me for a long period. I probably wouldn't take military action against other fiefdoms unless I had to.

Sorry if it's a poor quality answer, I'm new at munchkin-ing.

Pasteurization is very much a boon for increasing the shelf-life of milk. However, that only became a concern when people started living away from freshly-squeezed milk during the industrial revolution. Your subjects would likely all have their own cows or access to freshly produced milk, making the need for pasteurization limited to those not living on a farm, i.e. probably just you in your castle.

*** It's probably better to find a ruler and cooperate with them than to try to do everything alone. Granted this would water down a lot of potential changes, but I think it's still net beneficial. With low tech, there's realistically not much you can do to monitor and prevent sabotage attempts from within. Major upheaval should be avoided, because if the locals are displaced and disgruntled by it then there's not a lot you can do to stop them. That means working within the established system.

Go to another library. After the first library, choose national libraries or university libraries. Read books on learning languages if you encounter a book of a different language.

If a book had an emotional ending, would you find yourself feeling that emotion after your speed reading? Would it be possible to mentally poison the speed-reader with a particularly disturbing or psychologically targetted passage inserted into a book?

There's also potential munchkinry about what constitutes a book. If you pay somebody to stitch a bunch of books together you could read them all at once, though why you would bother when all you have to do is touch them is another matter.

More importantly, if you could somehow manage to read Wikipedia you could absorb a lot of information, although you'd run up against normal human memory limits extremely quickly even with the world's best memory techniques.

** *From your perspective:*

Your power gives you the ability to send exactly 1 bit of information back in time to the last time you used your power. It /appears/ to function under the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov self-consistency principle.]] That is to say, if you receive a 1 or a 0 from your future self, you will, for some reason or another, end up sending that exact same bit back in time. Each time you send a bit back in time, you immediately receive another bit from your future self. You never end up trying to create a Grandfather paradox. (Either you never got around to testing it, you always got cold feet at the last second, or it doesn't seem worth the risk to you.) You wonder if your power can be leveraged in any meaningful way.

*In reality:*

Your power works by splitting the timeline into two. In one(Timeline A), it feeds you a 1, and in the other(Timeline B), it feeds you a 0. These two timelines are otherwise identical. It lets the two timelines run until you attempt to "send" a bit of information back in time in one of them. This is actually a delusion on your part; your power does not actually send the bit back in time, it simply receives the input and compares it to the bit it fed you in the past. If the bit you attempt to send "back in time" is the same as the one you received, then it splits that timeline and repeats the process. If the bit does not match, then it ends the timeline. This is why it appears to follow the Novikov self-consistency principle; all timelines in which it doesn't are instantly deleted. You are unable to communicate with any of your copies in parallel timelines.

Example: Suppose that in Timeline B(the one in which you received a 0) you attempt to "send back" a 0 to your past self. Since this matches the bit you were given in the past, Timeline B will instantly split into two timelines, Timeline BA and Timeline BB. In Timeline BA, your power then feeds you a 1, and in Timeline BB it then feeds you a 0. Timeline A still exists. There are now 3 timelines;

Timeline A: In which you received a 1, and have not yet attempted to "send back" a bit.

Timeline BA In which you recieved a 0, "sent back" a 0, and received a 1.

Timeline BB In which you recieved a 0, "sent back" a 0, and recieved a 0.

If instead, however, you attempted to "send back" a 1 in Timeline B, that timeline would end, and only Timeline A would remain. (the one in which you received a 1) If you then tried to "send back" a 1 in Timeline A, it would split into two timelines, Timeline AA(in which you then receive a 1) and Timeline AB(in which you then receive a 0).

If there is only one remaining timeline running, and you attempt to "send back" a bit that is the opposite of the one you received, then your power will simply kill you instead of ending the timeline.

There is no limit to the number of timelines you can have running concurrently.

*** I'm pretty sure I would kill myself with this. Since I don't know how the power works automatically, all I know is that it appears to follow the Novikov self-consistency principle. The reason I know that is because that's how it always happened, right? But to learn that I'd need to experiment on my own.

In fact, I wouldn't even know that it /was/ time travel if all that happened was I sent the bit of information back and immediately got a new one. For all I know there are aliens sending me single bit messages and watching when and how I respond for whatever reason.

Since I know nothing about this power except for that I am receiving one bit messages and can send one bit messages, one of the first, most obvious things I would do is send the opposite of the received bit. After all, maybe the aliens sending messages want me to show I'm not just repeating them.

Boom, every timeline dies. The simple fact of the matter is that I wouldn't go anywhere near munchkinry until I understand the powers I'm wielding, and I won't get that far without sending the wrong bit back and seeing what happens. While you could argue that one of me would decide not to take the test, the difference between me that received a 1 and me that received a 0 is so minimal it wouldn't change the outcome of my decisions.

/But/, let's assume I get past that hurdle. Say I got a neatly wrapped information packet telling me everything you say I should know about this talent. Here's something I'll end up trying, even if it doesn't make sense by what the packet tells me about the power.

I'll sit down at a computer, refresh the message and get a 0 or 1. I'll type it into a web page that translates between binary and decimal and repeat. Dozens of 0's and 1's creating ludicrous amounts of timelines, but also forming a binary code in the translator. The key here is that for every exponentially large number of timelines where I receive garbage info, there's a few timelines in which I receive coherent information completely by random (It is also likely that I receive 75% of a coherent sentence, and am prompted to continue until it 'completes'). One timeline might end up being warned about rain tomorrow (regardless of if it rains tomorrow or not), another might get a message predicting the death of a celebrity.

Most of /these/ messages are worthless garbage predictions as well, but since I've brute forced /every single possible binary code of that size/ I'm guaranteed that every piece of information that I would consider an accurate prediction gets at least one timeline in which it is expressed. The me in those timelines become convinced the power produces information ex nihilo, and do it more. What's more, if I go into another set with a goal in mind, there will be a timeline with an answer that satisfies my 'question'.

Among an incalculably large sea of disappointed and disillusioned failures to produce useful information, there will be at least one of me who can sit down at a computer, have a question in mind, and abuse time travel so hard that I get the answer out of nothing. Impossible equations would fall before me. The solution to the world's greatest problems in an afternoon, so long as I ask the right questions (and even then, my power could 'correct' me). I could ask how to become supreme ruler of the world, and versions of me would hear /every possible way to do it/, with the methods even taking into account factors no one on Earth could predict.

And, from inside the timelines, I would never even realize that I'm leaving thousands of me, millions of me, vigintillions of me, quantities of me we don't even have numbers for, stuck with garbage nonsense and a power they consider far less useful. Some precious few of me will generate misleading information and resent my power for it, and there will be one poor sap who, every time he tries to get coherent information, ends up with the rickroll url.

***** The understanding I had was that the real, physical universe split into two simultaneous, physical, real timelines upon each bit sent back in time. From there, every universe with coherent information produced is as real as the originating universe, and also as real as every universe without coherent information.

It's a fantastically broad scope, since it means the power literally duplicates the entire universe with each use of the power, and that sending the wrong bit back literally destroys the entire universe.

And the fact of the matter is that the goal is not to have one true timeline with maximal success. With the complete and utter separation of the universes, which are all real all at the same time, it doesn't matter to the most successful version of me what happens to any other version of me. And just the same, the relative success of another version of me in another timeline does not weigh on any judgement of whether to physically destroy my current, entirely real, universe. And that's not even taking into account that I /don't know/ that the timelines work that way. Each and every version of me is utterly oblivious to the nature of the power, and also to the existence of any other versions of me.

There will be countless versions of me convinced they have a powerful time-travel oracular ability, as that is how it functioned for them. There will also be countless versions of me convinced they have a limited time-travel oracular ability, as that is how it functioned for /them/. There will be countless, mind-boggling, incomprehensible quantities of me convinced the power conveys no information, as that is how it functioned for them. There will be a few of me convinced of falsehoods, tricked into committing evils or great wrongs. Some of me, I expect, will be driven insane by the pure chance of environmental factors and the wrong messages properly interacting. All of these versions of me would be real people, in real physical universes living real human lives, and there is no reason for any of them to end their universe. Not even if I become convinced I've stumbled upon a supernatural power to generate the binary form of the rickroll url.

*** It would be a very bad idea to split the timeline too many times (by sending back the bit you last got each time) without a certain strategy to get rid of most of them, because some of your selves would have /bright ideas/ that start with splitting some more, all of the resulting selves would be the sort that have bright ideas and split a lot, and in short order almost all of the timelines are whatever singleton is most efficient at getting its timeline to split.

This rules out the strategies of "use the binary number your timeline is labelled with to win the lottery and terminate all timelines where you didn't win", "open the binary number as a text file and read it as advice" and particularly "compile the binary number and run the code" as foolish.

It doesn't immediately rule out more careful strategies like getting some hardware that has its probability of hardware failure below p, existential-risk-grade-carefully writing correct software, and then speeding up some NP-type problems by a factor of O(1/p).

*** This seems literally entirely useless to me. You can't learn anything about the future this way. What are you going to do, precommit to send a 1 back if event A happens and send a 0 back if event A doesn't happen? Sorry, but once you check to see whether you got a 1 or 0, you're obligated to send that 1 or 0 back regardless of whether event A happens. As described, this isn't a time machine; it's a random number generator.

How could this be tweaked to be a useful power? Well, I can think of one pretty simple way. Have the power /print out/ a 1 or 0 from the future every time it's used. You can then choose not to look at the slip of paper, and instead give it to someone else along with the rule you have in mind for deciding which number to send. Then, that person can receive information about the future, so long as they don't expose you to this information ahead of it coming true - in that case, they'll corrupt the process and make the number random by forcing you to say what you already said.

#+end_quote

I respectfully disagree. Although it may appear that way from the perspective of the user at first, in actuality I tried to write it so that you'd be able to make "quantum" decisions.

Let's have an example. Suppose you're trapped in a villain's lair, and he wants to ask you 50 consecutive yes or no questions. If you answer any of them wrong, he'll kill you, but if you get them all right, he'll let you go free.

Now let's say that you come up with a plan. You decide that, if you get a 1 from the future, you'll guess yes, and if you get a 0 from the future, you'll guess no. If you get a question right, you'll send back the same bit, but if you get the question wrong, then you might as well try to send back the opposite bit and force a paradox, since you have nothing to lose in such a situation anyway.

If this power was just a random number generator, then your chances of winning would be 1 in 2^{50} . So let's see how this plays out.

*Your perspective:*

He asks his first question. The latest number you've received from your power is a 1. You decide to "refresh" the bit by sending a 1 back in time and waiting for a new bit...

*In reality:*

/The timeline splits. In Timeline A, the new bit given is a 1. In Timeline B, it is a 0. In Timeline A, you guess yes. In Timeline B, you guess no./

/As it turns out, yes was the correct answer. In Timeline B, the villain declares that you have answered incorrectly, and that he will kill you. In a desperate gamble, you attempt to send back a 1. Timeline B collapses, leaving only Timeline A./

/In Timeline A, the villain declares that you answered his first question correctly, and that it is time for you to move on to question #2. You send back a 1./

*Your perspective:*

You get a 1, so you answer yes. You get it right, so you send back a 1 and proceed to the next question.

*/REPEAT UNTIL YOU ARE FREE./*

As you can see, by using this ability in this manner, you are able to survive an arbitrary number of questions with ease, despite the increasingly diminishing probability of doing so. Of course, in reality, 50 versions of you got a question wrong, and 50 timelines collapsed as a result, but from the perspectives of both the villain asking the questions and the version of you that succeeds, you were apparently able to pull the correct answers from out of nowhere with 100% accuracy.

If this power /was/ equivalent to a random number generator, this would not be the case. You would simply have a 1 in 2^{50} chance of surviving.

***** I can't figure out how this is a power. It's functionally equivalent to a suicide button from your perspective. If we live in a quantum multiverse that splits every time something variable happens, then you can get the same result in real life with any device you can reliably kill yourself with. (According to the interpretation of some people, you'd need some kind of "quantum universe-splitting" randomizer to use as a coin-toss, but I disagree; I'm pretty sure the universe naturally splits enough to cover all your bases.) The only difference is that this power usually destroys the entire universe instead of just you, but a major point of quantum immortality is that from your perspective, these are the same thing.

That's correct. /If/ we live in such a universe, then it's effectively a suicide button. If we don't, however, then this power would basically allow you to simulate a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation][Many-worlds interpretation]] from your perspective. In effect, it's functionally a really wonky type of precog that involves selectively killing alternate timeline copies of yourself in order to achieve the timeline that you want.

Right, but you don't really ever know that it's a suicide button. From the perspective of the you in the parallel timeline, it's a shot at possibly rewriting the past.

Let's say I'm betting a million dollars on a coin flip. In one timeline, I get a 1 and choose heads, in the other I get a 0 and choose tails.

If the coin lands on heads, then the me in the second timeline would be tempted to "send back" a 1 instead in order to change the past in order to win. After all, to my knowledge, the worst that could actually happen is that a couple seconds of time are retconned. I'm not actually aware that it's a suicide button that destroys my timeline.

This is true. In order to munchkin this power, you have to come up with protocols beforehand as to how to make choices based on the bit you get, otherwise your success rate will be unaffected by the power. Does 1 correspond to yes or no? True or false? High or low? Safe or risky?

** You've recently made a friend who, despite being well into high school, still has an imaginary friend he regularly associates with, to the degree of having conversations with her in public. Normally, you would find such activity strange, but this is different, because you can see her too. In reality, your friend was unwittingly granted temporary access to powerful magic, which he used to think up an imaginary friend who, thanks to the magic, is now very much real. The only problem is that neither of them believe this, believing her to be merely a strangely intelligent figment of your friend's imagination.

Seeing as she exists only through vague magic, the conditions of her existence are as follows. She is invisible, inaudible, and intangible to everything and everyone save you and your friend, essentially existing in an overlapping plane to our own with you two being the only things to overlap. On her end, she can do pretty much anything, from pyrokinesis to matter creation, but the only things her powers can interact with are, again you and your friend. She rationalizes this as a) your friend made her, so of course he can see/interact with her, and b) you being clinically insane and out of touch with reality, interacting with some sort of overlapping copy of her.

My challenge to you fine people: convince the imaginary friend of her existence. Bonus points for munchkinning her power, limited as it is.

P.S. Sorry if the problem doesn't quite fit here, I'm a bit new to this sub, and thought this might be a place to crowdsourcing it (for reasons of defeating plotholes before they emerge)

As for munchkining, any physically hidden information is yours. Cheating on tests is trivial. Winning the Randi prize is easy. There's definitely more exploits of the power as described...

...but I want to move onto questions.

Does the internet work in her "world"? Can she get a cell phone and look things up? Are there other other people there, and can she interact with them?

If she's not intangible to you and your friend, how much force can she exert on you? Can she pick you up? If she makes fire, does it warm you? If she makes cold, does it cool you?

Does "pretty much anything" include: Teleportation, telepathy, manipulation of time, manipulation of space, the creation of complex things you don't know how to make (cell phones, alzheimer's cures), tracking/tracing magics, learning/memory magics... I'll stop there.

Are there types of magic she can do that imply things like souls (ghost summoning), or that animals have intelligence (talking to them)?

Can she make friends that only exist in her world? Can she makes copies of herself? Can she make copies of "real" people (you, your friend).

**** Huh, never thought of the sleep thing. I really should have noticed that at some point... In any event I should explain myself a bit better than my original comment, written a bit late at night. The way reality works in this system is that all standard, nonmagical things exist on the material plane, any any magical or otherwise "rule breaking" thing lies on an overlapping intangible plane inaccessible to everything and everyone save a select few. Magic users are those few who can interact with the immaterial and make it take form on the material level. The Imaginary Friend was created entirely out of magic and, despite having access to the bulk majority of the plane, can't interact with anything material, directly or indirectly, save you and your friend. (Your friend because he made her, you for reasons unknown)

She can't make anything she doesn't understand, so no phones and defiantly no internet, but if she's seen a book before she can make an accurate copy without having read it. The series of events that resulted in her creation have some really infinitesimal odds attached to it, with only a few dozen such creations having happened throughout human history, only two of which are still alive. They can perceive each other and interact, though one has secluded himself in a corner in the middle of nowhere for millennia and the other is magically imprisoned. Accordingly, in all functionality there is no one else there with her.

She can interact with you two both directly and indirectly, so fire, cold, and her picking you up would all work. (There would be another way to solve the existence problem, now that I'm thinking about it) In regards to general abilities, "pretty much anything" was me being lazy, so, in the order you listed: yes, only to you/your friend, with training maybe (but she has no real access to said training, and in any event it would only be affected relative to you three), same as the last one, no, once she knows what to track, if she finds someone who already can use them or a book describing how to. She can't make sentient life, so no ghosts, animals (actual animals can't perceive her), friends, or copies of people.

"Understand" is a vague term. If you gave me a book, I could understand the concept of "book" and the concepts written in the book, but I don't have total recall of every single sentence in the book. I probably don't even understand how ink sticks to paper and how printing presses work. In what sense can she "understand" a book in a way which lets her create a copy containing every single sentence in it, without memorising the sentences or the molecular bonds between the ink and paper, but would not also allow copying a cell phone or some other thing that she also only sees part of?

That doesn't really help. Okay, bookbinding tells you how to use paper, ink, and glue to make a book. Does she know how to make paper, ink, and glue? (If she can make something without needing to know how to make its components, that's an obvious exploitable loophole.)

Using a cellphone isn't good for Internet, but it does let her send electrical signals that are interpreted by your cellphone as sounds. If she were to lift you and drop you, she would be able to use that to send slow morse code messages that everyone can hear. Sending a message to your cellphone is the equivalent, except instead of lifting and dropping you, she's lifting and dropping the speaker thousands of times per second, which other people should be able to hear for the same reason.

Presumably the black box should be secured in a reputable colocating exchange, for minimum latency and maximum throughput (ie multiple 10Gbps links).

*** Okay, so this is an inherently personal-focused power, it has no effect whatsoever on anyone or anything other than you, so the real question is 'what can I use this light-creation for to gain knowledge?'

The first and simplest idea is blunt illumination. You can keep a room dark and still see everything as clear as day. This has very limited applications, since the only situations in which it benefits you is one where you explicitly benefit from the room you're in being dark while also being able to see in it. Sure, there could be some situations, like reading a book without bothering anyone by turning the lights on or fighting in a dark room where only you can see clearly, but that's not much.

So now the question is, how versatile is this fire? Can I form it into distinct shapes and leave them that way? Do they persist as they get further away from me? If yes to both, I can use them to make notes that only I can see, which can be significantly more useful. For instance, the day before a test I could create notes on the desk out of fire, and look at those notes during the test.

Do the fires attach to moving objects, or are they fixed to the earth's surface? If they can be affixed to moving objects, I could take people and use the fire to write their name and other information I know on their bodies (presumably this could show through the flesh, so I have the entire frontal surface area to leave the notes). This improves my social skills by making sure I never forget a face or name or details about their life and also helps my memory by reminding me of something I might have wanted to bring up with them later.

Can I put flames where I can't see? On the other side of a wall? In China? Do I have to have geographic positioning of what I'm looking for? That last part is horribly exploitative, to the extent of information-from-nothing with can be leveraged into any-information-I-want (for instance, I could take a dictionary and put a flame on the first word of the sentence imparting me the most useful knowledge. Since I don't have to know where that word is, the flame would show up at the corresponding word). Apart from that, tricks mentioned earlier become easier with the fact that I no longer need my physical presence to write the notes.

Does this mean you also have insanely good reflexes? Are you always in slow motion? Or is there some sort of automatic detection that is able to recognize when something "dangerous" enters your radius rather than a speck of dust or an air molecule.

Additionally, if you're able to control temperature by controlling molecules, do you have to consciously apply your power on every molecule individually? Or is there some sort of subroutine that you can call by wanting to "cool down the air" and then it understands that and applies your power to the necessary molecules.

Does this have infinite processing power and can do anything no matter how complicated instantaneously?

Does it have infinite precision? If I flood the area with poison gas can it pick out and reject all of the poison particles while leaving the oxygen untouched?

Does it work while you're asleep? Do you have to tell it ahead of time what sorts of things to protect you from, because if so I can try all sorts of weird wacky things and hope you didn't think of one. If not, how does it recognize "danger"?

Depending on the results of the above, and the resources I have available (since "no upper limit" means you're capable of annihilating the earth, I expect every government on the planet wants you gone, so I expect to have a lot of support.) I tentatively propose:

chop your head off while you sleep

nuclear bomb

poison gas bomb

flood the area with water (even if you keep it away from you with a 1 foot bubble, no new air will be entering the system)

burn everything (locally to remove oxygen, or in a wide area to cause you to starve)

poison your food, and/or use some sort of narcotics, depending on whether you can detect "poison" as a danger since you picking it up will give it momentum

And so on. I just have to hope that even if one of these does work it works quickly and you don't decide to annihilate the earth in revenge anyway because op op op op.

**** Since it's his power it's obviously anchored to his reference frame. It doesn't have to make sense to other reference frames because it's not an inherent property of the universe, it's a property of him.

**** Points like this bug me. They remind me of the moments where Wile E. Coyote runs off the edge of a cliff and is magically running on air, but as soon as he looks down he starts to fall.

Gravity doesn't work like that. Sure, you can't walk on air, but what's /worse/ is that the difference between walking on air and falling is whether Wile E. Coyote knew that gravity was misbehaving. It's as if Wile E. Coyote could suspend the laws of gravity because he didn't know they were supposed to apply.

Either this power over momentum works against all logic of reference frames, just like Wile E. Coyote could initially run on the air, or it never works like expected because of the problem of reference frames, just like when Wile E. Coyote falls to the ground. But not both, and definitely not because they suddenly became aware that what they were doing was impossible.

*** How finely can you control it?

Its even more powerful than that. If you have precise enough control, you can instantly cool anything to near absolute zero by completely nullifying the kinetic energy of the molecules that make it up. Conversely you can super heat anything by increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules.

Reverse munchkin: You still need air to breathe and you can still be poisoned or asphyxiated. You still need food and water and can thus by poisoned or starved.

*** Doesn't literally everything have momentum, even massless particles like photons? So more or less it's god mode over everything within 1 foot of your body.

With that in mind, about the only thing you could really do is seal the momentum master in a vacuum large enough that they couldn't reach the edge before they suffocate, which would pretty much require them to walk inside your vacuum chamber of their own free will.
