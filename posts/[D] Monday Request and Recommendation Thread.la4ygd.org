Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** A few weeks ago I recommended [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][/Vacant Throne/]] by towercurator since it was wrapping up. Well, last week the final chapter was posted.

It's a pretty fun story about a woman who gets isekai'ed by an angel to a magic world. She has to learn to survive in a new world infested with demons and magic beasts, learns magic from a princess semi-possessed by a dragon, and adopts a shapeshifter as her sister.

The writing was well-done, if a bit plain at times, and I can't remember any spelling/grammar issues.

The world-building was okay. Often it was more alluded to than shown. I kinda wish we saw more of the world instead.

The characters were decent. I felt like there wasn't that much growth with the MC, but the secondary characters did grow into their own as the story progressed. I liked how genuine the characters felt, though the MC could be a bit grating at times.

My biggest peeve would be the pacing. I felt like some scenes, that ended up not being all that important, were given too much focus.

The ending was pretty good. Though I felt there were a few plot-lines that the author had previously started developing that seemed like they were important but were abandoned, which was a shame. And while I wouldn't call the story highly-rational, but it was mostly rational, and the payoff at the end was worth the read.

*** I just read this based on your rec last week. I enjoyed it while I was reading it: the writing was generally well-executed and it kept me engaged through most of the story. After finishing it I'm feeling like the payoff wasn't quite worth the investment, though. It really could have been cut by 1/2 without losing the good aspects of the story.

For what was mostly a qusi-rational story, it also really bugged me how lacking in curiosity the MC was. It felt like she did almost nothing to investigate much of anything, despite having direct access to angelic sources of knowledge that was literally unique among all mortals ever. For instance, for a work titled "Vacant Throne", the MC only bothered to even idly ask an angel where the occupant of said throne had gone /once/ and after being interrupted by a side-question from her mother, never bothered to go back to the question again. Especially given how long the work ended up going, it just started to seem weird how little she was interested in such incredible truths like 'where is God'. No one ever seemed to really think this was worth talking about.

Anyway, I'd give this a middling rec as well, but only if you have time to kill.

** If you haven't been reading Beware of Chicken on Royal Road, the story that in less than one month has unseated Mother of Learning as best-rated on the site, you should be.

It's updated daily, effuses ethos, and never fails to spur a smile.

The comment section can be quite funny as well.

- Oh, but the grammar is sometimes off. The author especially appears somehow chronically confused about whether it's it's or its. Reminds me of my smartphone's autocorrect autocorrecting every instance of its for it's.

**** The comment structure of royal road is quite irritating. The culture of first is a pain but a natural outlet of the structure.

I think that while I enjoy the story it isn't shocking that it overtook Mother Of Learning. It isn't because the story is godly, it is because it has a niche audience and you know pretty easily from the description whether you like it, so there is no obvious source of negative reviews. Of course if it trends into Jin getting too involved with the world that will start the negative rating train.

RoyalRoad reviews are a bit annoying to me because they are primarily the product of genre partitioning. I could be wrong for sure but I don't think it takes into account the exposure.

Long running and widely known stories that are a bit broad genre wise are always going to fall behind hot new stories with very well defined tags and flags.

The Essence of Cultivation and The Perfect Run both have a mere 5 pages of reviews yet are in the top 5. Meanwhile Super Minion has 16 and Beware Of Chicken has 22. Mother Of Learning has a whopping 39.

Number 6, a pokemon fanfic has 9 pages. Is that story really the 6th best on the site?

I'd really love to see their formula.

** I'm interested in finding good stories set in a realistic school environment, particularly in the context of gaming the system. There obviously isn't a shortage of books set in high school or college, but most of what I see looks a little too... pulpy, I guess? It's also possible I just haven't looked hard enough, but hey!

*** I'm not sure if this is what you want, but [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/][Polyhistor Academy]] is a pretty good magic school survival fiction. Premise is that our MC is accepted to a top magical academy and is forbidden to leave or have contact with the outside world during his studies.

Only the top 10% of attendees graduate since the school is extremely lethal and student on student violence is encouraged. But those graduates get unlimited funding for the rest of their lives. Violence is usually swift and brutal, so there aren't many pulpy parts.

It is in quest format, I don't know if that's a dealbreaker for you. You'll also need an account to view it.

Small correction. It isn't that only the top 10% of attendees graduate because the school is extremely lethal and student on student violence is encouraged. Rather, the school's lethality and student-on-student violence are /because/ only the top 10% of attendees are allowed to graduate, and anyone who doesn't make the cut dies or worse.

****** Sure. As far as quest-runners go, I can't recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/search/12168838/][Rihaku's]] works enough. He has a way of writing that encapsulates that 'if you give Frodo a lightsaber, Sauron gets a death star' adage bandied about around here. For me, he hits this sweet spot of pulpy goodness while taking itself seriously.

I like all of his stuff, but here are a couple standouts. There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bleach-quest-story-only-thread.283295/][Bleach Quest]], where the main character is Ishida from Bleach.

His [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/jounin-quest-story-only.244441/][Naruto-setting Jounin Quest]] is great, and complete.

I'd also point out his [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-odyssey-story-only-thread.257553/][The Odyssey]] quest, about a mortal in the world of Exalted . That's the sadly abandoned original, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/exalted-most-high.15728/][here's the equally sadly abandoned reboot.]] There's plenty of story there to get into before they patter out.

His other best stuff is his [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rihakus-as-yet-unnamed-quest.312404/][Unnamed Quest]] which is an isekai, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/even-further-beyond-complete.45951/][Even Further Beyond]] which is a take on xianxia. If the actual quest participation is what you're after, he has an [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-simple-transaction-i.66727/][on-going one I haven't gotten around to reading yet.]]

I'm not a huge quest reader, actually, but I don't want to just recommend one person, so here's another couple: [[https://fiction.live/stories/Deep-Red/3Qk82fibaeXXuvJXm/home][Deep Red by kosm]] is an Avatar (cartoon, not movie) story about an OC oldest daughter of Ozai and Ursa. I think this is also abandoned, but I enjoyed what's there; except for the website it's on, which is a pain.

I also hear really good things about [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]], which started as a xianxia quest. I think the sequel is still being written in quest form somewhere. However, I have had it open in a tab on my phone for literal months now without getting past the first chapter, so you'll have to draw your own conclusions about it.

** I'm going to give a recommendation for Queen of the Castaway Isle.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/queen-of-the-castaway-isle_14926175406224405]]

8 years ago a young women was stranded on a island with her family when her plane and one other crashed and the passengers weren't rescued for 8 years. Nasty shit happened there with numerous deaths from starvation, murders, cannibalism, sex slavery, and worse in a real lord of the flies scenario where there weren't any laws or consequences. The main character lost her siblings and now 8 years later is a broken and insane women debating whether she should kill herself after the people who killed her sister successfully get away with it because they all blamed her for the deaths and claim she is mentally ill. Which considering what she went through, she actually is. Then she has a weird nightmare and wakes up the day before her family left on on a plane. She now has a chance to save her siblings and get revenge. A well researched story on survival, mob mentality, and rational decisions. Also very well written characters and it seems to be almost complete.

**** There is some supernatural issue around the island that is also responsible for another plane that her little sister is on that traveled a few hours before her on a earlier flight. She is only going to save her sister and just as importantly to hurt quite a few people. I wasn't lying when I said she was insane from her experiences and she somehow on some level is happy to be back on the island. She warned her brother not to go with her and he didn't believe her. But she had a single day to make a call to a lawyer for changes to her will, give her cousin some stock advice, and fill the max carry on luggage with useful supplies. There is something supernatural on the island that seems to very much want her back. So word of warning that it a Thriller/Horror novel.

***** It seems like if she put as much effort into finding alternatives to getting on the plane as she did into getting useful supplies, she'd come up with something better. Perhaps she could do her best to make sure that the plane gets found in weeks or months and not the 8 years it took originally, which would do more to help her little sister.

But if I were her, I would feel very, very motivated to think of reasons why it's a good idea to go back to the island where (1) I can also get revenge on the people who made my life hell and got away with it, and (2) I have more survival experience and preparation than anyone else there. Staying behind requires doing things she's not experienced at, relying on other people to help her, and definitely giving up on revenge.

*** Read this up to chapter 50 ish and will probably keep reading. In general, some interesting ideas here, and I'm a sucker for hypercompetent characters, so I've been enjoying it. Atmosphere and setting-wise, this feels a bit like LOST or those parts of Green Arrow where the protagonist becomes a supernaturally good killer by surviving in the toughest place through incredible trials--except that the protagonist has already become a psychopathic badass.

The only major faults I have with this story are all writing and style/prose related. On the basic level, text-speek spellings (like using "ur" instead of your) or plain misspellings sometimes slip in randomly where it makes no sense and the grammar is a bit wonky. At a higher level, the narration perspective is a bit off--it seems to be a 3rd person omniscient retelling by the protagonist with occasional and in-paragraph shifts to the insides of other people's minds. Generally not too difficult to keep track of, but sometimes confusing. In general, this gives slight ESL vibes (chapter titles look like they were force fed through japanese-english google translate) although that might just be the webnovel-weebery leeching in.

*** It's clearly Lost by way of Worm, but the protagonist is so unlikable and repetitive it gets tiresome to read. Instead of using the siblings to provide a counterpoint to the protagonist, they're used as lackeys and underlings she can monologue to. It's not very self-aware. The chapter in which her and her brother browbeat their sister into being less empathetic made me lose interest.

I think it's trying to show morality is full of grey areas, but it very much fails at establishing this properly. Instead it's more like morality comes in 3 colors: The evil pedo rapist, the easily exploited and the "enlightened" cynics. Every wise character is an enlightened cynic, every nice character is easily exploited and everyone the protagonist dislikes is secretly an evil pedo rapist (and she knows this for a fact. There's an extremely graphic flashback to the aftermath of child rape that comes out of fucking nowhere).

Can't spell empathetic without pathetic! Amirite?

Spoilers ahead The concept itself is pretty cool. By calling it Lost by the way of Worm I refer to the fact the storm is clearly some supernatural alien thing isolating the people on the island and giving them superpowers via snakebite, for some reason. The timetravel seems tacked on, but the idea of Worm in an isolated survival scenario with a reduced cast is pretty good. The story would be better without the prepper porn of the first couple chapters. Her sister having gone ahead on an earlier flight is a blatant contrivance meant to keep her from avoiding the island. The way the family dynamic is explained later, it makes no sense for the protagonist to have allowed her to go alone even before she had the horrible life altering island experience. She's described as overprotective several times.

- Daughter of the Sun by Effie Calvin is technically the second book in her Ieflaria series, but it's completely standalone and unconnected to the first. (Later books draw connections between the plots.) Unlike the first, its characters are more adult.

- Daughter of Mystery (Alpennia #1) by Heather Rose Jones is historical fantasy that's super, super good. Well-researched, well-written, lovely romance, riffs on very classic plots and plot beats with a love of the genre and a willingness to do things better. Author is a linguist and it delightfully manifests.

** A rec and a request of more like it: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39307/a-fine-octet-of-legs][A Fine Octet Of Legs]]

I have before asked for more non-human MC's (I especially like Isekai's into something which normally is antagonistic to the "people" of whatever world it is and the interactions that ensue) and this new series seems to be just that.

Others like this I have read: Shade touched, the snake report, super minion, beware of chicken, blue core, Tree of aeons, new life of a summoned demoness, a backwards grin, I woke up as a dungeon now what?, OOgway's little owl, queen of the swarm, I don't want to be the hive queen, Hyphen (pokemon FF), kumo desuga nanika?, and probably more I don't remember.

If anyone knows more like this I could kiss you!

*** There is "The Many Lives of Cadence Lee", but it is unfinished and perhaps on hiatus. Note that the first two lives are still human, it is the third that is non-human.

Just started reading Beware of Chicken, it is a lot of fun. It is a very sweet story.

**** Read both, BoC is I think the second best story (after super minion) I have read on RR so far (it is very rare for a story to keep up its quality like that tho, so this isn't as big a compliment as it seems) while I didn't really enjoy Cadence much, can't really tell what was the problem, it just didn't really interest me much, felt a little... Flat I guess.

*** [[https://zalbert.net/octo/][Octo]] has a distinctly inhuman protagonist, good writing, solid sci-fi elements, and, on top of that, is a fairly rational story. Without going into spoilers territory, it might have something to your liking in the last third especially---although it's not an isekai.

**** The only thing I don't like about Octo is the protagonist's amazing unhurried pace during most of the story. I get that it's computationally bound and maybe it's an artifact of the writing but it feels like sometimes the MC is watching numbers go up for a million years.

The rest of it is great. Very nice sci-fi, feels plausible, interesting memetic hazard that I'm very curious about.

*** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]] is a technically non-human MC, though it's an AI so it's not exactly the 'fantasy monster meets villager' feel that a lot of your other mentions have.

Everybody Loves Large Chests is a famous (infamous?) completed one where the MC is a dungeon mimic and /very/ hostile to the locals. Most complaints revolve around the heavy smut that appears throughout, but if you're looking for a 'monster vs humans' story it's certainly that.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The Snake Report]] is an excellent snake MC story. Book One is relatively normal as far as dungeon animals go, and then Book Two comes out of nowhere with this crawling descent into insanity.

**** I have listed Snake Report, Large chests I read for a bit but got a bit bored, and I don't enjoy human vs monster - I like humans too! I can try PH, but I generally don't like post-apocaliptic stories. I like humans to progress, and it just gives me a bad feeling reading about apocalypses.

Thanks though.

*** Trying to respond to tjhance's request for ratification with trans girl protagonist (had weird bug when trying this earlier)

[[https://pithserial.com]]

It is recommended on here pretty regularly. The main characters are trans girls (although cis and trans make a lot less sense as categories when you can swap bodies as easily as changing clothes), and it is general really well written. I haven't been keeping up with it for a while, but the first 6 arcs and the world building is great.

*** All Night Laundry has a transgirl as the mc's companion (although she's more involved, capable and focused on than the average doctor who type so idk if "secondary protagonist" fits better). Main character is also a lesbian too so that might nudge the queer representation over the bar for you. Story is really good, the epilogue just started up now, and overall plot/themes/visuals is like Homestuck with ~80% of the clusterfuckery cut out.

*** There's more than a couple of Worm fanfics, with varying degrees of rationality.

Here's two request threads linking all that I'm currently aware of:

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/e9janu/lf_fics_with_trans_charactersthemes/]]

Also I loved [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/][Heaven Will Be Mine]], a visual novel set in a very much anti-rational universe. Not gonna say too much about the setting because slowly piecing together what's actually going on is part of the experience. Playing [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/435300/We_Know_the_Devil/][We Know The Devil]] before that might help, but there's only one egg in it, so it doesn't really fit your request.
