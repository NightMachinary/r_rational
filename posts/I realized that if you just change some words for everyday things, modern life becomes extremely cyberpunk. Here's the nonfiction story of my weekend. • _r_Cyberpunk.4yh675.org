Your story sounds awesome, and while it sounds like your life is more cyberpunk than the average person, it makes me feel a real joy and curiosity about your "setting" that I am indescribably happy to know I can sate by educating myself. It brings the escape of fiction to the grounding of nonfiction, and vice-versa. Congradulations, this is the best piece of creative non-fiction I've read this year.

** Not my post, but it reminded me of the "Joy in the merely real" sequence.

Of course "joy" isn't exactly the right sentiment...

*** I'm the op, and joy isn't that far off. Most of this story is me flying RC aircraft with my friend or hanging out with my goat. Can't think of anything I'd rather be doing.

***** Sadly he's a male and produces no milk, bulletproof or otherwise. He's a pack goat; when he's grown, he'll carry some of my gear on backpacking trips.
