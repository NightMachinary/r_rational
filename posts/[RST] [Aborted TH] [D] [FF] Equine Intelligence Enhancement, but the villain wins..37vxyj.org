** In response to [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/233242/the-pill#comment/6036916][your review.]] Here be spoilers.

First, I feel you were undeservedly rude to mrmaximus, and you should consider apologising. Just because you didn't like the final plot twist is no reason to insult the author. The story was reasonably well-written, the jokes worked, and it's entirely your personal interpretation that the bad guys won in the end - an interpretation which I do not share and the author does not share.

So what if it doesn't conform to your beliefs? Normal people are perfectly capable of reading stories written from a viewpoint that's different from their own. It's one of the best ways to learn about others.

--------------

Now then, for someone who claims to be rational, you're really not parano[[/r/NotParanoidEnough][i]]d enough about rogue superintelligences and un-Friendly AIs. Rainbow Dash takes an /under-tested drug which does not behave as it was supposed to/, and decides to conquer the neighbouring empire (and has a good shot at pulling it off) - which Twilight and /the original Rainbow Dash/ find abhorrent. Clearly, she's lost her moral compass.

I think it's hopelessly optimistic to trust that she really has found the best solution - by the end of the story, she's one step away from becoming a cackling supervillain, and three steps from becoming a paperclip maximiser. If you create a superhuman (superpony) intelligence that's not provably Friendly, pulling the plug on it is absolutely the right thing to do.

*** Good points. However, there are no indications that Dash lost her morality, or even that she found her actions abhorrent, given that she did not even take the time to understand why she originally thought war was necessary in the first place. It was a knee-jerk reaction to a situation she did not fully understand, much like many other knee-jerk moralistic reactions to morally ambiguous necessities.

And I'm not sure what you think is wrong with being a cackling supervillain. Laughter is very healthy for oneself, and should be exercised regularly to ensure you don't crush the world in a fit of totalitarian ennui. :P

Why is it that you recognise intelligence-enhanced mice as a dangerous threat, but an intelligence-enhanced pony is a harbinger of rationalist utopia? Are you showing a speciesist streak?

Or was Dash's resolution to conquer the Griffon Empire a testament to her good character? (Well, they're only griffons...)

***** It has nothing to do with a preference towards ponies. Dash's resolution to conquer the Griffon Empire is in reaction to the extant threat of war, and her actions are ones that will minimize death and suffering. The enhanced mice are similarly endangering the lives and well-beings of others, simply for revenge on Twilight. Her actions make total moral sense in a consequentialist view.

The logical prediction for the mice is that they will continue to be treated as vermin by the ponies, therefore a preemptive strike is rational.

****** Well, the better thing to do would have been to clear her plan with the princesses first, and not start a major war because an empire seemed like a nice welcome-home present.

I'm still not sure how you can possibly think Rainbow's the good guy here. Let's recap:

- Within two days of gaining superpowers, is making major strides towards taking over the world.
- Casually sacrifices the lives of many soldiers for the sake of the greater good.
- Ignores and disparages the advice of her best friend. Remember that the show is literally called /Friendship is Magic/.

Does [[/r/rational]] have a blind spot in recognising supervillains or something? Between this and HPMoR's Quirrell practically wearing an "I am Voldemort" T-shirt, I'm starting to wonder. What more does she have to do to convince you she's the villain of the story?

And Lex Luthor. There's a rational /Superman/ fanfic where we're more-or-less rooting for Lex fucking Luthor.

Maybe I should just start tagging people as Apologist for Obvious Villain when they do this stuff. Actually, no, that'll never work. It'll just start "Villain X DID NOTHING WRONG" threads.

Take even more personal initiative and become a more interesting character. I mean, that is the problem: we kinda want to root for the villain because they're the ones with plans and ideas. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact][Due to an unfortunate bias of literary structure, heroes are usually basically reactive]] -- [[http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=953][and therefore basically reactionary]].

(If anyone still wonders why the fuck I'm so fanboyish over /Gurren Lagann/: it is one of the very few stories to reverse the trend. The heroes are taking initiative and trying to build something, the villains are motivated precisely by their belief that doing so is ultimately destructive and futile, that no initiatives and no progressive efforts must be undertaken ever again.)

What? Exactly when did that ever happen? And mirror clones don't even count as people, or else Twilight /in canon/ is a mass murderer.

#+end_quote

Again, /when?/ Twilight barely said anything in reaction, and all she did was try to come up with logistic problems that Dash already had addressed. Twilight didn't give any advice in the first place, besides "Hey Dash don't do this thing," which was a normative prescription that Twilight didn't even justify.

#+begin_quote
  major strides towards taking over the world
#+end_quote

/"Right, well according to our spies inside the empire, it's because they're working on a secret weapon estimated to be greater than or equal to our magic. If they achieve something like that, then it could be a toss up as to whether or not the Princesses could keep them in check with their magic alone."/

/"I spent hours trying to think of the best way to achieve a lasting peace with them"/

No such thing. First of all, the Griffon Empire being called an Empire doesn't really mean anything; the show's sense of scale seems to view empires as having populations the size of Ponyville if you look at the Crystal Empire and Griffonstone. Secondly, one nation is not the entirety of the world, and, as I have repeatedly pointed out, it was a preemptive strike to prevent greater loss on both sides when the Griffons attempt their own invasion.

I'm still not sure how you can possibly think Rainbow's a supervillain here. It's kind of ridiculous for you to claim so; at the very worst she's misguided. There is no evidence in the text that Dash is being nefarious, underhanded, or immoral. She is solving problems on behalf of Equestria.

********** Certainly. Let me explain my argument in more detail:

- Rainbow Dash declared pre-emptive war on a rival nation.
- All else being equal, fictional supervillains are more likely than non-supervillains to declare pre-emptive war. (I only gave one example. I can find more if you want.)
- Therefore, this is evidence that Rainbow is being painted as the supervillain.

--------------

Okay, this argument is getting too long, so I'll weaken my position in the hope of finding a compromise. Can we at least agree that the plot is putting Rainbow in the role of the villain? We can think about the "should superintelligences be assumed good or evil" problem some other time.

The plot of this story is simple and classic, straight out of /Frankenstein/ or /Jekyll and Hyde/ or /Honey, I Shrunk the Kids/. A scholar makes a fantastic discovery, applies it foolishly, and then has to deal with the consequences before everything they care about is destroyed. Twilight Sparkle is in the "hubristic creator" role as the protagonist, and Rainbow Dash is in the "abomination of science" role as the antagonist.

It can be fun to re-read a story from the villain's perspective and see how they had good intentions (as all deep characters should) and had a good chance of success (as all effective villains should). But the author didn't write Dash as the good guy, and it's his story.
