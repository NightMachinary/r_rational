Going through another reread of HPMOR after recommending it to a new friend.

For the first time in this readthrough I realized why Dumbledore said this after Harry's escape via rocket powered broomstick:

#+begin_quote
  "Who's behind it?" shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a pace away from her.

  "One of two people," Dumbledore said back, "I know not, at this instant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second, we are all in far greater trouble."
#+end_quote

I'd glossed over this many times before, not really grokking what Dumbledore was thinking. I gathered of course that he suspects Harry and Voldemort, but had never really settled in my mind why one was "far greater trouble."

I think I had assumed on first read through he thought Harry's involvement would mean trouble because it showed his recklessness or unsuitability as a hero, and Voldemort would be worse because it shows he's watching Harry's actions and copying his use of muggle technology, which is a new and terrible threat.

But now I think it's the other way around.

"Trouble" is voldemort.

"Far grater trouble" is Harry - because it would indicate that Harry is NOT a "good" copy of voldemort as he seems, he's a true evil copy of Voldemort and has been playing Dumbledore for a fool. In this case they are ROYALLY SCREWED, because the prophesied hero is actually the villain, and they have no chance at all of defeating two Voldemorts without the help of prophecy. The World is doomed, Dumbledore's game with Time failed; he placed all his hope and trust in Harry saving the people of the world somehow, but if he is evil, there's no hope at all of a happy ending.


** I read it as Voldemort being trouble and Harry being far greater trouble, but not for that reason. It's simply that, if it's Harry, that means he thinks he knows better than all of Magical Britain what's best for them and is unwilling to compromise, bow to politics, or consider slower or less revolutionary solutions to things he observes as problems. In essence, it's what Quirrel said at the end of that arc: if Harry does conquer Magical Britain, overturn the aristocracy and democracy to institute a Harryocracy, and begin to optimize the world as he wishes, he will be their Dark Lord whether or not the magic he uses is actually Dark.

Basically, Dumbledore is deeply concerned that it was either Voldemort, or a far smarter, more dangerous, and more self-righteous Grindelwald. The only advantage to the Grindelwald option is that he's just 11 at this point...but how much of an advantage is that when 11 year old Grindelwald has already invented two incredibly powerful magical techniques which should have been impossible, under a year after discovering that magic even exists?

*** I think at the very least, Harry's uncompromising stance is only part of Dumbledore's worries. From Chapter 61:

#+begin_quote
  "In any case," said the Potions Master. "I looked within Mr. Lestrange to see if he knew anything of his mother's escape. He has heard nothing. But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the person responsible was Harry Potter."

  "I see..." Albus said slowly. "Thank you, Severus. That is good news."
#+end_quote

I think he's more worried about Harry actually being giving in to his Voldemort tendencies and corrupting his motives. Dumbledore would still strongly oppose a plan to break into Azkaban even to save an innocent person, purely on the grounds of maintaining the peace, but the other side of that argument would not alarm him nearly as much as someone who possesses the intellect to defeat Voldemort giving in to the dark side.

And the other problem with that is that only being 11 is a temporary condition.

*** I think Dumbledore was imagining something more direct in this case. His main thought about why someone would free Bellatrix was the horcrux, and I think this indicates he's afraid of harry now, not in the future, as he'd have to be aligned with voldemort to do this.

** Dumbledore ransacked the hall of prophecy and assassinated Harry's pet rock to force an unbreakable vow not to destroy the world on him. If the only one who can guide the world through the tiny path that allows survival is evil, that is bad.

** I haven't read this, well I read the like first 10 chapters or something like 2 years ago. Is it all 11 year old Harry? Basically from what I've seen on this subreddit nobody talks about like, 5th or 6th year Harry. I'm not the biggest fan of fanfics (especially rational fics) that “solve” the story in his first year. Does the story do it well/not at all?

I get that it birthed the genre and all that jazz and I'm gonna get 15 people telling me to just read it but I don't know /: I don't want to not like something everyone is supposed to like. I remember it being a really science-y type of rational. With like theories and shit explained. I've only been reading rational stories where the characters just make sound decisions based on their situation, not where they are a professor.

*** Yes, it's all 1st year. There is a fairly interesting sequel though; "Significant Digits", authored by someone else and iirc canonized by Yudkowsky. There is also "Sequel/Super-prequel" to Significant Digits; "Orders of Magnitude", non-canonized though.

*** there is a very good reason the story takes only 1 year. having it drug out over 6 wouldn't make sense with the initial conceit of the story. It remains my favorite rational fic and my favorite fanfic for many reasons; and I'd say the first 11 chapters aren't representative of the whole =)

***** Just read it, it's AMAZING and doesn't feel rushed in the slightest. I believe it is around 700k words IIRC, and the entire HP series is only around a million words. So it's basically got books 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 all put together in one year (the word count of all 5 books in 1 year, with a lot of side-adventures). I prefer it over the original work, lol (original Harry Potter) but it's very niche.

*** It does all take place over the course of one year. It's not - as you asked in another comment - because of time travel, but because the characters driving the plot don't need more than a year to have their plans reach their climax. It's not like the story is complete at that point, just the primary narrative thrust introduced /early on/ in the book rather than later, which sets up the world after (hence why there are so many continuation fics, like Significant Digits, which I second another's commenter's recommendation of).

There are definitely some people who don't like it, and some of them for entirely understandable reasons. But the first 10 chapters really aren't representative of the book as a whole. Harry being rather arrogant and blind to his own faults is the major criticism I've seen of the book from people who abandoned it early on, so if that was a reason you gave it up, I recommend you pick it up again, because that was an intentional choice and was imperative to some arcs of character growth. If you /really/ didn't like it, and for other reasons, I don't think you'll enjoy the rest of the book.

Methods of Rationality falls under rationalistic fiction as it does rational fiction, the key difference being the former involves didactic writing. That doesn't overwhelm the book in my opinion, but it's very subjective. It isn't very technical either, mostly just interesting experimental results and partly an 11 year-old trying to show off. Harry does spend much of the time just making sound (and the occasional insane and entirely self-gratifying because blind to his own faults blah blah) decisions.

****** It's got a similar thing to /Worm/ where a large amount of the word count is spent on the main character's thought process, but differs in that Harry is eager to explain what he thinks. Thus, the thought process is formatted as an explanatory conversation, rather than an internal monologue.\\
I feel this is more rewarding, but it is somewhat annoying to read, because you have to pay close attention to when characters might be lying. Some people read the book three or four times, because there are so many layers of 'knowing what will be revealed in the future of the book, this dialogue is much more interesting!'

*** It's definitely heavier on the rational/-ist/ part than the rational. And it does have its weaknesses. But it's definitely still a good read IMO.

Also, it isn't some kind of fix-fic where a smarter Harry Potter goes through the stations of canon and does everything "right". The only things that happen quite like canon is Harry getting a wand, Harry meeting Draco, Ron and Hermione pretty much where he first met them last time, Harry being offered multiple houses by the hat, and Neville falling off a broomstick on his first lesson and dropping the Rememberall. Everything else is new.
