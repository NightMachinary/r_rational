** A bit ago I was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41jwrv/bstrthf_name_for_the_new_novel/][asking for help coming up with a name]] for my new project. Well, the blue ribbon goes to [[/u/JackStargazer]] for his suggestion, "The Tinker's Daughter".

I waffled between "Daughter" and "Children", and I'm still not 100% sure; it might change when it goes for publication. For now, however, I hope you enjoy the story!

** It's happening!

It's interesting that Rob is intelligent enough to understand bayesian probability and deductive analysis, but barely intelligent enough to speak and not able to speak while thinking hard. Orthogonal intelligence is hard to understand though, and golems are pretty orthogonal to humans in that regard.

It appears worldlines are something like all the potential future timelines, and one can gain mana by cutting those lines (by killing her). They also appear to be directly related to human life. Not sure if Rob counts or not. It could also be that humans just have much more impact on the world than average rocks or whatever.

Personal preference: "that myriad worldlines shivered," but that's just me.

Currency is "marks." The mark was the German currency before the Euro. Conclusion: society based on Germany? Location is in a desert, so not Germany in that way.

Magic can engineer animals. Is this genetic (ie. biopunk magic) or plain magic (ie. the magic changes something and continually enforces the change)

** Hmm. The source of mana is intriguing, but leaves open large questions and huge ramifications.

For example, the main character's entire future has been cut down. Who, mechanically, would reap that? Or, would it go unclaimed? Or do you do a different kind of ritual that sacrifices the possible futures? Seems like there's a clear set of operations that do cut off world-lines (mixing things together, death), but another set that narratively cover that but would not do so physically - making enemies out of friends, for instance.

It also seems a way to probe the future. Gambling with picked numbers, for example - if I win, I have a great many more world-lines. Does that mean that I can determine which numbers to pick by seeing which world-lines have the most mana to give up?

There's also an interesting thing that happens when a mage is paid marks, as it would seem like it also pays them mana. Harvesting mana itself would seem to open new world-lines, although that can be explained easily by the mechanics of mana, magic, and the harvesting process.

*** Great questions; thank you for proposing them.

There's a time horizon on mana income. The farther in the future the big changes are, the less you get from them. There was a worldline where Peter survived and therefore Jess grew up to become a Great Mage who touched the lines of millions of people. Cutting that line off doesn't yield much, because those changes were so far in the future.

The immediate answer, though, is "the person who set the fire."

There's no way to directly see the amount of mana that a worldline would yield. For that matter, you don't know what the worldlines in front of you are -- there are only a handful of people in the world who can directly perceive worldlines, and they're all crazy. Combine this lack of knowledge with the time delay on receiving the mana and the time-horizon discounting and divination by mana received isn't really doable.

True, getting paid money increases your worldlines by a marginal amount, but it's purely nominal unless the amount of money represents an orders-of-magnitude change in your circumstances.
