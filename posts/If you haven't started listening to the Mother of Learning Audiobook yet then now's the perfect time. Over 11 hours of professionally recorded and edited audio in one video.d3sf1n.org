** Thank you to everyone that has listened to chapters as they were released. Please like and comment on the video to boost its YouTube rankings,

I am paying my editor to edit each chapter released thanks to the wonderful people supporting the project on [[https://Patreon.com][Patreon.com]]. I am running at a bit of a loss each week so if there is anyone who wants to support the editing process and keep these chapters coming out as fast as possible then please head over to Patreon and take a look.

[[https://www.patreon.com/jackvoraces]]

Every chapter is also available in podcast form from all major podcast apps.

Thanks again for all your love and support

Jack

*** When do you think the audiobook version will be completed approximately? I don't like starting incomplete things. Been waiting on Mother of Learning to wrap for ages so I can read it, but I can wait a bit longer for the audiobook version potentially.

**** It could take a while. Its a chapter a every at the moment. If I suddenly got a massive amount support on Patreon I may be able to do it a lot faster but cant afford the editing to do it much quicker.

** If one were to have read the first chapter or three way back when that were all that existed, and decided that they wanted to read the entire god damned thing in one-ish sitting, would nowish be a good time to begin reading it? I'd be fine with waiting a few months for the official climax/end.

Like, the first day of fall is a week from now. Perhaps I read Ch1 a week from now. Do you think MOL will be finished by Christmas?

** Honest question that you will most likely find rude, but do you have nobody103's permission to use his content? Also would the profits from YouTube & other websites be going straight to him? (Ofc whatever Patreon sponsors wish to give should be going to you for content creation)

*** We discussed this in length before I started recording so yes there is permission. There are no adds on the video so no money being made. If I'm able to put adds on later then I would discuss it with the author.

**** It might be best to add this to the video description, as more people in the future are bound to ask this - no point in replying to each and every person!

*** To quote the audiobook creator's response to a similar inquiry on an earlier post:

#+begin_quote
  I contacted the author and we discussed the production of a free podcast of me narrating Mother of Learning. He agreed and we have progressed from there.

** Did you redo chapter 1? If so I can really notice the difference and like it. If not, it's my imagination :p

Just listened to all of them, and enjoyed the accents. Thanks!

*** Hahaha yes I did (and chapter 2) I was more into the book and knew the characters better and also had my editor edit it this time, she does a much better job but didn't have the funds to pay her when I was just starting.
