** I've followed this comic since the beginning. Never read anything outside the actual comics, so I have no idea what context it exists within or anything about the author/artist. It has had various quiet periods and odd update schedules (like I'm one to talk) and I kind of lost track of what was happening in it.

Capital S Sci-fi themes, but it seems like a series of thinly related vignettes in only vaguely related settings, with reused characters and sparsely explored backstories and plots. Almost like more of an art character study or experimental thing, especially compared to other high-quality, and contrariwise high-ish volume color webcomics like Girl Genius.

Like a lot of the art, but the main female character is tripping along the border of being a nerd fetish object in several different ways and particulars, which is a little /ehhh/. Not that I don't /like/ that sometimes, but it seems borderline gratuitous for a story-based comic, and combined with flimsy plot makes it seem exploitative without being brave enough to really own that. This is from someone who personally writes smut and liked Michael Poe's work (if that helps any old-schoolers, context-wise). Perhaps that's unfair, but it was my reaction at the time.

Feel free to correct anything I've gotten wrong here. It isn't something I've spent much time studying, and I get the feeling there might be more to it from side channels I simply haven't followed.

That's how it started out, but it's gradually moving towards longer story arcs. There's two of them so far: /Hob/ starts [[http://dresdencodak.com/2007/02/08/pom/][here]] and lasts for 27 pages, and /Dark Science/ starts [[http://dresdencodak.com/2010/06/03/dark-science-01/][here]] and is still ongoing. /Hob/ and /Dark Science/ are thematically very different, but they share a canon. The vignettes don't.

I'd never really thought about Kim as a fetish object. Her high intelligence, robotic skills, and tendency to philosophise, I can see that much should appeal to us nerds. It's the heroic mad scientist archetype, the same that HJPEV and Agatha Heterodyne are pulled from. Definitely nerd-appeal. But I assume you mean "fetish" in a non-sexual way, unless socially awkward amputees are considered attractive these days.

I don't want to sleep with her, I want to /be/ her.

Edit: Okay, okay, point made. I can see it now, there's a lot of fanservice around Kim, I just got overly defensive of a comic that I really like. Thank you all for correcting me.

Second edit: Regarding continuity, it seems I was wrong. [[http://dresdencodak.tumblr.com/post/4031311313/is-there-any-in-story-chronological-order-to][The author explains that all the strips "actually happened"]], but don't overthink it - Hob and Dark Science are self-contained stories, and neither requires any prior knowledge to fully appreciate.

Socially awkward is nerd catnip, if done in the right way. A girl that no one understands, who gets into social trouble because she's really enthusiastic about her areas of interest? There's a reason that the term "adorkable" was coined. A /properly/ awkward girl is approachable, tugs at the instinct towards protection, and gets points for defying stupid social norms. It's an endearing quality in a character. (In real life, socially awkward comes with a lot of downsides.)

Also, "amputee" in this context means "has wicked cool robot limbs", which is a definite plus in my book.

Edit: I don't think there's anything wrong with making a character that pushes a lot of people's buttons like that, for the record.

**** it may be a bit overtalked, but i want to take a stab at the general "fetishized" point, because i thought it was always a mild weakness of Dresden Codak; though these days i dont think it happens very much, so perhaps its a past problem. There is nothing wrong with characters being sexy, having sex lives, or even striking sexual poses; but to be non "fetishy" that should come from the character's internal motivation. i think the linked "dating" strips are actually poor examples, because there Kim is actively thinking about romance, so would act in something approaching a romantic way. if in those strips she were to strike seductive poses, that would be fine, cause she /wants/ to be.

However, the Hob storyline also has strips like these: [[http://dresdencodak.com/2007/11/04/the-impasse/]] [[http://dresdencodak.com/2007/06/30/in-the-company-of-science/]]

Where we have random butt shots, and a logic defying semi nude welding/mechanic outfit. im pretty sure that Kim, the character, has no intention of being sexy at all, yet the "audience view" is presenting in such a way as to draw attention to her sexiness. So we are meant to think about her in a sexual/romantic manner in scenes where the focus should be on the words/plot/whatever. So its less about being a "cute nerdy girl" then the way the "camera" focuses on her cuteness/sexiness at awkward times, when the character herself is very much not trying to be that way.

****** i do! As i briefly mentioned, the Hob storyline in general has this problem, but the Dark Science storyline less so. There are less "fanservice poses", and in addition, the plot of Dark Science very much has a focus on Kim's body, and how she relates to it (specifically the prosthetics). There are many shots of her body, but are generally constructed in such a way that any sexual nature would be secondary to the primary focus of the shot, such as here: [[http://dresdencodak.com/2010/07/26/dark-science-04/]] (the focus is on the emblem, as well as highlighting the artificial lines on her back). i think his tumblr even has a post saying things similar to what ive typed at some point, so he is aware.

A note to make though btw is that "2007" might seem like a long time ago, but Dresden Codak has a very slow update schedule; The ones we linked are only like 50 something strips ago, and Kim only has 2 storylines plus older vignettes (that suffer just as much from the sexualizing problems). So for any given reading, seeing 50% or more of the storylines being fetishy means its easy to think of the whole strip being that way.

**** Oh, I meant it in a /very/ sexual way. Fetishistic display of robotic limbs is a thing, as are robots themselves, mad science, steam punk-isms of lace and chrome, and even just awkward nerd-girl-isms (even /genuine/ ones with strong grounding and world building support). It is all about the presentation.

Don't get me wrong. Agatha is still presented as a innocent virgin sex-symbol, tight corset and bodice and hip-hugging skits and all, but it isn't the /primary/ selling point for the work. It's just more character exploration, and it helps in explaining why the cute boys go ga-ga over her while not hiding the pandering. She also doesn't get physically abused in loving slow-mo panels, or spend valuable time emotionally presenting to camera, which is something I get more than hints of in Dresden Codak.

But again. That isn't a bad thing, in and of itself. It's just that I wish it /owned/ that more, made it something front and center, instead of making me feel like it was bait or something sneaked in to trick readers into liking a work that's really about something else.

I've been trying to sum up my thoughts on the matter for a while, but now I don't have to because you've done it better then I could.

<rant>

It's kind of weird how he does that and occasionaly spouts the feminist party line, but I suppose that it makes sense when comic geeks are getting upset about Thor being female. Just wish he wouldn't conflate defending strong female characters with censoring comments critical of your ideology and all the other "ends justify the means" tactics that modern feminism seems to have made a part of their identity.

***** He's an artist, who has to be good at drawing the human form. It's normal to practise your skills with character studies of your character in different poses and states of dress.

Would you be saying the same if he'd done a male character study?

EDIT: Actually he did publish some 'pinup' sketches of Kimiko. I think his explanation makes sense though:

#+begin_quote
  Inspired by a couple of amputee pinup photo shoots, I wanted to put together something similar with my own amputee character. This is obviously not the sort of thing that would be in the Dresden Codak comic (which is at most PG-13), but I found it a fun exercise. I hate it when people with prostheses or those who are otherwise “disabled” are portrayed as incomplete in some way. It's simply not true, and something I hope I successfully address with my work in general. People are much more than the sum of their parts.

  I originally posted these a month or so ago, but it accidentally got caught in a deletion craze I got in with the archives. I wanted to repost it because I didn't want to give the impression that I didn't stand by the work or something like that. In reality, I've gotten such nice thoughts and comments from various people, including amputees, and it would be a shame to not make the set available again.

****** Someone who is vocal about supporting empowering women might believe it, or might be doing it cynically for signaling value. His other behavior is not terribly consistent with him believing it, so it's more likely that he's doing it cynically. Signalling it cynically is possible regardless of his beliefs, but is more likely in worlds where he is self-aggrandizing and doesn't care about empowering women than in worlds where he just has no strong opinion.

Basically, if he believed it, I'd expect his comics (and particularly his publicly-shared non-comic art) to match his statements, and if he had no strong opinions, I'd expect him to less vigorous about paying lip service to it (something more like "Yes, empowering women is important, but sometimes it has to give way to the needs of the art"). Neither of those is what we see, so that's weak evidence toward 'Aaron Diaz is cynically using feminism for self-aggrandizement and doesn't care about it as a philosophy'.

I don't particularly care either way; if he /is/ using feminism for cynical self-aggrandizement, he's not anywhere close to being the most obnoxious or the most exploitative of the people who are (Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, respectively, have him beat, off the top of my head), and I'm not going to object to titillating art of awesome women.

***** It's interesting to read how everyone seems to have gotten this vibe from it. It's tempting to dismiss it - to write it off as some guys projecting their own insecurities unfairly on the writer of one of the few good stories out there with an interesting female protagonist - but I guess that would be unfair. Maybe there's something in it.

But I love Dresden Codak, and I enjoy reading the author's blog. He really does post quite a lot in support of more diverse and empowered depictions of women in popular culture.

Well I brought it up because it has an interesting female main character, but she isn't 'sexy' like possibly Kimiko might be considered to be (although I find myself wincing at the idea of rating a character's sexiness, as if there's only one interpretation of that). At least I don't think people would accuse Nimona's author of pandering to 'nerd fetishes' (if even /that's/ a fair category to propose!), at least not the sort you're talking about.

But maybe you could argue it's still doing it, just for a different sort of fetish? But you could say that about literally everything? So why are we doing this again?

Anyway, Nimona has a female lead who doesn't spend much (any?) time undressed, is never in any sort of romantic situation, and is short and plump and has shaved hair. ^{Therefore not sexy, right? :/} It also has two male characters who appear to hate each other but have this interesting relationship and were fairly probably once in a relationship, but their sexuality is not, I don't think, ever actually confirmed or made a big deal of.

All in all it does somewhat contrast with Dresden Codak.

********* Well in final defence of Kimiko's portrayal as 'sexy', then:

- Dresden Codak has interesting storylines with an interesting setting none of which rely themselves on Kimiko being sexy
- Kimiko is an interesting character in ways that aren't to do with being sexy
- Kimiko isn't comically, unrealistically sexy, like so many over-sexed female characters
- Isn't an interesting, intelligent female character /allowed/ to be at all sexy or to have onscreen relationships? Is being sexy permanently mutually exclusive with being anything else? I think this is what Aaron was going for when he deliberately sketched pinups of Kimiko without hiding her prosthetics.

Maybe I just didn't let myself see the 'pandering', but I feel that if I wouldn't complain about a fic with a good-looking straight male character who the author has sketched topless, then I shouldn't complain about such a female character just because I was concerned about some nerds getting their rocks off about it. If she was an obviously over-sexualised, paper-thin character then I'd be with you.
