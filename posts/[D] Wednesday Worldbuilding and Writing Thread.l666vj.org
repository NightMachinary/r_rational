Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** What are the requirements to be able to cross the Atlantic and Pacific oceans? Like could the ships of the Roman republic do it or some other ancient people? Was it a problem of navigation or the ships themselves?

*** Around 1000 ad, Viking explorers sailed all the way to America, and found a settlement there. The settlement only lasted 2 years, because between the unforgiving wilderness and the worsening relations with the Natives, there was just no point in staying.

Similarly, Chinese explorers were very close to actually discover America before Columbus, and could easily sail to Australia, but there was nothing there they would need

Ancient and Medieval explorers did not seek virgin land just to settle: they wanted new land that would be relatively close to established trade routes, had some natural resources that can be exported, and robust population to conquer, enslave, or at least trade with locally.

Prior to 1500s, there were no technological or agricultural means to make remote wilderness an useful colony, so such colonies were rarely attempted. Roman, Medieval European and Chinese ships were more than good enough to sail across the globe, there was just no point to it.

It was only after European empires grew powerful enough economically to send tens of thousands of people to Americas and Australia, and have hundreds of ships going to and fro with ore and grain, then it become economically viable.

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl][Thor Heyerdahl]] did a certain amount of research into this matter, building boats using primitive techniques and local materials and then trying to sail them across the Atlantic or Pacific.

/Kon-tiki/ (1947) was a raft that he sailed halfway across the Pacific on, and /Ra II/ was made from mainly papyrus reed, based on ancient Egyptian designs, and crossed the Atlantic to reach Barbados. (There was a /Ra/ as well before /Ra II/, but it ran into difficulties and the crew had to be rescued).

**** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor%20Heyerdahl][Thor Heyerdahl]]*

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tuːr ˈhæ̀ɪəɖɑːl]; 6 October 1914 -- 18 April 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany and geography. Heyerdahl is notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between societies. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development.

***** The austronesian people spread from Taiwan to all the islands in the Pacific and as far as Madagascar. So navigation is far more important than the ships.

** Humanity on Speed:\\
/How would the world change if the whole human population was on amphetamines?/

Scenario/:/ a new virus silently spreads throughout the population. The symptoms are mostly harmless, similar to a 7-day common cold.

However, the convalescents develop an interesting condition: their bodies and brains function as if they were constantly on a minor dose of amphetamine. They do not develop tolerance over time, and this condition does not interfere with other medication (including consumed amphetamines). The "condition" is incurable, and the penetration of the virus had reached that of the common cold viruses combined.

How would our culture, society, economy and politics change?

#+end_quote

Ouch, amphetamine-like effect on their bodies too? This is going to make minor injuries and infections of fingers and toes much more common, especially when combined with nicotine. Ordinarily, amphetamine usage could be halted when peripheral perfusion problems crop up, providing time to recover, but a permanent effect is going to make things more difficult.

** I'm working on the worldbuilding for a setting, but I'm having trouble coming up with a coherent naming schema.

Normally I'd just steal names from real life, but my story is a portal fantasy so Earth exists in my setting already. It stains the suspension of disbelief that you'd find two cultures from two worlds that both used the names Charlie, Kyle, and Melanie, for example.

So basically, I need a way to name a bunch of characters, where you can tell that the names come from a common culture, without explicitly copying the names from a culture on Earth.

*** The Lazy Shortcut Method takes the end-and-beginning of ordinary names. Charlie -> Liech. Kyle -> Lek. Melanie -> Nieme.

The Other Lazy Shortcut method involves picking a single syllable - and having /all/ names end with that syllable (at least, in a single culture). Such as Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, Vitalstatistix, Justforkix.

The Doing It Halfway method means that you grab names from some /other/ culture of Earth's history. Like Brutus, Copernicus, Julius, Nero.

The Taking It Seriously method involves first creating a language for your Portal People, and then generating names based of mispronounciations of words in that language...

*** I'm no con-langer, but one trick is to pick distinct initial consonant clusters for words of a certain language. Although still ones that English speakers can manage.

For example Vlad, zwei, and Mbuti are easy to identify as foreign words belonging to separate cultures and regions.

Another trick is to pick consonants a language doesn't have. Having no r's will give a particular sound to a language. For example, Hawai'ian only has like eight consonants.

*** Depending on the translation situation, you could use the translations of the names in the new world rather than the names themselves. For example, according to behindthename Charlie is derived from the words for either "man" or "warrior", Kyle from "channel", and Melanie from "dark". Translating the names as the root words would save you from having to come up with how the other world's language works, and they might also provide an easy way to illustrate the different cultures based on what they refer to or how they're structured.

*** A trick I like to use is, when language is assume to be autotranslated, making it clear that the names are being translated too. Here's an example from an abandoned project I was working on:

#+begin_quote
  Her name was not Rose, becauses roses were not a flower endemic to this world. But the name she did bear owed its etymology to a flowering plant that was red, beautiful, and dangerous, so the appellation “Rose” served better than most at conveying the meaning behind her name.
#+end_quote

Then you can establish a pattern-- a character with green skin becomes "Esmeralda", while a character named after a historical conqueror becomes "Alexander."
