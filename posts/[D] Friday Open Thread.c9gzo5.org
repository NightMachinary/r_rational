Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I'm reposting my comment from [[/r/starslatecodex]]'s Friday Fun Thread, because our Friday Open Thread starts pretty late for me ;)

--------------

This week I strongly recommend the [[https://publicdomainreview.org][Public Domain Review]], an online magazine dedicated to showcasing works that fallen into the public domain.

It doesn't shy away from sharing the strange and beautiful. Doesn't matter whether it's this [[https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4787/39875300915_69417f90d1_b.jpg][Egg-man with a goat-dick]] (that'll haunt me in my dreams) from [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-drolatic-dreams-of-pantagruel-1565/][The Drolatic Dreams of Pantagruel (1565)]] or [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-bakemono-zukushi-monster-scroll-18th-19th-century/][The Bakemono Zukushi “Monster” Scroll]] by an unknown artist.

It's a great place to find images for your blog/story/site, "learn" [[https://farm1.staticflickr.com/978/40962666254_a8919a49c9_b.jpg][how to build a fox trap]] (by [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/utagawa-hiroshige-last-great-master-of-ukiyo-e/][Utagawa Hiroshige]]) or go back in time and browse [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-art-of-book-covers-1820-1914/][old book cover art]] (I hope [[https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7823/46348542094_20d30c5b48_o.jpg][Mr Sweet Potatoes]] is a children's books. See this beautiful cover of [[https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7926/47020121602_46511f733a_o.jpg][From the Earth to the Moon]] by Jules Verne).

Lastly, the amazing [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/photographs-of-models-of-the-moon-1874/][photographs of (models of) the moon from (1874)]] (made not by a professional astronomer but by "a leading entrepreneurial engineer of his day") must have been a trip to see back then.

If anyone can recommend a similar site, I'd be grateful.

*** I haven't "beaten" my tendencies, but by dint of long effort over years, I feel that I've had notable improvement. No one step was a game changer, but I just kept picking myself up, shaking off the failures, and trying again. And as much as I can see vast ballrooms for improvement now, when I look at the me of 5 years ago, he seems like a distinctly inferior lifeform. Momentum builds.

*** The best thing that worked for me is [[http://www.beeminder.com][www.beeminder.com]] - you tell it your goals (they have to be quantifiable though) and then you report your progress. If you don't make progress, you pay them money (which is how the website makes money).

It's great, the team of admins is nothing short of excellent (very responsive to emails, I feel like they're friends). I have acheived SO MANY GOALS thanks to it - like I had a book on my bedside table for about two years without ever picking it up (my dopamine farm - aka my phone - was always somehow more appealling at bedtime). Once I put "pages read" as a beeminder metric, i finished that book - and a second book only it was /in french/ and had been sitting on my bedside table three years that I also created a goal for - within six weeks.

I've used it for everything from exercise to studying (it integrates with anki wonderfully, and has completely improved the way i use the service) to writing and probably a bunch of other things.

The thing that helped me be more productive at work was, funnily enough, going to see a therapist (see my long top level comment below) as well as signing up for [[http://www.complice.co][www.complice.co]] (which integrates with beeminder, but I haven't used it for that purpose).

Another technique I enjoy: promising myself I'll only do 3 or 5 minutes of the task and then will stop. It's a flavour of "focusing on starting" like you stated, but it works really well for me. It's weird how just telling yourself you'll stop, even though you know that you don't intend to stop, works so well.

My husband (who has ADHD) is always saying in awe how impressed he is because of how driven I am, how I set goals and acheive them, and how I don't seem to get distracted. I don't /feel/ this way at all. I feel like a hideous procrastinator. I feel disorganised and forgetful. I feel like I've just managed to put all those negative self qualities into a scaffold of discipline, finally, mercifully.

*** So I decided to go ahead and read /Classroom of the Elite/ Volume 1 and was disappointed.

To those not in the know, the story is about a mysterious prestigious high school that provides it's students a stipend and guarantees opportunities for it's alumni, though neither of these turn out to be as easily provided as they seemed.

While reading I found that I was occasionally hit with the feeling that the characters felt a little bit too unreasonable or socially awkward, that the prose was trying a little too much to be intellectual, and that some of the implications of the setting seemed to be ignored. It was only later that I realised that I was being put off by how juvenile or rather, how similar to children/young teen novels it was.

There were some neat concepts and it managed to get a few chuckles out of me but I feel like there were too many major issues holding me back from being satisfied with it.

- The point system didn't feel really important.
- The homeroom teacher and administration's motivations were confusing.
- The MC is supposed to be absurdly capable but I didn't really buy it.
- The school didn't really feel that different, just a regular high school + point system.
- The fan service didn't feel tasteful.

What's worse is a lot of the reviews and fans especially like volume 3 (which is where the anime goes through) as it's supposedly where the MC's "Machiavellian nature" and true genius is revealed to the reader! So I forced myself to read to at least that point. Again, I'll recommend that you not do that ;)

*** Just got caught up with Delve. I'm enjoying it so far, and updates seem to be coming every few days. The protagonist has believable flaws, thoughts and motives and is likeable. No narcissism or Mary-Sue tendencies. The world is largely familiar fantasy / RPG tropes but the specific characters and environment avoid feeling unoriginal. The magic system seems pretty solid and is central to the story. I feel like it's definitely going somewhere but can't tell exactly where. The writing is doing a decent job of making the reader part of the journey of figuring out the new world and its rules.

Anyone who contacts you via LinkedIn is a really really shitty recruiter.

Most other job sites are too general and filled with 3rd party Indian recruiters trying to force an agency.

​

If you want to be a free agency, I can't really help you other than to say you need to decide on what your goals are and some general tips. Going to need to do a little bit of ground work but I expect there are tons of writeups on how to be a successful or at least visible contractor. Some tips are\\
Make sure you set your rate correctly to account for lack of security, benefits, and vacation. Use contracts, and when companies refuse to pay you don't roll over, take them to small claims court it is cheap and easy. Have rates for night hours. If a client calls you at 3am for a 2 minute conversation make sure they pay for it.

​

I think the biggest thing is actually committing to getting work. When I left my last job I spent around a month relaxing and then 2 weeks "recruiting" but really dragging my feet. When I stopped and got serious I got a job within a week.

** tl;dr: is therapy good for neurotypical people ?

--------------

What are people's opinions on seeing psychologists / therapists for /non-diagnosable/ (i.e. minor) psychological issues?

There's probably little disagreement here that if you have OCD, a phobia, or are a pedophile or something you will benefit from seeing a therapist; but what about if you just have trouble dating, or feel like you're not being productive at work, or just maybe your life could use some basic improvements?

I ask because - long story - I was given a relationship ultimatum to see a therapist for issues I didn't think merited therapy. And then my psychologist proceeded to spend two years making me not hate myself (which I didn't even realise I did), and also incidentally improved the relationship ultimatum type stuff.

Given that it literally took a relationship ultimatum to make me go, I'm shocked at how resistant I was to it, and furthermore I'm shocked by how little I can say in support of therapy in general. If you were to go back in time with the mission of making sure I went into therapy, and you had a whole day with me now to work out the strategy for how to convince past!Weasel to go to therapy, I'm not sure I'd be much help - nothing I've just written would convince past!Weasel, she'd just say "yeah but my life is fine I don't need therapy", or "I don't hate myself; I'm lazy at my job, so it's perfectly reasonable for me to think thoughts about how terrible I am for being lazy".

So I'm wondering: should everyone get therapy, in general? Maybe not the intensive weekly sessions I started getting shortly before my sabbatical (from a different therapist who specialises in my specific problem: still seeing my original therapist because she's better), or the ten subsidised sessions a year I get from my "main" therapist, but I feel like the average person would benefit from seeing a therapist once every 3-6 months just to check in, discuss any key problems they have, etc.

Obvious caveats: some therapists suck, and I think that's why I was so resistant at first. The first one I ever saw was provided through my employer's assistance programme, when I was living in a town of 30,000 (+edit: dropped a 0, it's 300,000+ edit2: wait no, actually, it was that small) people: at the time I was struggling with emotions that were coming from my childhood sexual trauma, and the therapist they sent me to was very accomplished but.... he specialised in eating disorders and stress from shift work. He kept on trying to bring it back to me having body image issues as a result of the abuse, which I don't. So.... you know. That wasn't.... the best introduction to therapy.

Related: my partner has very severe OCD that is well-managed on medication, and he used to see a therapist regularly, but now sees her once every 6 months. He's acting depressed a lot, and I'm trying to convince him to go back to his monthly/bimonthly schedule so she can help him with that, but he's being very resistant to that. IDK why. And I guess I think that if I benefitted so much /when he forced me to go/, why can't he face that he has benefited before, even if he's got no "real problems" left because medicine is magic (which it is and it isn't), he can still benefit just like I have. Weirdo.

*** Ideally, literally everyone should see a therapist periodically. We should get mental health checkups like we get physical health checkups. However, the calculation isn't necessarily, "would it be better if I had a therapist," its, "is the cost in time and money of going to a therapist worth the benefit?" To which I would posit, usually no, at least for people who don't have an obvious issue or are unhappy with themselves. The exception would be people with a lot of disposable money, disposable time, or a healthcare system/job that allows them to go to a therapist with relatively little opportunity cost.

*** Tough to handle this stuff when you are away in france for 6 months. Yes, many people would benefit from therapeutic attention in some way or form. People get regular physiological checkups from trained professionals. Makes sense to extend that to psychological checkups.

No good advice for you on the partner issue unfortunately. Call friends and have them give your partner an intervention if they are so depressed?

EDIT: in the depth of the lesswrong archives theres a comment about someone attending an ivy league university. What struck the commenter about their fellow students was that they weren't smarter, or harder workers, but the overwhelming majority of them was just so incredibly well adjusted and free of these minor psychological hickups that impede everyone else.

It's how I treated the therapist when I went, which was basically for the same kind of motivational thing that I believe you're implying he has.

- she's available at my convenience (debatable: she's quite heavily booked but I book my appointments 6 months in advance so i always get the appointment right after work)

It's.... really the perfect friendship. And "all" it asks from me is ~$150 an hour (after my government rebate - yeahhhh she's pricy).

Like don't get me wrong, I do have a Best Friend, and we both help each other a LOT with the same sort of stuff therapists do. But there's stuff I won't even tell her that I told my therapist on one of our first sessions, and although I can say to my best friend, "i really want to talk about this, can we sit down and go through it", that's a harder favour to call in and it's reciprocal, so it's very neat to be able to see someone ~monthly for a full run down of my shit.

Yeah, I've been polyam since... 2011? So it's been a while for me - long enough to be boring. I've been with my husband since 2007 and my other partner since 2013, and have no other partners (though I've just started dating here in Paris so that may change - hmu any Parisiens who want to date me based on my vivid descriptions of what a basketcase I am).

***** Ah yeah, for me my therapist was kind of the same -- although he was 5 dollars and a student practitioner, haha.

I'm still working on sorting out boundaries and such myself because this is the first relationship I've had in years. I may be moving in with them some time after they move in together. Depends on how things go with my visit coming up, I suppose!! Exciting things in my life, at least.

****** That's awesome! I hope it goes well. Hit me up if you ever want to chat about it, though I'm not sure how helpful I'll be, I'll do my best. Otherwise the subreddit is pretty good.

** What sources do you get your news from?

I used to use NYTimes and the Washington Post, but they've both gotten more annoying about reading for free and they represent a very specific perspective. I read Arstechnica for technology related news and The Atlantic just because, but I don't feel like I get a comprehensive picture of what's going on with just these.

*** I read the headlines from the Washington Post. I (begrudgingly) listen to NPR. I'll read David Roberts articles on Vox and cleantechnica for environmental news. I go to 538 for politics. I'll occasionally read Haaretz for Israeli news (from a liberal Israeli slant). Ezra Klein at Vox used to do thought-provoking pieces, but he aged out of being able to write the news effectively. For economics I'll read Brad DeLong, Paul Krugman (NYtimes), Noah Smith (Bloomberg), and others as warranted. Occasionally I'll take a glance as Ross Douthat to see what mental contortions he's up to. For tech news I read Ars Technica. For local news I read the local paper's website (which does a good job). For a very liberal perspective I read Digby's blog; she writes for salon now too so there's some cross-posting. For political science news I'll read Crooked Timber. My favorite commentator, who usually has a level head, is Kevin Drum at Mother Jones. He's usually has a pretty smart take, even if we sometimes disagree, and at least tries to make his points in numeric terms.

​

My news reading habits are both compulsive and kinda part of my job. I'm going to be honest though; there's no great source for all news and I'm unhappy with large parts of many of the places I go. The only sources I'm terribly happy with are 538, Kevin Drum, David Roberts, Crooked Timber, and Ars Technica. I would recommend that you go with the Guardian or BBC world for a comprehensive picture of World News, but that lacks an American perspective. Once we pay off student loans, I'll probably get a subscription to the Washington Post, because it remains the best overarching news source I've found. (Even if the opinion page is a little to prominent and not fact-checked.)

​

Many of the places I listed are riddled with flaws.

NPR is full of both-sides fallacy and incredibly self-indulgent;

Vox is incredibly trashy and obviously false at times (Matthew Yglesias isn't their biggest problem and that's a problem);

Krugman and Klein have visually disengaged from the news cycle, since keeping track of it is unhealthy;

Mother Jones is niche, sometimes experimental, and best read for its investigations.

Haaretz paywalls their most interesting articles.

NY Times seems to want to make news more than report news.

Johnathan Chait has started tilting at everyone to his left and has gotten embittered after he lost two high profile spats (Te henisi Coates and Cory Roberts of Crooked Timber), and the political failure of charters in the face of his uncritical defense.

Ross Douthat has gone from contrarian to deliberately eliding the truth so I've stopped reading him.

Digby's blog is rightfully hysterical, but I can only take so much of that and function. Undercover Blue does great NC coverage though.
