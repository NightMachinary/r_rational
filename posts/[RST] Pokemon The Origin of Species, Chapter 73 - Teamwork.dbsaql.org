**** In the culture of the setting, yes there is.

Renegades are considered traitors to humanity for daring to use Pokemon against their fellow people.

Soldiers are people serving their nation and fight using military ordnance. The use of Pokemon would at best be limited to non-combat roles.

Actually using Pokemon to fight directly in wars would likely be considered a war crime of the highest order.

** Every chapter I get more and more excited for the inevitable confrontation between Blue and Red. I honestly think Blue will realize he's wrong at /some/ point, only because if he doesn't that would be a hit to his character, but my worry is that Red (or at least, "Past Red") will have internalized the whole "you should have gone in after her" thing to the point that it's too late to take it back.

What I /want/ is for them to make up and go back to being best bros but looking at the source material this fic is based on, it's not likely. I can dream, though!

*** I'm still not convinced Red was right. I said this way back, in response to the chapter where Blue and Gramps and Daisy took down the Titanic Trio: Just because you happen to have been correct one time does not mean the thought process you used to make your decisions was a good one. Someone who buys lottery tickets and wins is still an idiot for buying lottery tickets.

Red managed to avoid a pointless death /that time/, but it does NOT mean he was right to decide as he did. I'm not on Blue's side either. I just don't know. It's an incredibly hard thing to figure out.

**** It is a very tricky thing, but I think Blue has not really considered the emotional impact of what he's done. He hasn't thought "Wow, that was an incredibly difficult call for Red to make, he must feel terrible even though his choice was what kept him alive in the end." He straight up told Red "then you should have died", and I /know/ he means that more metaphorically than literally, but it's still a terrible thing to say to someone who just psychically felt their own friend die in a fire.

That isn't to say that Red didn't say some bad things himself--the whole "Aiko thought she had to go in there because of you" didn't help his argument at all, he just said it to hit Blue where he knew it would hurt--but to be fair, Blue struck first. I don't think either of them are 100% morally free of blame, but I think Red is definitely in the right in this particular argument, if only for the fact that if he didn't do what he did he'd literally just be dead.

I understand your point, though. Blue's main issue isn't of what Red /did,/ but rather the fact that Red thinks "I was in the right and I'd do it again." However, we know that ever since that argument, Red has indeed been doubting himself--the "Past Red" part of him, for sure, says that he feels "guilty about Aiko" and that he's still not sure if he did the right thing. I think current Red is operating off pure logic, because he's partitioning off his emotions, but when he allows himself to feel everything he realizes his...I can't call it a "mistake" in good faith, to be honest. He knew it was too risky. He knew he would die. I can't wrap my head around how Blue can blame him for thinking "If I could do it again, I would take the option that wouldn't kill me," solely from a human nature standpoint (never mind the fact that Red's greatest fear is death). And if it bugs him that badly, why can't he just accept that, in his terms, Red is a coward? Why does he have to completely cut all connection and make Red believe that one of his only friends wishes he were dead? He wishes Red went into that building, so therefore, he wishes Red had died. If this is how Red is thinking right now, I can't blame him at all. Maybe part of my judgment is just coming out of pity for Red.

Anyway, uh. Sorry for writing an essay. This whole thing is really complex and part of me wanted to just get my thoughts on it down somewhere. :p

****** The difference being that Professor Oak actually succeeded in rescuing his family members, and events proved that Red would have failed and died if he had entered the building. Both of them apparently made the right call in their particular circumstances. And yet Blue disagrees with both of them. He would have had his grandfather stay out, potentially losing Daisy and/or a number of civilians, yet he would conversely have sent Red into the building to die.

What makes Blue's attitude even worse is that he claimed to Red that it was a matter of principle. "That's what it means to be someone's /friend/," Blue says, looking back at Red now. "That's what you don't get, Red. You're talking about risk and the smart thing to do like it's a game, like your decisions don't say things about who you are, how people see you. Forget strangers you're on a mission with, how could anyone trust you to have their back on a journey, if they know that's how you see things?" And yet, after making such a bold "friends stick together even if it's risky" stand, he immediately about-faces when it's his own grampa at stake. Well, I say that makes him a huge hypocrite.

***** I agree he made the right call, but it's more complex than that. Staying out was risky too, because it meant that people definitely wouldn't be saved when perhaps they could have been. The question is, how great are those risks; are they justified by their potential returns, or not? Red judged not in this case, and the outcome suggests he was correct.

Blue claimed that once a friend was going in, he should have ignored weighing risks and gone in on principle. And then he abruptly about-faced when his grandfather did just that. And he didn't even recognise that he'd contradicted himself.

With the League officials furious as they are, I don't think they'll agree with the scenarios anymore. How much will that affect Surge though? I don't think he'll care particularly, but can the League punish gyms for disagreeing with the convention?

When apologizing to Red, Red would have told him with tears in his eyes that if it were Blue who entered that building, he would have followed him to his death.

Would be a bit of an oversight if surviving pokemon could attack people getting close to the body of it's trainer. Pokemon aren't even supposed to be trained to attack humans even if their trainer orders it(although as seen in this chapter it's not a regulation that's very followed), so it would be strange if a trained pokemon attacked another human without an order from their unconscious/dead trainer.

Don't know if pressure could deprogram training, but there's probably not enough time over the course of a single event to do it, even if it's trainer was dead.

** I don't see any theories as to how Blue's pidgeotto was able to identify rotom-frost as a threat at all. Foresight is an egg move for the pidgey line in the canon, so that seems unlikely. Has "Keen Eye" been buffed in this universe?

Also, I was curious about how rotom's typing would be handled in TOoS. Looks like it does effectively "lose" its Ghost typing when inhabiting an appliance, as it no longer has the permeability(?) or surrealism, but can still use its Ghost type moves; just like the canon. Interesting.

*** RE: pidgeotto identifying rotom - my first thought was that since scientific effects corresponding to Types are a must in this universe (e.g. the Flying "particle", and really the method(s) by which all moves work), it wouldn't be out of the question for some pokemon to have sensitivity via those kinds of interactions. For example, pidgeotto could have detected Electric-type "particles" off rotom, or its own Flying "particles" were shorted off near rotom's area. But this explanation may be falling into the trap of shoe-horning all unknown events into a single convenient phenomenon. And as a counter-example, it's not like pokemon don't identify danger by sight alone - they're trained to go tense at the sight of a Pokedoll, for instance, seen all way back in chapter two.

RE: egg moves - in the games, egg moves couldn't be found on wild pokemon, but I think this fic is unlikely to have the same limitation. From a rational standpoint, you have to keep in mind that fact that all pokemon are born from eggs in the wild. It's probably only TM moves that are reserved for non-wild pokemon, though even that might have (or start to have) small exceptions if a trainer releases their pokemon back into that wild and they're successful in surviving and having offspring.

RE: rotom's typing - I'm not sure if rotom lost its Ghost typing here. Blue mentions, when he first sees the rotom, that "It's a strange sensation, having knowledge blocked somewhere in his own head [...]", which seems to indicate surrealism. +Also, he notes after seeing the rotom use Blizzards and an unnamed electric attack that "The overwhelming strength of his opponent is balanced a little by it not using only its most optimal attacks" - which reads to me like either the electric-type move or the Blizzard, one or the other, isn't benefiting from STAB.+

+Well, that's what it sounded like at first.+ Thinking about it, it could instead mean the usage of Ice-type attacks that Snorlax is particularly effective at tanking against. And Blue did mention that this rotom was Ice type, as in the Pokemon type...but could possibly mean "Ice type", as in rotom's form...

And now I'm wondering if Red should work on his theory of pokemon with more than two types by starting with rotoms.

​

I'm interested in the answer to this, but I expect it's easy to rationalize it away as "egg moves are moves that pokemon need to become familiar with at a very early age that aren't exhibited in the wild, but need pokeball technology to train them" so basically a specialized TM.

#+begin_quote
  Red once explained for five minutes to Blue how a researcher in Johto discovered that, after breeding a slowbro and a bayleef, the baby chikorita that hatched was able to heal those around it: a power no other chikorita had ever dispalyed, but that the slowbro father had learned [...] [Blue] wasn't the least bit interested in the implication that pokemon retained some intuitive, genetic grasp of how to use abilities they didn't normally have
#+end_quote

So in this fic, egg moves don't need pokeball technology to train them, they're just moves a pokemon would not "normally" have, i.e. learn over the course of it regular growth (or have already learned by that point in time).

So much so that in retrospect, I realized egg moves from the moveset of a different-species pokemon, while theoretically possible to show up in the wild, would still probably be extremely rare because it looks like in the wild pokemon would usually only breed with another of its kind... But egg moves that are also the more powerful moves a pokemon would learn at higher level should probably be more common, unless the chances of getting an egg move was lowered in this fic compared to canon.
