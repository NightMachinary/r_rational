** To whom it may concern:

Any chance of getting this turned into a podcast feed?

*** I'm looking into hosting options for it. Plan is to release a couple first, see how they go and gauge reception. I'm aware how convenient podcast feeds are- hopefully soon.

**** It's pretty straightforward to just go into Soundcloud options and enable an RSS feed, which would allow people to manually add the feed to their podcast player if they're using a player/app that supports it.

You can do this by going to [[https://soundcloud.com/settings/content]] and fill out all the fields. Then copy the RSS feed URL and post it here so that anyone who has the link can add it to their player. If you tick the box that says "Include in RSS feed," all future uploads will be added to the feed automatically. (You can also retroactively add any existing track to the RSS feed by going to the permissions tab for that episode and ticking the box "Include in RSS feed")

Later, if you want, you can use this RSS feed to submit your podcast to services like iTunes and Stitcher.
