I've been trying to define for ages to a friend what rational fiction is. I first argued for the hard scifi/ high fantasy angle, which was followed by a discussion of the detective genre. The problem is that most of these genres have plenty of non-rational stories.

So what genre is it now? I'd say *heist fiction*. Think about it. /A bunch of experts of various fields working together to absolute precision to reach a common goal./

This type of story often explains the science behind a special device or gimmick (e.g. how to start a fire with just potato chips and an old matrass). Teaching the viewer about elements of the heist is intrinsic to heist fiction - /A thief opening an intricate lock is different from an action hero simply smashing it/.

Heists are a battle of wits on a small scale, usually restrained to a small local space like a bank. Rational fiction are *heists XXXL*, with a lot of protagonists aiming for world domination or the control over a country.

(Equally fitting is that a lot of rational protagonists are borderline evil/ amoral/ outlaws, which most heist movie protagonists are.)

Thoughts? Anyone got a more fitting genre? Or maybe someone who could build on my example?

Edit: Thank you a lot for everyone's input so far! I liked hearing all your thoughts. It's probably best to define RF as a genre modifier.


** I'd say heist fiction very often relies on weird framing devices and lying to the audience, neither of which seem compatible with rational fiction to me. Really, I've heard rational fiction is a /flavor/ rather than a genre and I think that's more fitting. You can have a rational romance novel just like a rational heist one.

**** That's because typical/stereotypical romance writers and readers are too turned on to pay attention to detail. It wouldn't take much to turn most romance into something rational: just draw out the growing attraction phase and include lots of details of the characters noticing things about each other while they try to focus on other things.

** Rational fiction isn't a genre, it's a genre modifier. You have rational heist stories, just like you have rational fantasy stories, rational sci-fi stories or rational westerns or whatever.

Also, I'm confused by what you are proposing, are you saying that (for instance) HPMoR, Mother of Learning and Pokemon: Origin of Species are heist stories? If so, I think you're operating on a different definition of that genre than I do.

*** Of those you mentioned I've read HPMoR:

Quirrel's goal is to break into the chamber of secrets, so his story is that of a heist. One could argue about what Harry ultimately wants to do post HPMoR.

I remember him analyzing the galleon and silver exchange rates, about how he could buy silver cheaply and then smelt it into more expensive galleons. Harry basically acts like a stock broker here, the Wolf of Diagon Alley. Imo brokers are just robbers in suits but I get that not everyone agrees with this definition.

Looking to achieve world domination (a common end goal in rational fic) and planning to do a a coup are also similar in structure to a heist: You steal the leadership of a country. This usually requires careful planning and a rational look at how the government of your story works. Most rational stories I've read employ building of political alliances; basically selecting your heist team.

I could probably draw up the parallels better if I gave it some more thought. I've been enjoying everyone's input here so far.

***** I admit I'm reaching quite far with this comparison. I'm basing my generalizations on this video essay I watched last year: [[https://youtu.be/z__DyGEvhM0][What Heist Movies Taught Me About Film Making]]

The video brings up Inception as an example of a heist movie.. and they don't actually steal something in the movie! They want to plant a fake memory instead.

So is the act of stealing physical coins critical to a heist movie? How much of the plot can you change until the characters and power dynamics become unrecognizable?

Idk I just find it interesting to compare genres as a fanfiction writer. Like it's easier to adapt a canon story into a Highschool AU fanfiction, if the original power dynamics already resemble that of a Highschool. If you have a rational protagonist who loves planning, you're gonna have a much easier time adapting them into a heist AU, instead of a flowershop AU, that doesn't seem OOC or crackish.

I'd love to hear your thoughts in turn! You probably have a different view on this than me.

****** Inception definitely is a heist movie though. Planting something vs taking something are at that point details to the overall genre.

But in HPMoR it's the antagonist doing the heist, and they definitely aren't doing it as their on screen focus. If Inception was the story of that Asian guy going after his futuristic business and then towards the end he gets ambushed, something gets planted in his mind and he has to live with the consequences for the latter chapters then that wouldn't be a heist movie.

And government infiltration or coup stories can be heists, but they aren't automatically by their nature. A heist movie is primarily about the how and has some form of plan execution as its structural center (wether successful or not and wether the plan is known to the viewer/reader or not varies). If the movie is a biopic/drama about the life of a guy that really needs money and then towards the end he witnesses a bank robbery and uses the opportunity to steal from the bank robbers with some quick thinking that is not a heist movie, despite something like a heist happening within it.

** ractional fiction, or rational literature in its entirety, is simply making the premise of the story and stick with it in a way other books fail to do. So, in case of a world with different rules from our own, make the rules once and stick with them.

Take the Harry Potter books. There were so many inconsistencies.

Like the Potters being their own secret keepers instead of allowing Peter Pettigrew to betray them.

Or wands from Ollivander cost 7 galleons and a single unicorn hair costs 10 (which makes no sense in economics, why would you make wands with a loss, not even breaking even?!?)

Or how the Marauders Map was in F&G Weasley from the very first book, meaning they would have friggin' KNOWN that there was something wrong with Quirrel having two names (Tom. M. Riddle, and hiw own), and even if they didn't know who the hell Riddle was, which might as well be possible given that most didn't know, they would have at least asked someone about it, and probably the name would have reached Dumbledore's hears and the entire first year would have been completely different. Or the second, given that they'd see their sister Ginny make some strange things, like going to the friggin' chamber of secrets of friggin' Slytherin, and slaughtering Hagrid's chickens and other stuff. Or the third, where they would have seen that their brother's rat pet had a name tag, which other animals didn't, which would have again brought them to raise some question and Dumbedore would have heard of it and yada yada yada.

Speaking of the first year, why would Dumbledore not simply Apparate from school to ministry of magic and back instead of flying and giving Quirrelmort his chance at doing damage? Plot holes, plot holes everywhere.

Why not use the Veritaserum in court against death eaters and ask them who the hell where all the others? Damn, there's a bunch of ways to end the war between Voldemort and the magical Britain at least a thousand times, in both directions.

There's other dozens of those in HP, which is why I'm taking HP as an example, because it's so blatant that one cannot not see it.

So, to answer the question.

A rational approach to literature is

1) To make the rules of the world inside the story, /all the rules/, right off the bat (even if the characters don't know them all, and the public reading the book also not knowing them, the author does). And everything will happen within those rules.

2) All the characters will make decisions that make /sense,/ given the contest, the information they have and the objective or objectives they have. Characters don't even need to be intelligent or even slightly smart for that. They need to make sense.

3) Not really a requirement, but it adds so much. Some characters know about biases, cognitive science and science in it's entirety even, and explain how something is a good idea even if is counter intuitive at first, or some characters are really intelligent and are able to take really really good decisions or to understand things from few pieces of informations in a way that is entirely possible and believable from that character with that information. Detective Holmes sometimes is borderline because he manages to do that with really, really too few pieces of information. Something like that, but less extreme.

4) The story makes sense. Mysteries in it could potentially be solved by the reader himself if he's paying attention enough, and later the character solves that mistery with the same amount of information. No events of characters solving seemingly unsolvable problems in impossible ways. Characters try to use the rules of the world in every possible way, trying to exploit those rules to their advantage as much as possible, like people do in real life with the law. No stereotypes for the sake of it if it doesn't make sense for a character to be that way. The world in the book looks exactly like the real world would be if the rules where the ones in the book.

*** I agree that HP was full of holes, but I can come up with fixes for the ones you propose.

- 7-galleon wands, 10-galleon unicorn hairs: Ollivander gets a discount for buying in bulk.
- Potters as secret keepers: The spell doesn't allow the protected people to be their own secret keepers.
- Map: F&G didn't mention it to anyone because then they would have had to explain where they got the information.
- Dumbledore not Apparating: The school is warded to prevent Apparition in.
- Veritaserum and Death Eaters: Magical-world 5th Amendment? A high-level spell or ritual to defeat Veritaserum. (Occlumancy?) Self-targeted Confundus charm to delete that memory, used when captured? Maybe that's a feature of the Dark Mark?

Still, even if I can patch over these specific ones there are still a gazillion more, so you're right in general.

**** 1) The Ollivander buying in bulk could hold, but even considering this true, the whole economy of the wizards sometimes is simply inconsistent. There's more than this example, trust me. And buying in bulk doesn't net you a 30% discount, it doens't work that way in economy. Trust me, I studied this shit. And you're not counting the cost of the wood and the work to actually make the wand. Whatever you need to do to make a wand, it's secret, so you'd expect a serious markup. Like, the Unicorn's hair would need to be sold to him at less than 2 galleons, TOP.

2) Potters as secret keepers, in the seventh book bill says he's his own secret keeper for his house, and some other weasley made the same in his house, don't remember which. It indicated that it's indeed possible to be your own secret keeper.

3) Might be right, but given that the rat was first Percy's and then Ron's, they had plenty of time to find out who the hell this unknown Peter Pettigrew was, with or without help from others. Wouldn't be even too strange to ask someone if they knew who this apparently random name was, and once they new, the ball would have begun to roll. In a really really bad direction for Pettigrew, I might add.

4) Dumbledore could go outside the schools grounds, just outside, apparate near the ministerium, find out that he wasn't required at all, then do the reverse. minutes at most, instead of the hours required by flying. No excuse in this one.

5) Definitely impossible for them to have a 5th magical Amendment. They used the veritaserum on Barty Crouch Junior, without process, and no consequences there. The mark didn't do shit too. You could Obliviate yourself if you knew you were going to take the potion, but if you were captured, the wand was taken from you and you'd have no way to prepare for Veritaserum. Same for Confundus. I don't know if Occlumancy blocks Veritaserum in canon, but even if it does, not all Death Eaters were Occlumens. Even if some were, administer the potion to all those you capture, and confront their stories, and find which of them told a lie, and you can trust the rest. Veritaserum was one example of what the government could have done. If you've read HPMOR you know the shit that everyone could have done better. HP is a book I loved, and love, but it's as far from rationality as the other side of the universe is to us. I know there are no sides, but you get it :P

** I think what you're describing is competence-porn, which both heist fiction and rational fiction are guilty of. To quote [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetencePorn][TvTropes]],

#+begin_quote
  It's the thrill of watching talented people plan, banter, and work together to solve problems. It's not just "characters being good at a thing," particularly if that thing is fighting---otherwise the term would apply to virtually all fiction---but specifically about using cleverness and hard work.
#+end_quote

Which seems to apply to a great number of both rationalist fiction and heist fiction.

I wouldn't say this describes rationalist fiction as it includes some stories--such as Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Stone, Star Trek, and The West Wing--which are certainly not rational, and misses a few stories--such as Three Worlds Collide, Shadows of the Limelight, Legacy of the Goddess, R!Animorphs, etc.--which certainly are (although, as I think of it, a few of those may actually be competence porn if seen in the right light... huh... at the very least the trope is still too inclusive to serve as a genera-identifier).

Edit: ok I'm pretty much convinced that all rational fiction is some flavor of competence porn. I guess you could write a rational[ist] fiction without the banter or hard work aspects, but it wouldn't be very good.

**** I didn't mean that's a bad thing. Just about all of my favorite books, stories, movies, and television shows can be categorized as competence-porn.

Maybe when I said both genres were guilty of it I was indicating the wrong connotation. I meant only that it's a prevalent trope in most of those kinds of stories.

Also, competence-porn has a negative connotation in some circumstances. But there's no better, and more widely used name for it, and it's fairly descriptive of a whole class of stories. Usually the term is used only when the trope execution is done badly, and that's a shame. But in this instance I'm using it as a neutral trope identifier where it only serves as a substitute for it's definition.

Edit: I usually dislike questions like “what genera is [X]” type questions and discussions. But this one has turned out to be an exception to the rule, since before I was unaware that competence-porn was such a prevalent trope in all my favorite fiction. I can now use this to find more things I will likely enjoy.

**** Story driven - think of a story where the plot is aiming to hit certain high points or events. It's common in action or thriller type stories where there's no point to is if we don't see the MC show off their final form at the end.

Character driven - slice-of-life is probably the prototypical example genre. Everything happens because character interactions or the characters' personalities make it so. If the planned plot has to take a back seat for the characters to shine then so be it.

A character driven focus with a story driven plot is kind of a contradiction on the surface so I understand the confusion. The story is either story driven or character driven. But in reality all stories are a bit of both and Ratfic doesn't allow that excuse. These stories are the kind where certain beats need to happen (thus story driven), but since everything must be character driven, the plot needs to happen organically without idiot balls, or the other nonsense some thriller writers resort to.
