** This is the first half of a two-part batch, split up because otherwise it would be almost 72K words, which is too much all at once in terms of both reading and editing. The next "half" will be posted Saturday at 8PM Central (or 48 hours earlier if you're an early bird on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]]). If you'd prefer, you can think of it as two large chunks of writing in close succession, rather than being 'split': I don't plan to do it again, but it worked out a lot better for me.

***** In terms of actual quests, we still have a fair number, plus magic like star magic. DnD level-wise, you're effectively a god at level 20, and Juniper is nearly at that point, but it's a long way to go before his power are 'natural' rather than dependent on souls (and side note, I'm glad that the unicorn bones were addressed in text- for a limited resource, they're sure getting used very liberally). Last time that everything was explicitly listed out was Chapter 138 Stats for Nerds II. It's not guaranteed that all of these will be addressed by the end, or that Fel Seed will be the final arc. I don't know what else will be done with Fenn, the elves, and her canceled quest. Let me know if I missed any quests below- The quest list hasn't changed all that much.

God Botherer

The Lost King, Found? - only thing of note is that the five other dream skewered who arrived around the same time as Arthur were mentioned as being relevant to this quest.

Through the Lashing Glass- a separate exclusion zone for some reason, which made me think they might tackle it earlier. Even the Risen Lands was an exclusion zone, although it was low level/the dangers came from other people more than the undead.

All 13 Exclusion Zones under Slayer of Horrors. This includes Fel Seed, Captain Blue, and Doris Finch. It includes areas that have had tangential topics brought up in passing, like the elves' Celestar research and the immortal farming guy brought up in this batch. It includes areas that haven't been brought up at all since first being introduced like the Goblin King. I'm particularly interested in A Door Into the Soul, Better with Loops, Guardian of the Underworld, and Finger of the Sun.

Tragedy of the Commons - cross-planar, definitely feels like an endgame quest. Maybe Captain Blue will detonate a void bomb while he's at it, forcing the issue.

Birth of a Nation - can progress over time.

Taking Root - still not complete, even if the locus finally saw some progress. Could still need some time, some additional tasks, or still end in failure.

The Sound of Silence and The Infinite Library quest also never had an explicit "Quest Complete" notification in the text. But the same is true for "They Say You Can't Go Home Again," so I can't tell if these are complete and we just didn't get the message due to inconsistency/the general abstraction of the game layer, or if all of these are /technically/ incomplete plotlines that will come back later. I'm kinda curious about this, because the Anglecynn arc seems "over," Lisi and the clones aside. He's sent out letters to his friends, talked to his mom, and has what he can get of the game notes. There's really nothing left for him if he tries to visit Aerb-Juniper's hometown, so I think the key is the "you had a life, before this." It might not be completed until he really finds out what the world is, if he's actually dead on earth, if he's a simulation, etc. Infinite Library and Sound of Silence definitely have dangling plotlines as well, but again, not sure how relevant they'll actually be.

It's something I've been thinking about even before this absolutely massive batch - splitting it into smaller chunks makes it easier to catch up quickly, easier to discuss / theorize with the community without only focusing on the ending / important bits, and easier to process in general.

Due to his upbringing, that holds special weight and feels wrong to do if both people aren't super into it. He doesn't seem to feel the same way about kisses (see previous batch) or, apparently, other sexual things that don't involve the coitus.

At the end of the day, you're describing your enthusiastic consent, which Amaryllis did not have. She had, at best, scientific enquiry in mind and at worst, emotional manipulation for nefarious purpose, none of which Juniper had previously given his explicit consent for. It is a situation unrelated to Amaryllis' sexuality except in so far as it relates to Juniper's requirements for consent.

He said it wasn't fine, he explicitly did not give consent, and every comment so far has told me how this rape is okay because of nebulous things like "it wasn't piv" or "asexual people have sex all the time".

He said explicitly that he was not okay with sex if she didn't get joy from it. No technicality makes it not rape. No other argument matters.

** Something needs to be said about what a brilliant idea it was to have chapter 198 revolve around prepping for the marriage inspector. That did so much to enable such a deeply rich scene.

It meant you could seamlessly integrate:

- A mini-recap of their early relationship,

- The topic of Fenn (and the little bow that could be tied on that hampering Joonaryllis),

- A look at a “what-could-have-been” timeline,

- The issue of Maddie and adding both additional insight into that situation as well as exploring how it's currently affecting Joon's perception of his relationship with Amaryllis,

- The roleplaying conceit and the obfuscation it allows which makes the exploration of all these issues much more natural and much less awkward

Imagine trying to cover that much ground that efficiently and that elegantly and with that much feeling when it's a scene with the characters sitting down and just deciding to have a deep conversation. The marriage inspector angle enriched it all so much.

And outside of that there's all the other humour and callbacks and just all-round fantastic character writing that had the chapter feeling so tense, heartfelt, titillating and bittersweet.

*** My pet theory for a long time has been that Fenn will come back in a way tied to Bluebottle. When this quest was brought up by Perisev she speculated about Joon developing "new magic" which would be the last thing to confirm (to her) that he's the new Uther. Bluebottle has his own specific and excluded brand of necromancy which I feel is going to tie in somehow, maybe it counts as bringing someone halfway back from the dead or something, and then another form of magic finishes the process.

And now we're finally at the bottle episode, so I get to find out how on/off the mark I was.

- Liked the honest conversation with Grak.

- What's Capn' BitB about? Does he have an actual body? Can he jump from zombie to zombie?\\

***** If anything, wouldn't that be an argument for soul magic exclusion or against zombie exclusion?

It seems like you could get functionally equivalent loyal zombie armies out of either school of magic. The only meaningful difference between the two is that Captain's zombies are in pain while soul zombies are altered to love what they do. But it doesn't seem like pain is at all related to exclusion (I mean, the Hells exist, after all).

The only meaningful difference I see is that soul magic doesn't let you project your actual self into other bodies, and Captain's magic apparently does. Two of the recurrent causes of exclusion we see are immortality (Fel Seed, Skin Magic, Captain) and uncontrollable feed-forward loops (Glass, computer, Doris Finch).

Soulfucking is actually closer to an uncontrollable growth loop than zombie magic, given that other soul mages can be recruited to the cause. So it must be the immortality aspect of the magic which would cause the exclusion.

And if that is correct, the Dungeon Master isn't even necessarily God himself. He's an extension of what Aerb is, materialized from Juniper's feelings about what his callous God is like and his experiences in life as a DM (that eventually became callous to his players with Fel Seed).

Whether there's an actual religious spin on it or if it's all due to Juniper's own beliefs on religion is up for debate.

  According to the notes that Reimer had given, the Layman was more of a concept than a person, one which could be ‘instantiated' in different ways, either through DM fiat, through agreement by the players, or by asking a third party who had no or little stake in the outcome. What that would mean on a system implemented in full with more rules, on what was probably a simulation was anyone's guess.

  “Oh,” I replied. “You mean, why not make it more sensible and change it so that it would mirror reality?” She nodded. “It's a map and territory thing,” I said. “You've got the map, which is a description of reality with baked-in assumptions about that reality, simplifications and shorthands and whatever, and then you have the territory, which is the actual reality itself. So in tabletop games, you have the rules, which are a playable map, and it's totally disconnected from reality, so you start to get it into your head that those numbers are the thing you're talking about, not a representation of them. And from there, you get into the business of number manipulation, rather than trying to simulate reality, in part because fuck reality, reality is boring and lame.”

Manifest effectively destroyed the Guild of the Essential Soul when he manifested, since he controlled the people there, and him being a soul mage makes the most sense of the magics we've seen, but yeah that's only speculation.

Putting on my contrarian hat, I think defining A as 1 is far more reasonable than defining A as B.

Consider the case of three boxes, labelled A, B and C. In this case its very easy to argue that these letters are a number system - first, second, third - 1, 2, 3. A = 1, B=2, C=3.

However I'm anxious that we'll get another gut punch soon since things are just going too well - new powers for the group left and right, near unlimited resources, no main character deaths aside from Pallida-ish.

As much as I'd like to get all the answers regarding Fel Seed, Uther etc. I also don't want this story to end anytime soon, I really hope that there still is a lot to come, even though a lot of threads are coming together atm. So many interesting exclusions which we'll likely never see (especially the boy in the time loop and the uber-farmer sound fascinating to me), a shame really.

Also getting those time lines was great, I'm on another reread right now it's not that easy to keep the timeline straight in your head.

Reimer and Lisi were hilarious, as was Amarylis response letter.

The marriage inspection prep. while well written and impactful didn't really land with me - sure keep the relationship drama going but we've been through how they felt for each other a few times now and I couldn't really take it too seriously esp. with all the Anime references.

Moving on, I'm just impressed how good of a character Grak is and how warped my view was due to the format of this being Junipers story. While not caring for him much in the beginning (as our Protagonist) in my reread I notice how much interesting stuff there was way from the beginning.

The Captain was another Highlight and I wonder what tricks he has up his sleeves given that he doesn't seem that powerful right now - for a moment I was even wondering if they'd mirror one of Joons earlier campaigns and just join sides with him (if only for a short time).

But the best part imo were Vals notes on the hells. I mean, they had been introduced as well, hell - but the more we learn the worse it gets. I mean...what the fuck, how many layers of shit do they have? While reading those I had miniature of Tony Benn in the back of my head with this speech [[https://youtu.be/ETqOvBKnKdk?t=146]] those poor poor infernals, also the notes tie in nicely with the Captain arc, economic systems based on suffering, creating a paradise for the very few while even a lot of the exploiters are just reinforcing their own misery. Quite poetic.\\
Still, kill them all.

Ah and one last thing. I really want to always read the chapters as soon as they come out, time zones be damned (they're released at 3am were I live), but yesterday I waited in vein.\\

Amaryllis had already made her predictions about what all my skills would give me at their higher levels, cross-referenced with historical notes. Level 30 was either social attributes, luck, or special powers like the one I could already sense was lodged in the unicorn bones.

  Magic generally didn't produce more magic, with a few exceptions. If you cut off a finger, it was really hard to find a magic that would regrow those bones (though it was relatively easy to heal a broken bone back together). If you lost blood, you needed a donor, or you needed to replenish it naturally on your own. Skin was a little more permissive than bone or blood, but it was apparently hard to find a magic that would help you recover from flaying. This was because bone, blood, and skin weren't just physical things, they had latent magic.
#+end_quote

This is from chapter 101, though the skin thing obviously isn't true now. Grak went without a hand for his initial months in the time chamber because to actually grow missing bones back, even if the soul is fine, takes something beyond what Joon has available to him through bone, blood, and fairy healing. Maybe replacing a lost eye would have just taken a little bit of extra time that they didn't feel like spending, but the lost limbs needed something special.

If they tried what you're suggesting, I think at best the healing magic would move the flesh around so that there's a cavity where the bone would go.

It feels like that 20th point of loyalty was made contingent on the locus being tethered to the land, since there's some difficult-to-patch exploitability otherwise--for example, take the bottle to somewhere that's already an exclusion zone, and further munchkin the already-excluded magic.

**** Does carbon monoxide work like that? I tried to find an example on dark skin but couldn't find anything which makes me think that it doesn't have the same discolouration.

If you think about other vascular changes to skin, blushes, bruises all of those are less obvious with more pigment in the skin. Whether tattoos, dark skin or even face paint.

So if I was this guy I'd be hiring dark skinned people to complete the disguise

***** It does. The colour is more of a maroon or purple on very dark skin tones, but it can look pink on light brown skin. Either way, it would be definitely obvious at a glance that something is very wrong with that person's health.

** In this batch we learned a bit about the Mary clones. A few of the details are a bit of a major dealbreaker, or really should be.

- They follow a law of least utility or benefit when deciding between being a human or animated statue for the purpose of interaction with abilities

- they have no souls.

- their combat stats are so low they can be expected to fail most encounters.

- They know everything 0!Mary knows and vice versa, at a temporal resolution of 1 day.

So they're effectively ex anima for the purpose of resisting demonic/devilish posession, and have information that would cause the hells to starting invading (the existence and location of Valencia, as well as the details of her power). The moment a devil rolls a Mary clone for a posession attempt, the hells will attck any wek points they know about.

** From Chapter 198:

> “I went back on my promise,” I said. “With the Bethel thing. It was spirit, not soul, but ---”

I don't seem to remember this. Has anyone got a reference?

​

Chapter 200:

> And that, really, was what I wanted. I wanted to be done with things.

I was a little bit surprised by this -- Juniper's not enjoying being an adventurer, he wants to end it and go back to being a teenager on Earth?

But later I think he commented that he was planning to end it by becoming a god and doing world optimization. So I guess that seems like a good reason to want to end being an adventurer.
