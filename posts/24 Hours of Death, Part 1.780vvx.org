** I guess this is as good of a place as any to weigh-in on the whole death conversation. While I'm totally on board with radical, unbounded life extension (provided that we can [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77lzq9/cgp_grey_about_death_and_the_false_pedestal_it/don1xp7/?st=j92yyr06&sh=1abefe82]["solve life"]] as [[/u/eaturbrainz]] put it), I don't think that death is as bad or even as meaningful as people think it is. Well, to qualify: death is very bad /currently,/ since life is so short, but in the limit of lifespan the badness goes down to zero.

Let me explain.

There is, of course, the heat death of the universe to deal with, which provides a physical upper bound on possible lifespan. The actual upper bound for most people must come sooner, though, since near the end, there won't be enough free energy to sustain previous populations, and the resources of some people will need to be cannibalized to extend the lives of others. You could still probably get in 10^{100} good years though.

But far sooner than that, you'll run into memory limits. You, as you currently exist, cannot survive past much more than a few hundred or a thousand years in any circumstances, simply due to the memory capacity of the human brain. Eventually, you'll forget all your old memories, and your values may drift over time. Compare the you right now to the you in 10,000 years. If the two of you don't share any memories or values, in what sense are you meaningfully the same person? The you of the present has just died slowly and continuously over the course of a few thousand years. In fact, this has already happened to you. Do you remember much about your early childhood? Probably not. And as a child, you certainly valued far different things than you do now, and if asked, would have said that you never wanted to stop valuing them ("I don't wanna grow up!"). Effectively, child-you was murdered by puberty. Should we then medically stunt puberty to prevent child death?

Suppose you can artificially expand your memory capacity. Great, you've delayed the inevitable. After a few billion years, your mind will hog a large amount of physical resources preserving all those memories. You can either continue hogging resources until the entire universe is just you, or you can let the old memories die to allow new people to exist.

But then there are the mathematical limits. Your mind is just a specific type of dynamical system, after all, no matter what laws of physics implement it. Even if you could in principle expand forever, I think it very likely that the dynamical system will become unstable and either bifurcate into multiple entities, or just cease to be conscious in any sense meaningful to original-you. In other words, "you" have a maximum finite size.

Suppose you could surpass the heat death of the universe and live for infinite time. What happens to a finite system over infinite time? It repeats itself infinitely often, necessarily, by the Poincare Recurrence Theorem. And now you're at Nietzschean [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return][Eternal Return]]. Sure, maybe you could find a way to randomize the experiences in some way so that the order never repeats itself, like the digits of an irrational number, but in the end you're still repeating every single experience infinitely often. And if the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time][B theory of time]] is true, then this state of affairs may not be meaningfully distinguishable from living for a long finite time in a block universe where all time-points are equally real. Such as the universe we probably live in now.

Of course, there are a /lot/ of possible experiences to be had before repetition occurs. But maybe not as many as you'd think. After cutting out the undesirable possible experiences, which are either horribly painful, just "meh," or are completely random noise, you're left with a small subset of meaningful and desirable experiences. Many of which are similar enough to be lumped into equivalence classes. At the end of the day, it might just be possible to have every meaningful equivalence class of experience before your 10^{100} years are up. Maybe save storage space by uploading everyone's memories into a single galactic memory database, which individual people can "check out" or contribute to.

--------------

When you take in all these considerations, "death" as a category starts to look rather meaningless in the limit. In once sense it is unavoidable, and in another sense you shouldn't have ever expected otherwise. The induction hypothesis of the "proof by induction" argument for immortality just sort of fizzles out after 10^{n} years of life.

If any of these ideas seems horrifying or painful to think about, I suggest that it is a good idea to re-align your expectations so that you are happy and content with this state of affairs. After all, worrying about what you cannot change is pointless suffering, and as transhumanists we seek to eliminate all pointless suffering.

Ok, so maybe I'm the weird one out here, but...

I remember a fair amount of my early childhood. I have a few isolated memories of infancy and being a toddler, but I've got /plenty/ of being a child, then an adolescent.

I also ended up feeling like my teen years were the "odd years out". Teen me was a horrible person and didn't even /enjoy/ being teen me -- total edgelord loser with no sense of getting off his ass. Adult-me is basically a lot like kid-me, but with more life skills and an interest in sex.

Is it really so ordinary to wind up an intuitively dramatically different person after nothing but /puberty/?

That depends on how old you are. Right after puberty, you are still very continuous with your child-self, but that fades over time, I think. What you have said mostly describes me as well, though I don't remember much about my childhood before age 10 except in a weird dissociated third-person. My values and concept of fun have drifted with experience as well. But I'm only 23. My parents remember even less, and are presumably much more different than their child selves.

Still, the "child-murder" thing was a bit of a rhetorical exaggeration.

***** I don't care all that much about continuity in the first place, but I remember fairly well back till 2. I know the memories are accurate because I've used them to draw maps of old locations and had them confirmed by adults. I liked it when my loved ones were happy and took pleasure in much the same things I do now...affection, food, fulfilling the preferences of others, dancing, singing, sunlight, striving and achievement, even sex... I haven't changed that much - my basic values seem stable. Everything since then has only been increasingly sophisticated means to achieve this for myself and others.

Of course I am... more ...now than I was then. But I don't think any highly important stuff was lost. In any case, yes, I'd definitely self modify to forget less stuff if I could do so without ruining anything else. You don't need to modify the brain necessarily, you can just make faithful sense-recordings that the brain may revisit.

Now, I've mostly forgotten them, and I don't really care about them any more. As for my memories before age 10, it's not that I have less capacity for remembering my childhood than average so much as I haven't actively reinforced those memories in a long time. If I try, I can sort of access some of them, but they seem very distant and vague. They are more like general emotional impressions and flashes of images that I'm building into narratives about myself.

*** I think most of us agree, then, that there is a point of diminishing returns. But it's still possible to do immensely better than we can now. I feel like my life is just starting, there's such an enormous amount of basic stuff I haven't been able to do (mostly from lack of financial resources), and I'm in my 30s.

Already, biology has decided to make me less physically attractive and possibly less mentally capable than I was in my 20s. Screwing me over before I ever even get into a financial position where I can enjoy my life. And this life timeline of mine is still far better than the typical experience of most humans who have lived in the last 100 years.

Even if I get things together and have a brief 'golden age', 50 is a little over a decade away for me. 60 just a little over 2 decades. Our lives are actually stupidly short, even if it doesn't necessarily feel that way on a day to day basis.

If my brain were converted to a digital system and sped up a million fold, I could experience far more interesting things by living millions of years in virtual reality, exhaustively exploring the possibility space I cannot explore as a mortal sack of meat.

*** My reaction to the 'finite system over infinite time' concept is effectively 'Okay then, so we need to (try to) work out how to make our systems non-finite.'.

Assuming bounds, we get entropic death. From the existence of /anything/ at all rather than Nothing, we postulate something-out-of-nothing and get hope. If the universe has a finite time, maybe we can break out of the universe and get infinite time. If any one physical system has physical size constraints, maybe we can tap into infinite dimensions and become entirely unconstrained, stepping up maybe-infinite steps of higher mathematics and Even Higher Mathematics in all the infinite permutations that can exist, as well as seeing countless civilisations made up of minds of all sorts of intellectual levels.

Maybe we can't. Maybe we'll reach a point of knowing everything meaningful, and know futility and despair. Maybe we'll die then, or earlier, and it will end up being just as final, just as pointless an ending as if we gave up and ended the path right now. But right now, there's still subjective hope. Since we don't know for sure--and even if it looks certain, we can still doubt the completeness of our understanding--there's still a sliver of hope that giving up isn't inevitable. I for one am willing to pursue that infinitesimal possibility of success rather than surrender early to 100% failure.

'think it very likely' (that my success is not possible) is not enough to deter me, not before I've personally wrestled with such issues and done my utmost to resolve them down to the very last quantum unit of available time.

--------------

In the past, on happily fewer occasions than would need a whole hand to count, I've thought I was about to die. My feelings at the time can be summed up as a resigned 'Oh, well.'. The absence of hope is not unnecessary suffering to be prevented, but rather the presence of hope represents more resources to be greedy for, more that can be done, experienced, remembered (even when so much of what is remembered is, for the time being, frustratingly lost as though by a 'tax'). By crippling our ambition, we can be happier, perhaps. By crippling our desire to read new books, we could perhaps be happier in our ignorance, living a simple life in which we never read a single book and never felt the slightest suffering from difficulties in getting new books. I do not fulfil goals in order to become happy, and if I did could use more direct methods. I approve of myself being happy when my happiness is a symptom of /doing what I want to do/, accomplishing things which I want to accomplish, which is fulfilling such goals. Learning, experiencing, remembering, growing (at least where relevant for myself).

**** I think humanity should certainly investigate all possibilities, including somehow escaping into other universes and self-modifying to grow in complexity unboundedly. I would put the chance that consciousness can grow to arbitrary size without instability, mathematically speaking, at <20%, and the chance that it could do so given whatever the final laws of physics turn out to be at << 1%. Suppose we eventually prove a mathematical theorem limiting us to a maximum finite size. What then? I don't think this is cause for despair. It's like despairing that 2+2=4 ("I want 2+2 to be equal to anything it wants to be! Logic is unjust!") I think despair at the finiteness of existence will just dissolve away in the presence of such a theorem.

*** I don't think the finite memory thing is necessarily a problem. If I have a ruler and am trying to draw a straight line longer than the ruler's length, I can just draw the line using the ruler, then line the ruler up with the line I previously drew, and so on ad infinitum. This works even for very small rulers. In a similar way, as long as the trajectory of my actions is always satisfying to me within the range of whatever memory capacity I possess, it seems like I can achieve meaningful personal growth.

The other things you point out are more serious.

You know, this is actually my wish. Immortality by itself is quite burdensome, since there's all kinds of dangers where you end up trapped in some eternal void, unable to move or scream.

So rather than just ordinary immortality, I wish for an everlasting time loop. Take the current point in time as the end of the time loop, and let it reset back to 1 year ago, and repeat forever. That would be true bliss for me.

Possibly, but this seems like a much easier fix. No getting stuck in volcanos or stars or black holes or featureless voids for eons if you keep being brought backwards in time.

I mean, suppose that on a whim, I decided to go on a round-the-world tour during one of the loops. I'm not going to want to spend years working to earn money so I can pay for that tour when I can just borrow it from the bank. And if I just borrow it from the bank anyway in a long time loop, I now have to spend the rest of the loop being harassed by debt collectors.

Err.. wait, I didn't explain myself well. When I said time loop, I mean time resets, but my memories don't. Like in Mother of Learning or Groundhog Day.

It would be pointless if my memories reset every loop because then I wouldn't know that I am in a time loop. It would just create countless time-copies of me that are all very depressed thinking that they aren't in a time loop, even though they actually are. So you would just end up with a bunch of identical depressed Todds.

Eventually my memories would repeat, sure. But I wouldn't forget I'm in a time loop since I get yearly reminders. And the fact that my memories repeat is great: it means I'm forgetting things, so I can enjoy them again. I can play a game until I'm bored of it, read a book until I'm bored of it, etc, etc. And then a few thousand iterations later, I forget I ever played the game or read the book and thus can once again enjoy them like they are new. Have you ever reread an old book or played an old game that you haven't seen in a long time? That's what it would feel like, which is awesome.

So the fact that I forget stuff means I wouldn't ever have to worry about running out of books to read or games to play in my infinite time, as long as the current pool of them is sufficiently large, which it almost certainly is.

Let me put it this way, have you read all those articles about designing AIs that let you "opt in" or "opt out" of stuff? There's a very dangerous loophole in that those AIs could forcibly prevent you from or push you into the "opting" actions. It's the same issue here: how would I ensure that I can retain this "opting" ability? What if my wish somehow results in my mind being altered into not "opting" correctly, or simply forgetting that I can "opt" at all?

In general, whenever you make a wish or contract of any form, you should definitely include options to get out of it yes, but design it so that you shouldn't ever need to use those options in the first place, since there's a chance you won't be able to when problems come up.

#+begin_quote
  Hopefully you just meant to do that within the time loop. Otherwise you're going to be in a lot of debt later on.

So I feel like you've been holding a double standard throughout this conversation. I've been throwing out ideas for things that /might/ be, er, /somewhat/ plausible to implement in the real world. Things that require a few thousand conceptual iterations to work out all the bugs and solve all the engineering problems. And you act as if your time loop is a perfect magical construct that /wouldn't/ just be some potentially faulty simulation in a matrioshka brain that could get horribly corrupted if a random neutron star passes through the solar system. Or wouldn't be run by a potentially unfriendly AI. Or doesn't make you absurdly lonely because you seem to be the only one looping. Or doesn't contain evil serial killers, drug cartels, and mafiosos who are bound to catch you and torture you into insanity at least /some/ of the iterations due to sheer random chance, since for some reason you seem perfectly content to time loop /the world as it exists today./ And on that topic...

Yeah, the Theseus ship problem is still an issue. A while back there was even a reddit commenter worrying about whether himself 1 second in the future is the same person as his current self. I don't really have a good answer for this one, I just operate on the heuristic that the me in the future is the same person as the me now, just in case it is true.

It's sorta like a Xanatos Gambit for me: either my future self is the same person as me, in which case my plans for my future self's well-being have raised the odds of my well-being, or my future self isn't me, and I just wasted my a large chunk of my existence planning for the well-being of some stranger. But hey, if I'm going to stop existing anyway (since I've been replaced by some stranger), I can't think of a much better way to spend it than by helping someone. So either way, I win.

You're right, I have been acting like the time loop is a perfect magical construct instead of worrying implementation details. I have been holding a double standard because immortality is something I can actually see being implemented, whereas a time loop seems impossible in every way (at least according to our current understanding of physics), and hence I have been thinking of it as a wish for some kind of god to bring about perfectly without thinking about implementation details.

Though I'm definitely excluding the idea of simulating the time loop for my wish, for actually the same reasons you just mentioned: things in the real world screwing up the simulation. I don't want to be stuck in some simulation where I'm completely unaware and unable to deal with any real world threats to my safety.

Now this is why I post on this subreddit. That is a good point and I thank you for pointing it out. I suggested a time loop instead of immortality because that puts an upper bound on the duration of torture that a malicious entity can give you. But now that I think about it, a year is plenty of time for someone to torture you into insanity, so maybe a shorter loop is in order. Perhaps only a month or a week. Though I must say I have no idea what my torture-into-insanity threshold is, so even that could be too long. Huh.

But if I made it any shorter I wouldn't really be able to do anything in each iteration of the loop. Ugh X_X.

Maybe a way to control the length of each loop that requires me to make a signal every day? But no, I could be forced into making the signal against my will just like with the "opting" actions for an AI...

Hmm... I must contemplate this further.

Well, yes, admittedly, there are plenty of fun things you couldn't do within a time loop. It's a trade-off between safety and desire. How can I wish to colonize the universe without the risks of strange alien technology operating on alien physics being used to torture me in alien ways? How can I wish for an absurd virtual reality without the risks of being trapped by malicious game masters? There is of course, some minimal amount of happiness required (for me, it is the mundane pleasure of rereading all the world's books and replaying all the world's games over and over for eternity), but otherwise I tend to heavily favor safety on general principles.

And a time loop is one of the safest possible things... as far as I know.

(If you have any insights as to why it wouldn't be safe, please share them with me.)

It is very odd to me that the first thing you think of to solve this problem is to shorten the time loop. Not kicking violent people out of the loop and also giving yourself instant reset ability like in Mother of Learning. Or giving yourself unstoppable superpowers that activate when you are threatened.

#+begin_quote
  (If you have any insights as to why it wouldn't be safe, please share them with me.)
#+end_quote

To make any sort of immortality truly work, we basically need to solve intelligence. We need a way of accurately predicting what things will enhance our well-being in the long run, and what won't. We need to solve a dozen engineering challenges, like how to permanently cure psychopathy so that no one ever chooses to do evil (and do this /without/ becoming one of a thousand fictional dystopias), how to create a fail-safe system of incorruptible friendly AIs to maintain post-scarcity and be the gods of VRs, et cetera.

The way you were talking about your time loop, it sounded like if a genie materialized in front of you right then and offered you the chance to enter it, you would have said yes. Without having a way out, and without having considered the problem of evil people in the time loop with you. Even if these problems could be solved, I'm not sure you actually last /eternally/ without going insane. You say you "really don't think you will" go insane. That's not a great level of confidence considering the stakes. People are extremely bad at modeling their own preferences. People can change in personality over time.

Here is a possible scenario. It's been 200 years; mentally, you are the oldest person in the time loop by far. You have read tens of thousands of books. And slowly, surely, the books have changed you. They gave you insights you had never before considered. They showed you a beautiful vision of well-being, of what it means to be human. They changed your priorities, which had seemed utterly inviolable when you started out (as priorities tend to seem). (Or maybe you're immune to books, and in one iteration you accidentally drink some orange juice containing a psychoactive drug, which sufficiently changes your neural structure - who knows?) You decide you want to accomplish something great and lasting. You decide you want to connect with people more than you ever have before. So you begin writing a magnum opus, of all the things you have read and seen. You make friends sharing your wisdom with others, looping them into your adventures. And then, just as things are getting good... the time loop resets. Everything you've written is gone. None of your friends remember you. You have to start all over. You try again, get a bit farther - and it ends again. You grow frustrated. You don't have the time to build what you want to build, to connect with others how you want to connect, before it's all wiped away. You become Sisyphus, pushing the boulder up the hill over and over again. You always wish for just one more day, one more hour. You grow to hate your world. You try to kill yourself. You try to kill everyone else. It's all wiped away again at the end of the year. Maybe you become sane again after a thousand years, maybe you don't. This is your eternity now.

The other disturbing thing to me is how much the time loop is just focused on /you/. Not anyone else. I've been taking it as an axiom that immortality should include the whole human race, so that we can all grow and learn together. In your scenario, everyone just keeps living slightly different variants of their miserable 21st century lives, over and over again. The drug cartels will continue torturing people, over and over again, but perhaps different people in slightly different ways, due to the butterfly effect of your presence. You are effectively freezing in place a large amount of suffering for everyone else.

I'll leave with a general set of principles. Any set of changes toward some utopia should be 1) Reversible and fail-safe 2) Implemented slowly enough to give time to evaluate the merits of each change 3) Value-aligned, and provably so, if at all possible.

*Dream shattered* D:

Wow, I... I really should have thought of that first. I guess on some level I was thinking that since only I was keeping my memories, only I am in the time loop, everyone else just lives through time normally and isn't affected...

...but that isn't really how time loops work is it? I mean, it doesn't really make sense to say that I'm living an infinite amount of time while everyone else is living a finite amount in the same period, even though they are moving through time at the same speed, and have to sapient enough to react to whatever changes my butterfly effects are causing, otherwise all kind of infrastructure would break down.

The other points you raised I could still get around, but this is the final nail in the coffin. I mean, I suppose I could kick everyone else out of the time loop, but then I would have to live like a savage, scavenging for food, having no electricity or Internet or anything that requires other people to maintain...

Now all my wishes are dead. :(

*** If there is a core of memories or values that I can maintain, even allowing other, peripheral memories of values to be lost over time, that core could be considered me. Lifetime preservation technologies might even specifically enable such a core of an individual to be persisted and preserved alongside. While we may observe dramatic personality change over our lifetimes, speculatively we are as likely to reach an asymptotic personality.

Also, a system where we may persist for an infinite time is likely to be so alien, and so disturbing to our current understanding of physical limitations, that it might be worth exploring regardless of the implications, because it is highly likely our explorations will prove it to be impossible. Pragmatically, the speculation regarding infinite recurrence should not dissuade someone from investigating immortality because the search for and arrival at this state is likely to generate fruitful insights about the nature of the universe and existence that will make us rethink the fear of being trapped in an infinite pattern.

#+begin_quote
  Death is absolutely necessary. Death is the Great Equalizer. A world without death is a world where the status quo reigns supreme. Where the powerful and wealthy are free to concentrate power and wealth without any check what so ever. Remember: the greatest horrors of the modern age have been wrought by man not nature.

  Imagine if the monarchs of old never died. Imagine if the various dictators of the present and past never left. A world where universities are run by faculty so hidebound by tradition and what they WANT to believe that science stalls. Where capitalists are free to hoard money and influence without bound. What would society look like today if millions upon millions of confederates and kkk members were still alive?

  Death is what makes societies and cultures flexible and dynamic. Death is what allows for progress, indeed, for peace. If societies cannot adapt organically they will be forced to change in violent ways as they approach stagnation or catastrophic failure. For without natural turnover the only avenue for mass change is mass violence.

  Lastly. On deaths relationship with humanity in a broad sense: What makes us human isn't our individuality. It is our society. While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.

Anyone who believes this is implicitly trivialising the literal billions of deaths to "nature" in the last 100 years.

Hitler is very high up on the scale of human evil (depending on how much culpability you ascribe to failed political policy, e.g. Mao's cultural revolution, he could be the pinnacle), but smallpox alone killed hundreds of millions.

So, which is more horrifying? I expect you'd still say Hitler, because you, like the majority of people, ascribe more emotional significance to human action. If that's the case, your heuristic is biased. You aren't objectively evaluating horror, you're evaluating the perception of horror.

To be clear, I'm not judging you for this. In fact, I feel the same. Human action is more horrifying to me because it's intentional, implicitly avoidable; don't do the evil thing, problem solved.

But humanity isn't even in the same league as nature.

Even if humans were responsible for 10% of all deaths (an incredibly high estimate), we'd still be [[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/][less deadly than ischaemic heart disease]].

As for the rest:

#+begin_quote

Okay then, how about an alternative solution to the 50+ million natural deaths per year: we make humans immortal, then kill those necessary to ensure society progresses. We'll kill, say, 40 million carefully chosen people per year.

Would that be more horrifying, or less horrifying? Certainly it would be more efficient than hoping that the random distribution of death happens to facilitate progress. In fact we may even be able to scale it back after a while.

Which brings up another point: do you have a ballpark figure for the limit of a human lifespan, beyond which society collapses? And if we do eventually approach such a long span, will you be campaigning for the shortening of your own life to prevent catastrophe?

**** Allow me to more narrow the scope of my argument slightly, strip out some extraneous rhetoric, and more clearly state my thesis: The technical hurdles standing between us and a desirable post-death society are less daunting than the societal hurdles for the same outcome. Moreover, there is not insignificant tail risk of some truly undesirable (dystopic even) post-death societies.

I will note that I am no moral naturalist, although the language I'm using might make it appear that way.

The base premises upon which this argument is built are as follows

1. Suffering in life is worse than the cessation of life (aka death). Consider, if you were given the option between A) spending eternity as a low-status laborer in North Korea, or B) dying instantly, painlessly, and without warning at some point in the next 3 years, which would you chose? *

2. It is easier to tame nature than it is to tame humankind. Harm mitigation involving nature is fundamentally a problem of science and engineering; progress is made with precision and rationality, once progress is made here it rarely vanishes. Harm mitigation involving humankind is fundamentally a problem of politics and culture, progress comes in fits, without precision or regards to rationality, progress is quite vulnerable to regress.

3. While nature causes more cessation of life than man, man causes more suffering in life than nature. At least in the modern age and in developed countries. In many cases where nature does cause harm, it is more because of human failings than nature itself (for example, the truly mindboggling amount of death and suffering from the Spanish Flu was in large part due to the chaos and unsanitary conditions of WW1).

* You might chose A if you thought the knowledge of your upcoming death would be awful, but even that would be suffering in life.

Horror is a fundamentally subjective term, there can be no unbiased and universal assessment of it. That is why I used the word horror instead of death. This fits in to premise 1, in that "horror" or the extra emotional distress caused by human harm (as opposed to natural harm) is responsible for quite a lot of suffering in life.

That said, I kind of which I hadn't made the point in the first place. It was more rhetorical flair than anything else.

You're right, it is entirely possible that we could achieve a desirable post-death society.

Wealth is a form of power, so I'll stop mentioning it explicitly, but it is one of the main forms of power I have in mind here. Those with power almost always seek to preserve their power, and most seek to gather more power. It is the powerful who have the most capability to enact or block change.

Indeed, there are tons of things going on right now where you could ask "why would a modern society permit this?". The answer being that the powerful don't care enough to change things, or they're actively fighting against change. I'm not speaking of conspiracies, it's more that there's a degree of selection bias and perspective-limiting path dependency involved in the pursuit of power.

Additionally, any anti-aging tech will be expensive as hell for a long time. As such the wealthy will be the first to benefit and will benefit more (from higher quality treatments). If the treatments are expensive for long enough, it's entirely possible a poor person could be born into a world where Mark Zuckerberg is 50 years old and die in a world where Zuckerberg is 130 years old (and still making tons of money and gaining vast influence).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

In the US, at least, we really do not try to reform prisoners. It is also entirely possible, no, extremely likely that most of the time we spend having political debates/arguments is a waste. Now political debates and arguments are different than discussions, but I think they represent the majority of political discourse between people with different views.

Simply put, most people do not use reason to inform their emotions, but rather they use reason to justify their emotions. Look into [[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-article-wont-change-your-mind/519093/][identity protective reasoning]] and the [[https://daily.jstor.org/the-backfire-effect/][backfire]] [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Backfire_effect][effect]] (two separate hyperlinks there).

For this reason modern political campaigns (in the US) are based more around increasing the turnout of one's political base and depressing the turnout of the opponents base, than they are about convincing swing voters. This might be somewhat different outside of a two party system, but I'd wager that's because citizens of such countries have more complex political identities, not because they're less susceptible to identity protective/motivated reasoning.

I don't remember if it was the CGP Grey video, or the companion Kurzgesagt video, but it was mentioned that it's entirely possible anti-aging tech will let us live healthy lives, but only up until we hit the theoretical upperbound of 120. I think that would be great, it would reduce suffering in life by an unimaginable amount and avoid many of the things I'm concerned about.

What if you presented these same options to a low-status labourer in North Korea? Live forever with the status quo, or die within 3 years? I think they would choose the former; death has always been an option for them, but eternity has not.

This is a tricky thing to quantify.

Presumably we lay the blame at the feet of the warlord, but what about nature, that made their land barren in the first place?

Nature's suffering has been largely curtailed in the developed world. It still recurs in some situations, mostly medical issues or natural disasters, but in general it isn't nearly as extreme as it is in developing nations.

The beauty of a post-death society is that it doesn't matter nearly as much if progress slows. Everyone will get to reap the benefits eventually.

By contrast, if somebody in our society discovers a solution for malaria (i.e. a way to eradicate the disease, not cure instances), the difference is about 400,000 lives per year (and many more who suffer from it without dying).

I don't think this is a very likely outcome for academia post-death, anyway.

Western democracy may be recent, but democracy has been brewing for thousands of years. I'd argue that the global trend is strongly in that direction. Military coups still happen from time to time, but a military coup is a lot less threatening if they can't actually kill anyone. If they /can/ kill people, then the leaders of the coup can in turn be killed.

It's true, but it's also the status quo. The rich can already afford better treatments than the poor, with correspondingly longer lifespans.

The only way to counter this would be to ensure that people all live the same amount of time. As long as wealth is able to influence this, no finite span will ever be universal (unless you enforce it through other means, e.g. genetic alterations). And given that wealth affects diet, exercise, mental and physical health, etc., you'd have to be in a post-wealth society as well.

Yet people do change their opinions. Consider [[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-31/same-sex-marriage-who-supports-it-and-who-doesnt-hilda-data/8856884][the Australian same-sex marriage debate]] (which is our own "Why is this still an issue?" problem). 19% support for same-sex marriage in 2005, 46% in 2015. I don't think that 27% of the population was replaced in the intervening 10 years, which strongly implies that attitudes shifted.

Individual debates may not have much impact, but society trends nonetheless. You don't even need to convince that many people to start snowballing progress.

#+begin_quote
  That's a good question, and I'm not entirely sure as to the right answer. I don't remember if it was the CGP Grey video, or the companion Kurzgesagt video, but it was mentioned that it's entirely possible anti-aging tech will let us live healthy lives, but only up until we hit the theoretical upperbound of 120. I think that would be great, it would reduce suffering in life by an unimaginable amount and avoid many of the things I'm concerned about.
#+end_quote

Assuming for a moment that 120 is the right figure (which I certainly don't have the analytical skills to do): if we ever manage to push the upper limit of a human lifespan beyond 120, will you oppose that, even when it comes to your own life?

***** Hm.

1: Well, in some cases. It's possible to suffer so much that life is not worth living, yes. This is not very common, however, and becomes less so if our ability to keep people healthy and alive longer increases. Because living an eternity as an abused slave would suck worse than dying after a good hundred years of life, I suppose (still debatable) but living for two hundred years as an abused slave and then another two hundred of a good life is better than dying after a hundred years of good life.

The problem with death is not the moment of death, that's a tiny sliver of time with no real weight. It's not the suffering of the ones left behind, that's a side-effect. It's the loss of potential, all the future good that never happened. So the question becomes, is the totality of your future a net positive or not? I'd say in most cases it is, because most experiences are better than nothing.

And, well, infinite life is such a large step, I believe it to be more pertinent to talk about extending life first, and ending aging for example. As a sidenote, that's also my response to all the 'you'd get bored of life' people - maybe I would, maybe I'd choose to die after a few thousand years of life, but I still want that choice, and a hundred years is not even close to reaching that point.

2/3: Well, we get into the problem that humankind is part of nature and lives in the midst of nature and untangling them isn't so easy. Lack of resources is part of nature, and that's one of the big causes of humans heaping suffering upon each other. Or, as you mentioned, the Spanish Flu causing so much death and suffering due to factors both 'human' and 'natural'.

I agree that the end of aging would lead into a very confusing and difficult societal transition which has the potential to end poorly, but I don't think that's a reason to not make the attempt, because the status quo is bad enough that it's worth it to try, and I feel we've a fair chance of ending up on track to a better world. Most worlds would be better if, like me, you believe that in almost all cases life is better than no life. In addition, it feels a bit like trying to stop the development of nuclear power because of the potential of nuclear weapons. It's going to happen eventually anyway, the earlier we get to it the better off everyone'll be and there's no reason to believe we'll be better able to handle the consequences in the future than right now.

Speaking of nuclear war, I don't really know if ending aging would make it more likely, or less. Sure, societal upheaval might ensue. Or more stability. Maybe leaders (and followers) who now have much more to lose would shy away from the button. What I do think is that such a trajectory, wherever it may lead, would happen on the scale of maybe a hundred years or so, and trying to predict a hundred years into the future is thoroughly futile.

  Moreover, there is not insignificant tail risk of some truly undesirable (dystopic even) post-death societies.
#+end_quote

I think variants on this theme are the most plausible arguments that death isn't that bad, or is even morally necessary, after a certain point. In the past, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56se39/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d8m8xtm/?st=j95s34ew&sh=c77b6002][I've argued that]] there may be a point at which more moral good is done by creating a new person than by continuing to use the same resources for a long-existing person. Society may stagnate when the same people exist for long periods of time, stuck at a local maximum, not exploring all the possibilities of well-being that we might want to exist. And there is always the risk of falling into permanent dystopia.

I'm not necessarily convinced by these arguments. It is easy to reverse immortality if it's not working out well, but not the other way around. I also think that the technology of immortality will also allow us to modify the brain's reward system enough to prevent greed and psychopathy from existing. A periodic randomization mechanism for avoiding stagnation, both on a societal and individual level, is also a good idea.

Immortality is irresponsible without an accompanying change in human psychology and societal organization. My idea of utopia involves radical freedom in a post-scarcity world where no one ever chooses to do evil not because of some totalitarian surveillance, because evil just isn't any fun.

  While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.
#+end_quote

As an individual human, I strongly disagree with this sentiment.

It's not that this isn't a legitimate problem, it is, but you have to ask yourself if the current price we are paying to avoid having to deal with it is worth it. Because that price is unbelievably high: we sacrifice one person to the reaper for every four seconds by which we extend the status quo. Is the problem of stagnating societies really so bad that not having to deal with it for another couple seconds is worth a human life?

You claim that aside from violence and war the only alternative for societal change is hoping that the people in power literally drop dead. I happen to think that this is not true, but even if it was, the death toll of one war per generation cannot possibly be higher than the death toll from ageing, can it?

Not the only avenue for change, but they are the main avenues for mass change. Even the quintessential example of peaceful change, the civil rights movement of the 60's (which is itself a total white washing, but whatever) was [[http://www.americansc.org.uk/Online/Vietnam_Civil_Rights.htm][empowered by the backdrop of the Vietnam War]].

We have been lured into a false sense of security in the post-WW2 era, doubly so in the post-Cold War era. The violence and war we see around us today, and imagine as so terrible (because it is) and so vast (which it isn't) is [[https://youtu.be/DwKPFT-RioU?t=14m20s][/nothing/]] compared to the carnage of the world wars. Which themselves pale in comparison to the potential devastation modern great powers can inflict. Much less the great powers of a future in which we have the technological ability to stop aging.

That's just wars /between/ major powers and /without/ nuclear weapons. When nuclear weapons are factored in, any conflict a nuclear power is involved in has a risk of nuclear exchange, including civil wars (no great power has had a civil war in decades). That risk may be lesser or greater, depending on the context, but any step closer to the edge of our extinction (or at least the wholesale destruction of modern advanced societies) is a step that should be made with great great great care.

****** On malaria: We could go a long way towards solving the problem of malaria without making people immortal, through CRISPR and gene drives (or some other method). It's also worth considering that those people who die from malaria tend to die because they lack access to proper medical care or preventive methods. They will be some of the last to gain access to anti-aging tech, if they ever do. If it's hard to distribute mosquito netting to improvished and isolated communities, why would you think anti-aging tech will be any easier?

On war: The effects of war are so much worse than just the deaths of the soldiers. In developed countries we're insulated from most everything else, so I can understand why that's what you went to. The full toll war takes on humanity isnt apparent until you look at second and third order effects.

If a country is turned into a war zone it's the civilians who suffer the most. War destroys infrastructure and order, it can decimate civilian supply chains. Shortages become common and crime skyrockets. Famine and disease spread like wildfire. Modern armies are relatively disciplined so it's less of a problem, but in the past widespread rape and war went hand.

I want to stress that we have no real idea of what a non-nuclear war between two major powers would look like. The world's largest economies haven't directly waged war against each other for over 50 years. The toll of such a conflict would be unimaginable, the only real points of comparison would be the world wars. Again, such a hypothetical war would also take place in a future where military tech would likely have advanced just as far as medical tech.

I'm going to stop now before this becomes another 1200 word post, but my main point here is that war causes suffering in life far beyond the deaths it causes. Hell, there was one year where suicide killed more US soldiers than combat (you don't commit suicide unless you're suffering pretty badly in life). Anti-aging tech wouldn't stop either

******* I don't think we should be concerned with minimizing suffering but in maximizing overall utility. If we want to minimize suffering then we should just fire off all our nukes right now and destroy the planet, because life requires suffering.

Death is bad not just because it causes suffering in survivors, or because it's a painful process, but because it prevents people from experiencing things that they'd like to.

I think most of the reasons that deaths in war are bad are also present in deaths from aging. And aging ultimately guarantees the death of everyone, so aging has a lot broader a scope in which to cause suffering or prohibit people from pursuing pleasure. Even if aging's suffering is not necessarily as intense as, say, death by starvation, it's nonetheless going to be a lot more common even in your hypothetical where immortality tech causes social conflict and war.

Your existential risk argument makes some sense, if we should care about the survival of the species much more than the survival of particular members of the species. But for non existential risks, I think it's clear that additional war would be worth the cost of immortality. Unless you're imagining an all encompassing war that includes most of the people on the planet as soldiers or civilian casualties, maybe?
