Ted Chiang is an author noteworthy for his excellent rational science fiction. I consider his work to be some of the most relevant to this subreddit. He pretty much exclusively writes short stories, and they're all amazing. Many of you will have read his writing, but I feel like since it has been some months since the last "Everything by Ted Chiang" post, it's time for a new post to show our new readers some of the very best this genre has to offer.

The first story of his I read was [[http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html][Exhalation]], the story of a scientist who isn't afraid to face the truth. I cried at the end, because the beauty of the story was too much for me. Read it first, and you will end up reading the rest of his work.

Many of his short stories are in a collection for sale on [[http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720/][Amazon]], or you can read them [[http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/tower.html][online]]. One short story, [[http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang][The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling]] is not in that collection, but is available online and generally considered an excellent rationalist work.

I highly recommend all of Ted Chiang's stories. I bought the book and have no regrets.

[[/u/Prezombie]] recommends [[http://www.sffaudio.com/?p=30099][two]] [[https://archive.org/search.php?query=ted%20chiang][sites]] with podcasted audiobook versions of Ted Chiang's works.
