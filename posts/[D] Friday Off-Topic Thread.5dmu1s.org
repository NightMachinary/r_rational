Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I watched the first season of Supergirl. Or to be more precise, I hate-watched it.

I think there's a certain laziness of writing that tends infect science fiction sometimes. It's like the writers think "okay, well this doesn't really make sense, but the whole concept is kind of out there so whatever". Similar to the argument that you'll often hear when someone asks "But how did he travel from the Wall to King's Landing so fast?" and the response is "It's fantasy, it's a show /with dragons/," which is not actually an answer to the question.

Supergirl has that in spades. Yes, I get that people watch superhero shows in order to get a power fantasy and/or get warm fuzzies, and yes, there's an element of both camp and fan service, but that doesn't absolve bad, contrived writing.

(I think one of few highlights was the DEO getting called out on keeping people imprisoned without trial, especially the comparison to Guantanamo Bay, which is the kind of Real Moral Problem that I think makes the best sort of story for overpowered superheroes.)

*** Minor digression:

There's this very widespread legal idea of [[http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm][/n/ Guilty Men]], with the most famous formulation being Blackstone's Ratio, "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

Let's say that you have ten supervillain prisoners. For each prisoner, you have 90% confidence that they actually committed the crime you think they did, and each is responsible for more than a hundred deaths. An supervillain released into the world due to a not-guilty verdict at trial will offend again 50% of the time, costing on average a hundred lives.

If we follow Blackstone's ratio, we're basically saying "better that five hundred people die than one innocent suffer", which seems obviously incorrect from a utilitarian standpoint.

I suppose this argues for extreme prejudice in the case of supervillains to an unpalatable degree; I'd have to do the math, but at the very least it's better for twenty innocents to suffer than a single supervillain be allowed to go free. Though I guess there's probably an argument to be made that the government putting innocent people in prison is much better or much worse than a supervillain killing them.

If you have the Joker or someone brutally murdering and mutilating 100 people, he's not getting out of that once caught. Imagine if Bin Laden had been given an American trial--do you think he would have gotten off even if he was hearing voices and drooling all the time?

**** An important thing to keep in mind is the effect punishing innocents has on the society at large. If your population cannot trust the system to fairly judge you, why abide by it's rules at all? If whether you are innocent or not doesn't entirely determine whether you will be /found/ innocent or not then there is less of a reason to follow it's rules, since even if you follow every rule down to the letter you may still be arbitrarily punished.

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

So I finally got around to getting a simple hex grid spawning in Unity!  Whoo-hoo I guess.  This has been long overdue, but things have kept cropping up to steal my spare time.  

On the design front, the final blow to the leveling system was dealt this week.  It's been a bit of a difficult holdover from the canon pokemon design, trying to fit the rigid level 1-100 concept into the other systems that were more free-form and built around diminishing returns rather than hard caps.  

In canon Pokemon, every creature had three different numbers that fed into any particular stat: the /base stat/, the /intrinsic value (IV)/ (generated at creature creation as basically a randomizer), and the /effort value (EV)/ (stats earned directly through battle).  Base stats were defined at the species level, so all Rattata have a base Attack (ATK) of 56, for instance.

When a pokemon leveled up, it would receive 1/50th of its Base Stat as a reward.  This meant that at level 50, a Rattata would have base 56 ATK, and at level 100 it would have 112.  

How frequently it leveled up was determined by its Growth Formula, which had several different archetypes that varied the amount of XP required per each level.  This meant that your Beedrill would hit level 100 while your Dragonite was still level 60, given the same XP.

And then of course, what moves a pokemon learned and when it evolved was determined by a straight level requirement: Rattata always leans Bite at level 10 and evolves to Raticate (starting) at level 20.  

I /think/ those were all the major ways that Level tied into the various mechanics (it also modified damage dealt and how much XP was earned, but those are more minor details).  Each of them has slowly been replaced with other mechanics, with stat growth being the last to fall this week.  So, here's what each of these concepts has been replaced with:

- Moves, as mentioned a few weeks ago, are tied to Aspect mastery and anatomy/stat requirements, which makes the move learnable whenever the prerequisites are fulfilled rather than at arbitrary times

- Growth curves have been shifted over to instead impact EV growth, which has taken a larger proportion of the stat impact (see below)

- Base Stats have been redefined as “how many stats are awarded on EV growth”.  So rather than being awarded in increments each level, you now receive points equal to your Base_ATK for every 100 ATK EVs earned

- Evolution has been shifted to a system similar to Moves, with more specific requirements than just level, which is detailed below.

All of these mean that the final nails have been put into the coffin that is the leveling system.  RIP levelups, we hardly knew thee.

--------------

Evolution, as mentioned, has been made slightly more free-form.  To level up, certain stat requirements need to be met (an Abra with 3 INT just isn't going to cut it as a Kadabra), as well as a certain amount of evolutionary “dust” needs to be procured.  

What we've decided is that the pokemon world is inundated with some sort of catalyst that triggers evolution--it floats in the air, it's embedded in living tissue, and it's produced and metabolized by pokemon themselves.  So breathing in the dust in the air, consuming fallen pokemon, or pushing the body are all things that will increase the amount of evolutionary dust in the pokemon, and bring it one step closer to metamorphosis.  

Because we're cheeky, we've decided this dust should be called Evolutionary Xenos Particulates, or EXP for short.  

But where this system gets /interesting/ is that Silph Co has found a way -- whether through synthesis or.../extraction/ -- to produce a concentrated version of EXP, which has different flavors depending on where or how it was produced.  

In short, evolutionary stones.

A pokemon can thus be fed EXP stones to accelerate their evolutionary timetables -- at a great opportunity cost.  You see, when a pokemon evolves, any EVs it has accumulated in a lower form get “baked in” to the base stats after evolving.  If you are patient and spend time developing your pokemon, those one-time stat gains from EV baking can be enormous--but if you're /not/ patient, well, all Silph Co affiliates have /very/ competitive prices on an alternative.    

TL;DR the last remnants of the old experience grind have been swept away.  Rather than worrying about arbitrary level gates, the player is now expected to be concerned with sick gainz instead.

I've found success in mitigating that by saying something along the lines of, "Looking for feedback, particularly which parts struck you as particularly well done, i.e. made you think or feel an emotion strongly, and parts during which you noticed your interest or suspension of disbelief slipping, or where you didn't think of the characters as actual thinking people."

****** I agreed with Crocker's Rules, but have often found that social norms fall into the opposite of the problem it implies - that is, rather than honest criticism being forbidden, honest counterargument against criticism is forbidden. I have often been accused of oversensitivity for disagreeing with criticism - even though I object to the thought behind the criticism, and not to its being uttered. Criticism is not exempt from criticism; a rebuttal of a rebuttal is still a rebuttal.

To elaborate, if I create something and someone doesn't like it, I fully agree with the interpretation of Crocker's Rules that says they should feel free to criticize it. But if Crocker's Rules are taken such that I'm forbidden from defending my work by arguing against their criticisms, then I think Crocker's Rules have fallen in on themselves in self-contradiction; they purport to prevent feelings from being prioritized over truth, but have in fact only caused a /different/ group's feelings to be prioritized over truth.

**** I don't think its long enough quite yet. Only 3 chapters posted (on spacebattles and DLP, will post to FF eventually too) so its not something I feel comfortable promoting quite yet.

Hoping to get another chapter up this weekend with some real plot advancement so I'll probably share it here then.

Its not really rationalist...its a Naruto fanfic, with a Massacre!Sasuke trapped in a month-long loop leading up to the Massacre. Mostly a mystery/family fic focused on Sasuke figuring out what the hell is going on, how he can stop it, how far he's willing to go, etc. It'll have some action, but since Sasuke isn't anywhere near as strong as anyone important at this point in his life, there won't be any powerleveling style looping. Also, there's a time/looping limit built in (not spelled out, but somewhat obvious in first 2 chapters) that means he wouldn't be able to do so anyways.

I hope the plot will be consistent and interesting (I have some ideas I think are pretty original), the themes poignant, but I won't be focused much on rationalism per se-- no discussions on rationality except as it might realistically come up, etc.

******* From the revised Chapter 1...

#+begin_quote
  It stunk of blood.
#+end_quote

Though both =stank= and =stunk= seem to be accepted as representing the past tense of =stink=, I prefer to use =stank= /exclusively/ as the past tense and =stunk= /exclusively/ as the past participle, since it decreases ambiguity.

#+begin_quote
  Her eyes opened, Sharingan spinning.
#+end_quote

Has a Sharingan /ever/ been shown to spin in the anime, outside of the moment of activation and in genjutsu? But this is embedded deeply enough in the fanon that it can be called a matter of personal preference, I guess...

#+begin_quote
  No cousin Tekka at the compound gate

  ---and I need to clean them and be with mother and father and Itachi---
#+end_quote

=cousin=, =mother=, and =father= should be capitalized when they're being used as /proper nouns/ (rather than merely as ordinary nouns), in accordance with =I ran towards Aunt Aiko’s house=. (Ditto elsewhere in the same chapter--=It’s okay mother, father.=, ="See if you can make one," father says.=, =The ball of fire I make is as big as father’s=, etc.)

Compare =The ball of fire I make is as big as Father’s.= with =The ball of fire I make is as big as my father’s.=

#+begin_quote
  No dream could be /that/ bad.
#+end_quote

I assume that =that= should have been italicized.

#+begin_quote
  With my strength, I will reality.
#+end_quote

That's an awkward way to use =will=. Let me see whether I can describe the problem...

IIRC, I've seen =will= used as a verb only in the construction =[someone] wills [something] into being= or =[someone] wills [a belief] to be true=. Note that the object of =will= always is an item that currently /isn't/ true, but is being /made/ true. Your Uchiha motto implies that the Uchiha /create/ reality, rather than merely /altering portions/ of it--and that seems a little too proud even for them!

Maybe =With my will, I shape reality.= would be better.

#+begin_quote
  ---her byakugan, of course!---
#+end_quote

If =sharingan= is capitalized, =byakugan= should be capitalized as well--unless this discrepancy is an intentional way of showing Sasuke's opinion that the Sharingan is superior to the Byakugan, or that the Uchiha are superior to the Hyuuga.

******** Thank you for the grammar corrections. I'm split on capitalizing cousin/father/mother. On the one hand it's definitely correct. On the other..I just don't like the aesthetics of capitalizing words too much. Weird, I know.

I'll capitalize Byakugan. That's an oversight, not intentional.

Hmm, Sharingan spin when casting genjutsu and at seemingly random times. Mild spoiler: that Sharingan is spinning because it's casting a jutsu-- what amounts to an amalgam of Izanami and Izanami and Aiko's MS technique, supercharged by the collective dying wishes of the Uchiha for a better fate.

Uchiha motto: yeah it's pretty arrogant, but mottos of sport teams, clans, companies, tight-knit groups, etc. often are. Also, I'm going with the idea that the Uchiha inherited in a diluted sense the Sage of 6 Path's Yin chakra, his spiritual energy. This means they can create forms, create reality, but not quite 'fill' it in, or give life to it. They're the outline, not the filler, if that makes sense. That's their strength in genjutsu and Izanami and Izanagi. So making reality fits, even if it's an exaggeration. In my Naruto metaphysics, deep spiritual confidence, especially in the form of a mantra or ideology, strengthens a person's chakra (by strengthening their spiritual energy), so the Uchiha mantra is a kind of 'clap along till you believe' idea that the clan knows isn't really true but helps them .

Thanks for the feedback, you're very thorough!

Any thoughts on the fix as a whole? The tone? Thanks!

#+end_quote

It seems interesting--though, as my flair indicates, I'm typically more enamored of the "power-up" style of looping. However, I don't plan to make a SpaceBattles account, so I probably won't follow it closely until it's posted to FanFiction.net.

******* You change tenses from past to present halfway through the chapter.

Also, you've done better than average at writing a six/seven year old, but simpler thought, language, and more passionate emotion would sell it better.
