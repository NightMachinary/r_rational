**** One of his POV chapters has him theorising that there are 'two' kinds of magic ability, the one that most Wizards have, and one for High Arcana. Maybe he'll find himself able to develop that, and do nothing but play with High Arcana.

He's already got some ability, but I imagine further development will make things strange. If that theory about it being part of the original language of creation filtered down is true, then something to do with being Hierophant might let him bootstrap himself into something else. We'll have to see if he kept the name properly, or becomes something else entire.

***** My understanding of how you lose a Name is that the core driving force that got you Named had wavered, died or changed. The core driving force of Masego was to tear apart Creation to see how it ticked. What sprang from this was his focus on seeing the connections between how magic works (recall how he unlocked witness).

Just because he lost his magic does not mean he lost this drive to see and understand magic. It's similar to a career physicist losing access to their laboratory and equipment. They no longer have the tools to study reality but the will to know is still there and if they're driven enough, they might reaqcuire the tools or obtain something better.

***** She had quite the identity crisis when she almost died to winter back in the underdark. It wouldn't be that surprising if actually dying freaked her out enough to make her lose her name.

There is definitely a trend of the woe losing their names and finding alternative sources of power. who knows, maybe that's the ticket to challenging the gods themselves.

** There's no way the Pilgrim knows what he's dealing with in the Bard. Considering that she orchestrated the Doom, there's no way Pilgrim would work with her if he knew what she's been up to. At least we know what the Dead King was referring to when he said that they would all turn on her.

** Oof. So was the Dead King playing one level above the Bard or the other way around?

Kinda surprised that Tariq is willing to take the Bard's word that they should spare Kairos on pain of letting him run around any longer and further indebting himself to Catherine. (Anyone remember what their deal was? I'm terrible with these details.)

Masego criticizing Trismegistus' (I love that half the characters in this story have like 4 different names you could use for them) sorcery was pretty uproarious. It felt a bit like watching Einstein slag off Newton as a "natural philosopher". I may be badly wrong about it, but I imagine the loss of his magic won't actually affect Masego's outlook much, assuming Indrani is properly resurrected. I imagine it'll be like losing a limb and he'll struggle to function in its absence, but I expect him to set about restoring it in the same way he's always sought to improve it.

**** Huh... that's... actually quite a coup for Cat if she walks out of this with a three month truce with the Dead King who's now got the knowledge to oppose to the Wandering Bard, a dead Saint and a Pilgrim whose influence in the Grand Alliance would presumably be undercut by forsaking his right to rule.

Still, that trifecta would presumably require Saint to try and kill Masego to give Cat cover to kill her, which seems unlikely given that he's successfully rid himself of Neshemah. Still, 2/3 ain't bad.

And yeah, I may have had my head up my ass about Masego returning to basically his old self considering he still has to grieve his fathers, his relationship with Indrani will have to evolve given what's just happened and the changes in her relationship with Cat, and also that he's now fully blind and without his magic.

******* i guess that depends in the definition of best buds, i was not thinking on idk, buddy cops and more thinking more on the line of sam and frodo from LotRs, that trusts each other and say that they love and are pretty much a couple without getting touchy.

and i think archer and zeze already behaved very close to that without the "i love u" part.

******** I guess there is, if at all, only a felt difference. But I think that acknowledging that which was already there will still change things, remove a few barriers. Plus, as the comment above said, that change is one of a great barrage of changes.

Maybe it won't come to that and one or both die. But with this story, even that won't really be anything permanent.

** My wild fan theory is that this is Bard's play to take a pair of threats off the board: Masego, whose powers are a threat to the playing board, and Catherine, whose goals are a threat to the game state.

How? She takes away Masego's magic and dominos him a solution that involves blood sacrifice a-la our favorite half-Fae ex of Cat's. Killian coming full circle, as it were. And Cat saying no breaks the Woe, and everything devolves back to the status quo.

But obviously A: EE is a better writer than me, so this isn't what's going to happen and B: if it did, Cat would find a third way.

** 'And it'll be worse if I dissect your shard after finding a way to torture you, I think. So I'll wait': this part made no sense to me (not in terms of disagreeing with the motivation, but that I'm not parsing why Catherine would disapprove of him doing that). That aside, the very end of this section made me REALLY REALLY happy! Very much looking forward to that being communicated to many other main characters!
