** There is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeroesSaveTheWorld][a TV Tropes page]] now. There's a handy "timeline" page for organizing things events chronologically (and which has shown me that the first sequence is a bit more of a mess than it had to be, in retrospect). I'll be trying to give the rest of it some life as well, at least enough that there's a skeleton there.

/spends five hours wondering how the character page should be organized.

Thank you again for reading. I'm glad that you're enjoying the story.

  Still, spending too long to think about what sort of message to send might have gotten her in trouble in some other way, either by making it more obvious that she was thinking carefully about this or by giving the opportunity for someone else to volunteer.

Wasn't the whole thing Hannah's idea in the first place? If she had thought of a better code and then simply acted as if the idea came to her a bit later no one without mind reading abilities could have been suspicious. I mean what are the chances that Simon comes up with it even though he hadn't done so until now?

Or did she just blurt it out as it came to her and the scramble to make a code, which she thought of only after saying her message-through-time plan out loud? Doesn't seem in character somehow, even though we have only seen little of it until now.

*** The concern wasn't that Simon would come up with a code, but that someone else might think of sending a message from the future and ruin her chance to do it now (and she wanted confirmation that she could push the CIA and trust Austin * Simon).

Hannah thought of it, and then she thought about using Simon to relay a message to herself from the future, so she's at least a little justified in being worried that somebody might think up the first part in the time that it takes her to create a better system.
