From my first skim through, it reads a lot like a funny pop-science book than anything more advanced. It crams a lot of scientific knowledge into the book, but albeit in a way to make it easy to speed through the book (with a few comics sprinkled in for a laugh or two). It feels like the book is meant to bring awareness of incredible new technologies to the public's attention in an effort to better handle the development of such technologies.

Here's a joke from the book about the frontal cortex:

  "But why would evolution put my personality in the least-protected part of my brain?"

  "Because the fact that you're a warm body is doing a /lot/ more for your reproductive chances."
