** My detective is almost at the end of her mystery novel quest, but my readers haven't solved the clues! I don't want to make my detective have unfair insights, but I think her puzzles are solvable. Can the veterans of the Final Exam help her?

You can submit your solutions directly into the current open poll inside the story (as, "Suddenly realize something something") or post them here.

*** I started reading it, so far it's okay.

There is a lot of things that irritate me, though. Reimu as a main character most of all. Every time I see picture of Reimu-as-detective, my immersion shatters. Very irritating.

Also, I hope the story starts to advance soon, first two chapters were, while not exactly slow, bland and a little boring.

I find main character boring as well. She reminds me of Spock-style Hollywood Rationalist stereotype.

So, I can only promise this: I will give my honest effort to read this and solve your puzzle, but I cannot promise to not stop reading if I don't find plot engaging. So far it is tolerable, but not great.

I would probably liked it better without asexuality theme. It is hard to relate to main character, so it's hard to enjoy reading.

**** Sorry about Reimu-immersion issues. Illustrating a story as you go, writing in realtime, requires a character who has /so/ many pictures of her online that you can find her dressed as a detective, or hugging a cat, or watching from the rooftops, or anywhere else the story goes. Touhou characters are good for that.

I'm confused about the Spock part. Sam Spade I could understand, but Spock?

***** I understand /why/ you use Reimu, Touhou art is around 25% of all anime art there is, but it still shutters immersion for me. That's the price of being a Touhou fan, I guess.

As for the Spock: main character with her lack of certain emotions has very [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/90n/summary_of_the_straw_vulcan/][Straw Vulcan]]-like feel. Like the one described [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLgNZ9aTEwc][here]] (warning: hour-long video)

And a bit about a riddle: I have read everything up to "The Stakeout" so far. [[#s][My thoughts on the riddle so far]]

****** The puzzle is solvable [[#s][even if]] Any detective story includes the possibility that some people are saying untrue things, but in a Fair Play Whodunnit it won't be all of the people.

******* Okay, [[#s][but]]

As for the puzzle: [[#s][let's do traditional analysis.]]

In conclusion: no, there is not enough evidence to make strong decision. Everything is shaky, world is insufficiently fleshed out, full extent of various characters' powers is unclear, so it's not clear what is or isn't possible. I have no clear answer. I can give some unsubstantiated guesses, though. [[#s][Here]]

** [[#s][...Am I the only one who wants to throw in with the Mind Flayer?]]

(Edit: actually, screw it--I'm adding a "Suddenly Realize" choice to this effect.)

Also, have you /been/ to this subreddit before? /Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'./ No, not even if you have a Fourth Wall Observer lampshading it, and no, /not even/ if said character did the same thing in the story from which they originate (I wouldn't know; I've never read it). That's the Nuremberg defense!

I admit, however, that when you revealed what "Ace" stood for, I had to stop reading and /literally yell out loud for a full minute/ in response to the *WEAPONS-GRADE LEVELS OF WIN* in that idea. You combined this with good use of crossover characters, resulting in a story that's got a lot going for it despite being pretty minimalist.
