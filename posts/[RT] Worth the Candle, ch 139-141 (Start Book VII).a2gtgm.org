** I know it's kinda redundant given that there is supposed to be official art Soon™ and it's not all that great looking, but another princess (AC7's if anyone's curious) inspired me to doodle Amaryllis and it'd be a waste to let it languish in the drawer given there's precious little Worth the Candle fanart, so I just hope it doesn't burn your eyes --- [[https://imgur.com/a/6DlemvM]]

Anyway, let's hope we're not getting another disaster so soon in the atheneum, though given Joon's track record in that regard that might be a tad too optimistic.

**** I would hazard a guess it's how the darker marker shades give way to thicker black outlines in shadows. It was only a half-conscious choice, but way they seem "heavy" makes it feel as if it pulls those parts back into the background.

  I closed my eyes and counted out three seconds, then flipped through the screens. I stopped when I got to the Companions section. Fenn was missing from it, her name, biography, and perks all completely gone, as though she'd never been there. My breath caught on seeing that, and I continued on to quests, to find that her companion quest had been silently scrubbed too, without so much as a greying out. It was like Fenn had never existed, so far as the game was concerned.

Juniper still gets the benefit of companion skills from Symbiosis, even if they're not one of his 40 selected skills, and his companions aren't limited to just 40 skills (though they also don't benefit from super-learning, just the benefits of Twinned Souls which artificially increase their skills).

The full list includes skills that Juniper could take, but has chosen not to, for whatever reason, and I find it mildly annoying when people make arguments about decisions without the full context, which a list of skills would necessarily not have.

Grak appears to be actually in the process of healing for the first time and it's very heartwarming. Him and Solace being cuddle buddies is straight up cute. Hopefully he'll find stumble upon his own Jorge soon.

Since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9yc1dm/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_135137_holding_krinrael/ea1e93v][my post last time]], there's been a fair bit of progress on *[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki][the new /Worth the Candle/ wiki]]*.

Summaries are complete for the *first six chapters* of the story: "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Taking_the_Fall][Taking the Fall]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Thickenings][Thickenings]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Solely_Responsible][Solely Responsible]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Reaver][Reaver]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Goraion][Goraion]]" and "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Cold_Comfort][Cold Comfort]]".

The minor characters from "Goraion" ([[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Poulus_Cambria][Poulus Cambria]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Becca][Becca]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Sly][Sly]]) have comprehensive write-ups. So too do [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Nate][Nate]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Ricky][Ricky]], the two other kids from ten-year-old Juniper's and Arthur's D&D sessions. A start's been made on [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Reimer][Arthur Reimer]]'s page, but it's slow going and we're still trying to formalise a way of doing these write-ups. There's placeholder pages for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Juniper%20Smith][Juniper Smith]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Amaryllis_Penndraig][Amaryllis Penndraig]], but there's so much to be written up for those that we've been putting off making a start. Pages for the game layer have yet to be completed, with the exception of a fairly comprehensive page for "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Achievement][Achievement]]" and a "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Skills][List of Skills]]".

Other *miscellaneous completed pages* include "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Frongal][Frongal]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Blackthorne][Blackthorne]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Color_Riot][Color Riot]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/The_Collection][The Collection]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Obol][Obol]]" and "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/God][God]]". We've also made good starts on "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Athenaeum][Athenaeum]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Risen_Lands][Risen Lands]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/XC-class_soulcycle][XC-class soulcycle]]" and "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Earth][Earth]]".

To make these pages possible, I've been compiling an assortment of *custom templates*. While the wiki software does include plenty of bits of convenient markup, there were a few things missing for our purposes. I've added a [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Scroll_Box][scroll box]] which has been put to use with the new "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Reflist][Reflist]]" (for preventing long lists of references from bloating a page's length). There are now standardised templates for citing [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Wtc][extracts of the story]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Tcoa][extracts of /The Council of Arches/]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Reddit][Reddit comments]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Discord][Discord comments]]. The "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Storylink][storylink]]" template is used to link out to articles on a chapter from character's biographies and such. There's now [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Gt][a template]] for marking text as quoting a game notification. For some reason [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Cite][citation needed]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Sic][sic]] weren't a thing, but now they are. I decided to throw together a template for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Mentioned]["mentioned only"]] and for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Main][linking to a main article on a subject from a section on that subject]]. The new [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Messagebox][messagebox]] template has been used to make a [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Stub][stub]] template, which is presumably (read: unfortunately) going to see a lot of use. [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:W][Linking to wikipedia articles]] can now be done just with the article's name. Examples of all of these templates' use can be found on their respective pages.

The pre-Aerb timeline of the story is kind of impenetrable, with Juniper's notes in chapter 105 being the best resource for organising it. We're looking into organising the story's flashbacks in chronological order - for now, we've pulled out all the relevant text and loaded into [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Flashback/src][one page]] in chapter order, but we've got our work cut out for us untangling the chronology.

In case you're wondering about the... /unusual/ prioritisation on display here (Blackthornes? Nate? /Really?/), things so far have generally just been a case of doing pages as and when the opportunity to do so arises. This isn't about turning as many redlinks blue as possible, it's about making sure what's going up there is *reliable* and *comprehensive.* To do so, we need all the help we can get - *no experience necessary.* Got a favourite character, chapter, or creature? Do a ctrl-f on the story and start pulling out info for a new page. *Just head over to the wtc-wiki channel of the alexanderwales Discord server (linked at the end of the last chapter) to join the discussion!*

*** The pre-Aerb timeline may have to stay fuzzy, given that Juniper is supposedly 18 and has more gaming experience than the average 30-year-old no-outside-lifer (and more psychological self-awareness than most folks /ever/ get). Which is fine, he's obviously a partial self-insert and his prodigal gaming makes the story work well, but it would make construction of a timeline difficult.

***** All weekend every weekend, and a fair number of school nights too, and /maybe/. Like Tiger Woods played golf, or Tonya Harding skated. But in both of those cases, there was an adult driving them to do it at least as much as they were self-driven.

Gaming is a team sport, too. And better gaming pretty much requires bad gaming as a pre-requisite. Ten-year-olds are munchkins, they burst into tears over failed rolls, etc etc. You have to crawl before you walk, unless you have one hell of a good coach.

Also there's the literacy level to consider, and the sociological sophistication level.

This isn't a critique of the story quality, it's a great story. All I'm saying is, Joon's gaming backlist is like HPMOR-Harry's reading backlist.

**** It's not about working out exactly which day every event took place on, it's about being able to definitively state "flashback X takes place before flashback Y" for as many given pairs of flashbacks as possible. Tiff's arrival, Arthur's death, and many smaller details besides can be used to split up the forty-odd flashbacks into groups - I just don't want to make incorrect assumptions. It might be possible, using the dates given in chapter 105, to apply something more than a relative ordering, but that's not really a priority.

Besides, Juniper ran sessions /twice weekly/ from 2009 to 2017. I'm sure there's plenty of details that can be used to work out a more accurate figure, but just as a rough ballpark, that's between (52 * 2 * 7 = ) 728 (presuming he started in December 2009 and went to Aerb during January 2017) and (52 * 2 * 9 = ) 936 sessions (from January 2009 to December 2017). Dude's spent thousands of hours doing these campaigns, many of which we know only actually lasted a couple of sessions. Is this level of "prodigal gaming" for a ten-to-seventeen year old unusual? Sure is. Is it a timeline impossibility? Nah, I don't think so.

***** Gaming is like a harvest, reaped from the seeds of cultural input. It'd be the next thing to impossible to just pump out game sessions over-and-over without material on which to base it. You have to read, watch movies (Joon /also/ has extensive movie knowledge), participate in games run by others, participate in web forums like this one, etc etc. For every campaign, there's several hours of prep - even for very prep-light systems like Dungeon World, you still have /some/ prep, even if it just consists of thinking about (say) a scene you want to run with "some evil king" confronting the PCs and in actual play that turns out to be the local duke one of the players created. Granted Joon could probably spend a lot of his classroom time daydreaming and not suffer much from grade reductions, but still.

I suppose you could just repeatedly run pre-generated campaigns like Pathfinder APs, but that's a problem too - each one of those is going to be at least 200 hours of play. My own group just finished a Pathfinder AP that took 133 3-hour sessions to get through. Even at the cracking pace of high-school all-weekend gaming, that's still most of a year.

And Joon and Arthur's group /weren't/ "kick in the door, kill them all, loot the bodies, rez the hostages" murderhobos. They actually liked to role-play, develop relationships with NPCs, etc etc. That stuff (which is the real fun of gaming anyway) takes even more time.

****** That's one of the breaks from reality that I found acceptable. I would consider it at the edge of plausibility, rather than strictly implausible, but understand it's one of those places where YMMV. Per the math as it's been laid out in the story, most campaigns were on the short side, low single digit months rather than years. Per the math as it's been established for play, that's ~8-24 sessions, which, again, is on the short side, depending on how long sessions actually are. Should be one short one mid-week, then a marathon session on Saturday of maybe 12 hours (noon to midnight), which is what we did when I was that age, so an average of maybe 8 hours each. Not all of that is actual play time, since some of it is conversation, argument, eating, breaks, etc., but it's hard to account for that. That would mean ~192 hours of play every three months or so. (In practice, lower during the school year, not during holidays, more during the summer but with fewer players.)

I'd say maybe half of the stuff in WtC is taken from actual high school campaign notes, old posts from our forum, PbP campaigns I ran in high school, etc., with the rest being either made up explicitly for the work, or taken from campaigns I ran as an adult. Partly this is because I didn't jump ship from campaigns as quickly as Juniper is said to have. In some cases, campaigns were "split" for WtC (e.g. they're described as being different campaigns, but in the reality that they were taken from, they were just two extended different arcs within the same world).

As far as inspiration? The campaign list notes a number of them; SCP, /The Atrocity Archives/, /Fine Structure/, Star Wars, Pratchett, etc., and there are more of them scattered through the entire work, none of which I think is /particularly/ unreasonable. It's also noted that Juniper and Arthur watched movies specifically because Arthur thought that cultural literacy was the mark of a good citizen (which, again, is something that I actually did in high school).

(Most of Juniper's emotions, reads on people, knowledge, etc. are taken from autobiography/e-mails/posts that I wrote when I was 13-18, so they're what I would consider /mostly/ realistic depictions of what it was like to be that age for me, if not for others.)

I generally consider Juniper at the edge of what's realistically plausible; he's an exaggerated version of how I was in high school, with many of the same forces shaping him.

I've been thinking about the Loyalty mechanic, ever since that theory that /Joon's/ loyalty is what's actually measured, a couple threads ago. I think that has too much going against it (a new data point si the bump in Bethel's loyalty, which seems to be completely internal).

However, I do think Loyalty could be a two way street. The increases in the Locus' Loyalty this chapter felt like Joon was actually starting to understand what druidism and the locus are about. Maybe it's about understanding your companion and letting them feel that understanding, forging a connection. Or something.

*** For the most part Dwarf Fortress is the closest thing in existence to the kind of game described in WtC.

Try making a mod for DF?

Alternatively and more interestingly if you want to try doing something from scratch...Try looking into Entity Component Systems.

Also let's look at some random sentence in WtC.

​

"A few seconds later, a variety of birds landed on the staff, and she tweeted at each of them in turn, causing them to fly off. "

​

From this the game is going to need to understand birds of different varieties, a female (assumed human out of context), staffs, A model for communication. The sentence implies that there exist behaviors like flying, tweeting and landing on various entities. Something would have to be done with adjectives like "on" and "away" There is a need for a model for each of those as well as models for all the concepts they depend on. At the end there is a bunch of entities that interact with each other through closely integrated systems to produce a state of the simulation. (And how that state is displayed to the gamer is a completely separate problem) Over time as entities and systems are added or revised the world will be able to say more complex things.

​

Unlike all those other guys I'm fully convinced you can make a great game based on WtC.

All entad's have this pattern:

an entad is an entity, has activation conditions, an acceptable class of targets and changes the target(s) when activated. Sometimes, it has a duration or temporary effect.

An example entad that fits this framework would be described as "a staff that when tweeted at causes itself to fly away" The more concepts are defined the richer the entad could be.

If you want to have an entad that has effects on emotions or mental attributes you need to create a model of mind and emotion for it to affect. An entad can't affect anything you don't have a model of. the model doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to be good enough that the player can fill in the gaps with their imagination. (locus?)

** If a soul is like a specific type of component in which it is just a collection of data attached to an entity then spirits are like systems which determine how entities change over time. (and interact with each other).

​

Many things that don't have souls should still be affected by spirits. Although the spirit wouldn't interact with the soul so the strings of spirits would have to be accessed through some other means. (June has only accessed spirits through their affects on his soul)

​

The true name might be an instance of an entity and there might be other components that you can gain access to besides the soul through knowing the true name like a location component which doesn't seem to exist in the soul but can still be modified by teleportation based artifacts (and still mages). My guess is that the true name points to an instance of an entity. My guess is that everything in the world (all artifacts, objects, people, animals, groups, buildings, cities, and possibly civilizations ect. have true names although it's harder to find them for some as there might not always be a convenient reference to it in a component such as it is with the soul component. ( I wonder if there is an artifact that can find true names of anything.)

​

Typically Systems can take an entity and add and remove components to it.

​

Magic systems/spirits in general might listen in for the existence of specific components. An exclusion zone could be created by creating a spirit/system that adds and removes those components as an entities location (component) shows they left and entered a zone. You could remove a spirit from the world and destroy the exclusion zone with all that that implies. Alternatively create a spirit or modify an existing spirit so that it ensures you have the necessary components to use the excluded magic. That way only you can break the exclusion zone in a more controlled manner ie that gives you a distinct advantage.

***** As I recall, It's one of the things AW has mentioned he didn't find a good place to state clearly, and we've only gotten the full explanation outside of the story. I might be able to dig up a quote on the matter, but I don't have one on me right now.

**** Another option is revision magic. You can revise someone at least one year into the past so still might be an option if they use it on fens corpse and soul.

***** You can't go back further than you can teleport, which puts a limit on it for them and even if you could it has to be impossible as otherwise there would not be a general attitude of death being hard to reverse on aerb. Most likely some part of the spirit leaves the body after you die and you can't revise something you don't have all the component parts to.

** Unrelated to the chapters.

After the library arc ended, I have this theory about what the DM actually is. Tho it comes with some flaws too.

The idea is the DM entity that Joon met in his soul trance after he maxed out his Essentialism (Chapter 78: The Sacrifice) is actually an entity just like Cypress (old Amaryllis on the doomed timeline), but instead communicating via book, the entity is communicating via soul link.

Or speaking more formally: the DM is a simulation of a character (probably Joon) on another doomed timeline. Sending message to the past via their soul link.

Or maybe with another wording: Joon following that DM's soul link is actually activating the doomed-timeline-simulation and creating that DM avatar.

The Flaws:

- The DM gift (the Earth Backpack) is hard to explain
- The DM is actively nudging things here and there
- If he's just simulation, why not just tell Joon directly?
- They already met in the past (in the recording of Joon's consent of being transported)

Okay, sorry, just wanna let this theory out from my head. I know it's flawed. And seems unlikely. But after reading the Cypress chapter and start thinking about the "what if" scenario. The scenario where Joon was one that tasked with sending message to his past. The talks between Joon and the DM comes to my mind.

** June has all the tools needed to create his own memetic weapons and defenses. Hell, with spirit and existentialism combined he could create a contagious "ideology" meme with a backdoor such that it doesn't affect those who know about it. Taking over the world with mass scale mind control. Oh wait I guess June wouldn't do that. He might be able to make a meme that can cause fell seed to self destruct.

Both Valencia and Bethel lack a soul but do they have a spirit? If not what is this thing that Bethel has that is not soul or spirit but has properties attributed to both in fantasy settings? Is there a skill that might give a clue? Is it really memorization or the mind? In which case social skills would be necessary to manipulate it.

** About this: /(Pallida and Raven kept their distance from one another, as much as possible, and while Pallida occasionally made private comments, Raven didn't seem to feel that there was a story that needed to be set straight.)/

I've forgotten what history Pallida had with Raven...?

(I tried checking the wiki but it seems not populated yet.)

*** Pallida lays it out in ch 125. The tl;dr version is that Pallida, Raven, and Dahlia (Uther's daughter) were all besties, and then Pallida and Dahlia began to grow up while Raven stayed the same age, which eventually came to a head when Raven walked in on Pallida and Dahlia having sex. Pallida says to Juniper that Raven is going to tell a version of this story that makes Pallida look a lot worse, but Raven hasn't actually said anything yet.
