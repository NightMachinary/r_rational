** So I can't believe I didn't make the (potential) connection earlier, but is your telepathic dragon in any way inspired by the telepathic dragons from Eragon?

*** Definitely. /Eragon/ was a big inspiration for me. It was my favorite book as a kid, and although the design of Rose had several big iterations, it ended with dragons for a simple reason: [[https://www.youtube.com/user/WriteAboutDragons][why not?]].

Other reasons were easy to rationalize in hindsight: evil looking, but familiar enough to not kill the baby on sight; not too big a stretch to change history so that all ancient cultures have dragon myths, etc.
