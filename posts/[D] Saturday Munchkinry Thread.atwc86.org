Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Consider either the HPMOR or Rowling's Harry Potter approach to Hogwarts, with the following modification: the broom-based sport of Quidditch has been replaced with the magical mecha sport of Magical Soccer. Mech Soccer is played with magically-powered suits of armor that come in different sizes; standardization has created the Junior and Pro sizes:

- Junior-size Magical Soccer Mechs are up to six feet tall, with a torso that fits within a four-foot cube and containing a maximum of two humans. Junior-size mechs have four limbs, and are limited to a common list of spells and materials laid out by the Magical Soccer Mech regulatory body. Their simplicity compared to Pro-size mechs means that compliance with regulations can be verified with a handful of standard spells before a Magical Soccer Match. There are several mass-produced designs. These mechs cannot fly in a sport-compliant configuration, but hobbyists have been known to use broom enchantments to allow them to fly. Like with broom flight, mech flight over Muggle areas is strongly discouraged.
- Pro-size Magical Soccer Mechs must fit within a 60-foot cube when standing upright. Pro-size Magical Soccer Mechs are limited to at most 6 limbs, and have a larger common list of spells and materials laid out by the Magical Soccer Mech regulatory body. Because of the increased possible complexity of construction, verification of regulatory compliance cannot be easily undertaken. In order to verify compliance, a given mech must be assembled from raw materials (the list of approved materials includes nonmagical pre-shaped materials of any shape, subject to size, cost, and materials restrictions) in front of a judge within a time limit. Judges perform a spell ritual that notes the magical signature of the mech, which can be verified remotely. Repairs and other modifications affect the magical signature, and a mech with abnormal signature can be disqualified. Magical Soccer Mech teams are allowed a number of backup mechs on the roster, but can only replace two mechs during a game. Generally speaking, resource constraints on team composition and mech construction, and the rules of the game as played, favor non-flying mech designs in regulation play.

Hogwarts teaches children to play Magical Soccer using Junior-size mechs, because Junior-size mechs are commonplace in Magical society. There are a number of spells for automating Junior-size mechs, and as such they are often employed as grunt labor in tasks that would be magically exhausting for witches and wizards to complete. When the Wizarding community last subjugated the goblins, Junior-size mechs were the Wizarding army's swarm fighters; mechs of all sizes are designed to be resistant to spells coming from outside of the mech's armor.

What mayhem would you get up to at Hogwarts with Junior-size mechs? How would you prevent that mayhem as Hogwarts' administration?

** *Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 11: Gold*

Ok, week ten of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This week we have gold, the first of the temporal metals. As always we're interested in what a gold twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, gold is perhaps the strangest of the 16 metals. When burning gold you experience a vivid halucination in which you interact with another version of yourself called a gold shadow. The gold shadow is a version of you that you would have been if certain major events or decisions in your life had gone differently. For as long as you keep burning gold you are inhabiting both your mind and that of the gold shadow; You see the shadow through your eyes and yourself through the shadows eyes, you know both sets of personalities and experience both your reaction to what kind of person the shadow has become and the shadows reaction to the kind of person you have become.

You become aware of the personality of the shadow and acquire a very vague notion of the general path through life they took, but you don't gain any specific knowledge that the gold shadow would have obtained. You can't, say, ask a version of you that broke up with your boyfriend/girlfriend what person they ended up dating (though you will know whether they ended up with someone else) or ask a version of you that went on to study physics to help you out on a physics problem you are struggling with.

You also do not have any control over which gold shadow you get to see when you start burning gold. The branching point in your life is selected randomly from all the moments where your life could have taken a different turn, but it is heavily weighted towards events and decision points that were meaningful to you.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, gold stores health. When storing health, the feruchemist stops healing from injuries, their immune system takes a nosedive and they start feeling generally crappy. When tapping the resulting metalmind, the feruchemist ability to recover from injuries is increased spectacularly.

As long as a feruchemist has sufficient health stored and any part of their body is still touching the goldmind, they can survive just about any physical injury. We've seen gold feruchemists that were impaled, set on fire, decapitated and had a stick of dynamite explode in their hands without suffering any lasting damage. One gold compounder even routinely fires a shotgun at his own face to demonstrate his healing ability.

It's worth noting that that this ability does not provide any increased pain tolerance beyond what the feruchemist builds up naturally through repeatedly surviving injuries that would kill a normal person (gold feruchemists have a tendency to get hurt a lot).

Feruchemic gold always heals a person back to their Spiritual Ideal, this is a sort of metaphysical blueprint of what that person is supposed to look like. Your spiritual ideal is build up as you go through life and is largely based on how you subconsiously view yourself. For instance, if you tap a goldmind right after getting a tattoo, the magic will force the ink out of your skin, but if you've had the tattoo for a while and you've come to internalize it as part of your body the magic will leave it untouched (and will even heal it back if the arm gets severed). Similarly, if two gold feruchemists lost an arm early in life, before they knew their powers and one has accepted and internalized the injury as part of who they are and for the other it remains a constant struggle, then once they get familiar with their abilities the latter will be able to heal back their arm while the former will not. Also, as an interesting side effect, transgender feruchemists that tap enough health will find that their bodies slowly start to transform to match their preferred gender.

Another notable thing here is that your spiritual ideal ages, which means this is on of the rare cases where magical healing does not automatically translate to immortality. You still can't really die as long as you have enough health stored up, but as age related damage starts adding up, "enough health" becomes infeasible even with compounding.

Please keep in mind for any munchkinry that involves hacking your spiritual ideal that people can't just wilfully start to believe things they know are untrue. If you're 40 years old, you can't just decide to believe that you are 20 years old. True, people are pretty good at self-deception, but spiritual ideals don't care about what you profess to believe, what you tell yourself you believe or even what you believe you believe, it cares about how you actually, deep down, view yourself. Self deception at that level, if it is even possible, is very difficult to achieve intentionally.

*** Just to double check: spiritual ideal is seperate from a person's spirit web, although I assume they effect each other indirectly?

The allomancy is very odd and useless for my understanding. It proves the many worlds theory for their universe? They would probably all believe in moral relativism, since they can look at how different they could have been based on decisions in the past. Seems especially bad since it burns a metal I assume is pretty valuable in their world, for no physical or informational gain?

Feruchemy: Goldmind Bodybuilder: with knowledge of how muscle building and how the body can adapt to stress works your can become the ultimate muscle monster. Even if the healing actually prevents normal muscle growth working out a ton should change your mental image of yourself and eventually your spiritual image. Or just be born/raised/brainwashed into thinking you should be super muscular and you will gradually shift that way every healing.

Requires you to be a copper and gold feruchemist: (Age)Immortality: store any memories that make you believe you should be older in order to truly change your spiritual ideal. I think you could limit the memory loss needed by using self deception then forget the deception techniques. Worst case scenario is that you have to store literally all of your memories after your target age, then heal yourself to that age before tapping your memories back. Then your biggest threat is any healing without the full storage will rapidly age you.

Shapeshifting: using the store memories and heal method you can turn your ideal into basically anything and then heal into that form. This would likely require a ideal/memory creating ally and storage of the vast majority of your memories. Store everything except how to tap gold and copper, your ally then convinces blank slate you that you are or should be X with Y physical traits, then to tap gold to heal to that form before copper to regain memories.

Gold feruchemy seems phenomenal if you have a bank to pull from which seems pretty doable. Suppressing your immune system most of the time isn't as big a deal when you can always tap to instantly cure yourself if you catch anything bad.

A gold feruchemist and pewter allomancer would be a monster. Any time you are burning pewter just for strength and speed you can store health to avoid wasting it and any excess pewter you have can be converted into stored health also.

Anti-Gold: if you can change a gold feruchemist's spiritual ideal you can mutate them or prevent healing. Extreme zinc allomancy causing self loathing or depression might do it, even if it's only short term you just have to time it so it happens when they are doing a big healing. Rioting apathy might make them just accept their wounds preventing healing also?

Correct.

#+end_quote

Not necessarily. Gold shadows aren't (considered to be) real. They're not people from timelines that have actually happened, just perfect predictions about timelines that could have happened. I suppose in a way that's weak evidence in favor of many worlds (because making such a prediction would be "easier" if the universe is already doing all the calculations in the background and the magic just has to peek into another universe to see what would have happpened), but gold allomancy is not incompatible with the copenhagen interpretation or even just with a straight up deterministic universe.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Apparently most gold allomancers tend to not use there abilities much because of how disconcerting the process is, but yeah, I expect those that do to be much more introspective and self-aware at least. For what it's worth, the two people we know that canonically burned a lot of gold were both pretty horrible people with big ideas about what means justify what ends. So I don't know about moral relativism, but it certainly seems to be somewhat unhealthy (though both of them were at least somewhat unhinged to begin with, so there's that).

#+end_quote

Ooh, that's very cool. It would require you to be at least a full feruchemist (and ideally also a gold allomancer in order for the process not to take forever), but yeah, that could work. There is probably some limit to what you can convince even a blank slate copper feruchemist of, but for the right person that limit could be pretty high.

I don't know about this one. Spiritual Ideals don't change over night, so you'd have to be close enough to burn zinc over a long period of time without them catching on. It's probably not impossible, but it's definitely going to be tricky.

*** Warning to anyone who has not read any of the Mistborn books, massive spoilers ahead. Do not read.

Did not know about the transgender thing. This gives Scadrial two ways to cure transfolks. Unlocked goldminds are the most moral method, but this would require a full feruchemist, very few of whom exist by the second era. The second one is definitely doable, but of questionable morality. A Hemalurgic spike storing gold feruchemy could be used to give the transperson gold feruchemy. This would require the spike to exist, which requires murder, but each spike could help several transpeople before losing too much charge to be useful, especially if the spike was "stored" in someone between uses. Capital punishment on Scadrial is marginally more moral than it is here because superpowers make it hard to contain some criminals, so a government which knew about hemalurgy might use it to get the most benefit out of putting someone dangerous down. However, this would require a /government/ to know about /hemalurgy./ The last time that happened we got a genocidal, immortal emperor who successfully pretended to be a demigod for 1,000 years and created two races of hemalurgic abominations, and also the Kandra, who are at least working for Harmony now. The downsides far outweigh the benefits.

Yeah, one of the best things about writing this series is all the little titbits I find out about while looking for WoB's describing how something actually works.

Definitely agreed that people not knowing about hemalurgy is probably for the better, but it /is/ theoretically possible to survive hemalurgy and if a gold feruchemist did survive the process they would probably [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/102/#e983][be able to heal back the damage hemalurgy did to their spiritweb]], which is one hell of an exploit if you can somehow make hemalurgy consistently survivable.

To be fair, all three hemalurgic races got better after the catacendre. There are good Koloss now and the one remaining Steel Inquisitor also seems to be a good guy (even if he is pretending to be the grim reaper).

We don't know what it is about hemalurgy that actually kills you except that it's not just physical trauma (though the physical trauma would typically be enough to kill you anyway), so no clue.

There's no reason you couldn't just insert the spike back into the feruchemist and have them heal the damage before removing the spike again. Other than that, if they are a gold compounder their previously created metalminds are still keyed to them, so they should be able to burn them for a burst of healing power.

1) You can control the direction of the force of weight inside the area. If the stuff inside the ares experiences a force of 10N towards the ground due to gravity you could make it so those 10N of force were pointed upward or any direction you like. (EDIT:The direciton change has to be constant though out the whole area)

2) You can slectively make objects the area intangible to gas and liquid as well as solid items that fit into a 2cm in diameter area. A object is anything you mentally consider a single item or being that is completely inside your area. You cannot cause an object to become intangible to the liquids or gases that make it up. You can't stop people from breathing with this for example. If a object (EDIT: changed person to object) loses intangibility the matter inside it is safely displaced.

3) You have a mental list of objects in the area and know where their center of mass is.

4) The area, when viewed with biological eyes has a slight purple tint. Otherwise it is invisible.

In addition to this you have enough durability to survive a fall from terminal velocity with little injury and instinctive knack for 3d spatial movement.

*** I had a similar power in mind:

- You can move an object within two inches of the surface of your skin provided it is entirely within that range to any other space within said range.

- No additional ability to remember what objects are in range or where but if you concentrate on an object and where you remember it should be you can get a "lock" on where it is.

- objects in motion stay in motion, objects at rest stay at rest. You cannot change, with the ability, the direction of motion. Meaning you cannot drop a ball bearing from your shoulders to your lower back over and over (vertically) until terminal velocity and then shoot it from your hand at a 90 degree angle (horizontally) away from you.

** The Earth is contacted by aliens. They're very advanced compared to humans and offers to uplift us. But they decide to first give human superpowers for a 'trial period' of 50 years to see what humans will do with it to simulate the culture shock of suddenly being able to do things beyond their imagination. They will uplift everyone after 50 years is up regardless, but do mention that labor is still useful for them. Your goal is to get as many human to be productive for their eventual new society as possible.

The rules to superpowers are as follows:

One power can be gained by designing it, then contacting an alien reviewer for review at any point during a person's life. You only need to think about it start a session. You can have any number of sessions with the reviewer to discuss your power before it is accepted as long as you have free time. You gain intuitive command of the power you earned.

The reviewer prioritizes, in descending order:

1. Being balanced. This includes raw power and maximum munchkinry potential. For raw power, the general upper limit is 1 megawatt, although if you make significant enough drawbacks or rate highly in other categories you can get more. Non-energy dependent powers get reviewed case-by-case. For munchkinry, the rule is if you can achieve world domination with this power in an Earth without other powers then it's not allowed.

2. Searching for talent. If your designed power can put into question how productive the user and other people will be when they are uplifted then it is more likely to be accepted. A Green Lantern ring ripoff is more likely to be accepted than plain super strength.

3. Judging morality. If you can demonstrate the power have both good and evil applications then it is more likely to be accepted(using values of 2019 average human with secondary education or above). An instadeath power can be used to murder as the obviously evil application and destruction of diseased cells as a good application.

4. Entertainment. A power that can evoke humanlike joy for the reviewer is more likely to be accepted. Capped-power toon physics is an example.

Your goal is to maximize the number of humans that is productive for the new society by finding out what qualities they need and maximize the number of humans that satisfy those criteria.

If your goal is to maximize "productivity", then your biggest threat might be humans pinging alien reviewers just to study their psychology to figure out how they screwed up so badly that human labor could possibly matter to them. You're not going to be able to integrate into their markets if someone triggers a communist revolution.

And no, human labor don't really matter to them, (they can supply 7*10^{15} watts as a side project after all) but the aliens do want to contribute to the society in some way and would like humans to do the same. While scientific advancements and resource creation is automated, culture advancement can only be automated as much as hiring a bunch of people to write poetry can be called automation.

So the answer the humans would find is that aliens would value qualities such as creativity and perceptiveness over hardworking and resourcefulness.

*** What 'productive' means in the context of this future is important. Clearly raw labour (i.e. mindless, repetitive tasks) are not what they want - rather, it seems they're interested in creative labour, i.e. imagination.

So. On that basis, here's my first idea for a power:

The ability to turn into any fictional character, with full access to the powers and abilities of that character, up to an energy limit.

Caveats:

- A 'fictional character' is defined as a character whose name, abilities, and identity are known to at least ten thousand humans, but who is not and never was a genuine person (example: Harry Potter, Superman) The fictional character's abilities are to be taken as the average, as known by every who knows of the character.
- The energy limit may reduce the abilities of the character; however, those abilities are still there, albeit in a reduced form. If I turn into Superman, then I still can't lift the Empire State Building, but I can still fly, juggle anvils, and travel through space. (I just have to avoid anything that glows green, and krypton gas).

The second caveat should take care of balance (though my ability to swiftly /change/ my power set is incredibly useful - even there, the requirement that ten thousand people must know of the character limits a number of abuses (though, with sufficient planning time, I can probably get an arbitrary character published and widely read)). As far as creative talent goes, such a power multi-set will reward creativity; it can certainly be used for good or evil (I could be Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader); and I imagine that it will be most entertaining to watch.

***** It depends on whether the reviewers judges the choice of power based on the 4 criteria you had given or whether something else plays in. Criteria 1 is very specific in that raw munchkinery cap is only defined for a world without supers.

I was also treating the aliens as an unknown entity that bestows power rather than actual people and so didn't consider your suggestion. I would add that rather than figuring out what the aliens want I would figure out what the reviewer specifically wants to get things past him.

Aside from powers that only works by interacting with other powers and thus can go arbitrarily high in munchkinnery(such as copying, changing, stealing powers etc.) I would probably go with a power that can create permanent self-sustaining magical/superadvanced stuff, since the allows me to get around the 1 megawatt cap and constantly increase my overall power.

Edit: Similar to that would be the ability to instantly comprehend with perfect recollection the knowledge stored in any knowledge container(including paper, electronic and biological). With a little cleverness you can get the knowledge of alien technology and such. It's an interesting power in stories because it requires the character to do stuff for their power to be useful.

** Harnessing Newcomb's Paradox

Depending on the exact formulation of the scenario, if you ever find yourself talking to an Oracle who's willing to change reality based on its predictions of your decisions, it may be possible for you to extract much more than $1,001,000 dollars of value from the exchange.

After learning about the choice, resolve yourself to come back and take from the clear box if and only if you discover some important piece of information in the future. For example, perhaps you will open the clear box on Jan 1 2020 if and only if you discover that oil prices are below $X a barrel on that date, but will leave it alone forever otherwise. Then open the opaque box.

There are two possibilities:

The opaque box is empty. This implies that oil prices will not skyrocket in the next few months.

The opaque box is full. This implies oil prices will skyrocket in the next few months.

This knowledge in hand, you are hopefully able to use it to profit more than you would have from cash alone.

One problem: You might fail to open the second box for reasons that aren't related to the information you're seeking. Perhaps you're bad at following through on long-term precommitments, or maybe you die in a car accident, or maybe someone else comes across the box and takes its contents before you can. For this reason, it's probably preferable to make your commitment in terms such that if you don't follow through on it, you get the million dollars, rather than the nothing. It also might be advisable that you only ask for mostly riskless information, so you don't lose that million (or more) on your bet the market will change in a certain way.

Another problem: Surely there are better pieces of binary information to gain than whether oil prices will be high or low on a certain day, when you're talking to a minor deity. What might some of these be?

Does all this seem reasonable? Has anyone ever written about this elsewhere? Am I egregiously cheating, going outside the bounds of the scenario as it's normally considered, by supposing the boxes persist for a long duration of time? I'd like to think that I came up with this idea myself, that it works, and that it's faithful to the original scenario. But, I'm not sure, so I hope I can get good correction here if I've overlooked some obvious mistake, or it turns out I'm subconsciously cribbing this from elsewhere.
