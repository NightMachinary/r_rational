Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I started writing a worm fanfiction and posted it on SV, based on "With Friends Like these" my TheMadmanandre. My fic, "The Friendbringer" is about 27k words in.

Friendbringer is intended to be mostly rational, but if you spot inconsistencies, I'm just having fun with it tbqh.

I've also started posting sections of my Pokemon fanfic Night within. It's recursive with OoS, attempting to be canon-compliant.

I'm still following my original schedule of about 3 weeks per chapter after the first chapter is posted though.

Anyway, let me know what you think.

You can read it on SV here:

Until they are complete, I will be posting on SV and SB exclusively.

** A few days ago, I put together a model of precommitment / motivation in this essay called [[https://medium.com/@owenshen/attractor-theory-a-model-of-minds-and-motivation-e462dccbe4d0#.m7iomjqx4][Attractor Theory]].

I've found it useful for thinking about how to arrange my day, when it comes to chaining actions together and understanding how actions can affect my preferences.

**** The current write-up linked on Medium in the above post is all I have right now, alas.

If you want to talk more, I'd be happy to do so via PM or something, though.

***** Ah, I was unclear if you were inventing a new term or discussing an existing term.

On precommitment: unless I missed something it seemed like what you were actually talking about was ways of avoiding situations where precommitment would be necessary in order to avoid attractors, instead of ways of using precommitment to prevent attractors from changing preferences. Is that right? I suppose precommitment is a separate issue from attractor theory.

In general it seems very interesting but I don't know what to ask.

****** Yeah. I tend to think of the actions where you "avoid slipper slopes entirely" as precommitment because you anticipate preference change, if that clears things up.

(This is referred to as "decision instability" and "time-inconsistent preferences".)
