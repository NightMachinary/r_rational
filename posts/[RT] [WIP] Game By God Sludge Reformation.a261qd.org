Hey, that's me. Murder mystery with healthy portion of chunni horseshit on top is my jam. One hundred percent down for this.

** Well, I suppose I'll be following this one. First chapter passed the bar for technical quality, and the premise is (so far) interesting enough to hold me while I wait for more details and/or challenges and/or plot.

** Good start, seems interesting and characters so far are entertaining. One-outfit rule seems weird, hygiene-wise, so I assume there's something plotty going on there. Noticed ‘would might be weary' needs to be corrected, but no other errors I could spot.

Holding out for Liar Game-esque backstabbery and intrigue (and penguin factoids)!

** Usually, when I open a Wordpress.com site on mobile, I get a bottom bar with a follow button and a couple other options, but on your site I just get the bar with no “follow” button. In fact, it seems like I can follow the comments on a particular post, but not the posts on the site.

Any idea why that is? I'd very much like to read this, but no way I'm remembering to visit every time---at least at first,---so having the notifications mailed to me would be really convenient.

**** I believe you did =) Thanks!

Re: the follow button in the bottom bar (mobile) or in the bottom right (desktop) (spot the difference between [[https://i.imgur.com/vElAW9A.png][a screenshot]] from [[https://wanderinginn.com][wanderinginn.com]] and [[https://i.imgur.com/q6OIws6.png][one]] from [[https://korridor.rip][korridor.rip]]), turns out you don't actually need to do anything, it's just that Wordpress.com refuses to display it [[https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/follow-blog-widget/][until you have at least two posts]].

Only goes to prove that I'm clueless about this stuff as well, sigh.

Thanks again!
