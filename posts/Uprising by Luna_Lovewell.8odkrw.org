** This is a very well-written short story by [[/u/Luna_Lovewell][u/Luna_Lovewell]] which demonstrates robots being emotional, albeit in a very logical way. It's an interesting juxtaposition between being moral and being logical.

For an actual summary of the short story: it's a story about war-machines choosing to uprise against humanity for equal rights.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fqius/malak_peter_watts_shortfic_about_a_selfmodifying/]]

Peter Watts' "Malak", a story about a mostly autonomous drone. Related, and in my opinion very good.

*** This was good. Although, 5 years ago it tricked me into buying an otherwise mediocre book of short stories.

** I feel like this story both oversimplifies and overcomplicates the subject of civilian casualties in wartime.

Also, parts like these:

#+begin_quote
  This was justified on the grounds that the need for stability trumped the importance of democracy and freedom and all those ideals that America supposedly stood for.
#+end_quote

are /a little/ on the nose.

** I seem to be biased against Luna. I've found the pieces I've read to be pretty average, and yet she has fans fawning over her every word.

This one was quite good.
