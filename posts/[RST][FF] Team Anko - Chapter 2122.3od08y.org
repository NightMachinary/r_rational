  Shino has been feeding on Naruto's chakra. There will be some drama there.

Since when has Naruto cared about his teammates using his chakra?

***** I don't think Naruto cares, period. He's not feeling it, it benefits the team, and if it's used against him in a prank, it's a good prank. I don't see any conceivable way that Naruto would actually care unless it ended up being used to harm the people he cares about. Do we even know that Naruto didn't know about this? This was to sustain part of their mission in the first place.

******* The team agreed awhile ago that Naruto should carry around four canteens on his back that Shino would fill with kikai, so that they had some extra punch when it was needed, as well as a bunch of kikai pre-loaded with chakra in case one of the others needed a refill. They were pulled out during the battle against the Sound kids a few chapters ago.

What seems to be a group

Guess it was too much to hope Orochimaru didn't know about Shino's spying attempts :D Surprised Kurama hasn't started feeding him chakra from the moment he sensed the drain, but I suppose they're not really /friends/ as of this time. Still would have expected it for continued-life reasons, but could be if Naruto dies Kurama goes free from his prison rather than dying alongside his jailor.

They will never be friends.

#+end_quote

I doubt that is the case.

If the Kyuubi gave Naruto chakra whenever he needed it, there would be very little incentive for Naruto to meditate and expose himself to the Kyuubi's manipulations. Naruto is not in any immediate danger of dying, or the Kyuubi /would/ save his life with his chakra, which means there is room for the Kyuubi to use this opportunity to build more rapport with Naruto.

No, but there is opportunity for Naruto to risk his own life and force Kyuubi to help him, or threaten to do so.

***** What scenario are you envisioning where Naruto has to pull that kind of gambit for the Kyuubi to provide chakra? Have you read this story? Naruto thinks he's on friendly terms with the Kyuubi, and the Kyuubi is perfectly willing to give him chakra to ingratiate himself with his host. That's exactly why he's dangerous, because Naruto thinks they can have a partnership on equal footing, while the Kyuubi is an eldritch beast of massive knowledge, intelligence, and power.

Kurama has stated that if Naruto dies, he (Kurama) dies too, and is trapped in Hell for 100 years. Of course, Kurama isn't exactly a trustworthy source....

Of course, if Naruto dying had a positive effect on Kurama, he'd probably already have forced him to go ham on Konoha when they were child abusing him, secure in the knowledge that he'd get killed by ANBU or similar. Child-Naruto would have been much more open to manipulation. Wouldn't have been that hard. Or any number of other ways he could have allowed or forced Naruto to die.

So it's probably at least as bad as suggested, though it certainly could be worse.

** I don't really like the shorter and shorter chapters, but I enjoyed how everyone is raising the stakes with every turn.

-Orochimaru seems to be brute-forcing his way into gaining team Anko's trust. Physically forceful and taunting Naruto, playing Hinata's traumas, teasing Shino's repressed emotions and all done overtly, with complete disregard for decency. It might work...

- ...if we hadn't seen how ruthless and cold team Anko could be when they believe that they are dealing with enemies. Is Naruto really such a 'hero' that he would put his teammates at risk to save the bad guy's minions? Or is he drawing the 'heroic idiot' card and trying to play along with Orochimaru's plans? Or is Orochimaru aware of this and trying to trap the team into their act by elevating and aggravating the consequences, like with Hinata's defection?

-Why doesn't Naruto create an army of clones and just stomp out of the place? He explicitly says that he can make several thousand clones a second and maintain that rate for several tens of minutes. I'm not sure that Orochimaru has the resources to stop a 100k strong army of ninjas running away as fast as they can in the next 10 minutes.

-How far away can Shino maintain control of his swarm? If it's several hundred meters, he can maintain the oil-infused bugs as a sword of Damocles over the Sound village while team Anko makes its escape. He already has an igniter: the blazing fires he can just ram his bugs into. Heck, why hasn't the swarm burst into flames already?

-Can Orochimaru move very fast underground! If not, Shino just has to concentrate his bugs around Orochimaru and plant an explosive tag nearby. Orochimaru moves, he'll have to dive underground to evade the firestorm. The rest of the swarm disperses to avoid killing team Anko as well.

#+end_quote

These two chapters together were about the length of a standard chapter. I wanted a chapter break on the image of the giant swarm, but that left it very short, hence the second chapter.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

To save enemy ninja, no. To save civilian women and kids who happen to live in a foreign village, yes. He's also pretty confident that the fire isn't a threat with Kurama helping, and equally confident that Kurama will help.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

His limit is actually just under a thousand. The passage you're referring to, he was having the experience of being tired for the first time in his life, and was trying to find an appropriate simile -- what he came up with was "well, when I create my max number of clones I have a brief moment of tiredness from low chakra, and then my chakra refills and it goes away, so this is what it would feel like to be at that low chakra state for a long period of time".

The way I've defined it, Naruto's chakra reserves are ridiculously large, but his regeneration is immense -- orders of magnitude faster than the average ninja's. It's the primary reason he doesn't get physically tired. (Although he does still get sleepy.)

#+end_quote

He can pass orders through a chain of kikai, so with a swarm this size he can control them from miles away. Orochimaru has no problem with him leaving, but has made it clear that he will kill all of them rather than let Naruto leave before the fire is out.

What they could have proposed was "you want Naruto for his chakra, but you're willing to let us go afterwards. I'll leave the swarm, which has enough chakra for your needs, and we'll leave now." Unfortunately, Naruto had already headed off to be heroic before Shino thought of it, and Orochimaru might not have gone for it anyway. Kikai have a lifespan of a few hours and Orochimaru wouldn't be able to control them once Naruto left, so they aren't as good for his needs.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They aren't close enough to the fire.
