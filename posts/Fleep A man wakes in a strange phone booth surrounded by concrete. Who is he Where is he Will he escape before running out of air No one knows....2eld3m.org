** Interesting concept, and smooth execution. It just seems that the protagonist has a bit too much knowledge (e.g., how to calculate coordinates from coriolis deviation) for a typical guy.

*** The fact that he has weirdly relevant knowledge could be [[#s][a clue that]]

Either that, or he's just very bright. It's all mathematics, you could figure it out in a phone booth if you had a pen and paper. And imminent death has a wonderful way of focusing the mind.

... okay, and there's an element of competence porn there too. The story's no fun if he just panics. Part of the point is that the riddle is solvable - for the character, if not for the reader.

****** According to UrbanDictionary, it was coined [[http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1yw417/why_do_you_think_weve_gravitated_towards_shows/cfoga9c][here]].

Anyway, "competence porn" is /awesome/, and I very glad that [[/u/dysfunctionz]] used it in this subreddit; I probably wouldn't learned it otherwise.
