** Complaints about update frequency notwithstanding, this was a good chapter. Experimenting with battlefield tactics in a controlled setting was a neat idea.

The added length seemed a bit unfocused, though. The author will need to re-calibrate to make sure pacing is as tight as previous books.

*** I kind of wonder if she won't end up overconfident from her test; trench tactics look a lot different once the other side brings artillery and specialists of its own.

**** The army of the dead is a pretty difficult tactical problem to solve.

Line warfare against people is usually about logistics and morale, as I understand it. So, like, making it hard for your enemy to feed their soldiers, tiring out their soldiers via marching. & fortifications, and then convincing the soldiers to break formation and run away.

None of that applies to the dead. The dead have greater endurance AND numerical superiority. Barring narrative mojo, every zombie eventually has to be stabbed by a living soldier.

The fact that the dead have parity or superiority in artillery, air support, and special forces makes this a real uphill battle for the living.

***** Eh. Never retreating isn't really a point in the undead's favor.

During early WWII, the Soviets biggest disadvantage was Stalin's insistence that troops defend their positions to the last man. It means any defeat automatically turned into a massacre, even when the Soviets could have fallen back to stronger positions.

See also this fight, where the Binds sent their small army straight into a meat-grinder, even though they could have gone further with guerilla tactics and forcing the Army of Callow to pursue them.

**** I don't know, I'd be interested to try that. It'd be pretty great to not have this constantly flood the front page even if it did qualify; the fact that it doesn't just makes it worse.

*** This subreddit updates slowly enough that I don't mind people using it as an RSS.

Over posting is only a problem when it starts to push recent content off of a main page

**** this, plus I do enjoy discussing the story here, while it is only arguably rational, the worldbuilding lends itself to interesting meta-discussions that fit on this sub quite well.

*** The front page of this subreddit has posts from 11 days ago. That's significantly more than a week for a single page. In Reddit terms, that's practically dead.

If anything, this subreddit is /desperately short of content/. It baffles me that anyone would discourage someone from posting anything even remotely relevant.

If we ever get to the stage that good content is getting pushed off the front page before people get a chance to see it, you might have a point. But that's ludicrously far from where we are.

**** If that standard qualifies a subreddit as dead, then it is virtually always a mistake to subscribe to any subreddit which is not dead. Low-activity subreddits are the source of all good content on the site.

**** I think that's exceedingly uncharitable - there's just been a three month hiatus. Regardless of whether you agree with their underlying point or not, that's blatant cherry picking, when it's normally 3 (now 2) updates a week.
