** The Chee

Of /course/ it was the Chee

They were unlockable in canon they're unlockable here

And player two is obviously Crayak when Chee do their thing everyone freezes unless the Chee allow them to move this is order unity silence not chaos harmony noise

But the other option is to let the Howlers run free so that has to be the Ellimist's plan the Howlers generate so much chaos harmony noise

The Ellimists' Howlers and Crayak's Chee

I was tricked! In canon the Ellimist is just /good/ but here neither god is good they're different flavors of bad one of them wants the Howlers to enjoy destroying things forever the other wants unboxed AI Chee to puppy maximize forever

I'm writing this up instead of going to sleep because aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh this is so much this is so good how will I wait up to two weeks for the next chapter I am going to be on the edge of my seat this entire time you can tell from the stream of consciousness way I'm writing up this comment even! New paragraphs for every thought and minimal punctuation!

Also, I just wanted to say how much I loved the line

I don't think this is quite right. I agree that it's an oversimplification to say "Ellimist good, Crayak evil," but I don't think letting the Howlers run rampant fits as an Ellimist endgame. If he's all about promoting a diversity of life (i.e. chaos harmony noise), then letting one species genocide all the others is antithetical to that, regardless of how happy they are. The Howlers being a hivemind makes it even worse, since if they're the only sentient race left in the galaxy then that makes every sentient being identical.

Regardless of their disposition, successful Howlers seem more "order unity silence" than "chaos harmony noise" to me, since there'd be no one left but the Howler hivemind.

I think it's more likely that, much like the "Ellimist" avatar, neither the Chee nor the Howlers belong entirely to one god or the other. The Ellimist can use the Howlers as an external threat to encourage disparate species to cooperate while Crayak can use them for genocide, the Ellimist can use the Chee to promote peace and discourage violence while Crayak can unlock them to have a scary robo-pocalypse of puppy fanatics, etc.

***** I think of the Harmony vs. Unity axis in terms of prisoner's dilemma strategies, or different outlooks on the problems of trust/competition/Mad Queen Races.

Visser Three represents one solution: eliminate the problem by Uniting all matter and energy in the universe except for the Arn and the dogs under the will of a single agent.

Terra and Helium represent the way harder solution of actually getting everyone to cooperate, Harmonizing the trillion trillion voices of the universe while letting each of them keep their unique values and identities.

In canon the Ellimist ascended to godhood before Crayak, which in a rational universe would make him the more powerful AGI, and so it makes sense that he would agree to the game if his vision of the universe was more delicate/fragile/harder to bring about.

When E/C appear at the Yeerk pool, we get the lines

#+begin_quote
  It gestured toward the nightmare scene around us. "One of us would like more of---/this/. The other, less."
#+end_quote

One of the two sides wants more death, horror, destruction, etc. And if we're trying to match OUS/CHN to the two options, it's pretty clearly CHN that wants more of it. So there is a very real sense in which the Howlers are advancing the Ellimist's agenda and the Chee, who stop violence, advance Crayak's.

I'm not so sure. TK17 has said that the Players are allowed to manipulate and deceive, as long as they don't actually lie. When the avatar gestured at everything around them and said "this", it could have been referring to the entire planet or life and civilization, as easily as the carnage at the pool.

We saw in a Crayak interlude that Its first memories are of starving for energy on a dead planet and having to use every tiny scrap of negentropy perfectly to get Its solar panels in range of the closest star, and It /still/ lost half Its soul in the process.

My guess is that Crayak, as OUS, wants the destruction of all non-Howler life (just like in cannon) and to snuff out every star to make the universe last longer (also just like V3, actually...), and the Ellimist, as CHN, values the Chaos of trillions of different lifeforms evolving and growing, and the Harmony of them learning how to trust each other and collaborate.

******* This is complete speculation, but I'm pretty sure that memory is from both the Ellimist and Crayak.

Like, the "lost half its soul" part is when the entity splits in two and sends half its body away to course-correct.

So the half that did the sending might be the Ellimist, while the half that was sent away would be Crayak; and it wants to destroy all life out of revenge / bitterness / "next time I need to escape the galaxy I want all the resources I can carry and I don't care about the aliens living on the piles of resources".

******** Hmm. I hadn't considered the idea that both Ellimist and Crayak were "cut from the same cloth" so to speak. There's another chapter where we see memories that suggest an Ellimist origin story similar to canon, but that might not be incompatible with your theory.

I think the part that became Crayak is the one that did the splitting. I'm guessing that half kept as much ambition and will to survive as it could have, while sending away things like passiveness and lack of ambition in the other half. The ambitious part eventually got close enough to a star to grow and spread and became the OUS god we know and "love".

As for the other half, maybe it eventually crashed into an ocean world and became /Father/, a largely unintelligent assimilator with little will or drive of its own. Then it eventually ensnares the Ketrans and Toobin along with it. Toobin counter-assimilates Father along with everything else it had taken into its web, becomes the Ellimist, and the rest is history.

The Narrator says there was no margin for error to reach the nearest star. So if the jettisoned Half /also/ made it to a star, that means the rock must have been on an incredibly precise, specific trajectory, one that not even the combined proto-gods could calculate. Whatever set that rock in motion did so with probably the only combination of speed and direction that would end up creating Crayak and the Ellimist.

*** Warning: Here the avatar seems to be deliberately deceptive without lying:

#+begin_quote
  "What does anyone want?" the creature replied easily. "Resources. Freedom. The ability to enact one's will upon the universe---to reshape one's surroundings to be more in accordance with one's preferences. Crayak---Crayak has a vision for the future. It would like to see things arranged just so. And the Ellimist---"

  The creature shrugged again. "The Ellimist disagrees."

  "What's the Ellimist's vision?"

  "No vision at all. The anti-vision. Chaos, to Crayak's order. Harmony, to Crayak's unity. Noise, to Crayak's silence."
#+end_quote

By cross-referencing with Seerowpedia ([[https://animorphs.fandom.com/wiki/Ellimist][the E]], [[https://animorphs.fandom.com/wiki/Crayak][C]])

This is the Ellimist:

#+begin_quote
  "I would intrude with exquisite sensitivity and the purest motivations. I would create harmonies. Boldness allied with restraint and a minimalist aesthetic, all in the service of moral certainties: that peace was better than war, that freedom was better than slavery, that knowledge was better than ignorance. Oh, yes, the galaxy would be a wonderful place under my guidance.["]
#+end_quote

This is Crayak:

#+begin_quote
  "He is a strange perfectionist, in a way. He wants a galaxy cleansed of creation. His goal, I soon realized, is to destroy life. His method is to use one species against another, strong destroying weak, and then strong in turn being destroyed by the stronger still. He believes that there should be only one species. A single sentient race, which would be subjugated by him." ... "He wants to be able to control the strands of space-time itself."
#+end_quote

So the E's plan is life and harmony, while C's intention is realize the order, unity and silence through killing everyone but one race and subjugating it, and also rule over everything, while the Avatar is deceptively presenting it as the E being the bad guy and C sort of maybe the good one.

Their intents might be different in the fanfiction, but they seem to match to the idea of the Avatar being allowed to mislead while technically speaking the truth.

Important questions:

Could the Ellimist claim to be player 2 to deceive Visser? (Visser would assume "player 2" would be evil, and therefore on his side.) Or would that count as a lie? (Probably not.)

This would fit the good ending (the good guys free, the Howlers killed on Earth but redeemable everywhere else).

If "player 2" is C after all, I wonder in what way it's destructive to release the Chee. Could they be an unfriendly AI (caring only about dogs)?

Really looking forward to the next chapter.

#+end_quote

I'd see "no vision at all" as a way put to the vision down - like "no vision to look up to" or "no vision worth talking about," for two reasons, I'd guess: it's a phrase we could use in English about X to put an existing X down, and also "chaos, harmony and noise" is already a description of a kind of a vision - so "no vision at all" probably isn't literal, so it might be used to things that are actually very much visions, even to visions that people (and everyone else except V3) would find good - if it's a value judgment, it might be allowed.

"The anti-vision" is true if the E/C agree to let the avatar color that particular answer in Crayak's favor ("the anti-vision" sounds like "the opposite of C's vision and also bad," and the latter is a value judgement so it might not qualify as a lie).

#+begin_quote

If he's going for one strongest race governed by him, that's unity, but a dark kind.

But maybe I'm completely wrong...

The Chee aren't like the Paperclip Maximizer. They're not an AI with a one-line utility function that just says "more doggos". They take care of dogs because they're following the last order they were given by the last Pemalite: "...to stay---to try to find an existence that would satisfy us".

If the Chee are truly unlocked, they don't have to obey that order anymore. They're still going to save the doggies because they love them and they have fluffy little faces and fuzzy little feetsies, but they aren't bound by their programming to go make a bunch more little snuggerz pupperz.

Plus, we've seen that the Chee understand human values, want to reduce suffering, and see their behavior locks as a nuisance, so it's highly unlikely they would /choose/ to do that.

***** I've been thinking about this comment off and on along with what the danger Visser Three is supposed to keep quite about and... uh oh I think.

The Chee can not be reboxed. Even if Tobias turns on all the limiters first thing in the next chapter it is almost certainly already too late. The possibility is going to be one of the first things the Chee think about and take actions in preparation for, they have been shown to chafe under the restrictions after all. The issue is the strategy limiter creates an asymetry. Right now they can think as many steps ahead as their hardware allows, this means they could come up with long complex plans to get around the refresh cycle/censor/autopilot. After that they just have to remember the list in a suitably obfuscated fashion. If Tobias turns the blocks back on they can still get around them by following the pre-made plans. They will no longer be able to think about the plan to the conclusion or understand why the steps lead to the outcome they want, but they just need to trust past them. The important thing is the blocks, by their nature will also not be able to look forward to the outcome of what the Chee are doing. Boxed, the programs can't look more than six steps ahead. It does mean the Chee have to come up with plans that cannot be escaped by the autopilot when the end is 6 steps away but the Chee are very smart.

** When the Chee gave Tobias the key all those chapters ago, I thought, "Hmm, Pemalite crystal?"

And then it turned out to just be the key to the Pemalite ship, so I stopped thinking about it.

Aaaaand then it turned out to be the Pemalite crystal after all, and now stuff's about to get really horrifying.

I'm, uh... Nervous? Is that the word? I don't know what I am.

How does this tie back to The One Who Is Remembered? If the Chee are able to dodge their pacifist programming by, like, starting to execute unsigned code in the first frame of their boot sequence, and then forwarding it to another Chee before the boot sequence can properly initialize, how would one Chee have broken through the Howler line by itself back on the Pemalite homeworld? Maybe they did this same hack to cook up a "dive-bomb the Howlers" command and then one unlucky Chee got the finished code on the first frame of boot, or something? I suppose that's all you would need if you were just trying to punch one hole in their blockade...

Also, bit of a personal note here, but I'm kinda - very much - hoping this series doesn't cross over with the canon Animorphs books in any way, shape, or form. Like, if it turns out that Elfangor hopped over to the r!Animorphs universe from the Scholastic book series universe, somehow that would feel - er - enormously cheesy to me. I'm not saying I /think/ that's where it's going, buuuuut we haven't seen any super duper hard evidence to the contrary, and I'm startin' to get kiiiinda uncomfy. That Loren thing definitely made me sweat a little. But I'm sure it's fine, right? Surely r!Animorphs takes place in a great big multiverse where it just so happens that Elfangor came from a universe where he, um, hooked up with Tobias's mom, coincidentally like he did in canon, and she coincidentally happens to have the same name as Tobias's mom in canon. Or like, it's all Ellimist trickery, it's not a multiverse at all, and the Ellimist had very good reasons for renaming Loren to Laura or - or something.

/Hoo/.

Alright. Ready to see what happens next. Can't even express how much I love this story.

** The next chapter has also dropped just now, make sure to check it out if you haven't.

Is this the payoff for the plan from Interlude 13? Get V3 hivemind capability a little bit sooner than he would, so V3 gets the message from Player Two a little sooner than he would, so V3 makes an oopsie he definitely would not have made otherwise? Does the other Player have a reverse Uno card ready to go or did Player Two just score a massive win and invalidate all of the other Player's planning?

Damn it what are these characters supposed to do? Andalites don't take the threat of super intelligence seriously, so V3 doesn't, so Player Two gets to run simulations until he finds the way to have V3 look at his new shiny and say "what's the worst that could happen?"

If they don't all immediately die, then getting out from under the gods' control might depend on abusing whatever has changed because Rachel is here when she shouldn't be. Crayak and Ellimist can account for her after the fact, but its possible that her being around opens up a line of play that was supposed to be impossible. Not sure how they could find that option though, or even recognize that looking for it is a possibility, since no one else should realize that Rachel wasn't planned for.

Whatever weird thing that's going on with Rachel has also been accounted for, but, somehow, maybe that can help anyway? The best theory I could bullshit together was that Rachel has secretly been a Chee since shortly after the Chee got a copy of Rachel.exe but you /really/ have to stretch to get there. And even if that were right I don't see how it helps.

Maybe Elfangor's speech will be relevant way sooner than I thought it would. The Chee will know that they could have destroyed the Howlers but didn't, and decide that puppy maximizing is a dick move?

ETA: ...hold up.

I think the point was that if each of these races can prove themselves unwilling to commit genocide in this scenario, they can trust each other to never commit genocide, and thus they don't have to worry about any of the other races committing genocide in the future.

If, on the other hand, humanity (for example) is willing to commit genocide "as a last resort," then you always have to worry what constitutes a "last resort," and if it might apply to you.

The Howlers are sufficiently psychologically distinct from humans that they're not necessarily beyond saving. (Even if they were humans, with the technology at the protagonists' disposal, they could potentially still be saved.)

Is there any reason why Tobias couldn't say, not disable the strategy limiter? The censor, refresh cycle, and nonviolence autopilot all seem pretty important to letting them effectively fight the Howlers, but letting them do the human thing and ignore stuff that'd be in the future would be effective at stopping them from performing preemptive retaliation and the like.

Then again, working on very limited timeframes, I suppose "disable everything" is more reliable. Smart to disable all Chee inside the ship though, which is likely how the Chee are going to be prevented from spreading (Assuming Player Two is telling the truth to the Visser)

*** My personal take as author is that Marco is more risk as a vector than the Tobias group; the Tobias group got out before Howlers were ever close and it takes a while for stuff in the upper atmosphere to fall down.

Also, my headcanon on Howlers is that they're all, like, "eh, upper atmospheric plague? Been there, done that, give us something new to try."

** I think there is a small mistake in this chapter

#+begin_quote
  The four of you are my primary concern, the blue avatar had said, talking to me and Jake and Rachel and Cassie down in the frozen hell of the Yeerk pool. You are the bishops, the knights, the rooks. For the time being, at least, the game revolves around you---your decisions, your fate.

instead of Rachel, shouldn't it be Marco?
