** Now that I think about it, it kinda makes sense that Cat and Vivienne are no longer Named.

I always kinda took being Named to mean that you help a conviction in something that would not ever change.\\
Basically, I thought they needed to be insane over something really specific to their names that they could never compromise over.

And basically the whole of Vol 4 was Cat learning to compromise.

I do realize that this probably has some holes to it, but I like it.

*** The way I see it, a name is not just something gods grant some people. It doesn't define you, you define it. It's a reflection of what you are, at your very core.

Vivienne saw that she was no longer acting as a Thief, no longer thinking as a Thief. She changed and the name no longer suited her. In the same vein, Cat became a queen and broke away from the Black Knight. She is no longer a his Squire, or anyone else. Be it in title, in actions or in personality.

They have the potential for a new name and will probably awaken one, specially now that Callow is free and they are from there. I just worry there is not that much of the story left to tell those tales properly.

** I didn't really buy that there was a significant risk of Procer, who are quite familiar with the Black Queen, throwing 7,000 cavalry at her. Seems like it would be standard procedure to not engage powerful Named without heroic assistance - any army doing otherwise wouldn't last long. I'd expect that this army in particular would be informed to not assault the Black Queen specifically, unless they have heroic assistance.

You see the Black Queen, you turn around, you go grab Pilgrim and Saint to deal with her and then you proceed from there. This may well be what happens but the will they/wont they tension (and subsequent Cat's a badass vibe) didn't really connect for me.

****** Cat's well being, as far as she was concerned, was not in any realistic doubt; she may not be able to take on 7,000 horse but that's not the same as her realistically being unable to retreat if need be. If you're saying that it's normal to feel doubt because it's hard to think clearly when 7,000 horse are running at you then sure. That doesn't create any tension though for the reader who can look at the situation more dispassionately and see that the horse are going to stop unless their commander is holding the idiot ball.

Sure, but this was a non magical named getting hit by an arrow. Apart from Cat being on a whole other tier (and Procer along with very soldier in their army /knowing/ this) and able to drop lakes on armies still as far as they know, there is a big difference between a zero risk pot shot with an arrow and the 'likely sending 7000 cavalry to their death' gambit.

Do you think the Proceran army would have informed all their officers of note of the Black Queens capabilities? Do you think charging the Black Queen without heroic assistance would be an approved course of action or one that anyone informed of her capabilities would do?

We had a discussion about this a few chapters ago, about enemy leaders thinking her reputation is hyperbole. I think that should happen a lot less often than it does, if we're assuming competent commanders in at least most of those militaries.

****** If i'm going to work from the baseline that the PGtE world is internally coherent then i can only presume that this was due to the soldiers charging the Black Queen being from the Dominion and thus the commanding officer didn't know what she was capable of. If you know someone can drop lakes on armies (afaik the fact she (probably) cannot do this anymore is not known to any of her potential enemies) you do not charge them unless you're holding the Idiot Ball.

***** It's not like the bulk of the cavalry and officers could recognize her at that distance. Especially when you're busy keeping yourself on your charging horse and have your vision restricted by a helmet.

Source:

- I did some archery in college, so I know how hard it is to see details even at 50 meters. 500 meters away? Even with my spectacles on, a car looks like a toy. No way to recognize any details.
- Rode motorcycles in high school (with helmet). There's really no leeway to pay attention to extraneous stuff. Even though it wasn't a full face helmet, the view was restrictive enough. Keeping balanced on a smooth road occupied much of my attention.

******* It's still not easy to see (from 500 meters our) when your field of vision is restricted by your helmet and your attention is occupied by staying on your horse and keeping it from stumbling over rough ground. For officers, it's even worse - they have to make sure their men are following them and keeping in formation.

********* I still think that most reasonable people would interpret what they see as a vulture or some large bird and forget about it. At least until they get closer and have some reason to look again. But at that time, would Zombie's wings still be visible?

And don't forget that they are cavalry in formation. So only the front row have any kind of vision. Furthermore, you can't easily stop a formation, even if you are the ranking officer.

***** The question was never "will Cat be able to turn back this cavalry charge?". It was "What's her plan to turn back this cavalry charge, and how does it showcase who she is and how she's grown?"

​

In this case, the answer was "play into the narrative - not the one the world's watching, the one that gives weight to Names and lets a Callowan orphan draw a sword from a stone, but the one that's playing out in the heads of every horseman charging right now."

​

Cat is no longer the underdog, the one that has to *prove* she's scary. She's moving too fast for the slow course of Fate, out of the grooves worn by her predecessors. Instead, she's using the stories in the minds of her enemies and allies, laying down new cultural precedent through trickery.

*** She just dropped out of the sky during their charge. The question was not whether they would stop, but whether they would notice her fast enough and notify superiors in time to stop. 30 seconds prior, they were charging in to cause a rout, so stopping on a dime wasn't exactly a thing they could do.
