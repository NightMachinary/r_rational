*Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*

This is a discussion of the themes and questions concerning the *Chapter 10: Levels of Description, and Computer Systems* and its dialogue, *Ant Fugue*.

*Layers and Layers*

In this chapter, Hofstadter is explaining a very basic idea with multiple examples. Every system has multiple levels from which one can understand, or use, the system with different perspectives. Cognitive Science describes [[http://blog.shakirm.com/2013/04/marrs-levels-of-analysis/][Marr's Level of Analysis]] where complex systems are described using three levels.

- The Computational Level is the goal or purpose of the system. Sometimes it can describe the behavior or actions of the system when no goal can be observed.

- The Algorithmic Level is how the system attempts to reach the goal or how it carries out its function/behavior.

- The Implementation Level is the physical construct of the system or how is the system physically created.

Marr's Level of Analysis is about how complex systems can be simplified to better understand how the system works without limiting oneself to a single aspect/level of the system.

......

*Fundamental Level*

All of this talk about levels brings up an interesting point. No matter what we do or how many levels we view reality from above, everything is reducible to the basic interactions between quarks. Reality only has one level, and all other levels are purely a product of your brain in an attempt to extract the most useful information quickly. Yes, viewing reality from multiple levels is useful, but do the ‘extra' levels have any meaning outside of your mind? Can you say that a system has multiple levels if there is no one around to use the system or understand the multiple levels?

What do you think is the relationship between Zen and multiple levels?

......

*Dialogue*

Because I had a lot of trouble reading the drawing (it's not shown very well on my computer), I'll describe it here for anyone with the same problem. It's simply the word MU with M composed of the word ‘holism' with its letters further composed by the word ‘reductionism' and with U composed by the word ‘reductionism' with its letters further composed by the word ‘holism'. Also if you can see it at a small enough resolution, you'll see that all of the smallest letters are further composed of MU. Here's a link to the [[http://i.imgur.com/vAZi1Zt.png][image]] thoughtfully provided by [[/u/markus1189]].

What is the definition of ‘holism' and ‘reductionism', and how do their meanings relate to each other and MU? (I know that this is answered in the dialogue, but I feel this question is important enough that everyone should try answering it in their own words to grasp the connections between the concepts.)

Reductionism as applied to the ant colonies seem to result in explaining Aunt Hillary as a consequence of statistical trends, but holism explains Aunt Hillary as the sum of all of her ants. How can the concept of Mu be related, if at all, to Aunt Hillary and the reductionism/holism viewpoints?

How does this dialogue can be related to the MU drawing and the musical concepts Hofstadter brings up?

I have a marvelous explanation of how the *Prelude* relates to the *Ant Fugue* and all of the musical concepts involved, but unfortunately, this margin is too narrow to contain it.

** Sorry that this post is late today. I completely forgot about it yesterday and when I woke up this morning, I realized my mistake.

/bangs head against desk/

This post is pretty short today, because I was rushed and the chapter was pretty basic with mostly examples of the concept that Hofstadter is trying to illustrate. There was a lot I could have gone into in the /Ant Fugue/, but most of them are related to music which is something I don't know very much about, so I decided to just make a little joke about it in the style of Fermat's Last Theorem in the hopes that people will think of them for me in the comments.

** Glad [[/u/xamueljones]] could make it, I kind of was a little worried :) Thanks.

Clearly we need books with /a lot/ of margin :P

I did the reading of the definition a few days back, this is what I kept in mind, anyone correct me if I am wrong:

- reductionism =->= *everything* can be explained by the parts and their sum
- holism =->= the whole is *more* than the sum of the parts
- MU =->= who says that there are only these two, who says that only one is possible, or even that one has to be

1. On p. 279, did you notice the intentional typo in the book? I only discovered that one by accident and was amused because it shows how flexible our brain is when reading text, which fits the paragraph.
2. When reading the section about the OS cushioning the user, I think our brain does almost the same, i.e. did you THINK about opening a bottle the last time? The same goes for many routine tasks that the brain does without you having to consciously thinking about it. You don't have to think about opening a bottle on the lowest level: grip the cap, squeeze hard with your fingers to not lose grip, now rotate in the right direction until open, ...

1. "Prelude... Ant Fugue" -> Prelude and Fugue
2. I think I got most of the music references w.r.t. the dialog like organ point, fermata, stretto etc but I have not really a clue how they sound in the actual music. Any recommendations for e.g. videos? [[/u/rspeer]] had some good ones for previous chapters maybe this one too?

*** Sorry that I missed the last discussion.

I think that these dialogues are meant to evoke the Well-Tempered Clavier. The first prelude and fugue in the WTC (BWV 846), which is pretty well-known, fits really well. Toward the end of the prelude, there is a pedal point that takes a very long time to resolve. Once it does, it resolves onto a chord that is held somewhat longer (a fermata), and then proceeds (attacca) to the fugue.

Here's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMrqGRNx20][book 1 of the Well-Tempered Clavier]] in one video (with no visuals except a still image of the pianist). This is over two hours of music, but hey, it's really good. Even if you just listen to the first two preludes and fugues, it's already worth it.

The pedal point I'm talking about is from 1:27 to 1:57.

Minds are about information, so yes. [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6738][Viewing reality from a "more abstract" level just means making only slightly worse predictions using dramatically less information.]] A successful causal model still approximates the real world, even when you look away from it. If it didn't, it would be useless when you /were/ looking at it.

** Okay, someone help me out here. I would swear that at some point the book mentions a "pedal point", where the melody is supported by a single bass note for a long time, and that in a nearby dialogue, Achilles just says "Gee!" over and over for a long time. This would be a great match for the first prelude (in C major) in the WTC, which has a pedal point consisting of G over and over. Where is that in the dialogues?

If you zoom in on the 'c' in reductionism inside the 'U' you can read the small 'mu's
