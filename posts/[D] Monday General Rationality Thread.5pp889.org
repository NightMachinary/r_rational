Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Just a quick reminder that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5z/on_the_importance_of_less_wrong_or_another_single/][LessWrong]] is trying to become more of a central place for rationalists.

I've been posting more things there, and it's been pretty good so far. If you're interested, we're always happy to have more voices joining in.

*** Thanks, that's good to know because I basically abandoned the place a long time ago and at some point it felt like everyone gave up on the "rationalist hub" idea after it was suggested. It it works out, I'd be kinda proud of the rationalists at beating incentives related to group dynamics.

But I'd still like to know why that solution is better than people gathering at [[/r/slatestarcodex]] for example.

**** Okay, once I wrote that, I started seriously thinking about this. Here are some of my thoughts:

- Less Wrong is a really old site that hasn't been maintained a lot. Reddit is also old, but it's actively maintained and new features are added once in a while. People like things that are new and fresh. We may believe we as rationalists don't care about things such as these, but I believe people actually care - I hate to admit it, but at least I do.

- When I still used Less Wrong to some extent, there were some trolls and mass-downvoters. Whereas in [[/r/slatestarcodex]] there are active mods and even Scott frequently goes there and aforementioned phenomena either don't exist on the subreddit or they don't bother me me so much that I would have paid attention to them. Also, because of reddit's voting algorithms, it's not possible to downvote with multiple accounts on reddit and you can't just make new accounts and troll on [[/r/slatestarcodex]] because you have to gather some karma first. There have been some stunts on Less Wrong where one person has upvoted his own thread 20+ times with multiple accounts.

- I really really doubt any of the big writers like Scott, Luke, Alicorn, Yudkowsky etc. are going back there.

- There's a lot of historical baggage that goes with Less Wrong. Some negative things that come to my mind are: some amount of drama, Roko's Basilisk and all those other thought experiments about torture and the trolls and mass downvoters I mentioned earlier. It also centers heavily around CFAR, MIRI and Yudkowsky+Sequences in particular and there are lots of people in the rationalist community that aren't particularly obsessed with those. My personal opinion? I admire Yudkowsky tremendously for kickstarting the rationalist movement with them, but I don't think the Sequences are up to the kind of scholarly and scientific standards the community deserves nowadays - which doesn't mean they aren't and haven't been ridiculously useful.

I think they're at least trying to update some of the things you mentioned, if that helps a little.

- Updating the code base
- Removed downvotes in the interim
- I've seen increased activity from CFAR in writing things (e.g. Anna Salamon), and it at least looks like they'll continue to churn out content in the near future.

I agree that LW has lots of historical baggage and all your concerns are valid. Just thought you'd like to know that some effort has been in place to try and update things.

Without calling on him when he doesn't want to be called upon, there's at least one user on this sub whose username indicates either a liking for antisemitic humor or, alongside his flair, possible white-nationalist views.

I've never done anything to ban him, because he hasn't broken the rules of the subreddit. That's not to say I /wouldn't/ penalize him if he deliberately broke the political detente on this sub and tried to use it as a propaganda platform, but he has yet to do any such thing.

Serious question as the growing trend towards legitimizing the use of physical violence against people who speak or express *thoughtcrime* is disturbing, more-so disturbing to see from a respected peer.

Note: please do not misunderstand me, neo-nazi's or the like are about as hateful and pitiably wrong as they can be, they are a great example of what everyone should dislike, but to put it politely, that does not excuse initiating violence in anything short of clearly preemptive self-defense.

There are others points to consider as well: when you are agreeing to reduce the conflict to the crude physical level, you're basically also agreeing that the winner will be not the side that's more clever with its rhetorics, arguments, and legal tools of fight, but the one that's just the fittest in the environment of physical confrontations.

******** Congratulations: You are making pronouncements about my [[#s][enduring nature of my personal character based on a rather limited data set]], specifically you determine I'm unwilling to speak up against evil when I call you, a mod here, for what seems to be [[#s][advocating the initiation of violence against an undesirable political faction]] . .

"Fighting a group", and random assault without follow through, seem two very different things, but that may just be my distaste for useless violence.

I'm going to assume we disagree on where society is in the sliding scale between civilization and it's breakdown, and have common ideas about when violence is necessary, and maybe even when the initiation of violence is moral. I still question your lauding of a sophomoric assault, assuming your talking about the neo-nazi in DC, but I've never bought in to symbolic violence.

Just so I can try to understand your worldview:

What did you think of the size calculation in the [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][You are still crying wolf]] post on ssc?

What is your definition of a fascist? /Edit: well said Jiro/

I'm of the one of the target descents too, but it's been at least three generations since my family was practicing Jewish, so dunno if I consider my ass on the line. I generally find both the "kill the jews/blacks" and the "kill whitey" tribes equally below contempt and generally not a problem.

Which "size calculation"? I also think the post is disingenuous, since it seems to assume that "racism", "homophobia", and "fascism" are equivalent charges. They're not. Maybe Trump likes black people, insofar as he ever has a consistent opinion or interest about anything but money. I know he's got Jews married into his family, and I know he waved that LGBT flag. He's still a fascist, in the same way that Mussolini was a fascist even though he didn't give a shit about Jews.

For definitions, we're going to use Wikipedia, because it's easy to reach, and if you don't like something, you can reach for primary sources.

  Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism
#+end_quote

The page continues:

#+begin_quote
  Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[7] Such a state is led by a strong leader---such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party---to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[7] Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.[8][9][10][11] Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.[12]
#+end_quote

Now we've got a checklist of features. Let's see how many fit:

- Strong leader/cult of leadership? Check.

- Views war and imperialism as good for the nation? Check, but also shared with most other nationalist and imperialist ideologies.

- One-party state? /Very/ check: the Democratic Party have been locked out of effective power since the Reagan years. Now, I'll be the first to say the Democrats suck, but they don't suck in such a unique, incomparable-to-the-Republicans way that a sane, fair political system is /expected/ to institute one-party hegemony over a period of decades.

- Autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies? A platform point. Very check.

- Totalitarian? Increasingly and worryingly authoritarian, as has been the "bipartisan" consensus during these decades of Republican hegemony. Call it half a check.

- Complete mobilization of society? Actually, this is the strongest break between Republicanism, Trumpism, and traditional fascism. The Trumpist base seem to like this idea, but Trump himself and the Republican Party seem to prefer a /de/mobilized population who quietly serve the capitalists at the top. I'm gonna call it no check at all, yet.

So, out of six possible points for features of fascism, we seem to be able to wrack up 4.5/6.

#+begin_quote
  I generally find both the "kill the jews/blacks" and the "kill whitey" tribes equally below contempt and generally not a problem.
#+end_quote

/What/ "kill whitey tribe"? I've only ever heard about these people on the internet, so I'm dubious that they exist /at all/ and aren't just a paper tiger of propaganda. The Movement for Black Lives Platform did not call for killing white people: the worst you can say about it is that it said the wrong things about Zionism, which is another topic entirely.

Now, for the case of "kill the Jews/blacks", yeah, those guys are small-but-significant in numbers, and Richard Spencer is one of them. Punching him is /how/ you keep his tribe small in numbers. However, the general kind of fascism you need to lay an eventual base for "kill the Jews/blacks"? 4.5/6 points checked.

Remember, the Germans in the 1930s did not actually expect Hitler to kill all the Jews. They may have hated Jews, sure, but the Final Solution was kept secret because they expected even good Germans to balk at its extremity. Allied soldiers heard about the death camps, and considered it to be vicious anti-German propaganda, /right up until they liberated those camps/.

That refusal to believe the evidence, because the conclusion was just too wild to be true, was /precisely how/ the Final Solution happened. A political Refuge In Audacity.

Do we know /precisely/ what the new fascist government of America is going to do? No, we don't. But based on the patterns they match, including the ones they call up themselves ("Drain the swamp" is taken directly from Mussolini), we can expect horrendous, historic evil.

Of course their disadvantage counts, and as long as we're playing the tribalism game, I should note that up until Trump, I was /ecstatic/ about the way the Rust Belt's famous "white working class" was voting. You'll remember that everywhere those guys determined the outcome of the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders won. That was the first time I felt like class consciousness and a sense of common material interests were coming to the fore in the United States.

Hell, it was the first time I felt like I could come out of the closest as a Jewish socialist from Brooklyn without getting labeled un-American.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That's quite right. I don't believe in a "basket of deplorables". Fascism operates off of fear, uncertainty, and chaos. This means that, /especially/ in a two-party system, most of the people voting for the fascist /are not themselves ideological fascists/.

If someone voted for Trump out of fear that Clinton was horrible, well, she /was/ horrible. We can talk. If someone voted for Trump because, out of two candidates who spoke to their economic situation, he alone was on the general-election ballot, well, /we can talk/. Actually, if someone voted for Trump because they wanted him to "take our jobs back from immigrants", /maybe/ we can talk, /if/ they're not actually so self-sabotaging that they can't be persuaded to support a broad working-class program.

There's one place I draw the line to stop talking, though not yet to start fighting. That's the hypocrites: the ones caught up in the tribal cult who think that it's /fine/ for /Trump/ to support universal health-care or industrial, but that exactly the same things coming from /Democrats/ were heretical, filthy communism. I can't talk to those people because they're only thinking about tribal affiliation, not policy. They don't even /really/ want the industrial policy or health-care. What they /really/ want is the flag-waving and military parades. I'm not terminally interested in those things. I'm terminally interested in industrial policy, health-care, minimum wage rises, breaking up big business, etc.

Now, problem is, I do think a good quarter or third of the total population falls in that last bucket. There really do seem to be a huge number of people who are so far gone with their nationalist tribalism (and that can go ahead and include the nationalist tribalism of the San Francisco professional class and bourgeoisie) that when they say "politics", they just mean a Red Tribe against a Blue Tribe. They don't actually think of /issues/ at all anymore. Everything is symbolic, nothing is material, and if Vladimir Putin personally enslaved American workers as household servants, it depends more whether he's waving a hammer-and-sickle or a Russian Orthodox cross when he does it. That's my impression of, for instance, the Slate Star Codex commenter crowd, and /they scare the shit out of me almost as much as Nazis do/. Because they're the proto-Nazi, the one who's looking away from the real-world human suffering and putting all his attention on that big, awesome streaming banner and these spiffy uniforms. This is [[/r/rational]]: we /ought/ to find an all-style, no-substance ideology anathema here.

Then there's the place I draw the line for preemptive violence. That's open, knowing, self-aware fascism. Not being deceived. Not voting one way when you could have gone the other out of misguided fear, or hope. That's the line: when you consider epistemic and moral truth to be determined by membership in your tribe, thus setting up life in general as a war for supremacy between those tribes, then you are fash, and you should get bashed.

Is one of /the/ major complaints about the blue tribe. While the red tribe (not the leadership) has recently shown a willingness to at least tolerate new ideas like marijuana-legalization, and has dropped a lot their religious overtones.

From where I'm setting it looks a lot like the red tribe has gotten a lot less tribalistic, and the blue tribe a lot more.

I seriously think that if the Red Tribe is so utterly panicked that /everyone who's not Red Tribe is trying to destroy them/, then they've frankly fallen for fascist propaganda. Or just plain gone crazy. Again, that is in no way grounds for violence against generically Red Tribe people, but luckily, we don't /actually have/ any such violence. On the other hand, it makes the Red Tribe sound like, let's call it, Palestinians: "everyone is holding us down, that's why we have to kill them all!"

Instead we've got journalists being charged with felonies because they happened to be covering protesters during a protest and the cops don't like the protesters. Meanwhile, what was it, eight states are passing laws to criminalize or financially penalize nonviolent civil disobedience.

I mean, maybe you think protest is a "Blue Tribe thing", but doesn't it seem awful dangerous for common ground to you to /criminalize things/ for being "Blue Tribe things"? That's overtly saying: "if you get too Blue, we will arrest you, charge you with a felony, and put you in jail for years at a time", all for doing something that we all agreed was a necessary part of democracy before (remember, civil disobedience has been used by nonviolent segregationists in the South). That's /actual state violence/ by Red Party legislatures against what they're assuming will be Blue Tribe people, actually deliberately destroying common ground in the name of having your tribe exterminate the other tribe from public life.

But tell me again how my reddit flair is making it impossible for fellow Americans to coexist.

It's really weird that you say "not the leadership". This makes it come off that your claim is, "the red tribe's voter base has shown a willingness to tolerate legalizing marijuana and secularism, but their actual elected officials are still entirely committed to not doing those things."

Yes, which is why it's very important that the Red Tribe /turn on their leaders/, right now, and not on their fellow Americans who have different tribal markers but are actually fellow proletarians. That doesn't mean voting for Democrats, it means joining the demonstrations right now, joining the general strikes we're trying to build, and helping us try to mount a revolution against the whole fucking system that's keeping America on track to Third World living conditions in the richest country on the planet.

In the specific case of punching Richard Spencer, yes, I can say that honestly. Even when I've been at demos with Antifa blocs, they don't get violent unless leftist demonstrators are attacked first.

No, as far as I can tell, people who don't like affirmative action are not fascist. Period. Fascism is a fairly specific thing, in which society's problems are uniformly cast in terms of a war or conflict between racial, ethnic, or national groups (roughly). If you don't conceive of most issues in terms of race war, you're very likely not a fascist. If I disagree with you about politics, you're very likely still not a fascist. There are vast, vast domains of views that aren't going to get any talk of violence from me, because they don't involve literally murdering me.

For my Pokemon story, I've had some great input from people online on structuring my story. [[/u/InfernoVulpix]], [[/u/DaystarEld]], and [[/u/AlexanderWales]], and a few others whom I don't know their reddit names, have been invaluable to me. Anyway, here's some rambling on the story.

I realized that up to now, I've written the story entirely in 3rd-person limited. It seems easier to write, and it allows me to take a modestly dispassionate voice in the story. My target audience for the writing is going to be the YA when it comes to plotline and diction. Throughout the story, occasionally sections of it will be from the 3rd-person perspective of individuals not my MC, and once in a while, a chapter or section may be First person. The trick will be to handle the perspective changes without being jarring to the readers.

As of this post there are ~6 pages of prose, ~4k words, ~15 pages of worldbuilding, and a LOT in my head I write down as I remember.

Let's talk MarI/O a bit, and Neural Networks. This is my claim which I am not backing up with any evidence whatsoever: Creation of GAI will be from some advance form of the Artificial Neural Network. What is a Neural Network, and how do they work? This is a high-level overview intended to help you understand one facet of them and how they work. If I miss any key terms, feel free to comment and let me know.

One thing which is really cool, is how Neural Networks are able to be run on GPU's. Have you ever wondered why GPU's are better than Processors at running them? This is because GPU's have two advantages in particular: floating point calculation and Matrix math. GPU's can calculate floating point numbers in matrices very, very fast, and so running and training a NN is much faster on the GPU, because ANN's use Matrices and floating points.

Neurons are either active, or inactive. Firing or not firing. This is influenced by something I call its Activation Level- what internal value (usually a float) must the Neuron be in order to fire. An empty ANN may fill in all neurons with .5's, and set the activation level to .75.

At its base form, a Neuron has two ways of interfacing with the network as a whole: Inputs, and Outputs. Let's say we have 3 neurons, A, B, and C. Connected like so: A->B->C. If A is firing, then it sends that signal to B. Often, there is also a "Bias" which B has on A's connection, which can dampen or amplify the power of A, so if B doesn't care about A's input, it won't fire because of it. If B fires, then it sends it to C, which C then biases B's input similarly.

Any neuron can connect with any other neuron, and sometimes they're even divided into " Discreet Layers" That's what Deep Neural Networks means- they have different types of Layers, given various biases a researcher believes will help with making the Neural Network better for their purposes. Additionally, Recurrent means that a neural Network can also loop back onto itself, so using our A-B-C example, you might get something like: B->B.

Anyway, have fun. This is a semi-continuation (from last week)[[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ob9ox/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dcj4eo4/]]]

*** I agree with the part about good English, with the caveat that some forgiveness is appropriate for speakers/writers for whom English is not their native tongue. Learning a foreign language is an admirable endeavor, but a difficult one as well. Those who choose to undertake it should be encouraged and forgiven for grammar mistakes that native speakers have no business making, to some degree. Most of the reasoning in your arguments doesn't apply to them anyway because presumably they are competent with their native tongue and have perfectly coherent thoughts using it, but fail to translating them properly to English.

That said, it can still be annoying to communicate with someone who can't properly convey their message, regardless of the reason for it. People practicing a foreign language by interacting with native speakers on the internet should try to avoid complicated topics that require extensive vocabulary, and should also try to avoid arguments and debates, since their position will be severely weakened by their less coherent framing of it, and both parties are more likely to end up angry at each other due to the lack of proper communication.

The best approach would be to, as 4chan would put it, "lurk moar". Read conversations between other native speakers to see how they write, but try not to interfere too much and annoy people until your skills grow high enough. Or maybe it's just a better approach to not do your learning in online forums because many of the posts you read are going to use bad English and you will learn bad habits from them.

***** No, but it seems I am immune. I would not regret being infected even if I wasn't immune, though.

But I imagine some people /would/, so do consider not-asking; it actually has the potential for working, I think.

**** Ok, I'll report back, after 2 days it didn't seem to have any effect but I do think it has the potential for working for others (I'm actually surprised it didn't have any effect on me)

*** Reporting back as one of those who asked you about the original post: I didn't think very hard about it afterwards, and have never experienced the described pain. It's possible that focusing on the possibility shortly before [[#s%20going%20to%20sleep][spoiler]] would cause me said pain, but I haven't really bothered to put that much effort into it to be honest.
