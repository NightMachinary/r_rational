For anyone that only follows the story only posts, you may have missed this.

Essentially, the author got into a brief discussion about Star Wars and included minor details of the setting of the story (note: zero plot elements or anything that could give away the suspense of the film). Because of this and the rules imposed on Space Battles for the opening of Star Wars, he was banned for a single day from posting. By his own admission, Mr Zoat (the author) became irrationally angry at this and decided to move his thread over to Sufficient Velocity. When he becomes unbanned later today, he has stated that he will permanently lock the current threads on Space Battles and begin migrating content to Sufficient Velocity.

Current thread here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si.25032/]]

Page of the thread where the conflict started, although the original posts have been removed: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-2109]]

Edit: to give an example of how bad the spoiler policy is, they just banned someone for mentioning that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie. When it's in the trailer and on the official poster. Yeah.


** I've visited SpaceBattles a few times recently because TVTropes recommendations pointed to some stories there, but the atmosphere felt really weird.

A moderator could show up to give a warning for a really stupid reason, for instance, write a wall of text with lots of spelling mistakes and plain out bad formatting, and everybody just rolled with it like they were used to it and that was supposed to be normal.

The discussion rules set in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][tGWP]] thread were outright stiffening; after the Star Wars hype /all/ the pages\threads acquired an advertising for the SW discussion thread; etc; etc.

I'm kinda biased in judging a classic bulletin-board forum because they've always felt too restrictive to me, but still.

*** I recently [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vf7x8/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cxniksw][spoke in defense]] of aggressive moderation for bulletin boards, so I should probably explain my seeming [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-2121#post-20295073][about-face]] in the WTR thread. Basically, I think that in this whole situation the tail is wagging the dog. The rules we make and the aggressive moderation we employ on a site like Teamliquid.net exist only in service of the community. This is why the first rule there is "[[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/tl-community/17883-tlnet-ten-commandments][THIS IS OUR HOUSE]]" and all the rules are super vague. Double standards should exist and are intentional on TL. SB would do well to follow the same ideas rather than being enslaved by their own rules. Zoat should be allowed to slightly spoil Star Wars (and note, he didn't even really spoil it) and violate rules in his thread with lesser consequences, just a warning, because he's earned the privilege. That's how these things should work!

** I liked [[/u/eagleJarl]]'s [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/20293854/][take]] on this. I've heard a lot of bad things about the mods, and although I don't post a lot of their rules seem... bad. Rules for the sake of authoritarianism or something.

Their rules on pirated content are particularly egregious. I'm definitely in favour of paying people for their work and all that, and although I'm not a big fan of the rule (being a dirty infohippie and all) I can respect it.

What I can't respect is that they claim it's purely of legal reasons and has nothing to do with their politics.

There are a lot of little things like that, that one in particular just irked me. I think [[/u/datapacrat]] also had some trouble over there.

I did. For certain content in SI, I was given infraction points, a temp-ban, and had the thread locked. In order to be allowed to keep posting the story there, I would have had to submit new chapters for moderator approval or risk perma-banning or other such penalties. I decided that it wasn't worth the additional effort required, and started back-posting the existing chapters to Questionable Questing instead.

I should note that while S.I. does contain content that can be considered adult in nature, I have consciously kept in mind a rule that any such content has to be written in a clinical, detached, and/or non-titillating fashion. "Body horror" would be a closer description than "erotica".

** I was unaware until I watched the movie that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie. If I hadn't seen the movie, you would have spoiled it for me (and I watched the movie yesterday for the first time). Banning people for this is entirely appropriate.

(And it is not, in fact, obvious from the poster that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie, just a similar looking ship.)

Also, Zoat seems not to understand the concept of a Schelling point. Banning a subset of movie references, and getting people to agree on exactly how that subset is defined, is a lot harder than banning all movie references.

*** Oh no, you know the ship appears in the movie. You don't know what context it is, what the ship is doing, who's piloting, where it's going, where it's been, why it's there or how it appears. I'm sure that spoiled the entire plot for you.
