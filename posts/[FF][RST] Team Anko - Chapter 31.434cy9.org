** Uuuuugggghhh. That was good. That was *very good*. Last few chapters felt extremely abrupt, and the transition into Anko's report to the Hokage practically gave me whiplash, but I very much enjoyed the whole experience.

It goes without saying that you have the best Orochimaru I've ever seen, period, and I doubt I'll ever find one that I like more than your's. He was a bit like [[#s][HPMoR!]] in that his arguments were so persuasive that I sometimes found myself overlooking his less-than-ethical deeds and sociopathy. He differed from him in that he (seemingly) did have a Ruthless Utilitarian ethical model that was effortless for him to follow because of his sociopathy, and he seems to be utterly devoted to pushing humanity forward and keeping it alive. Every time he casually drove a semi-truck through Team Anko's plans, just oozing that "one level higher than you" swagger, I couldn't really feel all that upset. This was true despite the fact that the part of my brain that was comparing this story to all the other pieces of fiction I've experienced was just kinda yelling that the antagonist was *not* supposed to be this utterly superior, and that clever plan-wrecking was the purview of the protagonists. For consistently achieving that sense of narrative wrongness, a solid gold star for you.

A bit disappointed to see it end here. It does make me desperately want a sequel to explore the sheer number of interesting plot threads left unresolved. I do really want to see more of Orochimaru doing his thing and actually turning out to be the hero that the world needs, to everyone's awkward realization.

Thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the chapter where they return to Konoha, but I kept staring at it, unable to figure out a better way to do it. I suppose I could have shown her kicking Cat into the wall, but that felt better as a noodle incident.

mmmm...so-so. He's actually driven completely by self-interest, but he recognizes that helping everyone /else/ stop fighting is the best way to promote a safe and non-distracting environment for himself. That's why he's got no problem killing the scientists if they fail to keep the kikai alive.

Maybe there'll be a sequel. For now, I got to the end that I wanted to get to and I'm going to take a break from it. If I do pick it up again my initial focus would be on Naruto and the Fox, but Orochimaru is so much fun to write that he'd definitely be there.

**** /Blinks/ Your intended end from the beginning was Naruto mostly succumbed to the fox and trapped in Sound while the rest of the party is home, Hinata still having the same home problems that a lot of this happened because of, and tons of outstanding plot threads?

That seems like a particularly weird target end state if you have no definite plans for a sequel in mind.

***** I might do a short thing about them at some point. My headcanon version is that:

- Jiraiya is more or less a match for Orochimaru in terms of cunning but has different priorities--he's ruthless and Konoha-uber-alles but not psychopathic. He fights with ninjutsu and seals, showing a preference for indirection.

- Tsunade is smart but not on the same level as her teammates, and lacks their ambition. She is, however, by far the most dangerous of the three in close-quarters fighting.

A fight scene with / between the three of them would be fun.

How sincere was he? Most of his arguments were well put together, but we had a certain lack of context that skewed it heavily in his favor in a lot of instances, making them SOUND very persuasive, but, if examined, you realized their foundation lies in evidence you're getting from the person trying to persuade you. Big no-no.

Does he actually like Orochimaru as much as he seems? Is he sincere about being here to help save humanity from itself? I gots to know!

** Some criticism:

A. the interaction of Anko/Reizo/Ibiki wasn't well-written. The primary issue is one of over description. You explicitly write that Reizo is Anko's girlfriend and lover and that Ibiki is her boyfriend/lover, which isn't necessary given the scene that immediately follows. You could have simply written Anko arriving in her house, Reizo and Ibiki comforting her, and the reader would have made the obvious connections.

-you write:

"Ibiki and Reizo pressed close; Anko was a tactile person, and the best reassurance they could give was simple contact and a willing ear."

Here again you overdescribe. If Reizo and Ibiki pressing close, we can assume that Anko is a tactile person; we don't have to be told that.

"Having to do those things to her own students must have torn Anko apart. She still had nightmares every couple of months about Orochimaru's training; *she always woke up screaming and lashing out*" Again this part feels extraneous.

"Reizo smiled; the laugh was a good sign. No matter how broken Anko was when she came home, once she managed to find something funny---no matter how dark or disturbing it might be---there was daylight ahead. Sometimes a long way ahead, but ahead." Maybe some people enjoy the inner narration of characters in this way, but this seems obvious. Do the readers really need that spelled out?

"Reizo looked at Ibiki with a confused frown, *silently asking if the joke was another 'ninja thing' and could he translate for the poor civilian*? He shrugged, just as mystified. Why was it funny that Shino and Hinata weren't going to be allowed to see their families?"

Again this is pretty extraneous. Just have her look at Ibiki with a puzzled frown, he shrugs, and readers get the implication.

"A moment later her eyes popped open; she looked up at his face and there were no defenses left, nothing to shield the woman inside the ninja's uniform."

I understand that the theme of this chapter here is to show Anko's emotional vulnerability but again I feel as though a better way to write this would be to be more implicit than just outright basically saying "this chapter is where I show Anko has feelings by showing her being vulnerable with her lovers".

Anyways, I've read/skimmed the fic as a whole and while I don't really feel like going through and critiquing the whole thing I will summarize by saying that I think your writing would be significantly improved by working on removing some description. On the other hand, the fic would also be improved by fleshing out some scenes (the return to Konoha, for one) more, so I'm not sure that blanket advice to streamline is a good idea.

B. This is more subjective and related to the tone of work: I personally found the introduction of the Republic annoying. If we take Naruto canon feats (even before the hilarious serial escalation of the World War arc late in manga/anime) seriously there's zero way guns are threatening to any ninja post Chunin rank. I understand that lets you dramatically escalate the fic and throw new variables into the work, but was done rather clumsily.

Some praise:

I'll echo the others here in saying that Orochimaru and Kurama were pretty well-portrayed as more intelligent than others. Their plans were well-designed with lots of contingencies and they generally stole very scene they were in.

Congrats on finishing the story, its rare that a good fanfic gets completed.

Well, I confess I didn't expect an end here. Was a good cooldown scene with Anko relating her past few weeks to friends and lovers, struggling with guilt and grief and possibly anger while she did so.

** Simply stunning, EagleJarl. I'd have gotten to this earlier, but I'm in the middle of transitioning my mobile reading to a different app, and had not yet transferred about half of the in-progress stories I've been reading.

--------------

I think I've only seen an Orichimaru pulled off that well once before, [[#s][although]]

Your version of Naruto's world seems like a fun place for a whole new level of conflict once the muggles start getting mixed in, and I can't help but wonder at what the ninja might try to keep up. Basic alliances? Unseal secrets? Unseal Bijuu? Create another "Sage of the Six Paths"-like event?

I think interactions between Kurama and the other Demon hosts would be interesting, depending on possible host/demon awareness and interaction with each other.

--------------

I sat down and wrote for a short bit. If I were to title it, I'd tentatively call it 'Showman'. I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with it, but I'll let it play out. So far, it's about a guy with a custom Tarot deck he made himself that he tells stories with. Not sure where I'm going with it, but things are already popping up(Telling the future has a price, that the main character absolutely does not want to pay.) that seem interesting. Oh, and writing is a slow process for me and I tend to get sidetracked easily, so I got that going for me, which is nice. :/

I signed up to FictionPress to post it, but I need to wait half a day.
