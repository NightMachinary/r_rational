** So it seems as if Cat's "long price" is making Akua realise that redemption is impossible to achieve, that she will never be a part of the Woe, and that no one will ever consider her a good person, yet deciding for herself to do good regardless of this anyway.

First teaching her what her life /could/ have been, how she could have a genuine group of friends around her and people admiring her, and then taking that away and showing that it was nothing but an illusion all along, /with Akua accepting this and still going through with it./

That's cruel, man.

*** I actually think that this would constitute far to mild a punishment and can actually be considered a tremndous victory for Akua. The type of psychological punishment that Akua is dealing with may bother her for a while but then like any human she will simply adapt and get on with her life. If anything it will leave her in a superior position as once Cat is convinced that she has adequately punished Akua any further interference from outside sources that seek to impose a more severe punishment or prevent Akua from working in a position of power will be opposed as an attempt to undermine the authority of the Black Queen.

Consider the perspective of someone who lost their family to a murder learning that the punishment for the perpetrator is for them to receive psychological counselling so that they can understand how their crimes will damage their social standing and to then be given a position of power where they can enjoy socializing with friends while working in a field they love. Would anyone really accept this as an adequate punishment? Doesn't it make more sense to consider this as the criminal gaming the system to escape justice and even profit from their new position?

I personally think that it is quite telling that a condemned social manipulator who had bragged that she would be capable of finding a way to avoid punishment and become a trusted subordinate has found herself in a situation where she has indeed become a trusted subordinate and the evidence demonstrating the severity of her punishment is entirely limited to assumptions on her mental state. It seems to me like Akua has simply succeeded in her manipulations and is now laughing victoriously in her mind as she marches down the path to a role as the trusted subordinate of the most powerful woman in Calernia with the only cost being the need to make the occasional display of inner turmoil. The exchange of potential emotional pain in exchange for essential immunity from further punishment and a position of tremendous power is a deal that Akua would have eagerly accepted ever since she lost to Cat.

Proponents of restorative justice advocate pretty much exactly this kind of response.

  “It is an inspired solution,” the woman who'd once been the Diabolist admiringly said. “And not one I would have considered in his place. I've always sought the elimination of waste in artefacts and rituals, it would not have occurred to me to actively pursue it instead.”
#+end_quote

Wasn't this her big innovation with Keter's Due in Liesse? So this seems straight-up false.

*** No, she re-utilized the waste that was unavoidable in her ritual. Here if I understood correctly, additional waste is generated as a way of increasing the absorption of the necromantic construct's energy.

*** On the other hand, your quote is an excellent find in terms of "actually this is about Akua's long price".

*** Think of it in terms of electricity.

Akua was a master of keeping the resistance in a circuit low. When she absolutely couldn't keep resistance low, she found a way to recycle it back into useful work--like a heat pump, using waste energy to do additional work.

Masego intentionally introduced a resistive element into the circuit to make it more resilient to limit the overall current possible in a circuit--like the ballast in a fluorescent light.

I wonder if Akua could have partnered with one of the Named healers to do more than just vent the heat created by channeling along the cold iron; since the energy is there, it would be cool to see it repurposed as a burst of healing to offset the risk of needing to get in stabbing distance of the constructs.
