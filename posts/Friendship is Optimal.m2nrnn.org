** Isn't this already well known in this group? Also, I prefer this link for this sort of content:

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1857/folder/4096/canon-compatible-optimalverse?order=rating]]

And I would like to suggest this as being thematically similar (and actually quite inspired by FiO!) but less apocalyptic and where the AI is a bit less overpowered:

*** If we never repost old classics then new members will never see them. I don't think there's anything wrong with posting a link to something like /FiO/ or /Worm/ or even /HPMoR/ once a year or so; it's not like the sub has a problem with too much activity.

*** Yeah it's a bit of a repost, but it's a good story. If any newer users see this for the first time, I strongly recommend FIO. If you like ponies, it's about ponies! If you hate ponies, it's about how ponies are a horrifying existential threat! Win-win!

*** I mean the AI being realistically overpowered is kind of the point of these kinds of tales of caution.

Giving the mortals a fighting chance through sone artificial stupidity kind of misses the point that there really isn't anything we can do after the AGI has been turned on and communicated with for the first time.

**** It's more along the lines of the productive capability of doing stuff like immediately developing nanotech when our combined science and engineering doesn't have a mechanism for doing even simple versions of the stuff. The AI in Thousand Tales is plenty smart and does outthink humans all the time, but just because it has access to massive amounts of processing and the sum total of human knowledge does not let it immediately bypass a ton of R&D and lab-based prototyping and factory construction that must take place in the macro scale.

*** Nah, I remember back in the days of LessWrong when Iceman first gave it to us to betaread. EY posted some comments about it in the google doc. At some other time he'd mentioned how he'd write the same story and how it would differ from what Iceman did.

So am pretty certain that this story is not it.

***** I don't have a link, no, but it was something to the point of how, if he'd written the same story, in Yudkowsky's version parts of the horror of the situation would be that all the "ponies" would still be aging and mortal, for no other reason than that CelestAI would be following the depiction of ponies as seen in the MLP show.

In Iceman's version, she seems to have enough leeway that she can at least make the ponies unaging and immortal.
