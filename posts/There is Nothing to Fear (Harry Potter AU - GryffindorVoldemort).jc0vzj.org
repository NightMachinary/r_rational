I'm posting this again because I've finished the "oneshots and occasional multishots" phase of this series.

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

This is mostly a For Want of a Nail-type story, with everything proceeding as expected up until the Sorting Hat is put on Tom Riddle's head and makes an observation, and an argument, that it hadn't made in canon.

Future updates will be biweekly from here on out: First, an interlude, and then the first chapter of a 15-20 chapter story.

The series can be found on Archive of Our Own [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][here]], on Sufficient Velocity [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.49249/][here]], and on Spacebattles [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/][here]]. If you're interested in conversation beyond the subreddit, then there's more of that on SB than SV.


** I can wholeheartedly recommend this work. It's something I've enjoyed enough to do a reread of everything out so far, which I very rarely do with how much stuff I have on my "things to read" list. My only points of concern I could bring up would that the shift into a focus on Harry and away from Tom could have issues, there haven't been any pre-teen characters interacting with kids their age yet that dialogue could end up off in those interactions, I don't know yet. And my second point is that posting about your work one week into your two week update schedule got me all hyped that I'd misremembered it and looked for an update only to be disappointed. Dick move.

Anyway, read this work.

/Very/ possible, and something I'm going to be trying to keep an eye out for (also, a reason that I won't be spending much time on the pre-teen years).

Sorry. :( My usual practice is to post first on SV/SB, then wait a week in case anybody's caught an egregious typo or something else needs to be rewritten, so Ao3 (and consequently my reddit posts) are always a week behind.

Anyway, I gotta make up for that, so check your PMs for what I'm posting on SB/SV next week. :)

** This is one of the better stories I'm following right now and in contention for the second best HP fanfic I've read behind HPMOR. Some of the one-shots are brilliant and just full of feeling.

It feels to the HP world a little like what Game of Champions was to Pokémon, at least tone wise.

It's not marked as rat fic but my guess is that's out of an excess of caution or to prevent sparking off a “is this rat fic?” debate, because it reads much like a rat fic.

** Can you upload this somewhere that is easy-to-follow and easy-to-ebook? AoOO has those, but you have created lots of very short books instead of normal chapters, which breaks the site. Royalroad would be great, for exmaple, as it also has an RSS feed.

I'm currently uploading it to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13715432/1/There-is-Nothing-to-Fear][FFN]]. Does that work or is there another site that would be better?

I could also just stitch together the EPUB, MOBI, and PDF files from each story in the series and post those in the series description.

** (SPOILERS)

I have just one complaint so far and that is Dumbledore should have entered the duel with riddle knowing the children would be put in danger and willing to strike Riddle down. It is a terrible cost, but it is the only path to victory, to ignore the terrorist's threat and strike true for the safety of future children at the risk of those here now. He had to trust in the capacity of the other instructors to save as many of the children as they could from the basilisk and fight all-in. This is too great a weakness I think in someone running a war with these stakes.

Edit: Failure 2 - knowing he will lose, intending to lose, he brings the elder wand. this is double stupid. If he intended to lose or die he should secure it elsewhere.

*** I think your first point is a good one: I'd expect the Hogwarts faculty to be able to take down a blindfolded basilisk, especially with initiative on their side.

But as for your second point, I'm assuming based on his dying thoughts that the Elder Wand is part of Dumbledore's bigger plan. That he's not the true master of the wand and is giving Riddle a defective weapon. Although that's maybe too close to canon to be interesting...

**** I agree, Dumbledore seemed to have a plan. However, I think it failed, based on the chapters that happen in future years, and on the ending of this last chapter (his dying thought was that the stone wouldn't be able to retrieve him... but in the end it could).

*** Don't the last two canon books make it pretty clear that death ≠ defeat, for the purposes of transferring mastery of the Elder wand?

Yes, just like in canon, Dumbledore was going into his final encounter with the intention of dying, but, just like in canon, his death would be according to his own plan, and thus it should not give Riddle (or, in canon, Snape), mastery of the wand.

On the other hand, whatever Riddle seems to have cooked up for /after/ Dumbledore's death might change matters.

As for attempting lethal force against Riddle... I have to agree that that is probably the tactically correct decision. However, I don't think I can blame Dumbledore for being either unwilling or unable to commit to it, "weakness" though it may be. These children have been entrusted to his care, and it would take a certain ruthlessness to weigh lives the way you're suggesting he should. Dumbledore is many things, but I don't think ruthless is one of them.

***** Draco disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him, then Harry disarmed Draco. Therefore Harry was the owner of the Elder Wand for the entirety of the seventh book. Voldemort failed to kill Harry a second time because the Elder Wand knew Harry had explicitly come to die, and that therefore death was victory. Victory condition satisfied, the Wand remained Harry's.

***** Harry got it because /Draco/ disarmed Dumbledore before Snape could kill him, and Harry disarmed Draco.

And then Voldemort killed Snape, thinking that killing Dumbledore's killer would make him the master of the wand.

However, it didn't work, because Snape never defeated Dumbledore, the latter's death at the former's hands being all part of the plan.
