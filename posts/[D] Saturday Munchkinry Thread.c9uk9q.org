Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Let's say you're a nice, powerful vampire in the Present Day. You've got money, you've got physical strength, and you've got a bunch of powerful vampire allies (and powerful vampire enemies).

Task: You've decided it's time for vampires to Come Out Of The Coffin (i.e. become known to the world) as the Masquerade is not going to survive much longer, but you want to use it to your advantage - and you want Fame and Respect.

Do you use your influence to tell the humans that your enemies are "evil vampires" and they should be torched? Do you become The Vampire and go around the talk show circuit? Demand vampires be given voting rights and then become the Leader of your Human Country?

Some standard vampire strengths/weaknesses: no sunlight, asleep during the day, stakes, super speed/strength, can give people orders with your eyes, invitations, silver, humans like to be fed from

*** You should read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255][Contratto]] by Alexander Wales/cthulhuraejepsen. There a similar situation is adressed.But to answer you questions.

#+begin_quote
  Do you use your influence to tell the humans that your enemies are "evil vampires" and they should be torched?
#+end_quote

No, because it wouldn't be wise to present vampires as inhuman enough that such violence and violation of rights is necessary(even if its just enemy vampires). Enemy vampires should still keep their human rights and be treated like radicals and criminals from any kind of group, because once you made people think that different rules apply for vampires, then changing that is going to be hard.

#+begin_quote
  Do you become The Vampire and go around the talk show circuit?
#+end_quote

No, I would offer vampirism to a bunch of celebrities, politicians, people in influential positions, and most importantly people with religious authority(heads of religions like the Queen or the Pople would be invaluable). People would have no reason to trust me if I were to go public, like sure Id be famous and certainly a curiosity, but there are already a lot of better looking, more well spoken people who are trusted by the public. Like people already take medical advice from people like Oprah and Jenny McCarthy, it would be bad not to make them listen to people they trust talking in favour of us.

#+begin_quote
  Demand vampires be given voting rights
#+end_quote

Not unless they have been removed first, I would make sure that even suggesting taking our rights away is considered discrimination similar to taking away the rights of people because of their race or sexuality.

#+begin_quote
  then become the Leader of your Human Country?
#+end_quote

No it would look extremely shady if immediately after vampires are exposed, one previously unknown one becomes the leader of a major nation, especially when people find out about the mind control powers. At best one of the trusted turned politicians wins the election, while at the same time remembering that he depends on me for his connection to the rest of the powerful vampires.

In general though, I would have to make sure that Vampires are presented in the most positive light, and make sure that at no point were not considered humans by the law or public opinion. Thats where its important to have religious figures on your side. Because when People just get confirmation that the Supernatural is definitely real, they'll want to know that they're not damming themselves to hell by consorting with demons.

The feeding would be the hardest to explain, but I would hope that we found some sustainable arrangement until now that doesn't require us to have committed mass murder over the years. Artificial blood would be the best case by far, but things like feeding on volunteers, blood donations or animals would do in a pinch, but would definitely lower public relations, and could bring potential problems with the law.

The mind control is going to be a extremely hard sell, like in the best case scenario I would make sure that nobody finds out about it. But if they did I would make its limitations public(or make some up) so people have something they can do to feel safe, and make it look like using this power is already forbidden between vampires and have some law that forbids manipulating the mind of others without consent.

The Enemy vampires shouldn't be to hard to deal with, since I assume that truly Powerful ones would have to be smart enough to realize that countering my efforts would only harm themselves. That vampires are considered monsters to be hunted is just in their interest as well. And the truly despicable ones can be presented as deranged individuals to the public who are not representative of the vampires as a whole, and aid human law enforcement in dealing with them in a hopefully non lethal way.

Ensuring Personal power and fame isn't to hard when you're connected to the most famous people of society. And just writing and releasing a book about your experiences in the past centuries would make you extremely famous, because its the first autobiography of a real vampire it will also have historical value. And even if I just started to make a lot of stuff up who could refute me, like I could claim to have fought in many historical wars, to have dined with kings we know little about, or even to have witnessed events like the crucifixion. My powerful vampire allies would certainly have reasons to support my accounts, and my enemies would do it even if I was telling the truth.

"I was born a human; I remain a human despite the accidents of my condition. I did not die; I was reborn, much as any Christian is reborn in his baptism. I am as loyal to my country as any American; indeed, I am more loyal to it because of the protections it offers me that other countries do not. No court has stripped me of my right to vote; I have committed no crimes. I have lived in my house and paid my taxes and registered my car. There is no ground to say that I may not vote."

Appeal to the rule of law, to the principles of the country in which you inhabit.

"Epidemiologists may wish to model my condition as if it were a disease, but they want to model gun violence and memes as if those were diseases, too."

Don't allow the implication that the vampiric condition is a scary disease. It's just a thing that happened to you.

A truthful account sounds like a great idea: if you lied I think you'd run into the same problem that people who remember past lives and are kings, consorts, met Van Gough, etc run into: people would wonder how you managed to interact with so many famous humans. And if you tried to claim historical presence in a place you weren't, you might end up accidentally fucking up your historical accuracy and modern historians could counteract you (yeah, okay, maybe modern historian of religion can't attest to exactly what the minitae of a particular church you were in believed; but if you mention a particular type of plough centuries before it was invented).

All in all, though, sounds like you've got things covered; though I notice you've went more to fame and power than Respect. (Giving respected people immortality is probably going to help on the Respect front, though!)

**** The single biggest problem with this is the question of "where do vampires come from?"

If vampires are born, either from human birth, or by some process after a human naturally dies (and can no longer consent), then they have a solid bedrock for arguing their moral right to exist. They can't help the fact that they're vampires, and they'd prefer to go on living just as any human would.

If vampires are created, either by existing vampires turning humans, or by humans willingly making pacts with vampire overlords in return for life eternal, then their moral grounding is far more shaky. Vampires created against their wishes might be able to win some sympathy. But vampires who decided they were okay with eating humans if it meant they got to live forever, and vampires who are going around making /more/ maneating monsters, will be looked on very poorly.

Such vampires will find it especially hard to win over religious figures, since what they are doing spits directly in the face of pretty much all major religious doctrine. Any religious figure of any clout will probably reject their offer outright, either out of religious conviction, or the simple fact that it would be a /terrible/ PR move.

And if it's a mix of both, then it doesn't matter if vampires are born against their will. They will be hunted down like all the rest, to stop them creating any willing vampires.

*** Some of it depends on how many crimes vampires are responsible for. If a thousand cold cases are suddenly explained by the existence of vampires, then vampires have a real problem on their hands from a PR perspective. You can present as basically being a human with a "disease" of some kind all you want, but as soon as the first tearful family comes forward crying about their innocent teenage daughter that was snatched up from the streets and found three days later drained of blood ... well, that's not going to get public support, that's going to get harsh "we must do something" laws put into place, suspicion from everyone (especially given the secrecy), and deep investigation that might not be so great for these vampires, /especially/ given how many laws they must be breaking by their mere existence (even if they're getting their blood from ethical and legal sources, they almost certainly have to hide their identities in some way, which means fraud, forgery, tax evasion, etc. unless things are done /extremely/ carefully, and even then, it might literally not be possible).

I think all of the above is true for the two principle issues, which are 1) immortals and 2) drinking blood. Anything that makes the vampire stronger makes it harder for them to come into the light, so to speak, even if it's not something that makes vampirekind appreciably stronger in aggregate. For example, immunity to anything but silver would require armed forces and vampire hunters to tip their bullets in silver, which doesn't make vampire extermination all that much harder, but the immunity makes vampires much more threatening to the average person, which helps to tip the zeitgeist in favor of vampire capture, restriction, tracking, or extermination. Contrarily, easy-to-exploit weaknesses like requiring an invitation, damage from sunlight, inability to cross running water, etc. make vampires less threatening, which is a good thing from the perspective of bringing vampires out into the world.

And then we get to mind control, which (depending on the specifics) is a bigger deal than anything else combined. Even relatively short-term mind control, on the order of minutes, means that chains of command have to be reconfigured, new protocols need to be put into place, and at best there will be rampant paranoia about vampires taking control (plus a bunch of false 'vampires made me do it' reports). Superstrength can be handled with existing laws, or with pretty easy grafts onto existing laws. Mind control? Not so much. It's hard to know how the powers that be would react to the introduction of mind control, but I think "not well" is probably underselling it, and some kind of draconian response would be expected, even if it stopped short of considering every vampire a criminal.

So, to strategy:

Having highly respected vampires would be a boon, and depending on transmission rules, would be pretty doable. Full, informed consent would be important. Better still would be to have existing immortal vampires who are highly respected, but if the "no daylight" rules are strict, that might not be possible (here, I'm thinking "noted reclusive author of the acclaimed series of children's historical adventures comes out as vampire"). If you /personally/ can be one of them, especially one with clean hands, then you're well-positioned to +be a Benedict Arnold to vampirekind+ take advantage of the coming out.

Attacking other vampires as "evil" while coming out? I can see it, but it would take a lot of care, since it both sets bad precedent, and it raises a lot of instant trust issues, even/especially if you're claiming to be one of the good guys. Ideally you have proof of some kind, and ideally the evil guys /don't/ have proof. Might raise some "why now" questions, especially if you've been sitting on that proof for decades or centuries.

Making demands sours things, depending on what those demands are. Angling for all the same rights that everyone else has is probably not that much of a stretch (again, depending on how many people vampires have murdered in the past), but it's really a matter how people, governments, media, and corporations deal with all the new stuff, like the blood drinking, immortality, and other stuff. A state might pass a law making it illegal to drink human blood, which would effectively kill vampires, or force them out of the state (I have no idea whether this is true elsewhere in the world), which would then get an injunction or not and kicked up to a superior court. Vampires might have to register as living weapons, if they're strong enough, or even if they're not strong enough and public perception is against them. "Continuing to go about with their lives" is the bar I think vampires would be most concerned with clearing.

Oh wow, yes. All of a sudden all the cold cases came up! Putting myself in the vampire shoes as an Ethical Vampire, I'd... probably be proposing the vampires be put on trial and sentenced for their crimes, with the proviso that a life sentence is cruel and unusual punishment for a vampire. This puts a huge number of vampires on ~500 year sentences though in prisons that can't technically hold them anyway. If vampires literally existed I'd imagine the public would want to put them to death, even in civilised countries where it's not an allowable punishment for any crime.

I'm imagining one of those father-son writing dynasties - like Dune but high quality throughout - being revealed to be one such vampire.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, I think with vampires coming out of the coffin, their two options are trying for world domination (easiest way: convert all of humanity in one night, except for a few "herds") or trying for "not being exterminated". The latter would have to be planned, multi-pronged, and probably depend on converting a good deal of billionaires.

I tried to make the setup True Blood rather than My Vampires, but I can't help but think about it in those terms obviously, and for My Vampires, a vampire can only convert once a century and the success rate is on the order of 50% (and much lower the sicker the human is, so deathbed conversions are virtually impossible) - which isn't going to be great for their reputations if they're trying to get celebrity endorsements since they'd leave a pile of bodies in their wake, and even if those bodies are consenting, it'd be an extremely hard sell.

**** This made me realize the immunity is actually huge and you could launch a violent vampiric takeover if needed. The sunlight and invitation only are issues but you can presumably wear a morphsuit or something if needed or have thralls defend you during the day. Door to door combat is a snag, but there are some workarounds with blowing houses up or starving cities out.

The element of surprise if no one leaks your true weaknesses makes basically immortal on the battlefield. Throw some thick steel plates on vampires and you have hellishly fast, bulletproof (the metal plates can be absurdly thick, stopping "low" calibers, while the high calibers pierce all the way through so silver isn't left in you) better than night vision goggles (armies would pay trillions for natural night vision) equipped forces that require no supply lines. Drink the enemy, take their stuff, and tear people apart by hand if needed. They can travel hilariously light, they don't need protection from the elements or to carry food. Just weapons, for efficiency, and a shovel for tunnels/deep trenches to sleep in. (If it's traditional they might have to carry their homeland's soil?) These forces would dominate the field, even when weaknesses are found they're better than special forces from day 1.

Vampires are presumably immune to bioweapons and chemical weapons, so you're free to take and use them on anyone you want. Until the enemy makes garlic bombs they have no equivalent, and looted hazmat gear should keep that out without a problem.

You can definitely seize a continent, if someone can figure out a way to leverage vampire powers to stabilize a tyrannical government (mass glamour?) you should be able to grind down the rest of the world from there with regular armies alongside vampires.

*** This is kind of the problem of reality vs fiction. Figurative vampires /do/ already rule the world (hence why it's a cliched metaphor). If there were a masquerade, what changes if it's blown, really?

As long as the people in the empire are fed somewhat, and the slaves in the vassal states weak, why would they care if a couple people they don't know get eaten/enslaved every now and then? They don't care now, so except for a powerless fringe minority that's fantastically racist against super sexy vampires, nothing would be different.

Fantasy and reality do not mix well; reality always imposes itself and disappoints. (One of the saddest days on the internet was when I discovered that hurling the Earth into the Sun is less efficient than hurling it into Jupiter.)

Anyway, our vampire overlords trick us into thinking they're not real by all the wacky media they put out there. You think vampires have superpowers, are allergic to silver+sunshine+right angles+wood+garlic, and glitter? Ha, of course not.

They're completely indistinguishable from ordinary humans - philosophical zombies, you can call them. Where did they come from? I don't know. A parallel dimension, or simply a way to save on computing cycles for the computer simulation we're living in. Or nearly anything else. Who can say.

**** You may know your target's body position, pose and action, but you wouldn't necessarily know the location of everything around them. You could reasonably infer that they're at their desk, typing on a keyboard, or perhaps typing on a phone's touch-screen. But you wouldn't know the exact position of the keyboard in either case, making it hard to infer what they're actually typing.

You also wouldn't know what was on the screen at any given time, making it hard to tell what they're even doing while typing. So even if you could tell what they were typing, and they happened to log on to a site within the 1-hour timeframe (and didn't just have themselves set up to login automatically), you would have no intrinsic knowledge of what site or application they signed into. Knowing what they're typing wouldn't necessarily help there, as they might have navigated to the site or app using their mouse or fingers, and since you can't see the screen...

All that said, a far better way to rob people would be ATMs. Just hang around one in public, and wait for someone to walk up to use it. So long as they see you, you can mark them as your target, and then spy on their bank PIN as they enter it. This would be much easier to guess on the larger, simpler keyboards of an ATM, than on a desktop or phone keyboard.

Once you know their bank PIN, it would be relatively easy to trail them on foot for an hour, and wait for a time when they leave their wallet unattended. Then you can just stroll over, steal it without them noticing (because you know where they are at all times) and then go and empty their bank account. It might take a few tries before you get the perfect opportunity, but the payoff would easily be worth a few wasted days.

** This is part 2 of the mini battle royale quest [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c7002f/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/esgpnm7/][that started here]]. It's very low effort, there's no voting, and it's intended to be simple fun.

For the opposition for this update I quickly brainstormed 16 opponents' wishes and paired them up randomly. This should hopefully mean I can better simulate the natural path of progression that other people in the story go through.

Next update I might write this ahead of the Saturday post, so I can get this up before the Monday sticky, but we'll see what happens.

--------------

“Wait!,” cried Felicity, “don't I get any questions?”

Is a round one-on-one, or some kind of group fight? What even is ‘mundane power' or ‘trivial magic'? Was elimination really... you know?

Only silence rang back from the white expanse. It seems she would have to figure this out alone. Felicity sat down, legs crossed, and focused.

#+begin_example
  [[ Affliction: Great Artist ]]
  You are unable to conceive of wishes from whole cloth.
  Oh, stop complaining, originality is hardly in vogue.
#+end_example

The insight struck suddenly and Felicity jerked up in surprise only to nearly have her eye poked out by a paper aeroplane.

The story of her recent life written on the sheet of the plane was one thing (“Well that's one way of putting it on paper.”), but the comments and suggestions below it was what really caught her attention. Some minutes of deliberation later spent mulling over their ideas, she had a course of action.

“I wish for whatever wish would make me most likely to win.” It was a silly wish most likely, but it helped scope out the rules.

#+begin_example
  [[ Rule Violation: You can have the impossible, just not that impossible. ]]
  Russell would be disappointed in you, Felicity.
#+end_example

Right, self-reference. Easy enough. “I wish for a wish that---”

#+begin_example
  [[ Rule Violation: New rule, cheating is against the rules. ]]
  This is a test of your wishmaking powers. That's your task, not mine.
#+end_example

The rejections kept intruding in her head as if they were just any other thought. So far they had gone as expected. There was one more that seemed like a no-brainer to try.

“I wish for the atoms in the arena to be rearranged such that my opponents have a cut in their brain that instantly kills them, but leaves me uninjured.”

This time there was a brief pause.

#+begin_example
  [[ Rule Violation: New rule, cheating is against the rules. ]]
  This is a test of your wishmaking powers. That's your task, not mine.
#+end_example

Bah, that /was/ a specific wish. There was no time for this wannabe lawyer malarkey! At least the paper had recommended a fallback,

“I wish that my opponents have particularly damaging cuts in their brains.”

#+begin_example
  [[ Rule Violation: This ain't my first rodeo. ]]
  Leave the fighting for the arena. Don't make me call the sheriff.
#+end_example

Felicity took a deep breath. This was OK, she had expected these to fail. Knowing the rules they broke was the point of trying.

--------------

There were a few options to choose from now. A following suggestion was that perhaps she should ask for an elaborated death trap to attack her opponents on entering the arena. Rocks falling from the sky, or explosives around the area sounded like a safe bet, though the more exotic suggestions seemed too risky. She was also suggested to wish for cover at the same time, which would be a good call, though it risked splitting the wish's power, whatever that was.

The downside is that falling rocks would only be a short-term solution. The paper had emphasized skills that grow and cohere, and the benefits of being able to interrogate the opponent after the match. Stealing powers, becoming smarter, seeing the future. All have the potential for greatness... but she needs to survive the next round. Right now she would lose every time against a martial artist with a knife.

There were suggestions of magical kinetic projectiles and a sprite familiar. A sprite would be lovely, and the kinetic projectiles clever, but the idea of someone just running up to her and stabbing her was hard to avoid thinking about. She needed something concrete and actionable, until such a time that she had leeway for these things.

“Alright,” Felicity spoke again to the luminous nothing that submerged her, “I wish...”

--------------

The battlefield was brightly lit, but under her cover Felicity mostly saw darkness with traces of sky behind thick metal bars and glass(?) windows. Her cover was an impressive metal dome---nothing out of the realm of human technology, perhaps not even impressive, but certainly thick and well made. Out the port she saw her opponent, who saw her and immediately threw some sort of---

The window shattered and bars bent in an instant, and Felicity recoiled with shock. A fraction of a second later a second thud hit the cover elsewhere, rebounding and leaving Felicity half deaf. A pit formed at the bottom of her stomach, and she scrambled to figure out a way out.

She heard a dull rumble of her rocks falling from the sky, and stood up to---

The environment faded again to white.

*Anton Matthews defeated!*

--------------

Congratulations! The next wish for you to munchkin is ‘ten times the mundane, ten times the magic... well, give or take'. You get to keep your previous wishes, but there's no information about the details. The cover, along with a large pile of rocks, are lying to the side in the white expanse. Felicity's minor scratches from the incident have not healed. The waiting time before the next round is another 30 minutes.

*** I think I'd wish for vastly enhanced speed and reflexes.

--------------

There are two ways to avoid my falling rocks; tank it, or dodge it. Spending a second wish on either durability or speed will allow anyone to do so with ease.

Spending /my/ second wish /entirely/ on speed means I get to keep up with them if they do the same; in effect, it's then out First Wishes against each other. On the other hand, if they didn't spend their entire Second Wish on speed, then I am now able to run circles around them, dodging their attack and possibly even turning it back on them (if they have some defense against my Falling Rocks).

In order to attack me, then, they'd first need to break through my cover and then hit me - which is possible, for someone who (say) spent their First Wish on a lightsaber and their Second Wish on speed like we did - but all in all, I think that a strong defensive wish like this is the best option.

(Third Wish should be a weapon of some sort again. Fourth Wish maybe an accelerated healing factor?)

  You get to keep your previous wishes, but there's no information about the details. The cover, along with a large pile of rocks, are lying to the side in the white expanse.

*** *Brainstorming*

- So the falling rocks will kill anybody without enhanced durability or a mobility/evasive power. So I think she wants a good hax power to designed to counter that next.

- The metal dome seams pretty good defensively to the point I feel it would be worth more to invest into an attacking wish next rarther than defencive. Unfortunately the metal dome gets in the way of that so something that can bypass solid objects is needed.

- It will be best to try and tie the power of wishes to some trait or attribute that can be increased in the future. Physical strength or reaction times might be good.

- She should test if you can use a time travle wish to send infomation about the next fight before she had made the wish. For example: Wish that upon your the end of the next fight a message describing exactly what happened up to that point is send back in time to before you made the wish. That way you can scout out the enemys without having to pay for a wish.

*Wish Ideas*

- [Mind Control Aura Punch]: You can convert the kinetic energy of an attack to fire off a spherical aura that can pass though solid objects and mind controls anyone but you who enters it. The more Kinetic energy used for the abilty the largers the radius of aura /or/ the faster the aura travels away from you. So you could turn a punch into: a 2m wide aura that moved at a snail's pace, a 1m wide aura that moved at a human sprint or a 0.01m aura that moved with the speed of an arrow.

- [Time Twin]: Felicity can travel back in time to anywhere within Xm of her pasts selfs location with the limit there can only be Y alive Felicity's at any one time. Where X = the distance she could sprint in a second at the time she uses the ability and Y = the largest number you can make it while still being a valid wish. To be truly effective Felicity's will need to be willing to kill themseves for the group but even with out that it's still useful. (Edit: or just make it that future Felicity's obey past Felicity's) Can be combind with a strength stealing wish later down the line for exponential physical power growth.

*** one idea is wishing for a library full of useful information about the rules with a closed room made of metal and full of hallucinogen gas around wherever the other contestant is.\\
another is a fortress full of traps that can kill or disable the opponent and either poisonous gas or something that can disable the opponent, with herself and the cover at the center.

Or she can wish for a magical decoy/ servant that looks like her and has as many skills and physical ability that she can get away with wishing, can act independently and causes all wishes and magical abilities other contestants make that reference you to target it instead.

try whishing multiple things with ands first .and if that doesn't work try tying both of them to a single concept.

Since I'm not cruel enough to mess with this wish*, this is going to be vetoed out of character. This quest is meant to be low effort to write, and even modelling the effects of this abstractly would not be conducive to that.

*Oh, you wanted it /only/ to contain pertinent information? I thought the essays on cat attire were a welcome addition myself.

** So I'm thinking about doing something with improving OnionBoy's /Reaper's Creek/. In that book, eventually the main character's power ends up being "edit the coding of the universe" but obviously that's way too OP. The character's power starts out with him being able to sense dead bodies.

So, basically, he can sense where dead bodies are in a sort-of-almost sight way, like it "glows" for him, but he also "senses a coldness" or whatever. Once he sees the dead body, he can no longer sense it and won't see the glow, even if he leaves. Also, it's not mentioned but obviously this has a maximum distance he can sense dead bodies (nothing too extreme or whatever).

A Youtuber that did a review of this book stated that this is the lamest power you could have, and I don't think that's actually true! (See: Worm) Other than finding dead bodies of missing people, being able to tell if someone has died in a house or apartment and telling the authorities so they're not left there for days or weeks, and being able to tell if a birth will be stillborn, what are ways this power can be used?

(Some extra parts of the power not mentioned in the book that I think are important are that if his eyes are closed and he comes across a dead body and then leaves, he'll still be able to see the glow; also, he has to process that he's seen the dead body that the glow is leading him to, so if he has a bad migraine and sees it with his eyes but doesn't process it, he'll still sense the glow. Yes, to be fair, I think he should even, at some point, be able to sense /all/ bodies of dead animals in his area, even if they're corpses of dead mosquitoes. I /also/ think that it should not last forever, since bodies decay, so once it's no longer recognizable as a dead body it won't register.)

What are other potential parts of the power that I or OnionMan may have missed?

*** Super messed up but the first thing that came to mind was giving abortifacients to pregnant women at various stages to find out definitely at what point a fetus is alive enough to then become dead.

Does it only work on humans? If it works on insects you could probably be a great pest exterminator. I bet it'd be great use for an ecologist, too, studying lifecycles and whatnot.

Depending on the distance you could use it to find old tombs and subsequent treasure. Or the opposite, burial plots that don't have bodies but should.

You could be an advisor to families debating whether or not to pull the plug on a beloved family member -- no, they are not going to wake up, sorry.

I don't know how useful it would be, but you could convey information. First, look at 10 dead people, say. Second, have someone else line up the bodies that you've seen in a certain order with bodies you haven't seen. The gaps in your sight give information. Can you sense/see the light through a camera or TV?
