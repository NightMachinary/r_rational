** I have created our new wiki page =)

I want to invite everybody to contribute to improving it.

What do you think can be better?

What are some other great works that need to be added?

What are some other awesome resources for rationalist writers?

*** Nice job!

I'd add [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] and [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories][sequels]]. I found them via someone's recommendation in this sub. Good stuff.

I like the section of resources for rationalist writers---you thought of everything I was going to suggest.

***** I just ran across [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/][EY's post on rationalist fiction]] and it occurred to me that while The Fall of Doc Future is rational fiction--the author does some math, consequences are thought out, tropes are deconstructed, reconstructed, and the world is built in a more cohesive and realistic, less comic book fashion--it isn't truly /rationalist fiction/ in the sense that all the thought processes are laid bare for the reader to learn and use.

The sidebar does a good job of making this distinction.

Maybe the Wiki should be subdivided into Rational and Rationalist sections as well? The Rationalist list would likely be short, but making the distinction might be worthwhile.

Also, I've seen a lot of good rational fiction mentioned in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3aca6x/hi_there_hpmor_are_there_any_other_fanfics_that/][this thread]] over on [[/r/hpmor]].

** I like it, it's pretty thorough. My only criticism is that I think we should be more specific about EY's influence. Perhaps noting earlier examples in the opening paragraph, and noting that his work basically created the modern internet rationalist subculture? I'm not entirely certain how it would be worded.
