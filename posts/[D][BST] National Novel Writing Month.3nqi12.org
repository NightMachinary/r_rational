November is [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]]. Does anyone have any plans to do it this year? October has always been my "National Novel /Planning/ Month" so that I'm ready to go for when November rolls around.

Here's my advice for anyone in the planning stages:

- Figure out your characters. If you're having trouble with this, just steal from somewhere and strip off the serial numbers. No one is ever going to call you on your main character acting just like Monica from /Friends/ so long as you fudge the life details.
- Figuring out characters means asking questions. You don't actually know a character until you know what motivations them, what they fear, etc. For all your principle characters, imagine them in either some stressful situation or faced with a difficult choice, then imagine the resolution.
- Figure out your plot. Dan Harmon's [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][story circle method]] is a more basic, more prescriptivist version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth][Campbell's monomyth]]. It's very easy to structure plots around it.
- Figuring out your plot means trying your best to link the story beats with "therefore" or "but", not "and". Events which are disconnected from each other are /realistic/ but don't tend to make for great writing (this bit of advice is one commonly given by [[http://www.mtvu.com/video/?vid=689002][Matt Stone and Trey Parker]]).
- Write a single sentence description of each chapter. Then write a single sentence description of each scene within the chapter. It's easier to write a novel (and write a novel /fast/) if you're spending less time stuck looking at the page wondering what happens next (though some of that is unavoidable).

As for making all this /rational/, that's just a matter of what direction you take the story and how hard you can hammer on your worldbuilding and plot, looking for ways that you're failing, then trying to shore them up. A good way to do that is talking to other people to get a different perspective. (Making it /rationalist/ is an extra level of difficulty that I wouldn't attempt if I wanted to hit 50,000 words in a month.)

*tl:dr;* So is anyone doing NaNo this year? Any plans you need help with or plots that need a second set of eyes? Any questions of rationality that need to be addressed? (I will offer my standard caution that it's better to talk about the things that you're puzzling out than the things you're really excited about, since "urge to write" and "urge to talk about the thing you're going to write" draw from the same well of enthusiasm.)


** What do people think of having a sticky thread for NaNoWriMo on every Saturday of November? That way we can get a weekly update on the progress each person is making without having every writer clutter up the subreddit for every chapter they write.

Or is anyone pessimistic enough to think that's not something we need to worry about?

I think that more people posting chapters is a good thing and not "clutter". Links to rational fiction are pretty much the point of this sub.

** Personally, I'm writing the second half of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/, which was fully plotted out last year and just needs an additional 50K words in order to be near completion (though 50K only got me a quarter of the way through my outline, so maybe this is just going to be an epic that will take me four NaNos to complete). I've been rereading what was there before, making some small changes as I go and marking down what I see as the promises that the story is making, along with the seeds that need to sprout in later chapters. When I get some free time for it (when I finish the final chapter and appendices of /Shadows of the Limelight/) I'll go back and revise the original 40 chapter outline, which is now woefully out of date.

**** Two dark wizards steal a baby from an orphanage, intending to sacrifice him on an altar of onyx. They find that they can't go through with it and end up raising him as their son instead. Some years later, he sets off from home in order to find his birth parents. He bumps into the princess of Donkerk, who has run away from home in order to find a solution to the prophecy of doom that's been hanging over her head since the moment she was born.

That's the central premise anyway. There's a bunch of other stuff as well: witches, battle nuns, the machinations of the royal mentalist, an oathkeeper struggling with the vows he's taken, the spirits of the land being called to their queen, etc.

** I'm writing some Scooby-Doo fanfiction inspired by [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39986f/q_can_a_dumb_protagonist_exist_in_a_rational_work/cs1m9c3][idea]].

I also had a brief but very thought-provoking brain-storming thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3n8fep/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvlu6fy][here]].

The story will be just making good use of Fred, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo with Daphne as the main character and rationalist (hopefully). I don't plan on using anything other than the characters and maybe a few Scooby-Doo cliches and catch-phrases (Jinkies!). I plan on focusing on solving one mystery which is about a crime which was committed by a normal person, but the setting has a strong supernatural background (maybe something like Supernatural's weekly monsters but better working relationships between the monster species and no direct interference by Heaven or Hell) which the gang has good knowledge about. It's to show how one can still solve a regular mystery with magic as a viable alternate explanation. I would love if anyone can give examples of other stories that do the same thing.

I plan on portraying the monsters as sociopathic towards humans (not necessarily sadistic). This means they only care about what the humans can do for them and they don't really care if the humans live or die. However they do understand that humans can be dangerous in their own way. No 'All humans are killing the Earth!' or 'All humans are weaklings!' here. So the monsters are intended to be rational actors as well.

So far I have a good amount of world building done. I'm working on thinking about how the personalities of everyone should act like as well as whether or not any psychological disorders should be demonstrated (the gang has gone up against some terrifying creatures, yo!). I'm also planning some flashback chapters on how the gang originally first met up over an actual supernatural mystery. The only thing left I really need to decide on is just what to do for the actual mystery itself.

I plan on just posting everything to a Google Docs with a separate one for spoilers and planning out future chapters/plot points. However, I'll only post to this subreddit as I reach the milestones of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 thousand. If I'm lucky enough to write anything after that, I'll only post it again once the story is completed.

I really hope I can get a full 50,000 words this year.

*** My plan as well. :D

My goal is to write a rational-ish story about a time traveler's academy set inside the ten days skipped in Catholic Europe's switch from the Julian to Gregorian calendars (loosely inspired by Faction Paradox's 11-Day Empire). It's a logistical nightmare because the schooling lasts six months but they only have 8 days to work in, so there are about 24 copies of every one person inside the school at a single time. Because loose-restrictions time travel, yo.

Anyway, it'll be about how the universe is surprisingly resilient to containing paradoxes but the administrators are trying to cover that up, and there'll be hints of a giant catastrophic War happening at some point on the metatime horizon ... no idea where to go from there, really, but I'm sure I'll think of something interesting.

Either that, or I'll be working in my 17th-century AI-vs-Illuminati Lovecraftian thriller. I suppose I have a while to decide ...

*** I should really learn to plan. I currently have:

- Man finds himself thrown into a forest outside his village to be tortured by fae.
- Woman appears, whose tattoo on her arm is an unholy symbol.
- Lots of politics.
- It's actually the future and posthumans invade from space to rescue their lost comrade (the woman).
- This was actually all a gambit to overthrow Earth's really backwards government. The rest of the Solar System are /fine/.

**** I really do recommend Harmon's story circle method. He makes the claim that stories follow that pattern through all cultures for a /reason/ which is that our brains are wired to think in terms of story and even if you were raised without ever hearing a story in your life you would gravitate towards that. So:

1. We start with our protagonist. We figure out why he's being thrown into the forest, but ideally it tells us who he is. If this is a redemption story, he's being thrown there for adultery, in order to show his sins. If he's being thrown there for unorthodox views, it shows us he's a contrarian. Maybe he's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe he tried to do a good deed and it spectacularly backfired.
2. This guy has a need. Need one, not being immediately killed by the fae, but that's obvious enough. Need two, that's what his first thought is when he realizes that he's not going to be tortured (to death? I guess you didn't say) by the fae. Likely options include revenge against the people who threw him into the forest, trying to remake society, trying to help this mysterious woman, or trying to get rich.
3. They cross a threshold together. This is where you finally get to the central plot; it's where there's whatever is on the movie poster. This is the point where the terminator starts chasing Sarah Connor, which occupies us for most of our plot. For you, that's politics. So we need a bridge between our main character's NEED (point #2) and the plot. They get involved in politics of some kind; okay, why? The man is using the woman as leverage for power? The man is trying to change the world? The woman has some plan of her own that she's dragging the man into? At any rate, this is where they go from "not being in politics" to "being in politics".
4. There's a road of trials. This is where your hero gets stripped down and made into something more. Since you want politics as a focus, this probably happens through politics. Our hero has to learn politics. If it's a redemption story, this is where we see the first signs of redemption. If he's a contrarian, this is where he either sharpens the tool of contrarianism or where he learns to go along.
5. Something is found. This is probably where your twist goes. If your hero has some fatal flaw, this is where he realizes what's wrong and what needs to be done. Your big difficulty is in bridging the gap between politics and a posthuman future; if the twist is "this isn't fantasy, it's science fiction" then I guess my thought is that you make the hero a proto-scientist and have his investigations lead him toward this understanding independently. You want good, logical connections between plot points; you /cannot/ have transhumans come from space to change everything with no regard to the plot as it has been, because that's terrible story-telling.
6. They meet their maker. This is where the hero gets the shit kicked out of him. It's the low point of the story. If the transhumans come and take the woman away, maybe that leaves the protagonist politically weak and hopeless. Maybe it's a /literal/ shit-kicking. This is where the break-up happens in a love story. It's where everything is suddenly hanging on by a thread.
7. We bring it home. The hero's been put through the wringer, but now he's /through/ the wringer and has to make it to the boss fight. Sometimes this involves travel, other times it's just about coming out the other side of the crisis. Here's a great place for your protagonist to get in a position to actually challenge the posthumans that have been manipulating him, however he might do that. Or it's where he rallies his political allies toward some action. Or it might even be where the woman lends her aid, since this is traditionally a spot occupied by the cavalry.
8. Change. Here's the absolute climax of the story. You can put a boss fight there, which, if you're sticking with politics, is probably a political manipulation of the posthumans rather than anything material. If it's a redemption story, this is where the hero shows that he's truly redeemed. If this is a love story, it's where they show they're truly in love. If it's a tragedy, it's where the character is truly ruined. You probably have some climax, this is where it goes. Ideally, you fire off every gun remaining in Chekov's Armory.

Hope that helps to flesh some things out. You might want to save the twist for the very, very end, making each point in there more about whatever vague "politics" is going on, but then for the final twist of a transhuman setting you need to repeatedly harp on things like systems of power, consent of the governed, etc. etc. in order for that to be properly foreshadowed and appropriate to the ending.

She has a barcode tattooed on her arm and appeared in a forest full of fae. She's also dark-skinned, in a time when that counts against her.

His motivation is to hand her over to the authorities and wash his hands of it. Her motivation is that she's amnesiac and has no idea what the fuck is going on -- the last thing she remembers is a time that's near-future relative to us. Thus the main motives are: don't die, and find out what's really going on.

It will be an erom novel because they sell and they're easy to write. I've already [[http://nanowrimo.org/participants/dstorrs/novels/autumn-s-acceptance][entered it]] on NaNoWriMo.org, although there's nothing there yet except the working title.

My plan is:

1. Finish writing the first draft of /Induction/ by 9am PST November 1.
2. Spend November writing /Autumn's Acceptance/ while editing Induction.
3. Publish /Induction/ no later than 9am PST December 1.
4. Publish /Autumn's Acceptance/ no later than 9am PST January 1.

So, basically, two NaNoWriMos in a row. This is a test -- I think this is doable, albeit challenging. If I'm right then I intend to keep doing it, publishing a novel every month until I become either self-sufficient or broke, whichever comes first. If I'm wrong then I'll keep publishing but will just have to give myself longer runways.

** I have no idea if I'm going to or not, though I have a few things on the back-burner I'd like to have written by 2010.

I ran into a ton of literary difficulties with what I tried last year, and I still don't know how to resolve them. I basically wanted to take the general setting and premises of an awful Marysutopia science fiction story I wrote in 2003, but make it halfway rational. I had to restructure the plot almost completely, but what I wound up with loses most of what made the original fun--there isn't so much room for exploration of... anything, really, unless I want to drown out characters and elements that I think of as pretty important. [[#s][Summary?]]

But maybe I should try something different? The past weekend resulted in two new ideas: one would be a /With this Ring/-style take on Dragonball (just thinking about all the avenues an unpowered S.I. could explore without breaking the general tone of the setting is fun, but I'm not sure I can write something good with it), and the other was a deliberately nonsensical story about Gingerbread People that suffered a severe case of Cearbus Syndrome (although that one makes so much more sense as a Youtube animation, attempts at deconstructing Magic Baking aside).

(Another appealing option is some sort of Wuxia story set circa Y2K, in what amounts to "the real world, but with more fireballs and robots". I have an explanation for the magic/SF elements, but the story isn't about them, so I don't expect it to be full blown Rationalist. [[#s][Summary]])

I currently find it more likely that, if I try anything, it'll probably be the Dragonball SI, but then I have to go read all those random bits of useful worldbuilding Toriyama released in the past 3 years (at the exact time that I stopped paying attention. I ... was not expecting Battle of Gods to be a prelude to resurrecting the series, so just tried to wait for the discussion to calm down. Oops.) I have no idea how to make it work without dropping the SI somewhere convenient by default, but I like how /With this Ring/ avoided that. DB doesn't have anything quite like a power ring I could use to get the SI moving and motivated, and I'm thinking about following WTR's example and keeping the metaphysical distinctions between our worlds as a serious limitation for the SI (so he would start out super squishy even by Dragonworld Civilian standards). I dunno, it sounds like fun, but if I try to take it seriously, I'm not sure how well it'd work.

** For anyone interested in story structure, I highly recommend a book by Robert McKee, and "Save the Cat" by Blake Snyder. These are books about writing screenplays, but they are amazing, and very useful to any writer. Robert McKee structure and explanation makes much more sense to me than Campbell's.

As for myself, whenever I'm trying to start working on a big project, I get stuck with a horrible writer's block, so for now I'll just keep practicing writing short flash-fiction stories, and hopefully eventually one of them develops into something longer and more interesting.

*** Some other resources that have worked well or been interesting for me:

- [[http://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/w-plot.html][The W Plot]] A clear and easy-to-do story structure that is easy to identify in many novels and much easier to work with than the following two options, although it provides less support.
- [[https://www.keepwriting.com/tsc/magnificent7plotpoints.htm][The Magnificent 7 Plot Points]] More detailed than the W Plot, less annoying than the monomyth. Easy to expand a W plot into a M7PP, so they work well together.
- [[http://orias.berkeley.edu/hero/journeystages.pdf][Joseph Campbell's Monomyth]] (PDF, because the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth][version on Wikipedia]] is too wordy.)
- The [[http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/][snowflake method]] I suggest not doing this exactly as described -- work on the various bits in whatever order appeals, intersperse writing with planning, and don't let the structure get in the way. The pieces are useful, though.
- [Writing Excuses]([[http://www.writingexcuses.com/][www.writingexcuses.com/]]) A good podcast by good authors; each episode explains one element of writing (narrative voice, worldbuilding, characters, etc). "15 minutes long, because you're in a hurry and we're not that smart!" [The second part is a lie.]
- A useful character design trick I took from Writing Excuses is to rate your character in terms of three attributes: Competent, Proactive, Sympathetic. I use a 5 point scale (1 is low and 5 is high) and give it as a 3-digit CPS number. Hinata is 451 (medium-high Competent, high Sympathetic, very low Proactive). Frodo is 113. Luke Skywalker is 333 in ESB and 453 in RotJ. [NB: If you disagree with my numbers, that's fine as long as you get the idea.]

[Edit: Added new things that I thought of after the fact.]

** Started outlining this week. I'll be working on a story I've been Worldbuilding for a while now, called Mapmaker, Mapbreaker.

This book is intended to be a sort of spiritual successor to The Edge Chronicles, one of my favorite series as a kid. A year or so ago I was trying to find something like it outside of YA fantasy, but came up with nothing. I decided to write it.

Currently trying to figure out how much of the plot belongs in the first book, and what the ending should be - writing towards a specific ending always makes pacing easier for me.

Last year, my laptop faced death-by-family-member right before NaNo, and I was forced to do my typing on my iPhone 4. I got 30,000 words in before carpal tunnel took me out. Here's hoping my laptop stays with me for this one!

For a back-cover blurb and excerpt. Also, knowing people are watching your wordcount is some nice extra motivation.

** I'm tempted to write my own S3E1 of Rick and Morty for a change of pace, but I'm probably just going to try and finish my other fiction. (I was hoping to finish it this month, but I'm so busy).
