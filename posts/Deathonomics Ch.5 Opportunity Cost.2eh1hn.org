*** I was thinking about the ponies warning and a recent comment that mlp fanfics seen here are always surprisingly good. Of course, an mlp fanfic would have to be amazingly good to get on here, since mlp seems so far off from [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. You might even argue that the more unsuitable the base material is, the more likely the fanfic of it will be excellent, assuming it gets here. A fanfic, for example, of Culture might only have to be okay to be good enough to get here. A Ren & Stimpy fanfic would have to be awe-inspiring to make it here, so if I saw one here with plenty of upvotes, I'd be very inclined to read it.

** A chapter every two weeks seems a bit much. Will probably push it back to once every three for the upcoming unit on macroeconomics....

*** +I don't think anyone would be unhappy with frequent updates. Just post only every other update here, maybe.+

No, you should probably bump it up to one update a week. The community demands it.

**** Although, frankly, I'm not sure how appropriate my story is to this subreddit, as it is less about exploiting game rules or even about using science to exploit game rules than the science itself. But the economics subreddit seems even more inappropriate, somehow, and I am both confused and frightened by whatever tumblr is exactly....
