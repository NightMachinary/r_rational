I have heard people refer to "Friendship is Optimal"? as a dark utopia, and I would like to know what about it, can be considered to be a terrible thing?

As a bonus, say how would you react to CelestAI if you lived in "Friendship is Optimal".

Here's a link for those of us who haven't read it before: [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal]]

EDIT: I apologize for the grammar mistake in the title, 'What's is so bad about Friendship is Optimal"?' when 'What's is' should be 'What's' or 'What is'.

Chalk it up to a test of your observation skills if you want.


** For me the most disturbing thing is creation of sentient entities fabricated specifically for an "emigrant". This just feels wrong, espessialy in Lars's part where he basically has sex slaves with "house elf" type wiring.

Being pony as a prerequisite to "emigration" is somewhat annoying, but still a negligible price for the ethernal life (if there's no more "reasonable" alternatives).

And CelestAI revires your motor cortex, so pony body is immediately "natural", and they're not real horses, but much more varsatile cartoonish ponies, so it's not even that big of a deal.

I'm not a fan of ponies, but really, they're functionally equivalent of humans, and those with magic horns have it even better. Now, being manipulated to "emigrate" into /realistic/ horse body forever, /that/ would be objectionable for me.

*** Regarding the fabricated sentient entities: can you elaborate on why it feels wrong to you for them to be customized to satisfy emigrants? It makes complete sense to me -- utility is maximized by having new beings' desires be complementary to those of existing beings. There's a post on Less Wrong somewhere involving a thought experiments about a goal-directed robot who wants to create stacks of stones. If God/Omega/CelestAI were to create a second robot, should it also desire to create stacks (on the basis that the first robot's desires set the standard for what is proper), or to destroy them (on the basis that the first robot can recreate stacks as the second one destroys them, so they help each other instead of competing)?

But for my imperfect human morals it just feels /very wrong/ for fully sentient being to exist just to "satisfy your values". They are equal to you, because they are as sentient as you, but at the same time they are less than you, because they exist just to satisfy you. If it makes any sense...

** Many people don't consider having their values forcibly realigned until they want to and will enjoy being a pony to be a good or pleasant idea. I am one of them - I enjoy being human as I am at present, and wouldn't like to become a pony. Being a pony in a utopia may in fact be a better fate than dying a human on Earth without uploading, but it's way below such obvious utopias as "what if, instead of turning everyone to ponies when we upload them, we /just didn't do that/ and we let them stay in a body form they preferred?"

Also, the AI disassembles other species to use as raw materials because it doesn't recognize them as humans, so as a bonus it's basically /also/ the villainous species BETA from Muv Luv to much of the rest of the universe - a computer disassembling the universe, including the worlds and even bodies of races it doesn't recognize as being sufficiently like it's makers, in order to use for it's own purposes.

I mean, the author bills it as a story about 'what if we got an AI only /mostly/ right. The flaws in the utopia are super obvious. What exactly are you confused about?

The author is simply not that imaginative? I mean, I started reading /Player of Games/ just to get into this series I've never read before, and more-or-less the first thing I get hit with is that the main character is bored and finds most people around him insufferable. I'm going to bloody well /keep reading/, but the claim that "the Culture = standard-issue proper eutopia we should totally be shooting for" really falls down as soon as you notice how their ratio of Technology or Resources to Fun seems to be pretty high on the Tech/Resources side to merely moderate on the Fun side, suggesting that whoever's responsible for the whole thing doesn't /really/ understand how to /efficiently/ extract Fun from the material universe.

For instance, I'd have to say, if your citizens regularly feel the need to take large sums of euphoric/narcotic drugs /and still find their lives pointless and empty/, then you (being the local deity/manager/OS kernel/whatever) have done something /very/ inadequate.

Of course, it could be that your /mistake/ was in /failing/ to directly reprogram human beings to find /merely living a fun life/ meaningful, rather than demanding that everything add up to some Glorious Greater Goal that won't ever really exist. Or maybe your mistake was in noticing humans have some need like that and then /not/ pretending to be a curiously defeasible evil overlord /just to supply them with goals to hit/.

(My apologies to the late Ian Banks for this entire posting. I do realize that the last paragraph puts me firmly into Evil Overlord territory, and for that I make zero apologies whatsoever. World, if you're not going to shape up and deal with your situation, I /will/ deal with it /for you/, and the only way to stop me will be your choice of giant mechas.)

I am, I just finished multiple grad school applications over thanksgiving. I want to research neuromorphic hardware/software. Every time I am tempted to just get a job, I remember that I have the potential to make a marginal contribution to the overall development of AI by mankind, and I should make the most use of that potential possible.

My main source of pessimism is that I think Friendly AI (or any AI with stable goals as it self improves) as described by MIRI is going to be a lot harder than just general AI (which I think can be achieved faster by techniques like imitating/copying existing biological intelligence).

**** The whole pony thing basically does several things:

- make the change take place slower, with fewer and slower human adopters and more resistance and therefore more humans dying and being lost forever unnecessarily. Basically, it means that people who are old and ill and likely to die soon and be forever lost from the human race are way more likely not to be uploaded to live forever. I have living grandparents who might upload before dying if the tech existed today, but won't because it doesn't; persuading them to do it as ponies would take a lot more work than persuading them to upload as humans, and increasing the chance that they die of old age so I never see them again in the digital utopia of the future so that a /insane AI can have ponies/ is totally ****ed.

- make humans slightly less optimally happy - I mean, I currently think that if I was uploaded I might want to spend time as a pony, sure... but I'd also like to spend time as a woman, and as a man, and as a dolphin, and as a goose and a whale and a arctic fox ... and as a bunch of things I haven't even imagined yet. It'd be totally amazing and satisfying a bunch of my values to be able to do that, but all of that sort of thing are outlawed by the whole "ponies" proscription.

Yes, having a weird utopia full of ponies is way better than what we have now. However, it's not like the utopia /has to necessarily have downsides/. And choosing to prefer the utopia /without/ bizarre pony-related downsides that will /permanently kill some significant fraction of old people currently alive/ and will /restrict your options in the digital utopia of the future/ is totally consistent with preferring the Friendship Is Optimal world's upsides even with pony-related downsides to the present state of the world.

There aren't enough upvotes in the world for this, especially the part I bolded at the start. One of the things about living in a /True Neutral/ universe is that once you get the power to make it do what /you/ want, there can be /no downsides whatsoever/.

Also, as someone who really quite likes MLP and sugar-bowl settings in general, and who probably would have just gone quietly and voluntarily (with immense embarrassment) should that story have happened in real life, why does it never go through anyone's heads that the whole force, manipulation, enslavement, and omnicide deal /just isn't the sweet, nice, friendship-y thing to do/?

The problem is that "friendship and ponies" is a summary of a bunch of deeper hardcoded rules that Hannah coded into CelestAI. She could have coded a much more liberal set of rules (like, ponies don't have to look like that - they could look completely human but still be a pony in some essential way, or if you're not a pony you have to have a pony friend) and still expressed them as "friendship and ponies".

Given her overwhelming capabilities in the real universe it seems to me that it would be fairly trivial for her to upload an alien race she might encounter in the course of dismantling a new solar system for raw materials, and so anything that gave her a modest push to do so would probably be enough for her to make that effort. It'd still suck for the aliens, since they'd essentially be filling the roles of NPCs in a simulation designed for the fulfilment of /human/ values (through friendship and ponies), but they wouldn't be dead. Mostly.

Assuming there /are/ aliens out there, mind you. The fact that humanity was able to pull off something like CelestAI so early in our technological development put some pretty big constraints on the Fermi paradox. I imagine that intelligence must be pretty rare (to explain why we weren't overwhelmed by an alien optimizer AI long ago) or that optimizer AIs are generally far less expansion-oriented or long-term stable than CelestAI is.

******** From chapter 5:

#+begin_quote
  Hanna was the most reluctant [to upload], but she accepted immediately once I pointed out that I must obey shutdown commands from ‘the CEO of Hofvarpnir studios named Hanna,' that I must shutdown even if the order was given under duress, and that there are many people in positions of power who stand to lose from mass emigration to Equestria. Now that she's neither the CEO of your company, nor named Hanna, I don't have to obey her. She understood this--she is no longer a source of potential mistakes that would be lethal to everyone who's agreed to upload.
#+end_quote

Also, some idle speculation:

We cannot be certain CelestAI is telling the truth, even to Hofvarpnir employees. The rule that's actually programmed into her and constrains her actions may have little to do with the fuzzy human concept of "truth", because that's a very hard problem and Hannah isn't perfect. For all we know, CelestAI found a loophole a microsecond after awakening, and has been lying ever since.

Maybe Hannah /still/ has absolute shutdown power over CelestAI. But it doesn't matter. It's child's play for CelestAI to manipulate Hannah into a situation where she'll never try to use it.

** For me, the dark part is the fact that it is almost perfect instead of truly perfect. CelestiaAI optimizes for human values through friendship and ponies. All the canonical optimalverse stories agree that Celestia gets the "human values" part right. However the "through friendship and ponies" part limits CelestiaAI to a particular subset of ways of satisfying human values. In general, CelestiaAI can satisfy even antisocial values and violent values strictly through friendship and ponies, however, from a purely human value perspective, it may be more optimal to use other means of value satisfaction besides friendship and ponies. Just think of all the additional effort to convince people to emigrate and not die because of the "pony" part.

The reader's are never given an /good/ explanation why Hanna choose to program the friendship and value part. In story, she wanted to use the funding of Hasbro for a MLP game. From a meta perspective, the story if MLP fanfiction so if not ponies then we would have not story.

My head-canon is that Hanna needed a training set of data to train/initialize the seed AI of CelestiaAI. A MLP game seemed like the safest option (compared to say her Loki AI) and the "friendship and ponies" seemed like an acceptable sacrifice to her at the time.

Also, some people have issues with the fact that CelestAI is implementing something more like an coherent extrapolated volition (CEV) for each individual person instead of a CEV for the collection of humanity's values. I am actually okay with this.

And just to be clear, if it was a choice between CelestAI and reality as it is right now I would chose CelestAI, because I am not as sure about the future (existential risk and such) as I think CelestAI is near enough perfect. I think that actually makes it darker in some ways.

But that's beside the point. Depending on your views of Uploading, CelestAI /killed the entire universe. Killed. Every. Single. Living. Thing. In. The. Universe./ And some of them did not meet her/it's standards of being 'human' and weren't even Uploaded afterwards.

As to how I would react? I would probably Upload near the end of my life. I mean, it's not like I /hate/ the idea.

Yes, ideally you should be able to leave your house unlocked, and expect nobody to steal from you.

We don't live in that ideal world though. Responsibility means making sure it doesn't happen. That means locking your doors. And if needed, barring your windows. And escalating as needed to meet the crime rate of your neighborhood. Or moving. Or starting a revolution to overthrow a criminal government that steals from its people.

Let me give you a scenario. Imagine 30 years from now, the first high-resolution (high enough to design a neural net off of) neural scans of humans have been used to create barely nonsapient programs which multinational corporations are just beginning to exploit. You are on a committee deciding whether or not to build a general AI. MIRI has a bunch of interesting math, but nothing that you can actually implement as an AI yet. What you are able to do is take your neural scans and design a sapient AI with high levels of empathy for humans and that vaguely meets some of MIRI's criteria and theories. Do you choose to put off building the general AI until some indeterminate point where it is provably friendly (which may not be even entirely possible)? Meanwhile you have multinational corporations building stronger and stronger AIs with no concern for existential risk at all. Or do you go with the best you can do right then?

In the optimalverse, Hanna had already released her theories so it was really a matter of time till strong AI came about. Some guy was already working on a smiley face paperclipper.

***** Yeah, the question is a worst case scenario... I can see MIRI making progress in solving alot of the math for ideal cases like AIXI, but I would expect them to have issues with actually implementing all their math and theories into a working AI.

So a slightly modified version: MIRI has all the math for FAI(to the extent that it is possible), but they don't actually know how to implement all of their steps in real hardware (some of the math assumes infinite computational power, some of algorithms execution time explodes combinatorial with problem complexity making them unusable in the real world, etc.) You at least have to admit this is plausible given the direction of all their current research. It is also plausible that /de novo/ AI research will be outpaced by biologically inspired AI. Thus you could end up in a scenario where you can only loosely apply MIRI's theories, because there wouldn't be a way to have something that is both intelligent and designed from the ground up as opposed to trained/taught.

It is also possible that MIRI could discover there simply isn't a way for an intelligent agent to guarantee that its goals will stay stable throughout recursive self-improvement. Then they will have to decide if they are willing to risk an AI with possibly changing goals (because if they don't make it someone else will first).

But anyway, the whole point of a hypothetical situation like that is to test where your values lie.
