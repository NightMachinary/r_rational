Now this is a weird one. It's a chinese novel that starts off as a comedy in a western fantasy world, and slowly advances into some of the best politics and world building i've ever read while continuing to be funny. It's really logical but not truly rational(author hides information sometimes for later reveals), even then, the story feels really well planned out. The protagonist (he really is a nice guy) has an extremely ambitious plot to change the world and it's superbly executed. I'd say you should read up to chapter 72 (end of first arc) before you decide if it's good or not, because it really lightens up on the comedy and gradually becomes an actual great worldbuilding and politics novel along the chapters (and the translation also gets a lot better).

**** Yup. And they even block chapters of popular novels behind gem paywalls (experimental log of the crazy lich apparently is blocked too). I recommend using novelfull to read anything that is available in webnovel, because it doesn't break formating and adblocker removes all the ads

***** I'm not familiar with the company or anything about this scenario, but have they done anything except start charging for things that used to be free? Because, on the one hand, I get why you're angry about that. On the other hand, speaking as someone who has tried to go pro, it's hard to make a living creating content these days, and it seems pretty understandable to think "I have given this away for years when I didn't have to. I did a huge amount of work to create it, it's of demonstrably high quality, and it would be great to earn some grocery money from all that work"

Most people are not willing to pay for anything these days, and get angry when you suggest they should. There are tons of illegal upload sites, so they don't have to. You can't make a living on ads because everyone is using ad blockers...which is entirely sensible, because a few sites had to go and ruin advertising for everyone by using hard-core porn popups, speaking popunders, and malware ads. Patreon is an option, but money is tight for everyone and all too many people aren't interested in paying even when it's voluntary. It can work, but you need an enormous audience before 1% at $3.17 each (the average Patreon donation) becomes meaningful.

(Sidebar: Thank you so much to the amazing people who have signed up as my patrons, especially the high-tier patrons. You guys astound me.)

******* Thank you for the thorough explanation. You're right, that's a lot of pretty scummy stuff.

As to people not wanting to pay for things...I guess we've had different experiences? Or maybe it's just that I've had very mixed experiences and the negatives stand out more in the memory. On the one hand, I've had a meaningful number of people fund my Patreon and my Kickstarter. On the other hand, I've been told by (what felt like) a very large number of people that I was immoral and a complete douche for taking The Two Year Emperor offline so that I could publish it in Amazon's Kindle Unlimited program, which requires exclusivity. This despite the fact that I gave 2YE away for a month before taking it offline and clearly announced what was going to happen. And when I say gave it away, I mean all of it -- chapters, notes, all the unused content, even the cover art that I paid money for. So, yeah. Maybe I'm a little bitter but it's a hard-won bitterness.

*** Yeah, webnovel is pretty full of dodgy things. A shame, because Experimental Log of the Crazy Lich is quite a funny and amusing novel. Not much Rational Fiction, except on the matters of the God of Law. That's a bit interesting.

**** The novel really does make a slow weird 180 degree turn somewhere along the lines. Roland delves a lot into politics and plotting, and even helps rebuild his old country. Truly amazing politics, stuff you wouldn't think would be found on a comedy novel. But the church of law is a good snippet of the rational part in the beggining.

At time of writing, I haven't read enough of this fiction to form a meaningful opinion, but I was driven to use that website for some things ever since I noticed that Novel Updates had stopped reporting certain translations (most notably one of my favourites, Master of Gu/Gu Daoist Master/Reverend Insanity). That said, I have NoScript installed on my normal browser. ...And for reading several restricted stories-of-interest in parallel, not making use of meangreenking's recommended method is effectively infeasible. But the 'Library' system is helpful for knowing when there's an update, which is really all one needs when Novel Updates can't be relied on... I just hope there aren't other interesting novels (that thought had been dropped) reflected in neither Novel Updates nor this.

**** Novelupdate stopped listing those chapters because they're behind a permanent paywall, and they removed the chapters that were previously listed when Qidian moved previously free chapters behind the paywall as well. But fear not, for the low, low price of $24.99 a month (yes, double a Netflix subscription!) you can read those chapters again!

***** Perhaps! In the same events, I also enjoyed the hints that led up to the teleportation Gu's refinement (which I didn't catch in time), and later on the less-climactic exploitation of that being a zombie lets you use Wisdom Gu's aura forever with no lifespan penalty (which I did! Though unsurprisingly, costs were narratively introduced to limit effective output).

I'm not convinced that the overall reality makes coherent sense--for instance whether certain major things happen because of true/Watsonian causes, or just narrative convenience, though every time more mechanics are revealed I feel joy--but I usually love Fang Yuan's approach to life (thoughts on death/immortality), even as it differs from my own (refreshing completely-amoral demonic path, versus benevolence).

Incidentally, did you know that there's a manhua adaptation now being made and translated? I've quite enjoyed going through the familiar scenes so far, paticularly the clashes with Fang Zheng. (The visual contrast at the end of Chapter 9, for instance... and the visual representations in chapter 15, or 18, or 20..!) (Though I was disconcerted at the time by the events in chapter 20 differing a little from those in the novel's chapter 25.)

** Here's a better [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/The-Experimental-Log-of-the-Crazy-Lich/][site]] to read all of the avaliable chapters up to #486.

[[https://wuxiaworld.co][wuxiaworld.co]] is a great aggregator site to read any of webnovel's stories on for free. Considering how much I hate how Qidan is bullying their competitors and doing their best to strangle the translation markets, I don't even care that the site is technically illegal.

Usually if you want to know about an issue with a site that you are using, you can find out more information through a competitor since they will be willing to point out any flaws their enemies have (just be careful to actually check that they are telling the truth).

Quite frankly, paywalls on a service that used to be free tends to be dubious especially since it reeks of a cash grab and signals the changing direction of a company from priding itself on quality to only caring about the money.

**** Typical xianxia, xuanhuan, etc. webnovels tend to have chapters that are around 2-3000 characters, or about 2-3000 words after translation. (Some go up to ~5k). 72 chapters works out to something like 140-216,000 words at that rate, or ~4 or 5 novels worth of text.
