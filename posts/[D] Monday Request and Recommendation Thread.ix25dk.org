Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

**** This is the first I've seen Rational Reads. It looks like it has the potential to be a very useful source! But it also looks like nobody has submitted new works to it in a while.

I'm going through and adding several.

(Also... it doesn't have HTTPS, so don't reuse a password on this site, even moreso than normal.)

Edit: I voted on and added everything I could think of that I've read, but it's still missing a lot. Looks like there hasn't been a big push to update it in at least a year. That means it's missing a fair chunk of stuff on the front page of [[/r/rational]] right now, along with a lot of LitRPG and Xanxia stuff from these rec threads. I estimate catching it up would only take around five rec thread readers doing the same thing I did.

He tries to abide by both and ends up half assing both of them, and being a hypocrite to boot. Rationally he realizes his flaws, but in real life it's hard to change yourself.

** For various reasons related to COV, publishers have held off on big releases until this month. That means that September is a great month for books in general, and fantasy books in particular. If you like published fantasy (or feel like getting into it), it's a good time. Here are a few books, and their associated series, that you might check out.

[[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609361/a-deadly-education-by-naomi-novik/][A Deadly Education]] --- A novel in a new series by Naomi Novik. I enjoyed her novel /Uprooted/, though I haven't gotten into anything else by her yet\\
[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089CLRRKR/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Battle Ground]] --- /Dresden Files/ is a great series about a wizard detective in Chicago. This book is the second half of a split novel, the first half came out a few months ago. The series is a little slow to start, some people recommend reading from the third or fourth book.\\
[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0865TSTWM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Piranesi]] ---The last major novel, /Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell/ by Clarke came out in the early 2000s. It was pretty amazing (and a massive doorstop). I'm excited to see what she's been cooking up for one trillion years.\\
[[https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Peace-Age-Madness-Book-ebook/dp/B0847KH373][The Trouble with Peace (The Age of Madness, #2]] --- If you ask my opinion (yes, I know you didn't), Joe Abercrombie might just be the best contemporary fantasy author. This is the second novel in a new series set in a (very) low fantasy world undergoing an industrial revolution. He's also written a young adult series that's pretty good. If you're looking for a place to start with him, I recommend his standalone novel /Best Served Cold/.

** So I've just recently started getting into rationalist fiction. A couple months back I read Unsong and yesterday I finished Mother of Learning. Mother of Learning was really enjoyable for me because it helped scratch the time-looping itch left behind by finishing the visual novel [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/648100/Raging_Loop/][Raging Loop]]. I mention it here in case anyone's looking for the reverse: something to scratch the itch of Mother of Learning with a story featuring an intelligent protagonist who systematically works their way through a time related mystery.

You can also just watch the first few seasons of the show (except the last one). It's a great show, except the last season. You can probably still enjoy it by reading it alone, but I think you'll miss the impact that Joffrey's character development will have without thoroughly stewing in it in the books or the show.

As you get to see a lot of plot devices fresh and many twists that readers of the books see coming will be even bigger for you. As someone that has read the books he basically does a lot of development about people and places that are only briefly mentioned in the books, so you'd be just as ignorant as the rest of us when he takes the plot to new places. And every time he does introduce a new character he fleshes them out pretty solidly so you're never really confused about who is who and why they're acting the way they are.

There are a lot of people with Martyr complexes in this though, Nina, Bug-Jesus, Ponch. Not to mention the very, very clear universally ordained bad guy who was once a good one.... Huh man it really is kinda Christian.

Still I would recommend it as the YA it is, it's certainly got more nuance with ideas about growing up, dealing with things like death, first love, loss, and making friends. Not to mention it's one of the few stories where the reasons for power levels maintianing throughout is explained. New Wizards have more raw power, but less control and the scales tip as one grows.

Not to mention the Aliens introduced as part of the main group in book 4(?) are a riot. The acceptance of the cheesy Tropes of trashy novels for Wizards of Mars, and the teenage angst with that.

*** I'm writing one now. It will be a Percy Jackson/SCP/Multi fan work. The issue with making a rational Percy Jackson is how irrational everyone is because of the fantastical elements. The novels are somewhat reflective of the modern myths which considering how old the gods and monsters are, makes no sense. You think thousands of years of experience would give the gods wisdom, but it doesn't.

For that matter how exactly do gods work? What does it mean to be a god of marriage or love or dreams? Where are the other cultures and their gods? In the fifth book of the series there's this fight between gods and titans that could mean the “end of Western civilization'. There are gods of other cultures, where are they?

Considering that it's belief that creates gods in the books. Where is the Abrahamic God? He has 3 billion followers yet there are only Greek?

My take on it would be to throw out a lot of the fantasy out. In the SCP lore there is a fight between two competing hyper intelligent/ hyper dimensional beings. One mechanical and one of flesh. The mechanical one creates artificial intelligences/machines to protect Earth from the nightmarish existences that the flesh one creates. Basically the gods are AIs (or maybe ancient humans that became the first demigods?) their divine form being machines the size of small moons) defending Earth from extinction that is the Lovecraftian horrors coming for them. Main story is that the 4000 gods of all cultures are fighting off the eldritch horrors of Lovecraftian lore. The demigods now are beings created (half machine/half human) that defend Earth from threats that get there..

Though that will remove a lot of the kinks in the story I'm still working on some more that got generated. I should have a first chapter out in a month or two.

  I'm writing one now. It will be a Percy Jackson/SCP/Multi fan work. The issue with making a rational Percy Jackson is how irrational everyone is because of the fantastical elements. The novels are somewhat reflective of the modern myths which considering how old the gods and monsters are, makes no sense. You think thousands of years of experience would give the gods wisdom, but it doesn't.
#+end_quote

There's always the classic cop-out - that they're shaped by belief in such a manner that they can't change from the people who made those mistakes, because those mistakes are fundamental parts of the mythos and thus the belief that they rely upon.

One possible goal for them - possibly suggested by an outsider, given the nature of the problem - could be to overhaul those stories somehow, and improve themselves that way.

***** I guess that could work. The thing is the original books were like that too where the gods suddenly gain character development after thousands of years. Kind of makes the main character seem like the chosen one which I don't like (even though he technically is in canon). Also I never really understood what they did all day when they couldn't help the heroes in the first four books.

I would love to see a version of “The Lightning Thief” where everyone realizes how stupid and insane it is to send 12 year olds to retrieve a nuclear bomb.

*** I don't have anything exactly like worm, but here's some stuff that scratches some of the same itches that Worm did for me while being good enough that I can unqualifiedly recommend them:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]] The original rational superhero work by AlexanderWales, set in a somewhat AU superman. Discussion and use of (And well written use of) decision theory consequentialism, proxy conflict, and existential risk. Front warning that for better /and/ for worse it's from Lex Luthor's PoV, so that colors the story.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/batman-1939-the-dangers-of-being-cold.27163/][Batman 1939]] One of the best DC AUs I've ever seen, or just AUs in general. An excellent series of stories, about batman, that genuinely feel as though they were set in the late thirties. Excellent writing and research, heavy focus on realistic result following from the premises, doesn't shy away from negative results but only includes them when they're sensible.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/spider-liv-olivia-octavius-au-quest.53960/page-3#post-12218583][Spider-Liv]] Excellent Spider-Man fanfic in an AU marvel setting; among others, Olivia Octavia as Spider-Person, here Arachne. Features transhumanism, politics, AI.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.39011/][Assimilation]] Somewhat self indulgent DC fic, but much better than pretty much everything in the glut of YJ fics. Makes heavy use of nanotech, transhumanism, and DC lore. Main character is not always fully rational but it's the kind of thing that I'd expect people on r/r to appreciate.

--------------

These aren't really similar to worm at all, but I do think they can stand in terms of quality.

My Hero Academia is a fairly textbook Shonen Superhero story, but it's a well executed example of such. It doesn't have much in the way of new ideas, but if you like those there's a lot to reccomend it.

One Punch Man is hilarious if you don't mind a setting not taking itself seriously. The protagonist is good, but the best of it comes in the secondary characters like King.

The Incredibles and Into The Spider-verse are the best two mainstream superhero movies in the last few decades, if you're looking for something more mainstream.

--------------

If you're in the mood for more worm, I can reccomend some fanfics for it, starting with [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/][Impurity]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-finely-honed-blade-worm-kara-no-kyoukai-garden-of-sinners.32454/][A FInely Honed Blade]], but I could go on so I'll hold off unless you're interested.

However, I would caveat that the beginning built up my expectation for a fairly rational story. Thus, the second half felt disappointing due to (in my opinion) overuse of tropes and the scarily competent opposition suddenly picking up lots of idiot balls.

*** Citadel: Training in Necessity is, as far as I've read (book 2, ~chapter 35), an excellent superhero story.

[[https://unillustrated.wordpress.com/monster/]]

Book 1 is primarily an exploration of powers and training a class of heroes, while allowing for plot development & progression amidst dramatic tension.

It is at least rational-adjacent and might be considered rational (I'd have to re-read to confirm, but it was posted here a fair bit years ago).

Although it is on hiatus (since 2017) and incomplete, I still strongly recommend it if you're able and willing to deal with the general disappointment of an incomplete work for the sake of the rest.

*** Nope not at all, so now I just read worm fanfics :)

I did however find one series that hit some of the same notes. Chronicles of Fid has Dr. Fid, the world's greatest supervillain, fight to save the world. The main character's pretty edgy and the story is an age old cliche, but it's a fun romp regardless. He comes off adult in his edginess, and his development isn't as straightforward as it could've been, which made it interesting. It's also complete at 3 books on amazon.

For worm fanfics, recently I've really enjoyed Brockton's Celestial Forge. It's a tinker OC fic, with the powers being basically Inspired Inventor lite from worm cyoa v1. It depicts characters well, and while the main character is increasing in power really quickly, he's still shit at dealing with PR and politics, which means conflict ensues! It's really good, and updates with 10-20k words every week.

Dungeon Crawler Carl is sorta like that. We always read from his pov, so anything we learn he learns. He also tries to be smart with his decisions, although from time to time he makes emotionally charged decisions as well.

Miles Cameron's Masters and Mages mainly follows one character, which leads to reader having same info as character. It's not entirely rational since the magic in it is more mystical and people more emotional.

For equity investing, there are a few widely-accepted stylized facts which you should be aware of.

- You basically can't outperform the market. A lot of very smart people with the best credentials are paid a lot of money to try. Some of them succeed, but not consistently, and it's difficult to tell if they just got lucky over a short period and are about to revert to the mean.

- Corollary to the above point -- there are some things about investing you can control. You can control what mix of assets you invest in -- which will have different expected returns and behaviour. You can control the fees you're charged. You can't control the actual returns of what you invest in.

- Salespeople will suggest that because their product has outperformed over x number of years you should be willing to pay higher fees to invest in it. Generally this is wrong. Past performance does not reflect future results and there are a number of strategies in the active management industry to make it look like their product is worth the fees. One of the most classic is to start a number of funds (ten or more) with different investment strategies and wind down underperformers. After five or ten years, one of them will have outperformed the market by chance, and this will be the one they're pitching to you ten years later. The fact that this has performed better than the market by chance in the past does not mean it is likely to perform better in the future!

- Because of this, the best investing strategy is to invest in the broadest possible basket of companies at the lowest cost, typically using broad-market mutual funds or ETFs. You accept that market returns are fine for you (keeping in mind that market returns are much better than what the [[https://www.thebalance.com/why-average-investors-earn-below-average-market-returns-2388519][average equity investor receives]]).

There are also some popular niches like real estate investing, which actually are complex.

That reminds me of an early email scam I read about. It promises to sell a program predict football results (presumably for betting). It works like this.

You start off with a large dataset of active emails. Before the next match, you split your set in two and send two emails. The first group has team A win, the second has team B win. The email says this is a free trial and you can buy latter when convinced.

No one is going to be convinced by a single correct email prediction. So before the next match, you take the email set, throw away those you gave incorrect predictions, divide the remainder between Team C and Team D and sent out the predictions.

This contains on and on, with people believing you've successfully predicted many matches. Your software must really work!

*** In contrast to the other conservative and safe commenters, I think you can beat the market by picking the right sectors to invest in. You'll do better by picking the sectors on the leading edge of growth. Growth is likely to be lopsided and biased towards certain directions. In the 1870s it was railways, in the 1920s it was automobiles, in the 1950s and 60s it was consumer electrics, 1980s electronics and for the past 10-20 years its been digital and electronics. This is a riskier path, where you have to think about speculative booms and busts, actually manage your money. And certainly, you can lose a lot of money if you get timing or target wrong.

But the potential rewards are much higher. Who isn't kicking themselves that they didn't invest in bitcoin in 2012? Google in '00? Facebook, Tesla, the FAANGs in general have been going up because people realised that this is where the leading edge is. The best way to do well is to be in on the leading edge before everyone else finds out.

You ultimately have to decide where you think the global economy is going. I think, along with [[http://ark-invest.com/][others]] that world growth is going to be clustered in AI, blockchain, genetics, robotics and so on. There are even ETFs that focus on these sort of innovative technologies.

Furthermore, I believe that no investment is really 'safe' outside boring stuff like gold. Index funds are just as vulnerable as crypto to these world-shaking systemic shocks: Coronavirus especially proved this. Better to hold a lot of risky investments that yield high potential rewards than just be picking up pennies from under a steamroller. The most you can lose is 100% of your investment, while there's virtually no limit on the upside.

My whole point is that given the most you can lose is everything, you should try and maximise the potential upside. Danger can't rise like reward can.

You can't lose more money than you put in (-100%). You can gain more than what you put in (+7000%). Given that the potential loss is limited, you're better off buying more 'risky' investments. Remember, the majority of risk comes from unknown unknowns: black swans like coronavirus or the GFC. Better to get something out of an inherently volatile system than just get hammered on 'safe' investments that yield low returns. Nothing is truly safe in the long-term.

Think about the poor Germans who invested in government bonds in WW1, the ones who did the 'safe' thing and left their money in the bank rather than buy shares or property. All wiped out in the 1923 hyperinflation. The world is volatile and we should embrace and profit from uncertainty.

Your premise is that the market is highly volatile and there could be an extreme risk. But you overcorrect and lean into this absolutely bizarre idea that the best investment strategy is to aim for the highest volatility approach possible. I'm sorry, it's nonsensical.

If I offer you three to one odds on a fair coin toss, you should take it, even on the off-chance I might die before you can collect. That miniscule chance doesn't mean you should take a bet where you get 1:2 odds just because I say I will take as many bets as you want to place.

I'm saying that because of black swans like 9/11, you shouldn't invest in 'safe' 'mature' companies like airlines or banks. That's because they yield low rewards but in exchange they promise to be safe and consistent. Safety and consistency are illusions. There's always going to be danger. Therefore, you're taking lower rewards instead of higher rewards for no reason.

Market volatility doesn't apply to personal decision-making, obviously. If the Twin Towers are blown up, or nuclear terrorism happens, you aren't likely to be killed. It's fairly unlikely any of this stuff kills you. But it can take away your money because you're investing in a worldwide economy, not the tiny geographic space you actually live in. That's why some gold can also be useful and why it's a good idea to have some long-term food storage.

Yeah, it's a bad idea building houses on faultlines, or in fire-prone areas for that matter. If I could, I'd live somewhere safe from these obvious known risks. That's pretty basic stuff. Of course, nobody can guard against every kind of risk. Have you read Antifragile? Taleb doesn't say to stay in a bunker in New Zealand cowering from all the danger in the world. That's the opposite of his point. He says to be aware of and embrace risk, make yourself antifragile so you profit from volatility. That's what I'm trying to do.

For an example of what I'm talking about, I've checked my rough ROI over the last two years since when I started with this strategy and it's >36% because I put most of my money in more recently. I'm sad about the decline from >68% in August when I mistimed things. But I picked a good sector and embraced volatility within it. The Dow Jones has been all but treading water in these last two years: its [[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia][returns are low]] and it's still exposed to the same tidal waves that destroy everything else.

Much better to pick a good sector like the Nasdaq which is up about 39% in that time period. Better yet, embrace volatility within the Nasdaq and get something like [[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TQQQ][TQQQ]] which has risen nearly 150% these last two years.

I'll admit that good timing is necessary to really do well with my strategy. One has to be fearful when others are greedy and vis versa. One has to have a steady hand, stress tolerance and confidence. But that's sort of the whole point of [[/r/rational][r/rational]], we're about trying to do better than everyone else by clever thinking, munckinry not hard work. The whole 'just regularly put money in an index fund' strategy can be greatly optimized.

Most of Brandon Sanderson's works are internally consistent and have believable societies and munchkin-ing. However a lot of people don't like his prose and direct way of storytelling. Still higher quality than most webnovels.

Joe Abercrombie's stuff isn't entirely rational, but his character writing is top notch. To the point where all decisions feel in-character and justified.

Robin Hobb's character writing imo is even better. Her main Fitz series books are her most well known works. Fitz himself is pretty stupid though, and keeps making the same mistakes while telling himself that he'll get better next time. Similar flavor of suffering as Joon from Worth the candle.
