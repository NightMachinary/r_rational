I see you folks are reading GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach. The book is filled with so many puzzles and self-referential jokes; I remember wondering when I read it years ago why he used that peculiar, specific phrase "an Eternal Golden Braid". Does that have some hidden meaning? An anagram or an encrypted message? I couldn't figure it out.


** Well, it also has the initial letters G, E, and B, albeit in different order.

*** Yeah, that's part of what makes it suspicious. Makes it's an anagram in another language?

**** Douglas Hofstafdter is fluent in French and spent some time translating his book himself. Mr. Tortoise becomes Madame Tortue to better fit the gender of the noun in that language.

***** do you have any more info / reference on that translation bit? He's not listed among the official translators of the French edition.

edit: also there's no evident anagram to "eternal golden braid" or its parts in French

** I mean, it's an anagram [[http://wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=eternal+golden+braid&t=1000&a=n][for a lot of things]]. But I don't think that it's an anagram for anything specific. (Douglas Hofstadter took over a column called "Mathematical Games" from Martin Gardner and renamed it as "Metamagical Themas", so he is a fan of anagrams.)

** Brain, rational, learn, agent. Not getting any good overall results, although these words stuck out to me. Probably coincidence, but on the other hand he is clever.
