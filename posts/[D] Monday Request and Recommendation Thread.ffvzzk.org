Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I read [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TTDGKP2/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0][Shade's First Rule]] and its sequel over the course of the week, and really enjoyed them.

I did nearly drop the first book because the main character was handed what looks like an obvious idiot ball in the first couple of chapters - he stops and tries to analyze a magical fight where one of the participants is actively trying to kill him, instead of running for safety.

But it turns out that's a genuine character flaw, and one that I feel like most rational characters would have in reality - a lot of the time rational fiction treats thinking as a free action, when it really isn't. You can't afford to spend a couple moments pondering stuff in the middle of a fight, and that lesson is beat into the main character over the course of book 1.

The book also poses a really interesting munchkiny problem: if you're a deity designing a set of classes for your people, how do you sneak power into them in a way that your fellow deities won't notice?

*** I'm about a third of the way into the first book, and see what you mean.

Though I don't think the protagonist's fascination with magic is that well justified.

Dude is 16 years old, in a town where every adult has a class and access to some magic. Even for peasants (Worker class) mundane tasks like lighting a fire have spells.

Yet he's acting like he has *never* seen magic used. Even though his very poorly introduced friend / father figure is a high level mage. Yes, popping off a fireball in the middle of town is irresponsible, but not badgering him to demonstrate /something/ is beyond belief.

Mana is cheap, so that isn't an excuse.

Also, WTF is the protag talking about saying he rarely meets anyone as smart as himself with his 16 Int. He meets a level 70+ worker, with 4 stat points per level, even with two points auto-assigned, that still leaves 140+ available... dropping 10 or 20 into Int at some point is quite likely.

Unless every non-mage is /so dumb/ that they treat Int as a dump stat forever.

If it was me, and I was a magic-obsessed teenager, I'd have asked the librarian every single little thing I could think of. He'd be sick of the questions, and probably would want to murder me at some point just to shut me up.

In Azarinth Healer's world of Elos, it is considered taboo to ask anyone about their class, skills or stats, and Ilea (the protagonist) is a recent arrival, so it was understandable that she didn't know about everything.

But this Ruwen has lived his whole life in this world. Didn't his parents (who only died / disappeared a year ago) have "the talk" with him at some point when he was growing up? Not the birds and the bees, but the stats and the skill trees. (har har)

Since mana total is based on Int, I'd think that he'd know /someone/ (which he totally does) who has an Int higher than 16.

They have an interaction in the second book that makes me think this was basically their relationship before the story started.

But again, a lot of teenagers spend their time talking about themselves in various ways, and don't bother asking other people about their lives. I'm sure he knew the librarian was a mage, but I don't think he'd really internalized that knowledge until he saw the fight. After all, not every mage in this world is a combat mage.

His mage/librarian friend was also keeping things on the down-low, which is probably another reason why he didn't realize just how powerful the guy was.

Y'know, I've noticed more and more as time goes on that I instinctively skim past cringy harem plots in webfics. This is not the first time. I only realize it when it's pointed out to me. An interesting character...flaw? Trait?

(I was the guy who recced WotR last week.)

Anyhoozles.

I've posted it here before, but I think that the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27993770-born][Dire Saga]] by Andrew Seiple has a vaguely similar tone. Happy-go-lucky murderhobo type vibe (though in this one there's no actual murdering). Good, clean, insane fun. Premise is a fairly typical superhero world in which the protagonist is a debatably mad scientist who just. wants. to uplift. society, but the stupid heroes keep getting in the way. Highly recommend the series. Just don't take it too seriously - it's very over the top, in a self-aware sort of way.

**** I want to anti-rec Gilded Hero. It's technically proficient, but anti-rational and not a really fun read. I hear it called 'realistic' over at RR, but I'd go with 'grimderp' instead.

I'll stick to the first couple thousand words to not spoil anything, (chap 1-6 spoilers) but the story reveals in chapter 1 that it's got a hard system. Like, stat levels, classes/skills you get from stats, etc.. Getting a skill makes you have a huge World of Warcraft style ding with a flash of light and thunder. Skills are big deals with requisite stats, and the early goal is to get a skill.

Aaaand it takes weeks of in-story time before anyone even asks what stats anybody has. I thought it might be a system unique to the MC, but literally everybody on the planet has stats and none of the trainers thought to ask while they were fumbling around trying to get skills.

Not for any reason. The author just seemed to have some scenes they wanted so they ignored the physics of the world so they could have those scenes. That's all.

As far as I can tell, the whole story is like this where there's no verisimilitude and it would take all of 5 minutes of thought for characters to act realistically instead.

*** I too binged this one overt the past week, and greatly enjoyed it. It's somehow effortlessly clever and funny, and I found myself thinking many times how much better this freaking free webnovel is then just about any book I've read (and paid for) in the past year, and certainly better than any comedy book I've read since Pratchett died.

And man is it original! The setting is a bit humdrum at times, but then all of a sudden the magic system or worldbuilding will shock me with how cool and clever it is. Not to mention the plot, which I suspect is at least partly inspired by some of the best parts of HPMoR.

I often see glimmers of Mother of Learning and Worth the Candle in the powers and power interactions, as well, like how the MC gets a lot of cheats, but it never actually feels like they're cheats because not only does he never stop being challenged, he also never stops challenging himself and pushing himself further, often crazily so.

But yeah, the only real mark against it is the unfortunate presence of the dreaded harem, made even worse by the increasing flanderization of the female characters, which in the later chapters has become bad enough to detract from my enjoyment of the story a bit.

***** You realize that Calvin is basically an alternate version of Elliot, right? That when his mother tried to summon a perfect hero, the system incarnated Elliot into the body of a newborn, I.E. it thought Elliot(or an alternate version thereof) was the perfect hero to tackle all the world's problems. I suspect that this is [HPMoR SPOILERS] a deliberate reference to HPMoR, where Harry Potter was a mindwiped copy of Voldemort's soul who was raised as an infant by caring, loving parents, and turned out reasonably well-adjusted, and who was the only one who could psycho!voldemort(it takes one to know one kind of thing.

So either the system made Elliot an advisor to himself, or more likely Elliot avoided getting mindwiped by copying himself into the system(itself a deliberate play on the xianxia trope of having an ancestor ghost advisor, I think). Yes, Calvin is impulsive and arrogant and reckless and that's bad, but that's baked into his character from the very beginning and he's being punished for his hubris, as he should be. His negative traits are also obviously being aggravated by Calvin's unbroken string of successes, and above all by having Elliot as a little amoral devil on his shoulder egging him on to greater risk/reward scenarios, with the threat of turning The One against him if he doesn't advance fast enough.

Like I said, I think that outside the harem stuff this writer is on top of his game, big kudos to him.

And even before - needlessly antagonizing their hosts during a diplomatic venture to make more money (when they were guaranteed great returns just doing the trading / using the automatons as craftsmen).

I guess my main issue here is that Kala has personality exactly to the degree that it's convenient to the main character. Any time Calvin wants to do something that Kala shouldn't approve of, it's not even that they argue and he has his way - it's just never brought up.

** The trope of underestimating an overpowered main character has been done to dust by now, but what about overestimation? Specifically, something like the MC going on a jaunty adventure with no clear plan, which figures of authority work themselves up about and completely misinterpret as having some clear reasoning and deep political motivations, with some tragic background to go along with it.

The protagonist is a salaryman who was isekaid into an alternate universe in which magic is real. He grows up as an orphan girl (Tanya) pressed into service in World War I due to her strong aptitude for magic.

Other characters view Tanya as a prodigy who is bloodthirsty to spearhead the fight and/or a valiant saint who sacrifices herself for her troops and her homeland. In reality, everything Tanya does is a desperate attempt to get herself redeployed away from the front lines. Unfortunately for her, her superior officers and underlings keep misinterpreting her words, and her plans go unaccountably well despite her best attempts to fail.

Actually, Delinquency Record is super close to "the MC going on a jaunty adventure with no clear plan, which figures of authority work themselves up about and completely misinterpret as having some clear reasoning and deep political motivations" - Tanya just wants to make enough money to retire and avoid the authorities, but they keep on hunting her down which means she needs to keep on making geopolitically destabilizing moves by accident.

A character who knows what they /think/ they want, and goes out of their way to get it/refuse to be distracted from it, even if it's a poor long-term strategy - is immediately relatable in a way that 'swallowed-the-dictionary-and-sounds-like-every-other-character' NPC number 15 doesn't.

** Any suggestions for something that's, for lack of a better term, Wizards As Fuck? /Earthsea/ definitely fits the Wizards As Fuck vibe, while /Mother of Learning/ and /Harry Potter/ do not. All three certainly contain magic, but only Earthsea has the sort-of-Arthurian vibe I'm looking for.

I suspect something's wizardness depends strongly on both the mechanics of the world (true name magic, geases, the fae, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords) and the structure of the plot, but I lack the vocabulary to express it more concisely.

  Magic exists. It has Rules. The Rules are incredibly complex, to the point where they're nearly impossible to describe in words. However, by becoming Wizard As Fuck, the main character gains a transcendental understanding of The Rules, and is thus able to Do The Real Magic.

"Off to Be the Wizard" by Scott Meyer has wizardry which is actually programming. It doesn't go too deep into the programming aspect and is more lighthearted wish fulfillment but it was a fun read.

The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss is good and about a school of magic. The third book will be released any decade now.

** I have been reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-throne-of-heaven-a-bleach-rewrite.56774][The Throne of Heaven]] which someone posted in this sub last week or so, it's a rewrite of Bleach that attempts to make sense and tie everything together from the very beginning. It's an enjoyable read if you're fan of the series and can get past the fact the writer is in desperate need of a beta.

Another Bleach fanfic that I also would like to recommend is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bleach-worm-arana.305947/][Arana]] by the (in)famous Ryuugi (so don't expect it to be finished, ever). It's a Worm/Ward crossover, but you don't need much knowledge about Ward to enjoy it since it pretty much does away with canon early on. Honestly, I'm not sure whether I would say there's much about the fic itself that is worth writing home about (aside from the last few chapters which are great), no I'm recommending this more due to the sheer amount of worldbuilding/rants/informational posts that it has, which are probably twice the word count of the fic itself. How much value you get out of it probably depends on how much you care about making some sense out of Bleach's highly convoluted setting, and how much Ward bashing you can handle (although most of his criticism is pretty legit, but it's a pseudo-rational analysis of a work that is not trying to be rational at all so tread with care I guess).

Anyone know of any other good, or at least decent or interesting Bleach fics that are worth reading?

It's set in a post-singularity future where a superintelligence has imposed a set of rules on anything less powerful than itself. These rules include things like: don't replicate uncontrollably, and their effect on the setting includes a cyberpunk alternate reality controlled by a game system. Pretty wild stuff.

She approaches the situation in an incredibly pragmatic way, modulo still being a real human being with the flaws and motivations of a human being. She sets about fixing the problems that plagued her youth, but everything doesn't go perfectly just because she has future knowledge.

**** Okay I've got a bunch since Thatguy didn't say anything.

For rwby there's stuff by Coeur Al'aran, although all his stories follow Jaune. Plus his writing can be hit or miss for people. I find his stuff to be more competent than 90% of the stuff on ff.net, so ymmv. I really liked his Forged Destiny and Relic of the Future.

An Exercise in Stupidity is an interesting Gamer story (set in rwby), in that the main character is very decisive and stubborn, and bulldozes his way through pretty much anything. This is hilarious at times because you'd expect him to pay attention to seemingly plot events but no, he just trucks on. His build is also about being as tanky as possible, which I don't see much on system stories.

Biomass Effect is one of my favorite unfinished fanfics. It explores the mass effect universe if the Blacklight virus from Prototype took over humanity and made its entirety a hivemind basically. Lots of really cool biological technology (which is improved and upgraded) and some interesting mechanics behind how you'd have a main character at that point. It's not too rational though, and some decisions can feel explicitly idiot-ball-y.

Man off the Moon is a Mass Effect/Fate:GO crossover, with EMIYA being unleashed on the galaxy. He's every bit the Gary Stu that he should be, and the mystery is pretty well done. Pacing really suffers in the middle but it has picked back up in the last few chapters (on hiatus though...). Also hilarious at times, when EMIYA tries to downplay his feats.

With Strength of Steel Wings has some of the best magic description I've read. It's a harry potter fanfic, with OP Harry. Basically some muggles figure out that wizards exist, and send Harry to be a spy. A lot of magical rituals and tattoo magic, with some absolutely breathtaking descriptions of magic.

There's a bunch of Fate/Stay Night fics that are enjoyable. Most of the ones I liked are about Shirou learning about the Holy Grail War early on, and developing his abilities before it takes place. There's From Fake Dreams (which is very popular and has mixed opinions by the Fate fandom), Fate: Unbalanced Scales, and Path of the King. They do all kinda escalate into Michael bay films, so ymmv.

Unmade is a really nice fanfic of Oregairu, with Hachiman and co. as adults after graduation. Hachiman is a detective with some military experience. The story's about a crime mystery, plus how Hachiman once more comes into contact with his old friends and crushes. It's really cute at times, and the writing is good.

Greg Veder vs The World is a Worm fanfic with Greg getting The Gamer power. It escalates like all gamer stories do, but it's written well enough to be enjoyable. Plus Greg's development is nice to see.

There's an interesting erotica called The Gamer, found on chyoa.com (it's like a text based adventure website). Follow the route written by neo_kenka. It's like an erotica version of The Gamer manhua. I both recommend and un-recommend this. It's interesting in how it explores sapient creatures created by the MC's system, and their dubious existence (are they automatons? do they have free will? Are they philosophical zombies?). There's some sorta deconstruction going on also with the MC's charisma and libido stat(which is ever rising), as well as his role as The Gamer (his origin and purpose). And the mc's build is really cool, it's like a mix between dimensionalism and summoning. Also copious amounts of sex and bodily fluids, hence the un-recommendation. Really interesting if you can get past that though.

***** Man off the moon is a crossover with Fate/Extra, not Fate/ Grand order. Definitely seconding the rec tho.

****** Huh I didn't know that. In the spacebattles forums a lot of people were talking about F:GO so I assumed. Speaking of which, it's no longer on hiatus! Although the author said in their latest chapter that they won't be updating at the same breakneck pace it used to be (It was something ridiculous like 10k words a week).

*** I've never actually seen A Cold Calculus recommended anywhere online, and it's a real shame, as it has to be the best Code Geass fanfiction I've read.

It follows Euphemia in an (alternate) alternate history in which she eventually becomes the Empress of Britannia. (I'm not spoiling anything, it tells you outright at the beginning that she's the empress by the end.)

It has some great worldbuilding gems that really flesh out the world of Code Geass, and it puts a lot more attention into the politics than the canon series. Easily my third favourite fanfiction of all time.

****** Honestly it helps and you might not appreciate the changes from jojo cannon if you do but I would say it stands perfectly well on its own merits and if you know code geass then it's really all you need.

*** [[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight/][First Flight]]📷 Is an excellent read, I particularly like the Kern trees and the worldbuilding around them. Can stand alone perfectly well too. Changeling space program is surprisingly good considering it's a KSP and MLP crossover, a definite cut below, a simpler story with simpler writing but still remarkably good. I would call them both rational adjacent, I liked how in CSP Chrysalis isn't a flat character and actually thinks things through.

*** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/clarisse-quest-now-in-part-ii-revolutionary-girl-clarisse-a-pmmm-tts-quest.44100/][This pmmm]] quest is a crackfic based on a fanfic, so very overlooked. No prior knowledge is required ( I have none). Later chapters have fewer than ten reacts. Fun mix of cute, crack, fluff, timetravel, mindwipes, pmmm stuff like that.

**** I read that for a while, but dropped it at ~80% of where it is now (it was up to date at the time) because it felt like it was getting really very convoluted to the point where I didn't really understand what was happening beyond the absolute surface level and I... just didn't really care enough to try and figure out what was going on? I was also incredibly put off by what happened with Mami - when she started referring to herself in the third person and like a baby, I felt like I'd stumbled into someone's fetish and I really hadn't signed up for that.

Maybe it's better now and I missed a bunch of explanations and straightening out of the plot, but I'm sufficiently put off by the thought of having to go back and figure out what was going on to catch up when I didn't understand the first time around that I don't think I will.

EDIT: The lack of understanding would probably be enough to drop a novel if no answers were forthcoming, but as this is actually a Quest where readers vote on what to do next it was especially frustrating.

***** It actually all unravels and gets explained not far past where you were. Personally, I really enjoyed the convoluted craziness, in the way I can enjoy a horror movie. The Mami thing is part of that doubting reality horror.
