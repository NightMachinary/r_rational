So it's no secret that there are thousands of alien invasion stories that take the form of movies, tv shows, books, anime, comics, and animation. Sometimes we are the invaded and sometimes we are the invaders. But are their any works of fiction that give rational reasons on why aliens would want to invade Earth?

Before you make you post let me just write two lists one with rational reasons and one with non-rational reasons on why the invasion happened.

First, the non-rational:

1. They want to harvest our natural resources-- this is a popular explanation in science fiction stories like Oblivion, and Battle of LA. The aliens have come to our world to harvest our natural resources like water, and valuable minerals. The problem with this reason is that most the resources the aliens want are in much more abundance on asteroids, moons, and other planets within our solar system. For example if the Tet needs more water to fuel itself, it can easily go to Europa where it can get all the water it needs. (Exceptions to this rule include stories where Earth has a fictional element that is valuable for highly advanced technology like vibranium.)
2. They want to use us as incubators-- while not as popular as number one, it is one of the older explanations on why aliens would want to come to Earth. Basically the aliens need humans and other different species to reproduce. This seems unlikely because for one thing these aliens are likely to have biologically differences with us that will cause complications during reproduction. Besides assuming these aliens are highly advance they should be able to possess artificial means of reproduction like cloning and or artifical wombs and insemination. The only exception to this are aliens that were designed to reproduce by impregnating members of different species like the xenomorphs, or Zerg.
3. They think we taste good- a popular conception from the Twilight Zone. In one episode, aliens come to Earth so we can become their livestock. They even created a cookbook on how to do it. While imaginative, it is high improbable again due to biological differences. We might taste like dirt to them, or worse we may be poisonous to the aliens. And again, the aliens can easily grow food in habitats and reproduce meat substitutes like plant-based meats instead of harvesting entire species and planets for food.

Now, some of the more rational reasons:

1.  They want to use us as slaves- so I know this doesn't sound rational because if we do encounter aliens they will probably have advanced technology that would replace the need for slaves and most forms of manual labor. However, if aliens do enslave us they will want to use us for other reasons. For example, a group of aliens that is centered around the hunting of other creatures like the Predators or the Hirogen might conquer humans so they might turn us into game for their hunts. Another possibility is that they want to enslave us for their galactic equivalent of the Hunger Games, as entertainment for the masses. A third possibility is that they want to turn us into slave soldiers like the goa'uld did with the Jaffa and the Espheni did with the Skitters to fight and conquer other worlds and species.
2.  Earth is a prime piece of galactic real-estate- in this scenario Earth is in a strategic galactic location and the aliens want to conquer our planet to gain said location. Examples include Earth location near or on a key galactic trade/travel route, being on the border of a galactic power, or Earth is in a key military location between two warring alien factions. A notable example is Justice League: Starcrossed where the Thanagarians invade Earth because it's the perfect place to stage a counter-attack against their enemies.
3.  They want to harvest the power of the sun- This scenario is one that I have heard from a youtube video. Basically, the aliens aren't interested in Earth just it's sun, because g-type stars like our are a stable source of energy and the aliens want that energy for themselves.
4.  They want to harvest organic life as a fuel source- This one I got from watching a national geo documentary "When aliens attack". In this scenario the aliens are a race of harvesters who take over worlds filled with organic life as a power source. This seems like a probable reason because we are the only planet in the solar system that have an abundance of organic life.
5.  The aliens want more of our art and culture- this scenario is one of the more optimistic scenarios on why aliens would want to make contact with us. Basically the aliens have found one of our probes with a mixtape of the various types of music that Earth has to offer (Bach, Mozart, Chuck Barry). So they come to our world to learn more about our art and culture and in return they give us rare minerals, exotic alien goods, and hopefully advanced technology, though the last one may vary depending on their non-interference policy. They are also very unlikely to wage war on us, because they don't want to destroy their newfound interests. One notable example are the Centauri who are interested in certain parts of human culture like poker.
6.  The aliens are refugees- a more popular scenario from science fiction stories, in this plot the aliens have just lost their homeworld, or are on the run from another hostile alien race. Basically they have come to Earth for the sames reasons anybody would want to immigrate, for a chance at a better life and better opportunities. Notable examples include District 9, and Alien Nation, but stories like Defiance doesn't count because the aliens with terraforming technology would have an easier time colonizing Mars without any fuss.
7.  The aliens are the equivalent to the romans/Nazis- in this scenario the aliens want to conquer Earth because warfare is part of their culture or they have an ideology like the Nazis that states that the aliens are the Supreme race and therefore they have a duty to rule over and/or exterminate inferior species. Whether this will benefit Earth is 50/50 because if the Aliens are anything like the Romans this might be a good thing because while the Romans did enslave and conquer other groups of people they also brought with them benefits that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7HmhrgTuQ][improved their standard of living]]. In which case, the aliens might end up bringing potential benefits to Earth like the end of war, poverty, and the eradication of several diseases. If the Aliens are more like the Nazis then we might be in trouble because the Nazis not only exterminated the Jews, but [[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/prisoners-of-the-camps][anyone who did not fit in]] with their views of the Ubermensch. The aliens might do the same thing to us, or any group of humans that they consider impure.
8.  The aliens are the equivalent to religious zealots- in this scenario the aliens society is dominated by a religion, and their main goal is to spread said religion across the universe. In which case first contact will happen either one of two ways: the Aliens are missionaries who want to spread their religion across the universe, or they are conquerors who want to spread their religion through force. Again how much this will benefit Earth is 50/50 because while both religious missionaries and conquerors in the past have treated people of different religions with condescension or as second-class citizens they also brought with them access to higher education, and advanced medicine and, much like the romans, they [[https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Lumen_Learning/Book%3A_Western_Civilization_I_(Lumen][improved the standard of living]]/13%3A_Week_11%3A_Islam_cont_Charlemagne_and_Russia/13.2%3A_Reading%3A_The_Umayyad_and_Abbasid_Empires) for both believers, and non-believers. On the other hand our treatment under the Aliens would also depend on the Aliens or the Aliens leader tolerance towards non-believers, people of different sexual orientation, the mentally-ill, and the mentally-disabled.
9.  The aliens are assimilators- this is probably the worse case scenario, where the aliens are the equivalent of the Borg, the Cybermen, or the Reapers where they want to convert or assimilate us into them. Notable obvious examples where this plays out include Star Trek, Doctor Who, and Mass Effect.
10. Humans have advance technology that the aliens want or must destroy- so in this scenario the aliens are attacking Earth because we have developed advanced technology that they want like nanotechology, or they want to prevent us from developing the galactic equivalent equivalent of the atom bomb like exotic matter. This vaguely happens in Titan A.E. where a group of aliens destroy Earth to prevent humanity from becoming a threat.
11. Earth has ancient technology that we don't even now about- in this scenario Earth has precursor technology that we weren't event aware about and the aliens want that technology for themselves. Notable examples of this scenario are in the Stargate universe, and the Halo universe.
12. The aliens are an advanced civilization of dinosaurs returning home- in this scenario the aliens are an underground civilization or spacefaring civilization of evolved dinosaurs that escaped Earth's surface hundreds of years to prevent themselves from going extinct. Now these ultraterristials have come back home only to find us as the new inhabitants. Notable examples of this playing out include the Silurians from Doctor Who and the Voth from Star Trek: Voyager, although in the later case their society isn't interested in going back to Earth.

** Another possible rational one:

FTL is cheap, terraforming is not, and comfortably habitable planets are rare enough to make an invasion worthwhile.

As a result, taking over territory is orders of magnitude easier than terraforming. Warfare is so easy in fact, that Earth is the odd one out with unique selective pressures on Earth, while the rest of space society develops differently in culture...

*** The specific mechanics of FTL matter too. To take an extreme example, you could imagine a situation like Stargate: the aliens have a teleporter that goes to Earth, and doesn't go to Mars. They can march over to Earth with their Death Robots or War Cyborgs or whatever, but they don't have any particular space launch capability, let alone terraforming.

Alternatively, maybe the alien's approach to interstellar travel is to launch a really big ship at a planet which lands automatically and dumps out aliens. For whatever reason, their ship doesn't realize there's already a civilization on Earth, so they can't jump over to Mars until they establish an industrial base here.

Or maybe the aliens use some kind of psychic stardrive that can only go to inhabited planets. If they go too far away from a source of bio-energy, their technology starts to fail.

Provided you're willing to accept technical constraints on the problem, it's /relatively/ easy to get "aliens are stuck with Earth" as an output.

Granted, you could make the rationalization that the aliens would wipe us out with their advance weaponery, but I'd like to think we would put up a fight before they conquer us. But then again maybe I'm a little too optimistic.

********* I mean, there's a question of exactly how long-term a plan it really has to be. We assume terraforming is a ten-thousand year project based on our current notions of human industrial capacity, but imagine a von neumann probe that comes into the solar system and recursively reproduces until all the space-bound matter is industry (and say it starts cracking mercury, while it's at it.) How long would that take, given exponential growth and a relatively technologically mature level of technology? If you were willing to spend lots of energy to get seed probes to different parts of the solar system faster, weeks, maybe?

After that, it's a matter of 'how fast do we want those comets on mars, and what portion of the dyson sphere's energy output are we willing to spend on the project?'

Then colonization or terraforming is irrelevant, since humanity won't survive the project. Plus, that level of civilization doesn't need to terraform Mars or colonize Earth, they'll get more use out of converting the whole solar system to Orbitals and Ships.

Any civilization that needs planets can't be significantly ahead of us in Kardashev level. They're just another K0, maybe a bit richer.

**** Assuming that their needs are roughly equivalent to ours, Earth has a functional, self-regulating atmosphere complete with ozone layer and GHG to keep warm, an active magnetic field to ensure we keep it, an active carbon-oxygen cycle, and it's in the Goldilocks zone for liquid water.

Getting Mars to that state is /theoretically/ possible, but terraforming requires an expenditure of energy and resources on the scale of an entire planet and the resources of much of a solar system, generally over centuries, whereas fictional SF FTL usually involves energy expenditures on the scale of what can be carried along on the journey. (Just the energy required to give Mars a rotating core capable of generating a sufficiently protective magnetic field is staggering. It's probably be orders of magnitude cheaper to build a shield against the solar wind in between Mars and the Sun, and that's not small potatoes either.)

In contrast, when you control orbits, wiping out an earthbound civilization down to the level where the survivors are essentially Stone Age primitives with a manageable fraction of their population is the effort of a few years or decades of dropping rocks from above at most. Smash us to the bedrock, let a few generations pass to lose any remaining scientific and technical ability to resist, and return to reap the spoils.

And if you get too aggressive with the bombardment, you can just leave for a while and come back to a planet that might be stuck in an Ice Age but with still living oceans, which is leagues ahead of where Mars starts -- a frozen ball of rock with almost no atmosphere or surface liquid water, mostly thanks to no magnetic fields to prevent hydrogen from getting stripped away by the solar winds, much less any kind of self-sustaining ecology.

*Edit:* That's without considering all the things that may just be impossible or expensive to engineer nicely that humans will want in other star systems: near-Earth gravity, a day-night cycle that won't mess up our circadian rhythms, not being tidally-locked, survivable atmospheric pressure, lack of many natural contaminants like heavy metals and chloride chemistry, a good ratio of nitrogen to oxygen, gentle axial tilt giving seasons and reasonable weather, a simple tidal system due to one moon, an orbit well-cleared of dinosaur-killers, a stable star that rarely sends out solar flares beyond what a civilization can deal with, no nearby quasars to sterilize the system, etc.

Planets capable of supporting /some/ kind of life might be common and yet planets capable of comfortably supporting /us/ might exceptionally rare gems worth the hassle of dropping rocks on monkeys.

** One scenario you missed is where earth is basically collateral damage in a conflict between two different alien factions. For example in the first Men in Black where an alien species shows up and threatens to annihilate the planet unless we return the macguffin, which was stolen by a different alien. Another example comes from StarCraft, where the Protoss destroy Terran worlds as part of their war against the Zerg (Although technically not Earth, they are still human planets).

I'm sure there are other examples of this basic theme.

I'm thinking of a scenario where earth is not inherently a target of the aliens, but just collateral damage. The aliens may not even want to invade earth.

Imagine the following. Some alien space terrorist group is discovered hiding out on earth. The local Galactic Empire sends in the military to arrest him. It's not even an invasion force, just a small elite unit, a couple hundred thousand ships at most.

They aren't attacking humans. In fact their mission is explicitly to minimize destruction of the native life forms. Before the mission was even approved, experts analyzed dozens of scenarios, and losses to native life are expected to be no more than 10% to 20%, which is considered acceptable.

As a corollary to reason 1: They might want humans as slaves because while automation is possible, general AI might be impossible or categorically unsafe.

Take having a free, open society vs a more authoritarian society. The perks of a free society enable growth in science and the arts, but makes it more vulnerable to espionage and more difficult to plan long term projects. The perks of an authoritarian system chinese style are quick execution of infrastructure projects and a guided industrial policy, but suffers from less individual freedom and less creativity.

** It's a bit similar to 2, but I think a setup like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoDominium][CoDominium]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/41767-starfire][Starfire]], [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CG2QZ1?ref_=dbs_p_mng_rwt_ser_shvlr&storeType=ebooks][Antares]], or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga][Vorkosigan]] series does a good job of providing a rational rationale for interstellar warfare.

Basically, the way FTL works is that there are "warp points" that provided instantaneous travel between star systems (potentially separated by great distances in real space). This means that the number of systems accessible to any given civilization is pretty low, but that civilizations that are distant in real terms can come in contact with each-other. As noted, this is kind of like Earth being prime real estate, but rather that Earth being especially desirable it's more that there aren't very many alternatives.

Another thing these settings typically do is declare that FTL is relatively easy, technically speaking. This means that in addition to Sol system being the only choice the aliens have, they can't just terraform Mars or Venus into something better-suited to their needs. Arguably this is a stretch, but any kind of interstellar war scenario means a great deal of "tech tree" fuckery to avoid curbstomp scenarios, or extremely unsatisfying battle scenes.

Some technologies will be missed due to civilization cultural/developmental bias. To explore these missed technologies safely fresh civilizations seeded to be as diverse as possible. However then seeded civ stray too much from some promising direction corrective invasion could be used.
- MMORPG. Invaders drop down and play, purely for entertainment. Could be PvP. PvE is especially unpleasant for natives.

another thing could be that some earthling species, either humans or some other species, could be biologically similar to another alien race. either the superior human alien species tries to eliminate us for ruining their reputation, or their enemies capture us for experimenting bioweapons that would be harmful on the human aliens (which they wouldnt need to try hard for lol, as we humans have gotten very good at killing other humans)

**** not exactly. i was thinking about if some alien species were like what MCU & popular media portray em as, aka humans but with green skin, then some of those species might not like the fact that earthlings are stupidly killing themselves & their planet. theyd kill us out of pettiness because they dont want to be compared to us

ultraterrestials could easily have similar motivations for wanting humanity gone. their race of superior beings would hate being compared to a barbaric species like modern humans & would maybe even destroy the whole planet just to erase theif dark history.

both reasons dont have to be because other alien species are the problem tho. plenty of empires would want the disfavorable parts to be censored, and removing humanity & earth entirely could be part of theid effort of glorifying their empire & their species

** Possible redemption of the 'harvesting resources':

They could just be harvesting everything in the solar system and Earth is enough of a threat that they choose to remove it first.

--------------

"We Are Bob" has some invading aliens that gamma ray blast planets and then suck up all the organic compounds for reuse to grow their own populations. Its generally a rational story and pretty fun read.

--------------

Another reason for invasion: Earth is just in the way of a mundane expansion. Its not important or strategic, its just that FTL doesn't exist and skipping over a solar system could mean an extra ten thousand years of travel. They don't really want to fight us, but we don't really want them strip mining the entire solar system either (even if they left Earth alone). And we /do/ have the capability of launching nukes into space, so maybe that is enough of a danger for them. Though they could just soften us up with a few asteroids before actually invading.

This is partially the story that takes place in half life. The Combine has an empire connected through portals, but not really FTL. And I think its necessary for the other side to open the portal for them to jump through. So they are just always going to invade when a portal opens up.

--------------

Another potentially rational reason for us to be invaded: for shits and giggles.

Ya it doesn't sound rational. But if you are a highly advanced alien race maybe re-enacting independence day is a fun scenario. Imagine a kid with an ant farm who chooses to introduce red ants to the black ant nest and watch them fight. The kid has any number of options for actually wiping out the ant farm, but that isn't any fun.

This gets even more messed up if we are the product of accelerated evolution and we were literally created for entertainment purposes.

Oddly I think of all the possible alien invasion scenarios this is probably the only one where we have a chance in hell of winning.

** Given that biological life is functionally just naturally occuring nanotechnology, I feel like you're not giving the 'they want to harvest our natural resources' angle enough credit. Obviously they're not after water and iron, but the biochemical outputs of novel evolutionary pathways? That's one of the major selling points for conservation of the Amazon, all of that precious, precious biodiversity.

*** Peter Watts' novelization of Crysis 2 is along those lines--- The aliens keep Earth---and countless other planets---as “gardens” they can harvest materials from every hundred thousand years or so, and they attack us because we're messing with their garden. Also, the reason the invasion isn't a complete curbstomp is because we're just fighting the equivalent of some semi-intelligent gardening tools that were woken up prematurely and, not actually being designed for war, are just DeepMind-ing their way into a solution to “some of the native fauna are interfering with our job.”

** I think that if alien invasions do happen, it will happen for cultural/religious reasons rather then an interest in our resources.

Perhaps they want to spread their religion to us? Or maybe they have some cultural imperative (white man's burden) to uplift and rule over other races.

** Another possibility: An uncrewed, automated alien probe that wasn't programmed with the possibility of meeting intelligent life in mind. Aliens aren't aware that we're here, they just know that the planet has biological life so they send a probe that uses local resources (screws us over) to construct a teleporter. In The Expanse, the alien probe is a virus like nanotechnology that hijacks lifeforms and repurposes them to build a stargate, but by that time the makers have been extinct for billions of years.

** Maybe we should flip the question. Let's think about /us/. In what realistic scenario would we turn into invaders for another planet?

The answer is... all of them. Like, suppose we identified one potentially close livable planet with spectroscopy. We got excited, managed to drum up enough support to send a mission. A steady stream of fusion ramscoops with cryopreserved colonists leaves the Solar System. Armed, of course, you never know. Then upon getting there, we find out the place has intelligent life. Would the official policy be “let's invade them”? No. Would that convince a bunch of armed, hopeful colonists with a reasonable technological edge to just pack their stuff and come back, especially when they already have lots of prepackaged cultural explanations to rationalise invasion and enslavement? Also no. It'd be the Americas all over again.

** We know today that there's no such thing as a Martian civilization, but it's a lot more practical to invade a world when you don't actually have to cross intellerstellar distances to do it; old science fiction such as "War of the Worlds" can give Martians the same kinds of motives that humans have had for crossing oceans when that was difficult.

** Related to #3 was an old sci-fi story where aliens to to Earth to trade knowledge. The aliens only was of life was to travel between solar systems at sub-light speeds only stopping to trade and prepare for the next journey. The time scales involved meant there was no repeat business. The aliens' main trade good was knowledge pills of skills and unique experiences. The aliens' preferred option was to trade these pills collected from many other solar systems over untold years and have the locals build a giant laser to propel and power them onthe first leg of the journey to the next solar system. Building the laser would have left Earth materially impoverished, possibly for generations.

Earth had the options of trading and building the laser (but hey, you now have the knowledge and a giant propulsion laser to exploit the local solar system) or be used as forced labour to build the laser and produce new knowledge/experiences for pills. The aliens could also detonate a portion of the sun (and incidentally fry the Earth with radiation) to propel themselves onward.

Only really a traditional invasion story in option 2 but a rationalish setup.
