Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So, I've been thinking of how to write magic in a way that it's the complete opposite of technology. What I've been thinking of is making it resemble less a mathematical equation and more a conversation, and have it be a lot softer rules, feelings over facts, etc.

Any ideas/resources for expanding on this?

*** Sanderson's Laws ([[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][First]], [[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/][Second]], and [[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-third-law-of-magic/][Third]]) are worth a read. The first is probably most important:

#+begin_quote
  The author's ability to resolve conflicts in a satisfying way with magic is directly proportional to how the reader understands said magic.
#+end_quote

So let's say that magic is a conversation, or it's art, or it's something that's not intuitively logical/mathematical. The only problem with this is that if you're using the magic system to resolve conflict, that resolution won't be satisfying unless the audience really understands why it worked (a consequence of conflict resolution being a matter of tension, which can't exist if the audience doesn't know why things are tense).

The first thing you're going to have to do is work out the boundaries of your system, even if it's going to be incredibly soft. Make a list of things that magic can do, and then a list of things that magic can't do, which will be invaluable in helping to keep the system feeling consistent, even while it's still soft. You should also figure out the linchpin uses of magic in the story as soon as possible so that they can be properly foreshadowed, which will keep the climaxes of scenes or of the plot as impactful as possible. If magic is a conversation, what does the conversation with magic at the climax look like? If magic is artwork, what does the artwork at the end look like? Working backwards will help you a lot.

I personally think one of the biggest problems with making a soft magic system is the question of why you can't just repeat the magic, which you'll probably want some answer for. Any system with repeatable and clearly defined effects will likely be at least a little bit hard, which doesn't seem like it's what you want.

(DaystarEld and I have two podcast episodes on magic systems [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-6/][Part 1]] and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-7/][Part 2]], which go over some of my thoughts in a lot more detail. It is a podcast though.)

*** It depends on what kind of themes you want to contrast against technology. If you consider technology as the collective, easily manufactured, spread, and used, then make magic a fundamentally individual process. Every person has their own "tuned" aura that interfere with one another, making it impossible for magic users to collaborate or even work close to one another. Structured magic loses coherence the further away from its creator's aura it gets, so it can only provide benefits in a localized area.

As for the actual use of magic being more artistic and less scientific, you could take a page from /Pact/ and make magic a form of imposing narrative over reality, creating a personal story and convincing the world that's the way it works for a time. Rather than measuring things in terms of points and resistances, make it about how convincing a mage can be, whether through oration, sleight of hand, or acting.

*** China Mieville's /Kraken/ has a pretty good magic system that's based around metaphor, context and history - IIRC at one point the main character digs a literal fork from a road, and trades it to someone else as an artifact that can change fate (which they happily accept).

*** /El Goonish Shive/ has a magic system wherein the magic itself literally has a personality and will outright change the rules under which it works if it feels that it is not being used in the way that it wants to be used. (Moreover, it /wants/ to be used, but only by a relatively small pool of people; it thus deliberately resists efforts to try to ensure that it is publicly known).

*** In [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23352/shitposting-in-another-world]]

Spells are powered by magic users doing great or terrible feats. A puppet show to get the children's wonder or giving a speech while slaughtering merchants. The more attention you get, the more energy you'll get to power spells.

-I think but don't remember, 60% sure. A spell focus is needed, it gathers energy gained and is used to cast spells.

-A spell is anything you can possibly imagine given form.

-How effective and whether the spell is successfully cast depends on how much energy is put into the spell and how the spell is casted. Like putting on a performance when casing. (The more edgy or weeb you are, the better the spell.)

-Depending on where you got the energy it can effect the nature of the spell, it was explained as

"... energy from an energetic dance is typically suitable for physical attributed spells, while a speech's power might better be used for illusion magic."

Also it's further divided in to negative and positive energy aka making kids laugh gets you white energy and telling a bad joke and angering a crowd gets you black energy.

The best result are using negative energy to do offensive or dangerous magic while positive energy is best for positive or support magic. Negative energy can heal but it wouldn't be as effective as positive energy.

I see this as less tech magic and more as art magic. Note the MC in the story is a plane shifted guy from Earth who has the ability to access 4chan to power his spells. Swears are censored but he has it uncensored on another site that he links to. Also this story is unfinished and on hiatus.

Post 8 in the story is when magic is explained by one of the characters.

*** Have you read Pact? It has some good ideas for this.

Edit: The Craft Sequence books also have an endless source of ideas in their central metaphor of magic as society.

If gods draw on the faith of their followers, what happens if there's a run on the bank? If magic is based on contracts and bargains with powerful entities, doesn't that mean mages are basically lawyers, and a fight between them is basically a courtroom drama? Isn't time travel - altering the past to effect the present - reminiscent of propaganda and censorship, and likely to appeal to the same sort of people?

The great thing about this is that they haven't remotely exhausted it. Almost any social phenomenon has a magic equivalent if you think about it - e.g. if power can be transferred between people, as it can in most settings, what's the basic equivalent of a pyramid scheme? Maybe a cult, or a clan of vampires?

*** Review the abilities and powers of gods in Ann Leckie's /The Raven Tower/, where gods serve as bottles for energy, and dispense it by speaking, where the speech describes the effect and the effect determines how much energy is required, but no one has done any research into how it works because the era is barely into cities.

*** UNSONG did a good job at magic as technology and antitech. You had the use of Names as consistent, studyable, repeatable spells for use in industry and placebomancy to confound even the plans of demigods with a clever turn of phrase. Placebomantic fights felt satisfying because we knew anything was possible, but they turned out the way they did anyway.

*** Everybody has a personally unique interface to magic which they understand intuitively. Different interfaces have different capabilities, strengths and weakness. (Maybe mages acquire their magic system by taking a particular hallucinogenic mushroom or something). If a mage's magic is known about by people other than the mage then the mage's magic weakens in proportion to how large the information leak is how (how detailed the knowledge is and how many people have it).

** [[https://www.sarna.net/wiki/Main_Page][Battletech]]. a human-only scifi setting with FTL, giant robots, and some genetic engineering. the setting is generally from 2750 through 3145, with most the activity between 3025 and 3085.

this setting is basically game of thrones in space. a religion controls all ftl communication, and were responsible for keeping the fires of war burning for centuries. the use of nuclear weapons on an interstellar scale caused technology to backslide a lot on two major occasions (1st succession war 2786 and jihad 3067).

what should rational fiction in this setting of nobility with armies of giant robots look like?

*** First person to invent a tank wins everything forever?

Like mechs are cool and all but for all practical purposes an equivalent tonnage of tanks, produced at an equivalent tech level, will blow the junk out of mechs.

**** setting-wise, tanks are cheaper but much much more fragile, and far less mobile.

the mechs are all-terrain (even space and underwater), jump-capable, and run with a neuro-helmet. they have fusion power (water for fuel, to get the hydrogen), and damage is more likely to be compartmentalised. mechs were based on earlier industrial mechs.

now, tanks do get used, but are a more defensive garrison unit overall. also, tank armor is weaker than mech armor with several wepons able to bypass armor to crit internal components.

***** That's what I meant about "produced at an equivalent tech level".

I'm aware of the in-universe justification for why mechs are best. The problem is, the only way the setting can justify itself is by irrationally handicapping the tanks.

The first thing a rational protagonist would do is realize that the humanoid form is *actively insane* for a war machine, strip the legs off a Kintaro or a Catapult or something, and mount it on treads. Suddenly you've got a mech that's significantly harder to hit than normal, yet doesn't lose any mobility at all.

With a bit more thought they might realize that hey, combined arms tactics /are a thing/, maybe we should take some of these jump jets and mount them on an airframe?

And now you've got an air force that's significantly more mobile than any mech, and a ground force that's significantly more /durable/ than any mech, and you win /all of the battles/ until people realize they were being silly and start copying you.

****** Frankly, the only way a "humanoid mech" would work realistically is in the form of human-sized full body power armour for the average infantry (to minimise front-line losses). Tanks/aircraft alone couldn't bunker down and hold objectives, and neither could giant mechs.

Of course, by then infantry squads or any front-line humans might long be phased out by swarms of small hovering guns (drones?) that can clear buildings of hostiles competently and remote-controlled by operators from miles away.
