**** Because if there is a rule that you must 'spend' the money (magically or legally), you buy a legally separate piece of property, then transfer that property back into fungible cash for as small a penalty as possible. Your original contract is now complete -you spent a billion dollars within a month. You have a completely separate billion dollars free and clear now, with no requirement to make poor, rushed decisions as to the spending.

This works, because if it didn't, you couldn't buy anything with any resale value with the money, as all of them could still be flipped again for money after the time limit. If they magic/law doesn't like stock, buy gold/platinum/assorted other commodities. Just make it a large enough market that a billion sudden influx doesn't crash it.

***** What about if there's a rule that you can't benefit yourself directly or indirectly without also benefiting some other large group of people -- i.e. if you want to spend some of the money on yourself you can only give yourself $100 and 10,000,000 other people also have to get $100. Or if you use it to buy a piece of property you can't own it afterwards, it has to become a park or something similarly public. Or if you donated it to a company that company would be prohibited from giving you anything or favoring you in any way afterwards. Then what would one do?

****** Well, that's a number of huge changes to the original scenario, but in that case, you do the same thing, only you immediately transfer the stocks to the care of a Trust Fund or similar legal body of which you are the director. In Case 1 (Ratio for Donation), you pay yourself the divided required to meet that standard, and organize it so other people also get similar value through work generated by the corporation.

Or, I mean, depending on how the rule specifies $100, you could give yourself $100 US and 10 million others $100 in Zombabewean dollars (Approx 0.0000001 cents US).

If you can use it to buy property that you can't own, again, the Trust owns the property, and you merely rent or use it at the trust's request (you also being director of the trust). This is actually what English nobles did in the 1500's to get out of paying land taxes, which required Henry VIII to create a law called the Statue of Uses to counter (interestingly, still law in some Commonwealth jurisdictions).

If you have to donate to the company, create two companies, one of which you do not control, one of which you do. Depending on the legal language of the rule itself, you either own all stock in Company B, which owns all stock in Company A, or you own B, and A is independent, but has in it's constating documents a clause which indicates a required payment to Company B or a trust fund set up on behalf of Company B on a regular bases. Said clause could not be removed without dissolving the company, in which case under most legal systems, you are allowed to recover money you invested in the Company at its inception.

Add in as many needed C-ZZ shell companies in between these two points to satisfy the requirements of the rule.

Any mechanical (legal) system can be gotten around in this way because of the independent legal status of corporations and legal liability law. Unless there is an omniscient conscious entity in charge of finding out whether you are following the spirit of the rule, you can get around any rule in this way.

The economy is simply too connected to rule otherwise. Do you break the rule if you end up giving the company money, and later you eat at a restaurant it owns? If you walk through the public park it bought? If you happen to qualify for a grant it offers? If your local road is fixed up by tax money it paid?

Everything is connected in the modern economy. Money doesn't actually exist as a tangible thing, that's the point of money, it's 100% fungible. One dollar is the same as another dollar for buying purposes, but 99% of that money only exists as numbers on a computer database.

** I'd probably get in touch with Elon Musk and be like "hey, so I've got a billion dollars burning a hole in my pocket, can I help you space?" With that much money to throw in, I might be able to get a seat on the SpaceX board and help oversee how the money gets spent. BFR and MCT get made even sooner, Mars colony gets built faster, humanity gets into space earlier making us that little bit more resistant to Death-by-asteroid. Or if I can help allocate some of those funds within SpaceX, help kickstart asteroid mining and orbital manufacturing. Nothing like sipping champagne on my spin gravity orbital shipyard while building the first large scale interplanetary transport ships.

Solve down to Earth problems problems first, such as hunger, using money under conditional spending, and the rest of the money self-sustaining itself through some sort of resource-busting investment.

It is more effiecient to put billions on the 'brain market' and have them perform research, than to fund research directly. It also avoids the problem of 'useless anachronistic technologies' which we think might be useful but turn out in the future to be a waste of money.

** Assuming I cannot arrange to move the money in a circle back to me and must abide by the /spirit/ of that:

I would spend weeks researching, brainstorming and outsourcing research into what causes would most appeal to myself. This is where it gets hard, because I don't exactly know where a billion would do the most good. Feeding Africa? No. Curing diseases? No. Give it all to MIRI? ...No. Probably. I'll do the research honestly, but I don't know programming, and I have no way of evaluating the expected return on giving a billion dollars to MIRI. I'm obviously not going to give a billion to the political party I'm active in, because they are so far from optimized it makes me sad. If I can set my family up with no debt and a few tens of thousands in travelling around the world, I'll do that, because that's pocket change and allows me to focus on Noble Stuff. Cryonics? Well, I have high hopes, but even assuming I can turn up on my favourite living people's doorstep and convince them to let me pay to have them frozen when they die, that's extremely expensive time wise, and I think when Cryonics finally pays off, if ever, having a few dozen people like Noam Chomsky revive will not be enough to make a very great political impact. I'm leaning toward anticipating a techno volatile future. I also cannot use my billion to assassinate 'bad guys', because I have no idea at all where to find reliable assassins, and looking for them would only risk getting me into a situation where I cannot spend the money. I'm not American, so I cannot easily spend money on bribing US politicians, although I will of course research this. I similarly cannot use the billion to buy Sanders the presidentship.

So the answer is, I would not spend much money until I had done research. I would buy an absolutely fabulous laptop, and I would lock myself in my room and spend most of the time on the Internet. What I would do at the end of the month I do not know.

If I try to make myself very rich with the sincere intent to use most of the money after the 30 days are up on helping the world, does that count as benefitting the world? (And if not, why should it count if I make any individual person rich with the intent that the wealth spreads to the world, such as giving the money to a businessman or politician?)

** Meh. Say I put the money in a fund for a specific use--sort of a grant/loan pool for certain types of projects. Would making myself eligible for drawing from the pool after the 30 days violate the spirit of the hypothetical? Assume these projects would generally require more than 30 days to complete.

I have no idea where a billion dollars could do the most good. That's a lot of money and I'd probably just ask a lot of the smartest people I can find (so ... probably here), and then they'd mostly point me toward Givewell, so I'd probably just start at Givewell.

But, again, a billion dollars is a /lot/ of money. If I shave off 10% of that for things other than EA, that's still a huge impact, and I get more than enough change to accomplish things more personally relevant, like throwing money at [[http://wicab.com][Wicab]] until they are able to / agree to sell the Brain Port® at a reasonable price, or buy/build a ton of tactile displays so they can reach people at a reasonable price, or... you know, maybe a billion dollars is enough money to start a health insurance company that targets the rare and outlandishly expensive stuff? Seeing as I keep tripping over the outlandishly expensive stuff.

Buuut... there is something I kinda want / could really use that fits into the range of a few dozen thousand at most, but spread out over a few months. I wonder if I could pay it all up front and still get what I need?

Would that a billion dollars could significantly impact the incentive structures in medical research, but in the US, a billion dollars is one new treatment. So I doubt I'm getting any medical miracles out of it. I guess I could spread it out among existing research that is only a little underfunded, but then I'd have to spend most of that 30 days researching the research and figuring out how to donate to them. I don't think my attention span can handle that. (Also: buy a million dollar subscription to attention span-increasing medication. I don't care if it's Ritalin or Modafinil or Bupropion... I just care that it works.)

I mean, I'm spending as much as it takes on Executive Function interventions. But 30 days is nowhere near long enough to properly evaluate those. I might need to hire someone to do long-term treatment, and after a while, a contract system where I pay everything up front and they continue indefinitely seems a little shaky.

But yeah, a billion dollars can sorta-kinda approximate some of my "this genie does not take 'CEV' as a wish" genie wishes. I doubt it'd be enough for all of them, but it'd at least be enough for me to pay a few of the smartest people out there to brainstorm something better than I can come up with.

I'm unemployed, receive SSI, and have a boat load of college debt. And can't drive. This gets in the way of lots of things, including the personal trainer option (and the Modafinil option, for that matter).
