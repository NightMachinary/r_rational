Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm working on a setting that's an archipelago. Tech level is roughly age-of-sail. People can travel between islands for a few months during the summer. The rest of the year has harsh and unpredictable storms that make open-water sailing extremely dangerous.

What sorts of cultural consequences would flow from this?

I have the details of the trade and government set up, but I'd like to add more touches about how every-day life would change due to the relative isolation.

*** Once the stormy season comes, trade is cut off, so people are always eager to get as much of whatever perishables they can before their supply is gone the rest of the year (assuming some amount of comparative advantage on that front). Most of the perishables get preserved (pickled, salted, sugared, honeyed, dried, etc), and even those probably need to be rationed out for the rest of the year. This might be the case for some goods even without strong comparative advantages, if there are economies of scale that only function when you have trade access to all the islands.

You need sailors to do the trading, but what do those sailors do when the storms come and they can't go out on the seas? That's probably going to define a fair amount of your culture. Do they become shallow-water fisherman? Do they have culturally-standard off-season jobs that play on their skills at sailing? The calm season overlaps with summer, which is prime farming time, so that's a definite stressor on the labor supply, which in turn probably has some cultural artifacts.

I think I would look for some quiet, labor-intensive activity for people to do as a social activity, which will probably be one of the things that defines the isolation period. Quilting groups, Bible study, things like that, likely related to textiles (since those aren't perishable and are usually labor intensive) or pottery (same reason) or something else, depending on tech levels, some of which is in service of getting goods ready for the next trade period.

So on an average night in the "winter", you have a group of people sitting in a circle chattering away as they weave the fibers left over from the summer's harvest, eating candied fruits that come in from the next island over and are in dwindling supply. People are cooped up and irritable, but trying to take their minds off of it, listening to the same story being told a fourth time.

*** The storm latitudes are a brutal place in a variety of ways. Jungle conditions dominate, with high biodiversity and (as conditions outside the body tend to resemble those inside) lots of bacterial and parasitic diseases. Expect almost constant precipitation outside of the summer months, themselves still so hot and humid as to be nearly fatal. The universal mid-day nap is a common cultural standard, and night it the time for social engagement.

*** Just as an aside, summer is the rainy season in lower latitudes, winters are dry.

So it should be the opposite of what you have there.

​

I guess it would depend on the distance between the islands. Age of sails is very vague, is gunpowder invented? printing presses? manufacturers? steam engines? steel? telescopes? Is science already a thing? or do people just invent things and have silly theories as explanations? Is tradition important to your people? because that can lead to technological stagnation.

​

Have you researched archipelagos and how some islands have metals, others don't, some have forests others are barren rocks. Your societies would work and have it's dominance defined by the resources their islands had available.

​

New Zealand for instance is a continental island, it's large, has metal, forests, rivers etc. So it could develop large populations, metallurgy, shipbuilding and become the super power in it's area.

​

Other islands had so little fertile land that they basically farmed fish, i.e they raised fish in artificial lakes for food. Some fished, some developed highly efficient pig / chicken farms etc.

​

Check chapter 2 of the book guns, germs and steel. It has a lot of useful information for this topic.

​

Try to stay away from the generic stuff, and don't assume you know how things work, double check your facts. Else you'll ruin your story for anybody with a bit more knowledge than you.

​

PS. it's unlikely for a rainy season to stop ships altogether, unless you go full stormlight archive, if their ships are so bad that this is the case the rewards for the first person that invents more resistant ships are immense. It's also an obvious problem with an obvious solution, so you can bet that it would have happened quickly.

*** Depending on the storms' extents, harbours might be far from settlements. If the islands are regularly pelted by storm winds, the circumferential coastlines will be ravaged by waves, to the detriment of prospective harbours. I'd expect to see more inland/upstream harbours, protected storm gales in other words.

Islands with reefs as natural wave breaks could keep deep water harbours directly at the coastline.

Where there isn't natural protection against these waves you'd still find both shallow and deep water harbours, but they'd all be relatively young (decades rather than centuries). Their existence would hinge on beating the odds of any particular storm season, and that would be a loosing game in the long run. If one managed long enough, or were luckily hit by a mild storm, expect to see efforts in the direction of artificial protection, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(architecture][moles]]). In that case storm season work could be in a quarry, if available.

Also, farming might be considered women's work. When the men go sailing during the calm season and the woman remain at home, if calm=planting season I could see culture developing in that direction.

*** What is the exact geography? Because if your archipelago has a narrow strait dividing the islands into upper and lower (or eastern and western) halves, then whoever controls the strait controls the entire archipelago. Also, it will divide the culture into eastern (or northern) and western (or southern) traditions.

Next stop thinking in terms of centralized Empires. They won't be. The method of control would be vassalage.

So, every island (depending upon how big it is), will have an Emir (equivalent) ruler who will rule the island and collect taxes and goods to be traded. During the non summer months this will happen. Before the onset of summer months, all the non-perishable trade goods will be collected and stored in the port market. Which will be busiest (and most happening) place on the island. This place WILL decide the culture, politics and destiny of the island.

Start of the summer months also coincides with the sowing season, thus making most of the men of fighting age unavailable. So most of the campaigning will be done in the later half of summer. Also, since no one will be able to field large armies to conquer and control all the islands, the method of control would be vassalage.

So, faction A, wanting to control island group A (consisting of islands A1, A2, A3, A4) will show up with its fleet, and the ruler of each island (A1R, A2R, A3R ...) will present tributes. (This would be the equivalent of tax collection).

So now suppose faction B wants to contest A's hold over these islands, it needs to collect tax BEFORE A does, but it can't start sending off a fleet at the start of summer (sowing season), so it has to wait. Which leads to a limit on how far its fleet can effectively collect tributes from (as it has to collect tributes which might take over a week per island, and it is time limited by end of summer on how far it can sail, because it has to come home BEFORE end of summer). This might mean that no ONE faction can control ALL of archipelago.

Which means a strong local tradition of independence. Foreign rule would not be tolerated; though local dictators would be the norm).

Also, if there is a Big Island with a small island next to it; you can be sure that at some point of time in history, a ruling party on the big island had been overthrown by the current rulers, and those previous rulers have fled to the smaller island. Which would mean that both islands now view each other with suspicion.

Finally, make sure your protagonist is a trader; because in this world, a trader is not just a trader, he is also the soldier, sailor, diplomat, spy.

** I spent too long making a new Wizarding Europe for the Harry Potter stuff I've been writing. What I've got right now is a work in progress buuuuuuuuuut if anyone's interested in a starting place to jump off from for their own fics, [[https://i.imgur.com/eu07frE.png][here you go]].

This is meant to represent Europe as it stands in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union (some Russian wizards saw what Grindelwald was doing with Hitler and had the bright idea to try it with Stalin, only they thought too highly of themselves and too little of the muggles, and came out of it rather the worse for wear).

The Statute of Secrecy was signed in 1689, so I started with the assumption that wizarding countries in Europe were more or less identical to their muggle counterparts at that point (indeed, there arguably wasn't any such thing as a "wizarding country", with few exceptions) but then began to diverge.

The major powers of Europe are the Kingdom of France, still ruled by a cadet branch of the Bourbons; the Wizarding Roman Republic, which was built from the administrative structure meant to oversee the Holy Roman Emperor's magical subjects; and Iberia-Sicily, which has not been ruled by the Hapsburgs for a very long time but has remained intact to be a counterweight against France and the W.R.R. when necessary. "Divided we fall" and all that.

Checkered areas in the W.R.R. represent "free states" (placeholder name) which have considerably more autonomy. Many of them are centered on particular cities but, given the low population of the magical community and their penchant for teleporting around, are larger in territory than a muggle version might be.

*** Really random aside: Andorra is a tiny country between Spain and France, and it has the strangest head of state ever. Wikipedia calls it a "Unitary parliamentary semi-elective diarchy".

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-Princes_of_Andorra][Andorra has co-princes]], namely the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France are the co-heads of state. Since 1278. (Originally it was the French king but after the whole revolution thing happened, power transferred to the French president).

And IIRC, I read somewhere that Macron threatened to abdicate the throne if Andorra didn't increase banking regulations so it'd be less of a tax haven, so those princes sure throw their power around, maybe?

Anyway, I know you're an amazing human slash genius, so I'm sure you could do something cool with that background information.

Also, why is Corsica French? I believe it was Italian in 1689. (Double checked: it was part of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa][Republic of Genoa]], which is part of Italy /now/). The Corsican people have a whole bunch of detailed history of uprisings and being taken over by various nation states (I think Spain had their finger in the pie at one point), so... yeah.

Then again, if you get complicated about the detailed histories of every tiny European country you'll probably be there all day. I don't know why but my instinct is that magic would make small nations more common, perhaps with United Magical States of X popping up.

** This is the core element for how magic works in a story that I'm working on. I'd really appreciate it if people could offer some critiques or ideas regarding it.

ESSENCE

Essence is the way that magic expresses itself in the world. It is the force that enables warriors to lift a ton of steel in one hand and it is the force that enables a mage to throw lightning at his foes. Essence exists in faint concentrations in the air but is mostly concentrated within individuals. Whenever something dies, it's essence is released. Most of that essence will disperse back into the world, but some of it will remain in some form. Usually the remains will be in the form of a spirit core of some type, but occasionally a different echo of the creature might form. The essence inside of this spirit core can then be absorbed by another individual in order to improve their abilities or develop new abilities. Essence is never absorbed as a generic increase in all of something's abilities. It can make you stronger, faster, smarter, it can improve the strength of some magical technique that you have, but a single spirit core can never do all of that. Whenever you absorb a spirit core, you focus on whatever you want to improve or develop and when you have finished absorbing the core, you will have obtained some amount of the improvement or developed some amount of that technique. For most people, this is done via a status screen. There are hard limits to the amount of essence that a person can have; these are known as circles. Additionally, there are hard limits to the amount of essence that any given attribute, skill, or technique can have within a circle. Generally that limit is 10% of the total essence limit for the circle in question. In order to advance from one circle to the next, you need to have some limiting conception of yourself. For example, to move from the first circle to the second circle, a person might have a conception of themself as a warrior. If they broke through like that, then they would find it easier to accumulate essence for fighting aspects and harder to accumulate essence for crafting or social aspects. Then, in order to advance from the second circle to the third circle, that person might have a conception of themself as a swordsman, and this would have a similar limiting factor. A person's conception of themself is called their class and aspects which are easy for them to improve are known as their purview. The following is the most basic status screen that exists:

BASIC Name: N/A Class: N/A Circle: 1 Essence: 0/1000

ATTRIBUTES Strength: 1 Charisma: 1 Intelligence: 1 Dexterity:1 Manipulation: 1 Cunning: 1 Vitality: 1 Composure: 1 Wits: 1

*** This seems like experience points, D&D classes, and gamer-style status screens. D&D came up with these elements to approximate the real-world dynamic where people specialize, and then get better at their day-job with practice. It's already true that playing a bunch of tennis will make me better at tennis.

So, I'd suggest making the magic system less realistic and focusing on the things that seemed really epic about the original idea. Right now, it seems like the big consequences are:

1. You get stronger by killing things
2. People specialize in professions
3. People can see status screens

If you push hard on #1, you get a world where the guy at the beef slaughterhouse is terrifyingly strong. And adventurer might kill a monster every couple days. But slaughterhouse guy kills a cow every 90 seconds for 8 hours / day.

Push hard on #2, and you get a world where my skills depend on my /self-conception/ rather than any kind of real-world practice. I'd pay story-tellers to invent useful-archetypes for my kids. Therapy, to shift my self-conception, would be super-useful. And people who are skilled at self-delusion would be incredibly versatile.

Push on option #3 and you get interesting consequences, too. I can imagine a story where the ROB gives a free gift of 2000 essence to some protagonist. His friends and family notice the sudden jump and draw the reasonable conclusion that he must have murdered a /lot/ of people in the last 24 hours.

And Free-Will gets weird in a world where there's a Charisma stat. Does everyone agree that Charisma-10 Bob is a better guy than Charisma-9 Dave? Like, not just that Bob is a better salesman or public speaker, but that literally everyone would rather be Bob's friend than Dave's?

If so, you'd get a fascinating social dynamics by making 1 character an "anti-gamer" who's just indifferent to mental stats.

*** How exactly do the mental attributes work here? Like drawing a distinction between charisma and intelligence is at least manageable because they are something you can clearly describe. However having Intelligence /and/ Cunning /and/ Wits seems excessive and like you would have a very hard time keeping track of how exactly they differ. Also what exactly does Composure do? Because it could plausibly be several different incompatible things.

Also on a more meta point does everyone start at 1 for every stat? If so then that means genetics has basically no impact on say intelligence (whereas in real life that's ~80% genetic) which will massively alter society. For instance paradoxically having innate differences not exist will almost certainly lead to a permanent aristocracy. As nobody without the resources to afford a great deal of essence can hope to be competent enough to make it in the ruling class even if it's ostensibly meritocratic. Similarly with such impressive mental attributes the aristocracy is likely to be profoundly more competent than ruling classes in the real world which makes it far more stable.

How exactly increasing mental attributes works also needs to be figured out if you want things to be coherent, since so many stories seem to ignore the effects of increasing stats corresponding to intelligence. For instance mental stats are going to need to be logarithmic in their effects (except charisma you could just let that turn into straight up mind control at high level which you can still write just fine) since having great deals of superintelligences running around will make your setting practically impossible to write.

Intelligence is memory storage and speed of access, Cunning is puzzle solving, and Wits is mental fortitude (ie: taking an extremely difficult test for several hours and not being exhausted at the end of it). Composure is social fortitude in a similar way.

Essence is logarithmic and multiplicative on top of whatever you already have. If you had Strength: 100 and let's say some base strength of c, then you would have let's say c*log(100).

Ok that works though having your willpower stat be called Wits is kind of confusing because people expect wits to be a type of intelligence (like it should probably just be called willpower). Composure seems a little confusing here though in that it's unclear what "social fortitude" even is.\\
I also just realized Manipulation is probably a social attribute not something related to spellcasting like I first though. So that raises the question of how exactly it's meaningfully distinct from Charisma. Because you definitely need to limit what falls under "Charisma" for it to be meaningfully distinct.

The essence limits do seem like they might not limit things /that/ much. Since in a world like this the death penalty is probably going to be employed a /lot/ thus creating a large constant stream of essence. Similarly while there may be basically level caps on individuals since you don't have to pick pre-made classes the people with a lot of power are going to specialize in classes which minmax their intelligence or their charisma to the greatest possible degree. Now both ruling groups would of course max out every mental stat since things like HP or combat potential don't much matter to them so they can afford to spend 60% of their essence on stats. However they would probably be specialization based on how one's class affected these things.\\
That creates a whole other thing you need to deal with since these sorts of "NPC" classes which /purely/ impact one's mind need to be figured out since they will massively impact your setting.

Also you haven't mention traditional magic, but if spellcasting is a thing then how that works needs to be worked out.

****** Right so Wits would be purely mental fatigue from overusing your brain and Composure is social fatigue from things like bullying or other types of social stressors. The whole set up is designed so that between Physical, Social, and Mental, you have symmetry for your resilience, force, and nimbleness. The formatting was messed up when I posted without my realizing which might explain why that's unclear. Charisma is raw force of personality while Manipulation is saying the right thing to send the right signal to someone. Once again, the divisions are essentially just Force, Precision, and Resilience, and then those concepts are applied to like Physicality, or Mentality, or what have you. If you developed additional attributes, then they would be similarly divided up.

I think the Essence limits do have a pretty good effect for stopping people from going all in on something. If we say that the base Essence improvement rate is log(Essence) and essence limits go up by powers of 10, then you can only ever get up to your circle + 1 as a multiple for your attribute. Additionally the way that classes limit you isn't really that they form level caps, it's more that they will progressively limit how much you can invest into any given attribute. You might be able to go no physical attributes for the first few circles, but eventually you have to specialize in mental or social and then further specialize within that and so on and so forth.

I think what prevents a ruling class from going all in on social/mental is that if you were to go all in, some random high circle combatant could just blow your everything up. This then causes social pressure to have some degree of personal fighting prowess. It's also hard to convince people to follow you if those people are in a different league of personal power compared to you. It's possible, but much easier to just have some actual combat prowess.

Specific applications of Essence is the only way that spellcasting manifests. This can be weird magical Kung fu, throwing bolts of lightning, magically efficient bureaucracy, or anything along those lines. If you're doing some kind of magic that has a specific purpose rather than just generically making you better at something, then that's a Technique/Art. Generally, it's called an Art if it has multiple different moves that it does (like how a martial art will have multiple maneuvers) and a Technique if you're doing just one very specific thing. An Art counts as one aspect when you're investing Essence in it; obviously a Technique does as well.

Honestly having these be different stats is kind of bizarre, because it seems like there's only actually one willpower trait which governs how much people can endure unpleasantness whether it's social or not. Like trying to create symmetries here seems like it comes at the cost of coming up with a model of human psychology which doesn't really work.\\
Also the way you described wits would make it seem like it is a weird hodgepodge that includes how quickly you get mentally tired but also one's general ability to endure /any/ unpleasant things which aren't social. Either that or it doesn't include willpower generally which then creates an issue in that a lot of willpower stuff wouldn't be connected to any stat.

#+end_quote

This creates something of an issue in that "raw force of personality" isn't some distinct thing from social skills generally. Good actors who are generally soft spoken (who would be considered to have low charisma) can nonetheless act indistinguishable from someone who's "really" charismatic. Charisma is a learnable skill not somehow different from other areas of social persuasion. So my criticism above applies here to that you're forcing human psychology into a weird mold that doesn't carving nature at its joints.

You could apply this same logic to real life to conclude that clearly all nobles must have been master swordmen. The reason some high combatants can't just blow everything up is that /the ruling class doesn't do their own fighting and virtually never has in any large society/. The logic that people won't follow masters vastly weaker in combat than them is similarly absurd given you can apply it to history and see how wrong it is.

Moreover, I'm having trouble thinking of how this would work, so let's say these witches have to make some sort of deal/s with the devil or demons. What would they (Satan/demons) want, why would they want it, why would they need to make a deal with a human to get it, and what is it they can offer in exchange for the deal/s?

The problem I'm seeing is that if demons can transmit anything other than information from their world/dimension to the human world then they wouldn't need to grant humans magic. They could just cull anyone with both a low probability of reproducing and a high probability of going to hell in the event of their death to ensure a steady flow of incoming souls. But I guess this all depends on how you design hell. Like maybe the souls of bad people go to some location of hell to be snatched by the first demon that happens upon them, but if the person sells their soul to a specific demon then that persons soul will be delivered directly to said demon once they die, which would give demons an incentive to bargain for souls. Conversely, if a person wants magic but doesn't want to sell their soul they could do favors for demons, like killing someone (that's likely to end up in hell) at a specific location so the demon can make an educated guess as to were their soul will arrive in hell. But if you're doing favors for demons, you're probably going to hell so that doesn't really make sense (unless you can literally just repent at any time and earn yourself a one way ticket to not-hell).

*** For demons, satanic pacts are a form of force multiplication. They have /some/ power on Earth, but they have more power if they have a supplicant to channel that power through or do their workings, and even more than that if they have multiple supplicants working together in concert. Usually the demon is working with their supplicant(s) toward some kind of escalation; it /starts/ with cutting the head off a dead sparrow to bring humiliation onto a girl in class, but by a gradual process of desensitization, it ends with human sacrifice. Some of the things that the demon requests will be to increase its power on Earth, but some will simply be to activate human cognitive biases (especially sunk cost fallacy) in order to increase the hold over the supplicant and/or expand the cult.

How it goes from there depends on what kind of rules you set up for your demons and witches. Are rituals static things with repeatable effects, similar to programmatic function calls? Or are they unbreakable contracts for service by agreement of both parties (with or without fine print or interpretation)? What, precisely, can demons do, and is it mathematically defined, utility defined, memetically defined, et cetera?

*** Daedras in TES, GRR Martin's magic, and Lovecraft stories follow this trope.

*** One could also have it work in a manner /not/ in line with the witch hunters beliefs - just other deities, practices, etc. that aren't christian. I've seen claims that, historically, branding other religions, etc. not as wrong, but as worshipping Satan, was one of the things churches sometimes did, because 'non-christian spiritual practices can't be good'.

How to work this out in a fictional afterlife, I'm not clear on.

In Supernatural,someone sells their soul in exchange for one of their friends being brought back from the dead. You could also have someone sell their soul for some form of 'almost immortality' - they won't age, but they can still be killed by fire, or something.

** Had a weird dream where a person showed up at my front door, screamed in pain, and had their arm pop off, and a torrent of luminescent water spewed forth from their arm socket.

Separately, I've been kinda working on a story that involves travel to multiple bizarre worlds, inspired by David Friedman's [[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/LegalSystemsDraft.html][Legal Systems Very Different From Ours]].

So, this makes me want to posit a world where a dark, dry cave is populated with people who, when their limbs are forcibly removed, gush out a huge amount of luminescent water, sufficient for agriculture if taken advantage of properly. I'll have to figure out the specific math, but removing an entire arm should be enough to feed ~10 people for life if none is wasted. To match my dream, it should come out at about a rate of 1000 gallons per minute, and come out for at least ten minutes, but it never ends in the dream so it could be virtually for life.

What kind of culture might you expect to come out of this?
