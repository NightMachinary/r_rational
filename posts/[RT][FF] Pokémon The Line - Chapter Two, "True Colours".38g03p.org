** This is damn good. It's only the second chapter and I'm already rooting for Red and hoping Blue dies forgotten in some unremarkable ditch (soon). I was actually quite surprised at the levels of hatred toward Blue that this chapter engendered in me.

** I'm generally uncertain about this chapter. A particular concern is that there may be too much exposition towards the beginning. Curious to know if it reads too much like an infodump.

Other than that particular question, criticism in general would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Horizontal lines are coming up extremely inconsistently for me. I've edited the chapter several times, but they keep vanishing and reappearing. There should be two in this document, after "You /bastard/." and "He looked like a Champion." Is anyone else not seeing them?

*** It's SLIGHTLY heavy on the exposition, but it's described vividly enough to keep it from being boring. Plenty of more famous authors do far worse. If you want to trim it down a little, that's your prerogative, but don't feel like you HAVE to.

I, for one, quite enjoyed this chapter. I was starting to get annoyed by the scene with the reporters, but then I realized that was PRECISELY the intent, and it worked out great. And it only got better.

*** I agree with coda for the most part. While perhaps exposition-heavy, it was extremely enjoyable for me to read, and gave a lot of background detail. Granted, I enjoy what most people would call filler, so long as it's not boring, which this most certainly is not.

*** The lines work for me. But fanfiction is known for messing things up all the time :P

Nice chapter!

*** This I can neither confirm nor deny.

(That shouldn't be taken as a wink-wink, nudge-nudge. Answering either way could very well constitute spoilers regarding the overall arc.)

** That ending was priceless.

I also liked that detail about Pallet Town's gate opening inwards and what it meant. Is that fact based on anything or did you just fancy the idea?

What I understand less is why Oak puts so much weight on prestige and media narrative. I mean, judging from all Pokemon media I know of, the world is chock full with trainers. Surely only the tiniest fraction can be getting any media attention of note at all and yet they are still at it so it can't be the be all end all. So letting Blue's audacious and probably criminal act just slide and go without consequence simply because it makes for a better story seems to make little sense in a world that isn't based on Shadows in the Limelight like rules. Not to mention that in a world where pokemon dominate everything and where there are age old trainer initiation rituals there must be more to aspire to as a young trainer than to become Champion.

*** Pallet Town's inward-opening gate is a pure invention. I don't think the canonical Pallet Town even has a gate.

You are correct, there are many ambitions beyond becoming Champion. In much the same way that most actors harbour some dream of becoming the next Brad Pitt, or many newer politicians hope to become President/Prime Minister, so too do most new Trainers. The professional Trainer circuit makes up only a portion of the wider Trainer demographic.

Going into details would be revealing a bit too much, but one can broadly state that being a Trainer is something of a stepping-stone to more 'grounded' careers - a way of gaining experience and seeing the world. Most Trainers will only stay on the freelance Trainer circuit for a few years before finding 'real' jobs.

Generally, placing so much concern on a couple of new Trainers' public image would be laughable. But these are the sons of Professor Samuel Oak, foremost Pokémon researcher in Kanto, inventor of the Pokédex, and other stuff that will be brought up later. They are already in the spotlight, so they may as well make the most of it.

This is about as much as I can say right now, but I hope it makes things a touch clearer.

Cheers!

I may be misunderstanding what 'Trainer' actually means. Isn't anyone who trains pokemon for offensive purposes a trainer in your world? That would be including all rangers, hunters, entertainment level fighters, aspiring champions, wilderness explorers, criminals, military and anyone else you see throwing around pokeballs to face off threats both real and artificial. And that isn't even including those trainers that focus even more on the show aspects as seen in the poke-contests in the newer editions/seasons. So the pokemon economy has to be larger than whatever the media supports, no?

That is kind of what I mean though. They are already advantaged when it comes to public fame and image. Letting such a direct and personal insult and crime just slide and allowing injustice mostly for public 'ratings' seems really weird to me. It seems equivalent to, I don't know, aspiring musicians from the same family hiding that one of them blatantly stole the other's hit song /after/ it got copyrighted? Or maybe publishing a paper based on research data easily proven to be stolen from your brother? There is not really a similarly prestigious career path that requires a unique object to start out.

***** 'Trainer' is a term that I'm using to refer to the more traditional Trainer set that we mostly see in the games/anime/books - folks who wander about battling monsters against one another for money and fame. The phrase "Trainer demographic" there was perhaps not quite the best to use. Let's call anyone who deals with Pokémon on a regular basis 'Handlers' for now, with 'Trainer' referring more specifically to the classic Pokémon archetype.

A great many Handlers and Pokémon begin in, or move into, more standard societal roles (such as the ones you listed), rather than remaining in the competitive circuit. Some immediately move into these utility roles, others start out Training in the pursuit of ambition, to gain experience, and as a chance to explore the world (if you're familiar with the concept of an OE, it holds a similar cultural connotation). Most who go down this path fail, but the few grand successes encourage young aspirants all the same. Those successful enough to make it into the major media spotlight serve as motivation for the many who try.

So, yes, the Pokémon economy is much larger than those few supported by the general media.

As for Oak's conclusion, this is something that I feel shouldn't be bluntly expressed in a comments discussion, especially when the piece is still in progress. How you perceive Oak's permissiveness towards Blue's actions is up to you, and I don't think it's really my place to enforce a particular interpretation.

** It's the little things like "Reclamationist fortress of Viridian City" that /really/ make me want to know where you're going with this. In the meanwhile, this is really good stuff. I've barely met him and *I* already want to punch Blue, in the stomach, /fairly/ hard.

Interesting take on Red's mom too. I'm assuming that's inspired by the canonical opening to the games where you set one foot in the long grass before Oak bustles out saying how dangerous that is and you need a starter Pokemon, and then have basically no parenting thereafter.

Almost a little sad about that, having played Gold where she was a slightly more active presence in the game and always seemed sweet/concerned in the way that parents are. But then, that's a different protagonist from a later generation who lives in a different town, so... never mind.
