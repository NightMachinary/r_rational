** The one who made treaties (and will soon break them) made them with the Queen of Callow, /not/ Catherine. This is significant not just because the two are different (as Cat herself has mused on) but because it was only extremely recently that the Grand Alliance recognized her as Queen of Callow. So the treaty made at, for example, the Battle of the Camps, doesn't count. Similarly, Sve Noc made truce not with the queen of a kingdom of cattle but with Catherine Foundling/the First Under Night.

 

So, a crack theory that makes at least a little bit of sense: it's the /Daoine/.

 

Either going after Zeze after hearing about his continued "fucking around with masses of souls" exploits or, much more likely, betraying their vassal status and /going after the Golden Bloom/.

 

After all, while the elves don't give two shits about regular people, a gathering to go after the Ultimate Evil on the continent, perhaps the only person outside of maybe Malcia and the Intercessor that can pose a threat to them, is exactly the sort of thing that might hold their attention.

 

And if that doesnt, then surely nothing else will. More so than usual, they have little reason to lay attention to just about anything. Remember, they fazed out of Creation when Diabolist started getting ready for her big finale. As far as I can recall, we haven't seen anything that indicates that they've come back yet. Until they do, they can be safe and worry free. After all, in order for the Deoraithe to launch any sort of surprise attack, they'd have to have some way to travel somewhere not of Creation.

 

A successful raid via Twilight could very much be the only chance they will /ever/ get to have surprise on the Bloom. Even if the odds aren't the best, taking back the Cradle is /precisely/ the sort of thing they will burn bridges for if it means success

(Plus does it not make sense thematically for, at the same time almost everyone is warring on the Ultimate Evil, a fight is also being taken to the Ultimate Good? Lord knows they aren't going to abide by the Accords)

**** I think the intended meaning is that they can attack Serenity

** ...oh. Kairos is implying that the Dead King is breaking the truce. Not a lot of heroes in Salia, and relatively small forces. Though he could attack anywhere in Calernia, couldn't he? Might be going for the weapon at Artoise.

Edit: Or the drow might not be attacking the Kingdom of the Dead. I mean, it's not exactly a nice place to live. Might've just decided to live in Twilight, maybe invade Arcadia.

Or the fae could be attacking. I mean, they just stole a chunk of Arcadia. And wasn't there royalty in that shard? One tried to hijack Cat's gate when she first took a peek there.

**** None of them save the Pilgrim made treaties with someone with the title Queen of Callow, though. The Pilgrim could, but given he lives solely by Catherine's mercy that story would sour for him and the Dominion very rapidly.
