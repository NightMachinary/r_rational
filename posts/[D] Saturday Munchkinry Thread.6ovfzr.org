Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Your powers are as follows: upon direct contact with a person's skin, you can transform them into [[http://imgur.com/a/8Iz2m][any Liminal of your choice]] for 24 hours.

Your goal is to take over the entire +TRI-STATE AREA!+ world. As with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/50tqsf/mk_you_can_turn_people_into_catgirls_take_over/][the prompt that inspired me to make this]], you don't need to be an absolute dictator - just be the leader of a world government.

*** Isn't this basically a strictly more powerful version of the catgirl ability? Dragons + Kobolds + Ogres/devils + weres each have relatively little in the way of phenotypic changes, in the sense that I can definitely see a fair amount of people making the switch.

You could probably stand to use an additional caveat: for example, the addition of a time limit, or changing it to "upon direct contact with a person's skin, you *must* transform them into any liminal of /their/ choice", or whatever you feel is necessary to add to the challenge.

***** Wait, what's the time limit on? Are you only allowed to use your ability for the next 24 hours? Or are the people you transform only allowed to stay transformed for 24 hours?

*** Huh, that's not the kind of time limit I expected, but it does present some interesting possibilities.

First off, the fact that it's only temporary will be a boon, for most people. You'll have a massive contigent of people who will want to be a liminal for a day, just to try it out. You could sell your services by saying "Today I'm making people into weres" or whatever, then have people pay to line up while you sit in a jeep and drive past them, making skin contact with each person. Estimating ~10 mph as a safe speed to stick out your hand and have people get slapped as you drive past them, and pretending people are about a foot long end to end, you could touch 10 * 5280 = 52800 clients in an hour, in an absolute best case scenario, although you'd probably have to do it twice to catch the people who didn't manage to get touched the first tim.e

There's probably a better way to do this, but that's an engineering problem. More than likely, on any given day, you won't see anywhere near that many people who want to be touched anyways. After all, to get this kind of conversion rate, you can do, at best, a few lines of people a day, which means you'll have to rotate which liminals you offer.

But then, that's assuming people only want to stay liminal for a day. More than likely, you could find a contigent of people who want to /stay/ liminals, and these people would rely on you to touch them daily, which would give you massive amounts of leverage over them: displease me, and you're back to being a regular, ordinary human. That puts you in a /very/ good position to start a personality cult. After all, regular cults already get a lot of mileage out of giving/withdrawing affection to make people emotionally dependent; "being a liminal" is the next level of "incorporating cult teachings into your self identity."

After you establish your cult, then you can basically use [[/u/infernovulpix]] 's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/50tqsf/mk_you_can_turn_people_into_catgirls_take_over/d76ylaa/][solution]]. Implementation details would differ, but the path would be pretty similar.

--------------

Alternatively, you can use the power only on yourself to become a harpy, claim to be an angel (most people won't know the difference), and leverage that into even-increasing power. As a bonus, you don't need to be an angel full time: just make a visitation every few months or so, give out some decent but obvious advice, aquire a shitload of disciples, and start affecting political change. Bonus points if you make visitations in a place that already has religious significance.

*** Just listing tools, not the actual strategy:

- Medusa lamia have a "glare that makes living creatures unable to move, as if they've been turned to stone". That sounds like a ridiculously useful safe tazer for police work et al, plus, if it works via a live feed then could be potentially */awesome/* as a "stun /everyone/" tool (ridiculously dangerous if other people get their hands on the stun-video though). Also: Have a companion that can be quickly turned into a medusa, and you have yourself a great surprise-stungun.
- Normal slimes are "exceptionally fast learners". Obvious application is obvious.
- Eel mermaids can use their mucus for cosmetics, which is a good source of money. Also, /in theory/, mermaids could be cheap scuba divers, but there's no indication that they can survive depths. If they /could/, though, then there might be utility in using them to map out ocean floors (which are something like 90% uncharted). Super important that they keep an eye on the 24-hour timer though, if they revert in the deep-sea then they're fucked.
- Backbeard cyclops have hypnotism powers. That sounds permanent-ish, and might be a useful and easy tool for either power or therapy. Secretly hypnotise world leaders for easy world domination, easy peasy.
- Arachne web could be useful for construction and whatever the material is useful for.
- Does zombie race actually resurrect people? Because, free experts right there. ET Jayne, Einstein, etc. Except it only lasts 24 hours, bugger. Still, /ridiculously/ useful if that works.

*** I don't know what a "Liminal" is, so I assume you can transform people into any of the species listed in the link you gave.

First, transform yourself into a sentient undead, now you are immortal. Now there are a number of ways to take over the world.

The fastest is to transform someone into a mindless undead. Effectively triggering a zombie apocalypse and turning all of humanity into mindless undeads, except you who is a sentient undead. Since you are the only sentient being left, you automatically are the leader of the world.

A slower, slightly more peaceful method is to make loyal minions into merpeople. Most of the Earth is oceans, so the merpeople will reproduce and become a major superpower, stronger than all of the land-based countries. Declare war against humanity for their pollution of the oceans, rallying the merpeople behind you. The land-based countries cannot win: nukes don't work well on deep underwater targets. So surrenders/pre-emptive peace treaties are desperately negotiated and signed, letting you usurp power and become the leader of a world government.

*** Two basic steps to get started-Money and fame. Both are easy to get, the Randi prize may be gone but subprizes remain. Does it keep injuries? If it transfigures them into healthy Liminal, it's a medical treatment.

**** If this follows the same rules as the older thread, body parts with no equivalent (that need to be created from scratch, such as wings or tails) would be perfectly healthy, but body parts with direct equivalents, even transformed, maintain their same state of injury/healthiness.
