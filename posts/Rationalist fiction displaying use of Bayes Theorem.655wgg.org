TL;DR: A university professor who does research on application of Bayes Theorem wants rationalist fiction recommendations.

I was talking to my instructor for statistics and probability theory. We were talking about how statistical and probabilistic literacy would be much more useful for most people than calculus. I mentioned updating your beliefs using Bayes Theorem. He was surprised I even knew such things and asked where I learned about it. I gave a very brief description of rationalist fiction. He was really interested given his focus of research is in application of Bayes Theorem. I told him that I'd email him a more detailed explanation with recommended reading.

This is the second instructor from the math department whose ears perked up at the idea of rational and rationalist fiction. If you want to get some rational fiction buddies, math departments are a good place to start.


** /Conned Again, Watson/ was summarized in detail [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5w27a3/eduffrst_conned_again_watson_in_which_sherlock/][here]] (though no discussion ensued...). Bayes's Theorem is used explicitly, in a visualized and easily-understandable [[http://i.imgur.com/S4JSIIk.jpg][format]], several times.

** If you want rationalist fiction where the protagonist actually /uses/ bayes theorem regularly, then I think you're out of luck. HPMOR is the only one I know which actually uses the phrase with some regularity, and if Harry Potter actually used the formula more often basically the entire plot could be avoided.

Well that, and trusted more experienced people more often when setting his priors.

** I seem to recall datapacrat having a fic with heavy usage of bayes theorem. I'm having a bit of trouble navigating his website, but I remember it was about an SI being revived from cryostasis into a female bunny body, and then exploring the exceptionally weird world that the singularity (and subsequent apocalypse) caused.

Can I have some help finding it [[/u/datapacrat]]?

*** The link you gave leads to the version hosted on SpaceBattles and was shut down by the mods with only 6 of the books.

Right now, he's not working on it, but I am confident that DataPacRat will return after he's finished working on the other story [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracted]] and [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit][FAQ on LoadBear's Instrument of Precommitment]].

** Seems like linking this website here would be relevant:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/browse.php][Mathematical Fiction]]

  #+begin_quote
    Of the many works of fiction that are published, very few involve mathematics or mathematicians. However, people who like mathematics (or are mathematicians ourselves) may especially enjoy reading those few that do. [..] mathematicians should be interested in these works of "mathematical fiction" even if we do not enjoy them because they both affect and reflect the non-mathematician's view of this subject.

    Therefore, the list at this site is collected both for your pleasure and professional interest. If you happen to know of any other examples, please let me know. [..]

    Notes: Since it is not especially significant to the purposes of this list, I am not differentiating between fiction which refers to actual mathematics and literature in which the mathematics itself is fictional. [..]

fair warning-- there is some really, really weird transhumanism involved, and I don't think it's ever getting finished.

** generally you can't rely exclusively on bayes theorem to be rational any more than you can predict the stock market through the movements of quarks. that being said, just knowing that your thoughts and decisions need to obey the math to be rational helps. there are a bunch of skills involved, it's not as simple as reciting the formal axiom and leaving it at that.

**** I mean that you're probably not going to find any rat fics where characters explicitly rely on bayes theorem all that much. You might find examples where a character explicitly studied the math, but I can't think of any examples besides HPMOR. Bayes theorem is intractable on most real world problems and I would say most realistic fictional world problems too. Humans don't have the time or brain power to rely on bayes for everything. Oftentimes just knowing that the rational characters' thinking and decision making has to obey the math (at least when they are being rational) helps a lot even when the characters themselves aren't explicitly using bayes theorem.

Tldr: it's really hard to find examples of bayes theorem being explicitly invoked and applied by characters in rational fic for the above reasons.

That being said if you want recommendations that your instructor might like...

If he's into sci-fi I would recommend reading "Three Worlds Collide" first. It's a greatly underappreciated masterpiece, and it is much shorter than HPMOR and by the same author. Plus its better than HPMOR on average (though HPMOR is better at its best) Also "the Vulcan your Vulcan Would Sound Like if he Wasn't Made of Straw". Don't remember the author for that one.

HPMOR is quite a time commitment and the protagonist is kinda a jerk in the beginning (plus the first four chapters aren't quite as well written as the rest) so some people might find it a bit off-putting. And HPMOR is pretty heavy reading too.

If he's still interested after reading TWC, he's probably going to like HPMOR too. Probably should use daystar's improved version of the first four chapters though for the best reading experience. TBH I think EY should have gotten daystar's permission to replace his original version of the first four chapters with daystar's.
