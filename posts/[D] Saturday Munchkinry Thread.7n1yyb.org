Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *Pint-sized time travel*

You discover that you have the ability travel backwards in time. Specifically, you're able to, at will, instantly send your consciousness back exactly one minute into the past, upon where it will overwrite the mind of your past self (I.e. mental time travel). You also realise that you can use this ability up to 5 times every 24 hour period, with no immediate cooldown (so you can, at most, travel back 5 minutes per day by chaining your uses).

You could obviously use it to win at gambling, but what bigger picture uses for this ability are there? How would you exploit this ability to its maximum?

*Scenario Two:*

Suppose you have the same ability as above. However, now a random person you know in your circle of friends (~30 people) has the exact same ability. How would you attempt to find out who that person is (preferably without them realizing it)? If necessary, how would you attempt to apprehend that person?

*** I think one amazing facet of this power is undetectable information gathering. You have the ability to perform tests and then make it as if they never happened. You can also asymmetrically communicate with someone in an undetectable way. Here are some example uses I can think of for this power:

- You smash a window / bypass a lock / do whatever you need to get access to sensitive information. You don't need to be careful, just fast enough that you're within your 5 minute time limit. You memorize the information and reset. Now there's no physical evidence, nothing is disturbed, you might as well not have been there so it's impossible to know that you were.

- You want someone to meet you and communicate something to you, but you don't want to reveal yourself. Tell them to meet you at a particular place, get the information from them and reset. Now you can walk past or away from the meeting place, and as far as the person's concerned you just never showed up. You can also tell someone to do a dead drop, get the information from that and then reset. Anyone watching the drop location won't be able to tell that it was accessed, because you made it so that it technically never was

- Test out anything when you're not sure how safe it is. As long as it won't destroy your brain or irrevocably traumatize you, you can get away with a lot of dumb stuff. You have a safety margin so that if anything bad happens, you can reset it and do something else.

- It gives you extra thinking time. If something shockingly bad happens, you have up to 5 minutes to process it, figure out how to fix things or just generally figure out what you would do differently. You'll have a nice buffer against being surprised. If there's a medical emergency, a 5 minute warning can easily be the difference between life and death

- You now have a godly success rate at nearly anything you try, so you can possibly leverage that into fame. Imagine a surgeon that could erase up to 5 mistakes during a day of operations. Imagine an athlete that can shut down up to 5 novel, potentially game changing plays from the opposition. The ability to never be caught off guard gives an unreasonable advantage. On the other side of this, you can make more risky plays and try more dramatic things without worrying about them panning out.

- You can ask and then unask a question, and do a lot of social engineering. This is more unethical use of the power, but you can do something like "Hey what's your name?" /reset/ "Oh hi Bob, of course I remember you". Someone catches you in a lie? Ask what gave you away remorsefully, then reset because you now have the information you needed to lie successfully this time. You can dig for information by striking up conversations with people, and then surprise them when you know things that they don't think they ever told you

**** An excellent and well thought response.

How would you handle scenario 2? Knowing that your adversary has the ability to gather information from YOU and your environment possibly without you knowing, what opsec countermeasures could you apply to negate this?

Or what I'd want to know is: how to resist investigation/interrogation from a person with mental time travel. Could you lie? How would you ensure cross scenario consistency? Any way to prevent your moves from being predicted?

If you want information to be confidential, you have to /never/ give it out. Not under torture, not if you have a gun pulled on you, not if someone walks over and says they're going to shoot your whole family if you don't tell them what they need to know. A person with this ability can still only know what you're willing to tell them. If you pre-commit to keeping your important information a secret even in dramatic situations, it'll be much more work to exploit you if it's possible at all.

As for physical security... in a theoretical sense, you want to make sure your information is encrypted so that it's useless to try memorizing it. In a real world sense, I'm positive someone with this ability could break into anywhere they please with enough preparation. The problem is that /someone/ has to be able to access the information and unless it's only you and you're willing to take your password to the grave, it's vulnerable to the same kind of real world problems that cause security to fail. Even worse actually, because it can be impossible to detect when someone has carefully used this ability to fish for information until they know everything they need. Someone with this ability would also be unreasonably good at breaking into places to steal physical things, it just wouldn't be undetectable. Honestly I think it's pretty broken in that regard, and that the only way to secure things would be making them genuinely impossible to access (which isn't practical to do). You also can't assume someone else has your same 5 minute time limit, which complicates things even further.

So my verdict is that you can keep mental secrets as long as you strongly pre-commit to keeping them, but if you have something written down or otherwise stored then you're up a creek without a paddle. Someone can methodically fish until they have a path to get your information, and you'd never be able to tell when they did.

****** You don't need to be quite so secure with this since you know the power can only take back five minutes at a time. OP does specify that they have the exact same power, so we know they have the same limitations. Therefore you don't have to precommit to never giving out your information, even under torture, you just need to precommit to waiting at least five minutes after the perpetrator has revealed himself before giving out information. Store all of your information under some fancy lock or encryption program that, when someone attempts to access, leaves some signal that it has been accessed, waits for five minutes, and only then actually opens. So even if they get your password they won't be able to access your files without leaving a trace.

Similarly, if you have personal knowledge that you might allow people to know, such as your home address, but don't want people knowing without your awareness, you can precommit to only give out that information at least five minutes after deciding to give it out. Then the only people to be suspicious of are people you decide to give it to but end up suddenly leaving without the information before the five minutes are up.

That is an incredibly good point, but I still think it's best to be as cautious as possible until you discover the nature and origin of the powers. I know if I were ever really put in this situation, the fastest way I'd screw myself over would be to think "only this specific power with this specific limitation exists". I mean, how arbitrary is 5 minutes when you really think about it? Why /that/ specifically? I know the Doylist answer is "because the question's OP said so", but I think these munchkinry threads are more fun if you take them seriously and really put yourself in those shoes

******** It depends on the context. These posts generally imply some sort of background knowledge where you have been told exactly the contents of the post ahead of time by a reliable source, or have acquired this information in some way. Otherwise, how would you know you even had this power and how to use it? When is the last time you mentally attempted to go back in time exactly one minute? When is the last time you attempted to read the mind of someone while you were touching them? You might jokingly try some powers every once in a while, but we have very strong evidence for living in a world where these powers don't exist, so you don't try every permutation of possible triggers for powers in order to discover which ones actually work. So if you did happen to spontaneously acquire one of these powers, you wouldn't even realize it unless something informed you.

So I think we can assume for the sake of munchkinry that the post is 100% accurate and that this is common knowledge, but in practice I would be cautious, and probably suspicious of everyone ever in case they also had similar powers.

Depends a bit on how the ability works.

Consider this plan: For the next 30 days, pick one friend and have a 20 minute private conversation in a private location. Towards the end of the conversation, without any warning, take out a knife and stab your friend. (If you aren't stronger than your friend, train to be stronger before attempting.) Be on guard around the 14 to 19 minute mark of the conversation.

There are a two possible outcomes:

Case 1) You successfully stab and murder your friend.

Spend a few minutes stabbing your friend to death, then revert 5 minutes to back before you stabbed your friend. Since they died without using any time rewind ability, this likely indicates that they do not have the time rewind ability (do this early in the day so they haven't used up their 5 minutes yet). Because if they did have a time rewind ability, why didn't they use it to prevent their death?

Since you rewinded to before your murder attempt, no one notices anything wrong. Proceed to stab your next friend tomorrow.

Case 2) Sometime around the 14 to 19 minute mark, your friend will suddenly react as if they just came back from a future where you stabbed them.

Watch for signs of this, such as sudden shudders, sudden attacks, sudden attempts to flee without any explanation, etc. Now you know your friend has the time rewind ability, but this is the part where things get tricky, depending on the specifics of your time rewind ability.

The problem is, you now have an angry time traveler that is very wary of your future murder attempt. The question is, can you still use your time rewind ability? You haven't used it at this point in time, after all. And you wouldn't use it in the original future either, since your friend used his ability before dying, and you only use your ability after your friend dies, which never happens. So I would think yes, you can. Use your ability to rewind back 5 minutes, and now your friend (who has already used up his 5 minutes) can't follow you back. So you effectively arrive at a past where your friend, the other time traveler, still has no idea you were even attempting anything funny. Now you know your friend has the time rewind ability, with no one knowing you know.

*** In scenario two, where I have a friend with the same ability, we can work together to send information a lot further than five minutes into the past.

To take an example, let us say that there is a lottery in which ticket sales close two hours before the results are made public. I observe the results, then I go back in time five minutes and tell my friend.

He hears me give him the results five minutes early, then goes back in time to tell me.

I hear the results from him nine minutes early (it took a bit of time for him to hear the results). Since I have not yet used my five minutes today, I go back in time five minutes and tell him the results.

He hears the results from me thirteen minutes early, and goes back in time...

--------------

About two hours before the numbers are drawn, just before ticket sales close, we each purchase a ticket with the right numbers and share a large prize.

So, basically, as long as the two of us work together (and can trust each other), we can send small bits of data back through time an arbitrary amount (at the risk of one of us mishearing at some point and getting the data wrong).

Once you've done that it's rather difficult to imagine many likely scenarios where you can make a massive difference by going up to five minutes into the past, so mainly you're going to affect the world by being absurdly wealthy. You could also potentially make your abilities known which would make you famous and come with wealth that way, but this would come with many drawbacks and likely being barred from manipulating stocks the same way.

The plan here is that you're going to be deliberately looking for very rapid stock changes throughout the day. This will probably involve having an AI that automatically notifies you of such changes. Ultimately I think this will work because on most days I imagine there will be some very rapid changes in stock in some publicly traded company /somewhere/. Though of course going to casinos would be a very good way of getting a few million starting capital, however people won't let you go to their casinos if you consistently win millions of dollars, so you can't scale up that income.

Stock tickers are delayed by at least 15 minutes, so if you need something with sub-5-minute accuracy you'll need to be working for an exchange/brokerage/etc. Even then you're not going to be able to pull it off, since high frequency traders have software that monitors the market and shapes prices in real time -- when they see you starting to buy a big position they'll jump ahead of you in the order queue and the price will be higher by the time your order goes through. Read the book "Flash Boys" for more on this -- it's fascinating and also infuriating.

Watch the suspected people for obvious usage of the power. Gambling and such should be a good tell. You could also attempt to give them a reason to use said power. In other words manufacture a situation where their power could be used to save someone or something.

You don't even need to do that. 5 minutes of time rewind is actually pretty useless for combat purposes, especially since they can only time rewind 5 times per day. It might give them some early warning to flee, or 5 retries to escape/win the fight, but that's nothing in the face of overwhelming force. Any standard police force would have no problem arresting such a time traveler, and once they are in a prison cell, their time rewind abilities wouldn't do a thing to help them escape.

The only time this time rewind ability would be useful in combat is if you were evenly matched. But then, you shouldn't be trying to apprehend someone while you are evenly matched anyway. Always attack from ambush with superior firepower.
