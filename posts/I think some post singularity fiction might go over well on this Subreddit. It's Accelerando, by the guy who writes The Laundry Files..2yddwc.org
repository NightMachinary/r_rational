** The thing that escapes most people's notice is that /Accelerando/ is intended to be Fridge Horror. Think about the events of the novel from the perspective of someone who isn't a member of the McX clan.

*** What little information we get on other people seems to imply they range from "Oh the horror!" to "adapting just fine," which seems to be pretty much the same as our current world.

***** I must have missed that by reading it too quickly. I interpreted the scenes on Venus as "most humans came out alive."

** It's good, but aside from Aineko, the main characters aren't really rational.

*** Indeed. While a brilliant whirlwind of concepts and themes and highly recommended, not exactly rational material. Mr. is active on reddit btw, as cstross.

** I really like the story because it's not so much post-singularity as trans-singularity. It provides a believable account of what a scale-of-years Hanson-style Singularity would look like, and how terrifying it would be.

** Not exactly rationalist fiction, but I liked it all the same.

While reading it, my smartphone broke down right when I was reading a bit where the protagonist loses his "enhancements" and, well, I felt really similar (to a less extent, of course). That's what made me love the book.

** Yeah this was pretty good but I've read better rationalist fiction.
