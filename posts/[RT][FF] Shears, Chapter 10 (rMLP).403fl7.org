** The story begins [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/1/shears/bridges-1][here]].

Basic info is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r][here]].

This chapter was extremely tricky to write, but I'm very satisfied with how it turned out. However, I'm wary of the classic trap of an artist finding their work to be more transparent than it is to someone without their privy knowledge. The chapter is intended to be disorienting---but please tell me if you feel it's too much so.

Comments are greatly appreciated; Shears is considerably more popular in terms of views, ratings, and favorite selections than it is in terms of actual discussion. As always, thanks for reading!

*** Nah, pretty transparent, though this one has the first event I don't see happening to me with the right lack of knowledge. (In the last chapter, I was surprised when she realized that she ought to pretend she had a preference.)

**** If I'm understanding what you're saying correctly, my response is that, well, Twilight is not particularly neurotypical.

That is generally the case with everything, as the former are lower-effort than the latter.

**** That's definitely true, I think I just get obsessive over feedback. But this chapter has inspired more discussion than pretty much the entire rest of the story combined, so I'm feeling a lot better. =D

** Feedback: The pacing is very slow, I am concerned that perhaps the author is scared of starting the actual story. (Sorry Calamitizer.)

*** I think that's a reasonable complaint. Pacing is a very tricky thing. I did my best to move the introductions along relatively quickly, but I couldn't justify writing more coarsely than one chapter per pony. The leading exposition is almost entirely over with, now, though. Arc 1 will be complete in a few chapters. And I hereby swear that not every episode will get a full arc like this one. =p

** This is a really really really really really really good story. Nothing further to report.

...

Well, one thing, actually. The story hasn't hit on its main themes yet, which makes fanart difficult. Any change you could give me a hint?

**** You probably aren't talking to me, but I'll answer anyways. It's impossible to see ... because it's all blurred/whited out!

Okay, but seriously, it's a moderately uncommon effect you really only ever see in digital media, whereby the author implies that the directly preceding passage is really just more of the same, and for that reason you don't have to read it. If you're really curious, the invisible portion says:

"But the Möbius function can only take the values zero, one, or minus one over a distributive lattice. It's only nonzero if it's evaluated on an interval isomorphic to a Boolean poset. If an interval is isomorphic to B sub n, the value of μ is minus one to the n.

**** It's meant to represent A) that Twilight's thoughts are fading in and out of reality and B) that comprehension of that paragraph is not at all important for the story.

***** I feel I should mention that fimfiction has a bunch of formatting options, and I generally read on Medium Dark. So the middle of the text was the only really unreadable part, and someone on Dark wouldn't be able to read the end at all.

** so just to make sure i understand, the reason she fainted was because of a surprise party, and she has a lot of social anxiety?

That chapter was kinda confusing.

*** She didn't faint, she had a panic attack that resulted in a dissociative state. She was briefly amnesiac/incoherent when the surprise hit.

But yes, you have the reasons right and everything.

  Celestia knows Twilight isn't the kind of pony who could treat her word as anything but law.

  heavy is the head of the pony who kneels beneath the crown.

Am I the only one who's finding Twilight's submissive relationship with the princess vaguely sexually gratifying? The answer is yes. Shame on me.

*** :o

There are probably others here who just have too much shame on them to admit it. The fact that one person on the subreddit finds it vaguely sexually gratifying means that statistically speaking there are probably others since there are a few thousand people subscribed to this subreddit and probably even more lurking. Of course, I suppose the next obvious response to that is "What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?" Maybe you are the only one.

Although I thought the Confessor and Lord Akon from "Three Worlds Collide" might have made a cute couple if it weren't for the centuries of age-difference, so I'm not one to talk. :P
