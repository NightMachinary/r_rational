*tl;dr:* This is the companion thread for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6iqyxi/biweekly_challenge_barrier_maiden/][the biweekly challenge]], please post comments, recommendations, or anything else relating to the challenge below.

The prompt this week is "The girl is alone, holdling back the darkness. She's too young to die ...". I believe this was the very first prompt to be submitted to the GDocs spreadsheet of ideas for the challenge, and is used here verbatim. I don't really have much to add, but I hope that someone will find their inspiration.


** I kind of want to write some log horizon fanfiction for this prompt...

Nah.
