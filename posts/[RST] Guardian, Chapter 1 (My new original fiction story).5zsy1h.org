** Hey everyone, this is the new story that I've mentioned a few times on Rationally Writing. It's aiming to be a YA novel for eventual publication, and I have no idea how quickly I'll be able to get through it, or how much of it will end up going online, but for now I'd like to put it up here for people to read and give feedback on.

Title is still a work in progress. Enjoy!

(For those of you that might be worried, I can promise that this won't interfere with Origin of Species, since this one chapter took me a few months to write with whatever spare time I had between all the other projects. It's nice to be able to switch gears and work on something fresh, but the new Pokemon chapter is still being worked on too.)

I'm unsure what Terra's motivations are for approaching the fourth "girl". As in, if it were me, I probably wouldn't have taken a brazen approach, but I suspect there's more info here that is probably important, like maybe fae are notorious for messing with people.

I felt like he was just looking for more interactions with fae, with the feeling of security that Puck would intervene if he was doing something really wrong. It makes sense, he does need to learn how to interact with them better if he's to ever improve on Puck's oath.

** I'm noticing a good amount of influence from Pact here, so I'm guessing that this story is partially inspired by the question "What would Pact be like if things didn't always suck everywhere forever?" You'd still have the clever words and mind games, the blood magic and assorted other magics, and the severe /risk/ of horrible fates if you're careless, but put instead in a package where, if you play your cards right, you can win or at least break even.

The fig trick was intriguing. Terra somehow knew that he was being affected by /something/, even though he was being blocked from comprehending it when not seeing it, but it was only when he had physical proof of her existence that he could actually remember her. I'm not sure what that means for the nature of glamour and illusions, but it's an interesting data point.

Naming scheme so far seems a bit esoteric, what with Terra and Puck. I'm guessing Terra was given an unusual name by his dad, who presumably was thoroughly immersed in the spooky stuff, and Puck's not even human, but I wondered for a moment there if this was a 'fantasy academy where everyone has weird names' story.

So far, it looks like it has good potential to get Terra more and more sucked into the supernatural world like Blake did, though hopefully less tragically. I can say right from the get-go that I hope Terra finds some peers to confide in and drag along with him. Alternate perspectives and reactions are a significant chunk of what makes stories compelling for me, so loner stories don't resonate quite as well.

My interpretation was that he was able to recognize the memory trick because he could only remember three girls, but he remembered them /acting/ like there was a fourth person there. Like their body language didn't make sense if there were really only three. So the memory trick made him forget the fae, but it couldn't alter how he saw the human girls behaving.

Puck's definitely not the fae's true name or I'm sure he would have objected to Terra revealing it, so I have to assume that he adopted it (or someone gave it to him) as a joke. I mean, assuming that Shakespeare is a thing in this universe.

** "Terra's feels nauseous" ought to be "Terra feels nauseous." I believe this is the only error in the entire text. I find the premise interesting. I like the characterizations of Puck and Terra.

Personally, I have a pretty deep-seated aversion to the use of present tense in fiction, it pulls me out of the story and completely destroys my suspension of disbelief and makes me hyper-aware of the fact that I'm reading a book, and I agree with [[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/sep/18/philip-pullman-author-present-tense][everything Philip Pullman has to say about the matter]].

It's /your/ story, and you ought to do whatever it is that makes /you/ satisfied with it because that's all that matters at the end of the day, but if you intend to legitimately publish this then you ought to be aware of the fact that a not insignificant number of potential readers have negative associations with the use of present tense in fiction since the vast majority of fiction isn't written in the present tense. You might very well already be aware of all that and made the creative decision to write in the present tense in spite of it. To quote a famous philosopher, "you do you, and I'll do me, and we won't do each other... probably."

*** Fixed the typo, thanks! And glad you like the premise :)

As for the tense, yeah, this is one of those things I feel like I might be most irrational about. I /know/ that I'm losing readers by having Origin of Species and this novel in present tense, but... something in me resists the notion that this is wrong or taboo, and wants to fight back against it out of sheer stubbornness that others have such an aversion to it.

No disrespect to Phillip Pullman, I love his work intensely, but I find the argument unconvincing. I think it's something that's evolved as a taste simply because of convention. The idea that present-tense is just not how stories are told is strange to me, who finds it a natural voice to tell written stories in. The Dresden Files makes sense to be in the past tense because the writer is documenting his past. Stories explicitly about past events ("Long ago," or "Once upon a time,") make sense to use past tense because it's part of the setting.

I'm not writing a journal, nor are my narrators or characters recalling things that occurred in the past. The narration serves as a simple lens of a story of what's happening /right now/ in the world my readers are reading, as they read it. I find it engaging, personally, and it allows me to use past tense as it's intended: to describe things that happened in the past.

If I end up getting to the point where I have to get this thing published and all the editors notes and denial letters are saying "gotta put it in past tense," I'll cave. But if I can help contribute to normalizing present tense as a form of storytelling, and have people able to more easily read both, I count that as a plus :)

In the meantime, I'm sorry if it bothers you, and hope the other aspects of the story make up for it!

**** Honestly, I read the comments first and saw people saying the present tense took them out of it, so I went into it knowing this was a concern people had--but when I actually went to read the chapter, I immediately forgot and didn't give the tense another thought all the way through. I didn't even really register that it was in present tense, despite having been "warned" in advance. I might be outvoted on this one but I think it's fine, personally. The writing flows smoothly enough, and the plot is immersive enough, that the tense doesn't get in between me and the story.

**** I think that you may be projecting your feelings as the author onto the reader when you say that it gives a feeling of things happening "right now".

For me as a reader, past tense works as a way of mimicking how I would sort through my own memories, discovering things as the chain of association makes its way through my memories of a series of events.

By contrast, present tense makes me feel like an observer, not a participant.

But I can definitely see that present tense might be more conducive to writing.

--------------

Also, anecdotally, present tense narration makes it harder for me to remember past plot events. I remember liking Ra, but I don't remember anything that happened in it. In your Pokemon Origin of Species I find myself having to go back and review more often than in other fictions.

Right, but Pullman didn't say that, he tried to make an argument about how the past tense is intrinsically a better medium to tell stories in, for various reasons, and how the shift to present tense can be used artistically. I feel kinda the reverse. The hand-held cameras comparison is a good one, but I do think that it's just as natural to tell stories in the present tense as the past tense.

Like, a friend could be telling you a story and describe it like this:

"So I was at the bar last night, and this big guy came up to us and started making fun of my buddy's shirt. I stepped between them and tried to calm everyone down, but he took a swing at me! I got knocked on my ass, and I was like, 'what the hell,' you know?"

Or they could say it like this:

"So I'm at the bar last night, and this big guy comes up to us and starts making fun of my buddy's shirt. I step between them and try to calm everyone down, but he takes a swing at me! I'm knocked on my ass, and I'm like 'what the hell,' you know?"

And in my perspective of how people react to this, no one is confused or taken out of the story because they know that the person isn't literally at the bar right now as they describe it, they're just using the present-tense as a form of immediacy/immersion, unconsciously.

That's how it is for me: when I write, it comes out in present tense because the events are happening /now/ as I envision them. The reason I don't change it is a bit of wanting to break taboos and buck tradition, but it's more because I'm stubborn rather than the first cause, which is that it's just natural to me :)

Huh, well I guess you learn something new every day. I didn't even consciously notice it was present-tense until you pointed it out.

I wonder if it's a native language thing - a lot of Polish fiction I remember was in present tense, and it's not really a weird thing.

ETA after reading the article:

#+begin_quote
  I agree with [[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/sep/18/philip-pullman-author-present-tense][everything Philip Pullman has to say about the matter]].
#+end_quote

That rant is really confusing. It's somehow assumed that using present tense as the base of the story means that only present tense will ever be used?

#+begin_quote
  But if every sound you emit is a scream, a scream has no expressive value. What I dislike about the present-tense narrative is its limited range of expressiveness. I feel claustrophobic, always pressed up against the immediate.

  I want all the young present-tense storytellers (the old ones have won prizes and are incorrigible) to allow themselves to stand back and show me a wider temporal perspective. I want them to feel able to say what happened, what usually happened, what sometimes happened, what had happened before something else happened, what might happen later, what actually did happen later, and so on: to use the full range of English tenses.
#+end_quote

Starting with the present tense as what's happening /now/ in the story doesn't prevent you from using the past tense to talk about what happened /before/, nor the future to talk about the future. In fact, talking about the future seems easier in english if your base is the present tense - you can now simply use future tenses, rather than have to reverse the relationship and use past perfect, or use some kind of contextual expression to provide the 'jump forward in time' and then get back ('A. Later, B. But for now C').

I must be missing something. Guess this will be a thing to pay attention to next time I read something streatched over a large time scale

ETA 2: I am now thinking of a story written mainly in future tense. I don't think it works well in English, alas (too much 'will'); but for something like Polish where the tense is built by transforming verbs, and so without annoying repetition, it could be a fun read.

I tend to find original web fiction difficult to get into. This chapter was the opposite - it really drew me in from the get go, with no snags along the way. It explained what it needed to explain, but didn't overshare information.

I was surprised to find that this was meant to be a YA novel. One chapter isn't much to judge by, but it didn't feel as simple as typical YA fiction. This may be good or bad. It appeals to me, but I'm not in the target audience. On the other hand, the very best writing /should/ appeal to all ages, IMO - look at Avatar: TLA.

Secondly, I kept thinking the protagonist was female because of the name "Terra", but the comments here seem to imply they were male.

(One possibility that strikes me is that Puck might take advantage of Terra's assumption that he'll only give hints if he thinks Terra's wellbeing is at risk--since it's an assumption on Terra's part, it wouldn't require Puck to lie.) And the part with the figs was clever and immersive. It made me /feel/ the memory trick.

Guardian and OoS are on the same RSS feed on your site, so unless you include something in the post titles other than "Chapter xx", its impossible to filter one out from the other with an RSS reader.

However, the mind games were intriguing.

*** I'm also nosy about why you don't use em-dashes. I think the use of dashes looks ok, they're just not using the specific character. AFAIK both the default wordpress editor and Microsoft Word will format "--", replacing it with a single long dash character. & it should still round-trip fine after conversion, if you have a more complex workflow. (More often I'll see someone blogging code, and the automatic replacement breaks the code).

^ you don't see this in a (deliberately) typeset book. You'd see an em dash, /or/ as a variant style, an en dash preceded by a space.

So that's what I was nosy about. But resolving it doesn't seem to be quite as simple as I was hoping.

- use the em dash style throughout, or the en dash style?
- use a variation where the em dash is spaced (like AP style - maybe less used for books / longform)?
- how to generate your chosen characters

I think I read it wrong about WP rendering "--" as an em dash. I think "--" shows an en dash, and "---" shows an em dash. But e.g. if you ever edit in Word with the default auto-replace, then it may permanently replace the characters, using a /different/ conversion.

(Editing in Word is another thing I'd say is Probably Wrong, but serves a purpose & takes more effort to describe what a preferable approach would look like).

****** Hmm, okay, so it looks like em-dash would be used for an interruption in dialogue, but I can't find anywhere saying that it's used for an interruption in narrative too. I guess the same principle might apply? But it's curious that it's not mentioned there, since it goes over it pretty thoroughly but specifically only mentions speech.

For now I'll replace the dashes where speech is interrupted, and keep the ones where narrative is :) Thanks!

******* Heh. Perhaps "good" is over-estimating Wikipedia, at least for how clear it is.

I guess speech is the most traditional use for dashes.

Absolutely up to you, what style you want to follow. What I'm mostly confident about, is that the ASCII hyphens that were used are /not/ considered dashes. And there's no traditional style that uses hyphens to show an interruption or pause (except stuttering, as Wiki points out to me).

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypen]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash]]

(You'll also see pedantic references to the ASCII character as a hyphen-minus, since it is overloaded to represent both hyphens and minus signs. But if someone's worried about typesetting math, they've probably used something like Latex or MathJax, or already wrestled with fonts & encodings to get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_figures][text figures]]).

English is not my first language, but should this be "/of/ any given setting" instead? I've also submitted this directly on the page, but decided I wanted to actually learn if I was wrong.
