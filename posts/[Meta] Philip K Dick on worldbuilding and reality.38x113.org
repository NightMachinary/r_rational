** I like the fundamental meditative questions he asks himself in order to generate his stories.

- What is the nature of reality?
- what are the innate qualities that make us human?

I am a physician and I often ponder on the disconnect between how I perceive reality and an actively psychotic patient is interpreting the same reality through the added lenses of conflicting internal stimuli. Most people agree with my version, most of the time. Do I have some of these maya illusions draped over my version too, things I am equally blind to in how I apprehend and comprehend the world?

His non-temporal interpretations of the coincidences between minor life events and his religious background do not seem to be explored in a similarly critical manner, though.

Perhaps subconsciously he had heard the Book of Acts when he was younger and internalized it. Or, elements of the story are common enough that they would overlap. Frankly, I'd be more impressed if his story matched something from the Bhagavad Gita or another tale he had much less liking of of ever hearing before, yet his book precisely pattern matched with it.

I gotta hand it to PKD though, he writes some trippy lit.

** Are you by chance following the Talos Principle Let's Play over on SA? Because this essay came up there at almost exactly the same time you posted it here; and while it could be the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, somehow I suspect not.

*** No - It looks like talos principle is a game, but what is SA?

(I did post this here after seeing it linked to on twitter by someone who possibly got it from there.)

**** SA is Something Awful - in this case the Something Awful forums; these are the (nonfree/paid) forums of the internet's self-described 'goons', a set of loosely amalgamated groups of internet people. They tend to have a strong presence in much of online gaming and (eg the Goonswarm in massive multiplayer online game Eve Online). The forums have as a whole strong tendencies to strong language mixed with pretty mainstream liberal beliefs on average, but they are large enough there is a great deal of variation from the average.

The Something Awful forums both started and first popularized the Let's Play phenomenon, where people watch others play videogames through videos or screenshots. The Talos Principle Let's Play thread I referred to above is [[http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3696744&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=1][here]] but may be paywalled (they switch the paywall on and off sometimes) and the Talos Principle Let's Play videos themselves are hosted on Youtube [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9796Fr0Sd2onLOYqW7O7w][here]]. On Saturday there was some mention/discussion of PKD and this specific essay.
