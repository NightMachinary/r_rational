** Wait, did she cut her ear off?

Damn.

It might not be major character death, but self-mutilation to achieve a goal is still alright.

** Honestly we had all the information to think the plan was possible. Just that we were not given a clue into the kids plans.

** Didn't someone suggest them cutting their ears off to fool the transmitters early in the story before Ray showed the device to shut down the transmitters?

Brilliant fake-out, although I sort of consider it cheating to draw Ray being on fire in the last chapter.

*** I agree that it definitely felt like cheating to me as well. Every time I think a piece of media is going to man up and actually follow through with its supposed stakes, it doesn't. Ugh.

Not that I wanted Ray immolated. I just hate these stupid sort of fakeouts. They're so trite.

"Oh, the MC went over the cliff edge in his car while handcuffed inside the trunk. The car was never found but he's totally dead."

Yea, sure he is....

**** I would normally object, but they get a pass after killing Norman. Assuming they genuinely did so, of course, which isn't /quite/ certain. I wouldn't be surprised if he was, though, seeing as his death was actually a meaningful motivator for everybody, rather than just an additional, slightly unnecessary, point to an already excellent plan.

***** I'm so skeptical about them actually having killed Norman. I hoped they did (again, not cuz I hate Norman) but just so they can avoid being cliche.

*** After this catastrophe, I wonder if whoever's in charge of the tracking implants will start putting them in a part of the body that can't be easily hacked off. I bet they never anticipated that little children would go so far as cutting off their own ears.

*** Going back to inspect the last page, I don't see him being on fire. There's the match dropping, Emma jumping after it, and then there's just fire, of no specific shape or form.

**** If you look at the page again, you can vaguely see a shadow in the center of the explosion which looks like a human-shaped blob to me. I agree that it wasn't so clear cut though.

** So... fakeout self-immolation.

Mama seemed to recognize the burning human flesh smell tho. Wonder where she 1st smelled it. (I hear it smells like pork roast)

Also, how did they fake the burning flesh smell?

*** I can believe Mama wouldn't know the difference in volumes of human flesh being burnt. That's a very specific thing to be aware of.

Also I should've known they wouldn't kill off Ray. The last panel of last week's wasn't entirely conclusive so I should've known.

*** The ear also smells, less intensely, but Mama would be stressed and not know the adequate level of strength of burning flesh smell, or not consider it now.

*** Maybe the box that those kids brought has some meat in it? Burning human flesh shouldn't smell all that different from a hunk of beef or pork.

** Hmm, still no explicit mention of William Minerva's pen. We got another panel of it in the last page or so, but no further information on what it actually does. Re-usable transmitter disabler, maybe?
