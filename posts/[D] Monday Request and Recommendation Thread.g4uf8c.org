Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** So I'm playing with the rough draft of a rational take on the Judeo-Christian Heaven / Hell / Earth conflict. Urban Fantasy for the most part, with some of the Cthulhu mythos thrown in to create an external threat to the classical conflict.

Has anyone seen something similar in the Rational Realm? Not necessarily Urban Fantasy or the like, but a rational stab at the Heaven / Hell conflict? I'd like to compare what I've got to others and see if anything pops up that would bug me down the road.

*** /Unsong/ is largely about the Judeo-Christian Heaven / Hell / Earth conflict, in its own meandering way, and includes [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][probably the best answer to theodicy I've ever read]].

The /Dresden Files/ is urban fantasy, a fun read, and has that conflict as a subplot in some books. Not super rational though, and that part of the setting in particular is largely shrouded in mystery (i.e. bullshit).

/Good Omens/ is also urban fantasy and fun. The setting is played as comedy though, and not even munchkined comedy like Discworld.

**** Good Omens is in the weird category of almost absurdist comedy, it's hilarious but uses that humor to make some very good points about things. I personally like it, goes down the same kinda vein as Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

Not rational, but still a good read.

***** The author can't seem to write anything involving risk or tension. The war is a curbstomp in humanity's favor from the beginning. Their enemies use outdated information, are extremely slow to adapt when they adapt at all, and have glaring weaknesses that seem to exist only to make the foes even less of a threat than they otherwise would be.

Their poor decision is usually consistent and well-explained enough not to fall fully under the 'idiot ball' trope, but that doesn't help to add any tension.

On top of that, a lot of it drags on and many people's reactions feel pretty darn unrealistic.

*** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25442/doing-gods-work][Doing God's Work]] has /similar/ themes.

Basically, the Judeochristian God won out against the other cults. Instead of eradicating them, he set them to work in his global corporation, Providence, where most of them are helpdesk staff, fulfilling prayers.

The work follows female Loki, who had most of her powers sealed away, and is plotting to get them back again.

The twist is that Providence is a despotical corporate hellhole, with office politicks, backstabbing, and tyrannical management that doesn't actually care about humanity in the slightest. It's a pretty neat take on corporate culture, as well.

** So I've been reading a number of Royal Road fictions from the best rated / trending list. When I tried this out a year or two ago Everyone Likes Big Chests was the highest rated work, which really made me doubt the quality of their rating system. Fortunately things have improved. Here's a very basic rating / random comments.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30131/seaborn][Seaborn]] Good stuff. Initially the litrpg aspect seemed too heavy handed, but gets a lot better. Nice theme / niche. Quite well written. Short. Definitely read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30737/the-humble-life-of-a-skill-trainer][Humble Life of a Skill Trainer]] Good start. Interesting premise, and good execution. Short. Read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26317/queen-in-the-mud][Queen in the Mud]] Surprisingly good. Short. MC is lucky in everything, but its not grating. Read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30029/summoners-journey][Summoners Journey]] Decent. Readable, and okay execution. Short, kinda cliche. Read it if it sounds interesting to you.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30623/cant-cure-deceit][Can't Cure Deceit]] Premise is a bit red flag, but pretty good page turner so far. Worth reading it if it sounds interesting to you.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]] Not exactly rational, but has some munchkinry (only from the main character). Popcorn fic. Read it if it doesn't annoy you.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] Decent writing. Funny. Cliche premise with enough new to make it refreshing. Read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights with Monsters]] Enjoyable. Long. Cliche premise, but decently thought through. Pretty good use of abilities. Worth reading if it catches your attention.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26581/rebirth-in-a-magical-world][Rebirth in a Magical World]] Harry potter fanfic, but does a good job of keeping canon stuff present but to the side. Has its own existence and characters. Worth reading.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red][A Journey of Black and Red]] Surprisingly good. Long. Worth reading.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30400/unto-the-breach][Unto the Breach]] Kinda cringy. Seems better than the description would indicate. Short. Hard to tell if this is worth reading yet.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29729/jumpspark][Jumpspark]] Decent original planes-walker imitation. Lucky / super high potential MC, but seems pretty grounded in having real threats, and reasonably growth rate. Gets Gengis Khan as a mentor, and he's pretty chill.

*** I have done similar, getting through a good chunk of the top 25. ELLC is still one of the best though, unless you really dislike the sexual stuff I'm not sure why that would put you off. Since you and lo4952 have already reviewed a bunch, I'll just review what isn't on either list or already well discussed here.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur the Dragon]] A comedy lit-rpg in which a dragon learns of levels and becomes an adventurer. Comedy is pretty broad, hit and miss but not too bad, a light and entertaining read in general.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][Re:Trailer Trash]] An unhappy middle aged woman in 2045 is sent back to when she was 13 in 1998, and so tries to turn around her life. From there it's just a generic high school drama. Tbh I have no idea why this is so highly rated, it's fine but that's it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935/there-is-no-epic-loot-here-only-puns][There is no epic loot here, only puns]] An isekai in which a girl becomes a dungeon core. Since she dislikes violence, she instead tries to create a happy tourism dungeon. A silly, comedy story, very 'wholesome' in the sickly sweet wholesomemes style, the only interesting aspect is the world building outside of the dungeon.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21374/epilogue][Epilogue]] A short story about a group of teens who are sent back to earth many years after being isekai'd. Pretty solid and won't take too long.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale][The iron's teeth a goblins tale]] A monster POV story in which a goblin is rescued by a bandit ranger and taught his ways. Excruciatingly slow at first, but it starts to pay off around 50% of the way in. Unfortunately, the author has stopped the story, though the stopping point is fairly natural.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template]] A xianxia parody, guys gets isekai'd but realises he's not a main character, but the titular master destined to be swept aside. He thus begins desperate attempts to avert his fate and stay alive. By far the best comedy on RR, even if you're unfamiliar with xianxia, though the author has disappeared recently. Be aware also that the grammar is quite poor and it can be confusing to read.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]] A regular xianxia, which I understand is a rewrite of a completed quest. It's decent enough.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare][Threadbare]] Litrpg in which a teddy bear gains the golem class and fights to defend his owner. Mercifully short, neat world and generally well done.

Divination, in particular, stood out to me: it works by querying a sort of collective consciousness of everyone in the area, so it only collects what people already know, and only gives you a decent signal if a lot of people know what you're looking for. [35k dead]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28356/carlfire][carl@fire]] A satire of royal road stories, but a coherent world nonetheless. It really goes the full mile with some of the themes, so there's a lot of disturbing content as well. [250k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27875/lament-of-the-determined][Lament of the Determined]] A crackfic, also a satire of stories on royal road, but no attempt at coherence was made. Much shorter and crunchier. Very crude humor. [10k ongoing]

*** One RR fic that doesn't get posted here enough IMO is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24396/digital-marine][Digital Marine]]

The setting is pretty great from a rational deconstruction standpoint. If we had a perfectly physically accurate MMO with time compression, nobody would waste it on consumers playing around with swords; it'd get immediately turned in to the world's greatest military boot camp. There's also no magical skill injections here - if you buy Advanced Hacking, you go through the coursework for a Master's in Computer Science in time compression.

The main character is relatively rational too - she makes informed decisions about her "build", and is exceptional but not too overpowered. The things she comes up with or invents as part of her career are all fairly reasonable in the scheme of things; there's no "oh you're somehow the first person to treat NPCs like people!" nonsense here.

*** Thanks for the recommendations, always interested in picking up good RR series. I've got a few as well that Ive found interwsting enough to keep reading, in no particular order:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] A multi-pov dungeon core story, focusing on a sentient, relatively peaceful dungeon core named Blue. The story focuses much less on hard power, with Blue having near omniscience and omnipotence within his domain. Instead the story has a nice look at what kinds of indirect threats could be posed, usually through interactions with well-developed supporting characters and Blue. If you're looking for an xp-grinding litRPG this might not be for you, but otherwise I'd highly recommend it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer][Azarinth Healer]] This one pops up a lot, so I won't say too much about it. The writing in the first handful of chapters put me off for a few months till I gave it another shot, and since then I've enjoyed it a lot. The story tries to avoid politics and big save-the-world plots (sometimes more successfully than others) and focuses on a girl and her simple goal of trying to punch everything to death.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall][Defiance of the Fall]] Another relatively popular one, an interesting blend of western and eastern setting. The premise is roughly the modern world getting shoved into a Wuxia cultivation multiverse, and the changes that accompany it. Another solid read, would recommend checkin it out.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] Sadly not updated nearly enough, this one is a great story about a "The Thing"-esque lab experiment escaping into the public. The setting reminds me of a more upbeat "Worm" universe, with public heroes and villains, unspoken cooperarion, and fun superpowers. Highly recommend, just be prepared to reach the end and despair at the upload schedule.

**** I'm surprised no one mentions that *Blue Core* is seriously pornographic, and that the sex stuff is absolutely central to its theme, in that it's pretty clear that the plot is tangential to the lovingly described hardcore sex stuff, rather than the other way around.

The entire setting is actually built around it being desirable to get fucked by the protagonist, to the point where he heals their actual soul with his black jizz (I wish I was kidding). In typical fashion, all the interesting and explored POV characters are females, and you guessed it: either have been fucked, will be fucked, or want desperately to be fucked by the dungeon core. Which will then be described in lurid detail, let me tell you.

It's not even that weird as webnovels go, but I do find it strange that everyone recommending it neglect to mention its... raison d'etre, if you will.

Feel free to google around if you want more thoughts regarding this topic. I think there was a significant revival of the debate when Game of Thrones started airing and a bunch of "thinkers", philosophers, historians and sociologists weighed in so it would be a good place to start.

  The fact of the matter is that modern Western society is significantly influenced by conservative Christian themes and as such, society is more comfortable with violence than sex.
#+end_quote

Then wouldn't that explain your concerns? That a community focused on rationality wouldn't adhere or let itself be influenced by cultural standards they don't necessarily agree with?

I've noticed the same thing happening with Time Braid, which is a much older rational-adjacent naturo fanfic that also features sex, yet most recommendations don't mention the sex in it either. Worth the Candle is popular too and yet no one mentions the rape.

I don't think this is the kind of community that purposely leaves those kind of things out because of shame, political bias, or any kind of malice.

Maybe letting NSFW be dictated by lines on the sand isn't rational, and thus not followed. Or perhaps the demographic that frequents this sub happens to be one that is not bothered by sexual elements in fiction. Maybe the rational/rationalist component is recommendation enough and so other elements (like sex, drug use or violence) aren't worth nothing.

Sorry if this is uncomfortable to discuss, I too am curious about what is happening and want to actually understand without jumping to conclusions.

Regardless of your personal views, you are far more likely to get into trouble at work and jeopardise your social standing by looking at pornographic material in a public setting or at work than you are to be reading about violence.

Language is about communicating clearly. If someone says "SFW", it will likely be understood to mean something like "might have violence, probably not super detailed, doesn't have explicit sex".

It's certainly reasonable to debate which topics are worth warning about and whether our current expectations are reasonable in that way, but just using a word the way you think it should be used rather than the way everyone uses it isn't going to convince anyone of anything, it's just going to cause your attempted communication to fail.

******* I believe it's a matter of detail and how in depth stories go into those parts and if you should expect that going into it. You don't need sex or violence warnings for "They kissed then headed back to the bed room" or "He held a hand over a red stain on his shirt" since these aren't unusually detailed compared to the majority of media. Violence can even get up to people dying, but with a lack of focus or detail it's not particularly disturbing. The same goes for sex scenes and romance, the level of detail and focus determines if the story warrants warning.

You can make a cultural argument about where we should draw these lines but that's very messy. Most people can agree when stories should have warnings, be it in depth descriptions of orgasms or realistic depictions of violence.

I don't have a issue with sex scenes in general, just some of Blue Core's and I think that's important information to add to a recommendation of it. Not mentioning it at all is a absolute negative in my opinion, it's a notably different part of the story compared to other dungeon core stories unless I'm mistaken.

Why do you think people don't mention it? I really want to understand this because as I said in the other comment it also happens with Time Braid and to a lesser extent with WtC (among other fics, probably), but it's not like this sub has some sort of bias or prejudice against nsfw fics (e.g. Erogamer gets recommended all of the time)

Again, sorry if this should be obvious, I'm not from the US so these kind of cultural differences tend to fly over my head a bit. I'm not even sure if this is an issue that is at a society level or some quirk specific of this sub.

********* I think in general it's a selection bias: the people that recommend those stories tend to overlook those parts of it as opposed to people who don't like the stories in part because of those parts seeing more of the themes that lead into them. I don't think anyone is being deceptive on purpose, they just don't realize how important those parts might be to others.

Blue Core fans might see it as just 1/15ish of the story limited to certain chapters while people who don't like that focus more on the theme of it throughout the story and those parts in particular.

Time Braid is more of a reframing issue I think. You can totally read it and think "yeah there's some sex in it but there's a lot more torture, and that's just part of it" until someone reminds you how young the characters are and other issues. Also a lot of people read it when they are younger, it was their first time loop etc.

WtC selection bias probably, I haven't paid too much attention to recs of it since I kind of assume everyone here is reading it. I'm probably a bit blind to it because I think it's so great, and the writing is top quality.

Erogamer is what it says it is and gets NSFW mentioned when I see it?

Then there's the fact that for some people that kind of thing is nsfw and worth mentioning, while for others not so much.

I'm not from the US, so I tend to notice these kind of things. My country tends to look down upon violence because of the amount of insecurity out in the streets, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPN9DPryZZU][meanwhile some would consider our TV shows to be pretty much softcore porn]] and our magazines and newspapers aren't much better in that regard. But we're also a 'modern western society influenced by conservative christian themes' I mean, the actual pope is from our country, and yet we're not as prudish as the US seems to be.

Rape, murder, gore, body horror, that kind of stuff stands out to us, but no one bats an eye to consensual fucking and other displays of affection. So (like that other redditor said) what is and isn't worth warning doesn't always match with what is written.

***** You're absolutely right in that there is a decent sexual theme to the series, with both the more carnal red dungeons and Blue's contrasting softer(?) NSFW scenes. However I think it's doing the other characters a disservice to say they only exist to bang the dungeon, considering that they are all well developed characters in their own right. Plus the NSFW scenes are like, 4 chapters total. While its certainly an aspect of their characters, it's not like the characters that bang the dungeon exist solely to bang the dungeon.

I read about half what's there right now, so 150k words. If my memory serves, there's only 1 or 2 brief male POVs besides Blue, which are snippets purely for exposition. The only females that have non-snippet POVs are: the queen(has been), the fox girl(has been), the lesbian couple(will be, i'm sure), and the dragon lady(desperately wants to be).

It's good writing to only expand on characters that will come to feature in the plot([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail][conservation of detail tvtropes]]), so no complaints there. What's not good writing--IMHO, obviously-- is when all the well characterized females in a story are attractive and willing to join the protagonist's harem.

And to be clear, I would object to this even if there was no graphic carrot top sex prominently featuring black jizz.

I think there's maybe three rational romances I've seen posted here. The thing is, to write a romance you can't just make it rational, it also has to invest you emotionally. So it has to be a good work of fiction first, but the characters are also smart and just happen to love each other. (Also the story is probably really witty and has things to say about society, but it's not a requirement.)

Anyways, here's one that I think might be worth a shot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18738010/chapters/44446768][Marriage and Monsters: An Eschatological Romance]]. I haven't read it though so can't rec it based on how good it is, but it seems to check the boxes.

Also, like, anything by Jane Austen. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice][Pride and Prejudice]] comes to mind.

*** As far as rational-ish stories with somewhat mature romance goes:

Trails in the Sky (video game) is one of the best told games I've had the pleasure of playing. Innocent, athletic/boisterous and social female main, and a pragmatic, kind, and yet sometimes uncomfortably cold male companion. Something of a jRPG blend of fantasy and steampunk-ish. Superb ending (though a cliffhanger) of the first game, haven't played the other two. The tension of the relationship is mainly around said open innocence and hidden coldness.

I'll recommend Looseboy's two great erotic visual novels with the caveats that they could use an editor and you should prepare for the quirks of Japanese ero-games:

The Devil on G-String's third route in particular (Shiratori Mizuha) is good enough that its worth playing the game just for it. Its a combination of intellectual thriller and surprisingly mature romance of two people trying to find a second chance, the romance more so at the very last part of her route, the good end (you have to specifically go there or you'll miss it). The interesting aspects of this romance itself were fairly short, however, though I think its well worth it given the quality of its writing and the fact that it is a satisfying conclusion to the thriller aspect of the route. The game is set between a cat-and-mouse battle of the main heroine and the enigmatic criminal who calls himself the Devil/Maou based on the classical Der Erlkönig, the protagonist being an amoral student with Yakuza ties who becomes a suspect for Maou's identity. (Also Maou is voiced by Lelouch's voice actor.)

Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo (translation: The Wheel Country and the Girl of the Sunflowers?), Looseboy's other minor masterpiece (earlier and probably the better story overall), is much less mature on the romance front (too anime-ish at times), but it does indeed center around the criminal (by dystopian standards) girls and the Special High Class Individual Candidate protagonist in charge of their supervision. Morita Kenichi, the protagonist, is simply cool- friendly, tough, intelligent and with wide experience. The antagonist Houzuki, Kenichi's SHCI mentor, is a pedagogically minded economist/politician who is also a charismatic and violent authoritarian.

** I have a lot of time to listen to audiobooks, and am constantly running out of them.

The good news is that I found one in podcast form. Apparently it started out as a reddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7asz8x/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part_1/][thread]]? It's called the [[https://www.podcastrepublic.net/podcast/1498806952][Left Right Game]], and despite the stupid title, the story so far isn't bad. It isn't rational, but I wasn't expecting it to be.

They are currently on episode 5, and update religiously once a week. Each chapter is about 30-40 minutes long. (Meanwhile [[https://www.podcastrepublic.net/podcast/1448857756][Pact]] updates sporadically, kind of near once a month-ish).

Really the best part of it is the sound quality. The sounds are realistic and you /will/ occasional turn your head to see if that skidding car sound was real. I think it's even edited for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_audio_effect][3d audio]]. That's to be expected (they are recording these in hopes of selling you high-quality speakers), but if you ignore the ads, it can be pretty good.

Also, as I write this comment, I learn that they have [[https://player.fm/podcasts/QCODE][more]] of these, which I will probably be checking out.

Also also, there's a sub for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/top/][these things]]?

Conclusion, I should write more reddit comments because it forces me to research things.

*** Hey, I had a phase where I listened to a bunch of audio dramas. It's an interesting way to consume media no doubt. Here's a few I remember being good.

- [[https://www.wolf359.fm/][Wolf 359]] does a good job of starting as a comedy and slowly turning serious. The main character has a wonderful voice and is fun to listen to.

- [[https://www.wolf359.fm/][We're Alive]] is a completed zombie apocalypse drama. I never got too far into it but it has good production value and starts off in a somewhat cliche but still enjoyable way.

- [[https://theblacktapespodcast.com/][The Black Tapes]] is a horror drama with a somewhat cliche plot, but the production value is high and execution is good.

Other than that I also listened to Edict Zero FIS (which is a scifi crime drama), Welcome to the Night Vale, and Tanis, which are all good but weren't things that hooked me straight from the get go. I'm sure there are many more dramas now, maybe I should get back into it.

If it was common knowledge among some secret subset of wizards, why hasn't it been used more often? Why isn't the world ruled by an immortal wizard-king?

You can justify all this, but I almost feel like it would be better to just say 'a miracle did it'. The actual mechanism of time travel isn't central to the story (it's a story based on a the rewind premise, but presumably it will never come up again- there'll be no time war, and the characters aren't ambitious enough to exploit time travel properly) so the same story setup could have been achieved without all the annoyance by just having some random unexplained event/accident do it.\\
It wouldn't be satisfying, but it would be less aggravating. As it is, the characters could and should ascend to godhood with the tools available to them, but they won't because that's not what the story's about. Poor writing, most of all because it's so easily fixable. Just have the time travel be a magic space bats event outside of character control.

The entire plotline this season was about political intrigue, and how different people respond to a difficult situation. It was funny, intelligent, and packed with a ton of great character moments. Also like...logical plot points that influence how the characters act and are internally consistent. :D I'm fangirling so hard.

I'm not gonna lie, RWBY has irritated me in the past with some of their irrational plot points and characters doing dumb crap for no reason. But if you dropped RWBY because of it, this might be the season to pick it back up. I don't know if they added a writer or what, but they definitely took it up a notch. I actually had to stop and rewind a few times because the characters were analyzing so fast I missed something, and I NEVER have to do that with this show, so...

For anyone getting into it, the Rule of Cool and not Rationality is the primary rule of the universe. Looking back on it though, I would have to agree with the sentiment, but more along the lines of the show becoming more Rational. It starts off very much not.

I wouldn't give it the Rational label quite yet, it's getting there but only for low stakes scenarios. 'Hero' characters for the most part are still operating on Saturday Morning Cartoon morals, with most villains suffering Disney deaths if at all.

Considering the mythos setup and the cliff hanger / last episode of the latest season though I suppose it is becoming more rational.

Even if the story's good and has potential, it's really hard for me to turn the critiquing part of my brain off. Does anyone have any suggestions for a rational fiction that is a well written, professional quality story? A few things I'm looking for:

1) Satisfying narrative arc (follows three act structure)

2) Realistic, well written characters

3) Decently paced (don't want to read chapters and chapters of them just talking, unless it's really, really well written)

4) Focus is on story and characters first, rationality/other themes second

5) Completed and/or regularly posted fic

*** You might be better off looking at published work, since a lot of those will have far more effort put into editing and polish, which a lot of webnovels lack due to their weekly updates. I can give a bunch of recs if you want them.

Other than that, the few webnovels I see that fulfill your requirements are these:

- Zombie Knight Saga: Fulfills all of them. Really satisfying power system to boot. My only gripe is that some characters seem sorta cartoonishly evil/sociopathic, which clashes with the serious nature of the story. But it's easily forgivable with how good everything else is.

- He Who Fights With Monsters, Delve, Ar'Kendrythist. Also fulfills all of them. Of these I like Ar'Kendrithyst the most due to its characters. You'll see the first two recommended a lot in this subreddit. I've also recommended Ar'Kendrithyst [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fw0ar9/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fmm5n0a/][here]].

- Coeur'Al'Aran is a prolific rwby fanfic writer who has really consistent weekly updates. The majority of his work has Jaune as a protagonist, although he's done one or two with other characters as well. Tbh, it reads a bit like shounen manga, although his work in Forged Destiny and Relic of the Future is good. Just take a look at his completed work.

*** I'd never recommend Wildbow's stuff to someone looking for books with something approximating a three-act structure. It's a sprawling webserial with arcs that sometimes span multiple books' worth of content.

--------------

Tentatively, I'd recommend the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Alexandra Quick]] series. It's Harry Potter fanfic, set in Wizarding America of the 2000s, and follows Alexandra who grew up with muggles being brought into the wizarding world, and discovering there are people who want to kill her because of who her real father was.

It /sounds/ really similar to canon Harry Potter, and the first book sort of is, but after that it takes a /really/ interesting direction and explores not just the many cultures that make up Magical America, but also sides of magic that aren't shown in HP.

It has a large cast of characters from all backgrounds, and it doesn't shy away from some of the more... unfortunate parallels between house elves and slavery, for example.

Alexandra herself can drive a reader to frustration; she's so fucking /bright/ but sometimes makes the most muleheaded mistakes. What's important, the world around her /acknowledges/ this; when she does something bad, it drives people away from her, strains friendships, or gets her punished academically.

Technical writing is better than most fanfics and original webserials, but I'm not the best at judging the quality of writing beyond SPAG and prose. I can say that I was rarely bored or exhausted by its pacing.

There's five books so far, ranging from 160k to 250k words. Each of those books has complete plot and character development arcs, as well as driving forward the overall conflict in the magical world.\\
Quite frankly, if the author hadn't started this as a Harry Potter fanfic, there aren't many alterations he'd have had to make to publish it as an original work.

I suppose it's... sort of rational adjacent(?) in a 'crack scenario treated seriously' way. Like many of the author's fics, the story's strength lies in its portrayal of the inner lives of characters experiencing existential horror. It touches on some of the same philosophical topics as "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", because those are themes that the author likes to explore in most of her stories.

The fic is unfinished and the current chapter ends on a rather awkward note, but I enjoyed it enough that I'd still recommend giving it a try. But then, I'm a huge fan of the author's works and would recommend reading almost all of them regardless of completion status.

Those are all still grounded in the recognisable, though.

This segment from one of the latest chapters (minimal spoilers, only setting stuff) is pretty much the best fit for what I think you're looking for:

#+begin_quote
  /The abyss between the spheres of reality is endless and dark, a place of horrible hungry things that hunt forever in pitch blackness, of predator and prey hiding and slinking, of silent filter-feeding giants and the echoes of alien thought carried on the currents. Small darting mouths of bottomless starvation, formless crab-hounds that seep through the angles of time, hunters of morsels of stray unwise thought and sensation across the gaps in creation, all of them catching my scent in the water and turning to stalk. Fleeing wisps, lost on the tides, desperate for the warmth and sanctuary of physical form, clutching at my ankles and moaning for help. Things vast and slow, thinking vast slow thoughts in trailing tendrils to entrap the unwary, eating, eating, always eating, growing bigger and thinking harder and trying to make themselves real./
#+end_quote

The prose is not normally this... abstract and flowery, but usually really good compared to most of the stuff that usually gets recommended around here.

Elevator pitch: Girl who always believed the monsters she sees because of her psychosis finds out they're actually real - for a certain value of "real" - and is drawn into a parallel world of cults and magic and zombies.

  Too little mathematics has been written in prose. Thus we prove here, via a fantasy novellette, that a locally L-bilipschitz mapping f:X→Y between uniformly Ahlfors q-regular, complete and locally compact path-metric spaces X and Y is an L-bilipschitz map when Y is simply connected. The motivation for such a result arises from studying the asymptotic values of BLD-mappings with an empty branch set; see e.g. [L17]. As far as the author is aware, the result is new, even though it would not be hard for specialists in the field to prove. The proof is essentially a modest extension of the ideas in [L17] in a more general setting when the branch set is empty.
