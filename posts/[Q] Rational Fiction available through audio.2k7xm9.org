Besides Worm and HPMOR, anything good out there? Any rational fiction will do.


** Ted Chiang's short story Exhalation has been mentioned on this sub before. [[http://escapepod.org/2009/04/10/ep194-exhalation/][Here is a good reading of it on EscapePod.]] Also Patrick McClean's How to Succeed in Evil is [[http://podiobooks.com/title/how-to-succeed-in-evil-the-novel/][freely available as a podiobook.]] Strangely though, rational nonfiction seems more easily available in audio form than rational fiction.

*** Any way to listen to How to Succeed in Evil in more than 8 minute snippets? It really breaks my groove of trying to fall asleep while listening.

**** Click the chapter names to download mp3 files of the chapters. If you want the bookend bits removed, you'll need to download something like audacity. It has a decent bulk command chain to let you trim x seconds from the start and end of each file.

** I'd be happy to work with someone on making some, if any one is interested. I do audio recording and editing and would love this type of project.
