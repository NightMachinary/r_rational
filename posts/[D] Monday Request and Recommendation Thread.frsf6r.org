Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

*** *Top Picks - Standalone*:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] (*Harry Potter*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Long*}: Voldemort is reborn as Harry Potter, and this time he can finally satisfy his hearts desire, becoming a Hogwarts Professor. One of, if not the best comedy fanfic I've ever read.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]] (*Harry Potter*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: In the late 1930s an orphaned Voldemort and a young Hermoine Granger meet for the first time, and the course of wizarding history is radically changed. A great what-if, exploring what would happen if one of the greatest magical talents met one of the greatest magical minds. Each character is very believable and their intelligence is realistically depicted imo. (Note while there is a slow burn romance it does not overshadow the plot, and is handled tastefully. It's only really relevant and after the two have known each other for much longer)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]] (*Harry Potter*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Long*}: What happens when a someone exceedingly familiar with HP and Evil Overlord tropes, ends up reborn as a voice in a young Tom Riddle's head? A great vehicle for exploring just how much further Tom could have gone with a guiding hand and some timely foreknowledge.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12539731/1/Kaleidoscope][Kaleidoscope]] (*Naruto*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Long*}: An SI ends up reborn as an Uchiha. One of the best explorations of how easily one might be twisted by being raised as a magical child soldier with the foreknowledge of just how badly things are likely to go for you. Dark but not grimdark. Note: This fic is composed of three volumes. While I loved all three, I'm only recommend the first here.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize][Sanitize]] (*Naruto*) [*IN PROGRESS*] {*Medium*}: A medical student is reborn into the Warring Clans Era as a civilian and their innovations are capable of revolutionsing the Ninja Medical World. This is a smaller scale fic than my other recommendations but I think the message is powerful and the subject matter handled beautifully.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][Fargo]] (*Puella Magi Madoka Magica*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Very Long*}: An American magical girl gets involved in what seems to be a Kyuubey plot. One of my favorite Madoka fics for the the way it explores the lives and neuroses of magical girls. I'm a big fan of the world it paints, it's complex carefully designed plot and it's loveable unlikeable characters. Also has a sequel I highly recommend.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] (*Puella Magi Madoka Magica*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: A phenomenal exploration of the possible sociocultural development of magical girls and their impact on culture and tech the world at large in the far future. I would recommend this one for the sheer scale of the worldbuilding alone. I need to point out however, that this is a serial with a capital S. It takes full advantage of the freedoms of longform fiction and does not mind taking it's time to establish world and character. It has multiple plotlines running simultaneously and gives each detailed focus.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-othersiders-worm-au-altpower-undersiders.362090/][The Othersiders]] (*Worm*) [*COMPLETE/ABANDONED*] {*Long*}: Taylor and the (AU) Undersiders have different power sets and their tactics have a much heavier emphasis on misdirection. One thing I really enjoyed about Worm was it's focus on image and leveraging expectations. This fic is all about using facades intelligently.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7197056/1/Three-Families][Three Families]] (*Avatar*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: Three Families have a vested interest in the avatar, we follow their stories. Two of the families are cannon, one is OC and really helps illustrate the care the author has put into expanding the Avatar universe. The writing is great, the plot is great, I heavily recommend.

​

*Top Picks - Crossovers:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10820443/1/An-Imago-of-Rust-and-Crimson][An Imago of Rust and Crimson]] (*Worm x World of Darkness*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Long*}: My favorite worm fic by far. Taylor triggers with a particularly spooky ability that comes with some psychological baggage, no stations of canon here. A great AU that effectively merges the grimdark traditional rpg setting World of Darkness and the Worm universe.
- [[https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29][Maybe I'm a Lion]] (*Tsukihime x Prototype*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: One of my favorite fics. What happens when grimdark magic meets a superpowered bioweapon? A long and slow crossover with excellent integration, great writing and wonderful hype buildup. A basic understanding about both settings is highly recommended.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8642442/1/Variant-Strain][Variant Strain]] (*Spiderman x Prototype*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Very Long*}: Another interesting prototype cross. Our friendly neighbourhood spiderman gets a totally new origin story courtesy of our favorite bioweapon. Yet another masterful mix of two worlds. Old foes in new forms and some delicious worldbuilding. The writing, plotting and pacing of this are all excellent and it's even completed!
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1099236/chapters/2211681][In the Shadow of Gods]] (*Mass Effect x Halo*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Medium*}: Master Chief meets Shepherd. First contact done well. Short but worth it alone for the interactions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon][Man off the Moon]] (*Mass Effect x Fate/Stay*) [*IN PROGRESS*] {*Very Very Long*}: Shirou ends up in the Mass Effect universe and goes through Space Boot Camp™ with a young Shepherd. A great look into how our favorite Magus would fare in a world of biotics and futuristic tech. A *V*ery *L*ong *R*ead with suprisingly consistent quality.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements][Postnuptial Disagreements]] (*Sekirei x Fate/Stay*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Medium*}: A stuffy magus finds himself in an anime style harem battle royale "death" game. No harem here though. The real focus is on how a magus, brought up on stories of a much more ruthless battle royale death game, handles this one. Standard tropes are played with in fun ways thanks to the natural predisposition of our sheltered haughty magi protagonist. A standard crossover with excellent characterisation and praiseworthy writing.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275548/1/Mirror-Mirror][Mirror Mirror]] (*Avengers x Harry Potter*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Medium*}: Shield wants the magic man. A great look into how a (semi-)professional superhero outfit with varying skillsets would match up against a standard "Master of Death"!Harry. Has a tight focus on the first contact interactions between Shield members themselves and with a skilled Harry Potter.

**** I've read a few of these because, you know, /world events/, and here's my thoughts, vaguely in recommendation order:

- Seventh Horcrux: a really great time. Very quotable, even. It's a comedy crackfic of the highest caliber - it gives both itself and its source material exactly as much respect as they deserve, which is sometimes quite a lot (and is sometimes not any at all)
- Sanitize: honestly this doesn't even need to be a Naruto fanfic. It's just so good. Would probably be at the top of the list if it was complete.
- Kaleidoscope: also great, but very edgy in the way you'd expect the internal life of a child soldier to be. Loses some of that edge in parts 2 and 3, but only some; this is the sort of story that gets so dark it brightens back up again.
- Imago of Rust and Crimson: I have to admit I'm not very familiar with the White Wolf settings so I have no idea what's going on with that side of things, but if this was listed as a Worm / Silent Hill crossover I would have 100% believed it. Great so far but I haven't finished yet.
- Postnuptial Disagreements: well written and it's interesting to put a monogamist into the battle harem genre, but I don't feel like the story itself does enough to make me care for the characters. I ended up dropping it at exactly the midpoint; if you're more in to the source materials you might like it more.
- Mirror Mirror: I just couldn't understand this "Master of Death"!Harry. Also, the superhero science was just so very wrong. Gave up after a couple of chapters.

***** I checked out "Mirror Mirror", and I agree with you on how blatantly bad the science is. However, I kept reading to the end because it's actually one of the better HP/Avengers crossovers I've seen. I like that the author highlighted the unique strengths and skillsets of the MC universe characters enough for them to actually give Harry a run for his money. It was refreshing in comparison to the typical OP!Harry steamroll plotline.

That's kinda what I meant - I'm not super familiar with either fandom, and the story on its own did a poor job of getting me to care about any of the characters (unlike, say, Kaleidoscope). I think it'd be a better story for someone who brings in some of those emotional attachments.

*** Depends what you are into my friend! One i have really enjoyed recently is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]], which is a HP fanfic but also... not really? It's not really rational, or rational adjacent, but it is a very good read. Its premise is about an american girl in the HP universe taking place about 2012 or so and the world building of what constitutes the american magical community is awesome. Very much popcorn reading, but very enjoyable. Sadly, I feel like its a dead fic, but! Not to worry too much because the person writing it didn't do it chapter by chapter but by books with 4 written right now (each about 170 tho words, and each doing the classic harry potter thing of a book per year). Cant recommend enough, thoroughly enjoyed them, and I have more fanfic recs if you are interested

**** I wouldn't call AQ "popcorn reading", for me that denotes a story where the author writes what they find funny in the moment. AQ was written more like a traditional book, the author wrote the entire story before publishing it chapter by chapter. That means stuff like foreshadowing, pacing, character development are handled /much/ more competently than in basically any other fanfics.

  If you were to ask me whether I liked dogs, I would probably have to say that I didn't. I wouldn't particularly say that I disliked them, either; they were just a category of animal that I had never held any special affection for. Before you say that dogs are amazing because they provide unlimited amounts of love and affection, I acknowledge that this is the case. However, since I already have a little sister, owning a dog would be superfluous.

The MC is far too "edgy", he's the only one that knows/acknowledges how fake and evil the world is and he loves to tell that to heroes. No one acts like a real human being. There's also something wrong with the writing in general to me, I think the pacing and scene transitions are off putting to me.

It's not rational fiction by design, but it's got its moments (such as the characters deducing the nature of the in-story counter), and for people who liked /Game By God/ this might scratch that same itch somewhat

*** Here are some recs ordered in decreasing amounts of levity.

[[https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Hyouka][Hyouka]], a LN about the establishment and operation of a detective mystery club set in a high school setting. This is a pretty rational read with some very low stakes and some fun mysteries.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/1/The-Optimised-Wish-Project][The Optimised Wish Project]], a fanfic that does an excellent job of building a rational vision of it's fiction (Dragon Ball). It balances the traditional levity of a Dragon Ball episode with the pursuit of rationalist ideals well.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28307/the-zombie-knight-saga][The Zombie Knight Saga]], my second favorite serial, is about a guy who ends up allied with a grim reaper. I thought the banter between characters was pretty funny. Fair warning though, themes of depression and suicide are explored but I feel like they're handled in a positive way. I think the author did a great job with the setting and abilities. The story is at least rational-adjacent.

[[https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/dungeon-defense-toc/][Dungeon Defense]], my favorite LN, is about a guy who ends up transported to his favorite game on hardcore mode, I really like MC's voice and his strategies and deductions are often rational. The setting is revealed to be suprisingly deep as the volumes unfold. Note: Almost every character's backstory involves a real raw deal but the plot treats them well. Stakes do escalate to a potential total war scenario but the focus is almost always on characters trying to outwit each other. Discontinued after 5 volumes.

** *BEASTARS* is an anime adaptation that is /holy shit/ amazing. Top tier characters, CG animation, directing, everything. Raw exploration of themes about nature vs nurture, racism, and deviance. Haru is Best Character. Watch this show.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/heir-of-the-bruce-battletech-dynasty-quest.334983/][*Bruce Quest*]] is a rather cool Spacebattles quest of the Battletech franchise where you play as Rhiannon The Bruce, Duchess of the planet of Somerset, who has recently inherited the title after the death of her parents when they fight off rogue Ronin from the Draconis Combine. I binged this entire thing over the course of like four days, it gets a lot of quest fundamentals very right. The competence porn I get from watching Rhiannon (and much of the cast) is a big factor, on top of the satisfying progression of Rhi rocketing up the skill ladders of politicking and administration and soldiering and piloting. It doesn't quite reach my highest echelon, and there a few aspects that dim my enjoyment a bit, but it is still quite solid and an easy recommendation.

** Thanks to the Coronavirus, there's a bunch on books on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/frp5dw/its_time_62_authors_144_books_all_at_099099_with/][sale]] right now from March 30th to 31st until 12 am April 1st! Hurry, all of them are for only a dollar each!

Below are books that I recognize here from previous recommendations:

Most important/recognizable to people who are part of the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community are the books by [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2020/03/30/sales-free-books-and-status-updates/][Andrew Rowe]]. [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKBSZGF][Six Sacred Swords]] are only a dollar, [[https://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Broken-Mirrors-Book-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]] is free, and he's writing a quest, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/spider-climb-a-jrpg-style-dungeon-crawl-in-the-arcane-ascension-weapons-and-wielders-universe.63681/][Spider Climb]], which is setting in the Arcane Ascensions universe which is like having another book to read for free. He writes some good dungeon delving/adventuring/magic school shenanigans.

Sarah Lin with [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W9J75R3?tag=][Street Cultivation]] with a novel financial-like take on cultivation, and [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHMHLLP?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf][New Game Minus]] (books 2 and 3 only are on sale) where an NPC mage becomes a PC warrior.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHNQGRX?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf][The Dao of Magic]] (book 1 and 2) by Andrew Louws where an exiled cultivator is sent to a magical world devoid of qi and needs to rebuild his power from the bottom again.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHPLHX5?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf][Mage Errant]] (book 2 and 3) by John Bierce about a small group of student-mages who no one can train are taken in by a mysterious teacher who thinks he can solve their problems.

Also, Bryce O'Conner's books, [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074C9LJT4?searchxofy=true&ref_=dbs_s_aps_series_rwt][Wings of War]], are also on sale, but due to reddit reasons, he isn't allowed to include his own books in the post as the original poster of the sale.

There's plenty more great books by authors that haven't been posted to here before and deserve to be read!

PS If the Coronavirus puts you in the mood for some books about being quarantined or about disease, John Bierce has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/fjmp4z/in_which_i_offer_quarantine_reading_suggestions/][list]] of excellent books that I would second my recommendations for. Just note that unlike the above, this isn't a set of books on sale, just recommendations.

** Recent additions to my in-progress manga collection (not rational) :

- [[https://mangadex.org/title/10049/mozuya-san-gyakujousuru][Mozuya-san goes on a rampage]] A little girl suffers from Joseph Tsundere's bipolar personality disorder. Comedic/Psychological/Dark/SoL. Absolutely gut bustingly hilarious. You will get a LOT of suspicious looks if you try to read this in public though.
- [[https://mangadex.org/title/31792/mieruko-chan][Meizuko-chan]] Meizuko sees horrific spirits; tries to ignore them. Comedy/Drama/Horror/Slice of Life. I was kind of iffy on this one to begin with, but the fantastic art kept me going.
- [[https://mangadex.org/title/17019/kakushigoto][Kakushigoto]] Single father tries to hide his employment as a manga artist from his young daugher (on account of writing a rather infamous manga based around dirty jokes.) Comedy/SoL.

I've been less invested in my usual action/adventure/fantasy/sci-fi manga recently and more into SoL. Either current events have made me long for simpler times, or I'm finally growing up. (Or I'm just burnt out on generic isekais, which doesn't leave me much to read in my traditional genre wheelhouse these days.)

*** The first book in the Children of Time series, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25499718-children-of-time][Children of Time]] is pretty good for this, with a particularly interesting alien biology and culture.

The second book in the series, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40376072-children-of-ruin][Children of Ruin]] blows it out of the park though with both alien biology, culture /and/ psychology. I was both satisfied and fascinated when I fully understood the degree and the complete details of their uniqueness.

Fair warning though, these books take place on planets with earth-analogue lifeforms. Whilst you won't be impressed by their apparent forms, you'll certainly be impressed by the thought and care that that went into their differentiating physiology.

Also, in-case you're spoiler averse, the summary/blurb of the second book spoils the ending of the first book.
