*** It presents an interesting workaround to his curse. If he says to Cat with a grin that he poisoned 'Hakram' last night, is he talking about the orc or the goat?

For all we know, he has a whole barnyard out back labelled 'Dead King', 'Malicia', 'Ashur', and 'Nicae' and the discussion with Cat was a lie from start to finish. I don't actually think that's the case here, but it means we still can't take anything he says even as true, even the literal wording that Fae-speakers would normally be forced to stick to.

**** I wonder whether the judgement is on the literal truth or the intent behind the words.

The exact curse/phrase is:

#+begin_quote
  Through lies and deception you have brought great suffering, and so from you I take that poisonous gift: never again will you speak untruth, lest it be the last words you speak at all.
#+end_quote

By what measure is the untruth judged? Does the Choir of Mercy act as the arbiter and judge?

** So correct me if I'm wrong but the whole of Hakram's game was that winning was infeasble without alliance right? So he's just upfront said that his plans were to be kingmaker right? But also Cat is missing the context in which he's referring to right?

*** Here's the game described: [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/10/03/interlude-giuoco-pianissimo/]]

The key to Hakram's game was that winning is infeasible without /deception/: you can't win if the other players know how close to victory you are, because, if they do, they'll ally to stop you.

I wonder who the third player will be...

**** Wait. This is Tyrants play! The key to Hakram's game being playable was having the points hidden and doing deals under the table. Kairos has been working on deal with everyone for a while, but no one thinks he is a imminent threat, just a common threat. So they give bits and pieces to him in exchange for critical leverage against each other, and the Tyrant keeps accumulating shit.

But do we truly know how far he is, even as readers? What if he is one stone away from winning the whole thing and everyone just thinks he is on half a pile yet?

Jesus I'm dumb.

***** Alternatively, it describes Cat's situation, she's too visibly close to victory, and thus her enemies are willing to ally to bring her down.

I think one of Malicia's corpse-puppets. It's been a long while since she and Cat talked face-to-face, and between the Salian gambit and the upcoming Still Water ritual she's been re-entering the narrative in a big way. With Black, Masego, the Accords, the Dead King, her ongoing plots and plans, and Callow joining the Alliance, they have a lot to talk about.

**** Huh i was wondering why it wasn't it the extra chapters where i was looking. Thanks for the clarification!

I'd put money on it being either the Hierarch or the whoever the Dead King is using as emissary.

*** They're an island to the south of Calernia, about a third the size of Praes. Their society sort of inherited the +Meizan+ Baalite structure, and they have different tiers of citizen with a council of tier 3 being de-facto rulers but a single tier 2 citizen acting as an overriding authority.

They were being beseiged by a fleet from Nicae, one of the League cities, meaning Kairos just back-stabbed his own city state to help two of its enemies.

**** At the Tyrant, Karios is the head of state of Helike, not Nicae. They are only nominally allied right now due.to the existence of a Heirarch. And even calling them allies is perhaps stretching it a bit as (even ignoring Kairos's tendency to betray literally everyone) before Anaraxes's election Kairos was sieging down Nicae as part of the war he was eating against the Good nations of the League (this was where Sabah was killed)
