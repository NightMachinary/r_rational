** One slight quibble - I don't think Brahman would be described as though it were a deity, would likely just be Brahmā? I can verify with a friend later today.

[Edit] Verified with a friend of mine who spent most of their life in India - they said the phrase "Brahman or any other god or supernatural being" didn't really make sense, and would be more likely to have been "Brahmā or any other deity or divine being"; "supernatural being" has implications of ghosts and demons, not positive entities, and the term "deity" is more common than "god".

*** Brahman is a more esoteric concept in Hindu philosophy, akin to a higher reality which humans are supposed to wake up into after enlightenment. It is seldom referred to in day to day speech. Brahma is the anthropomorphic creator in the Hindu pantheon.. Source: Grew up in south India.

**** This was roughly the feedback that I got from my friend who grew up in India as well.

** *Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

** How come Ananya knows there are 100 and the other ones don't? Or maybe their narration was unreliable and they actually did know?

*** Simon and Hannah implied that they know they aren't alone.

Ch. 2: "There may be someone out there with laser eyeballs and bulletproof skin, and what she has is a conversation opener."

Ch. 4: "Unless everyone like him was also in Toronto (he quickly notes the question on paper), purposeful placement suggests that there is more to the problem."
