I had an interesting dream about the Naruto fanfiction "Time Braid". First I need to explain a few bits about the premise. Obviously, the following is a huge spoiler so beware.

In the fic, the protagonist Sakura has several alternative personalities living inside her head. At one point a demonic personality is added who then takes over her body and tries to corrupt the original personalty. This demonic personality is convinced that this (corrupting Sakura) is her mission and that she will be tortured for all eternity should she fail. Problem is that corrupting Sakura turns out to incredibly difficult. There are also angels in this fiction and Sakura is much closer to ascend to angel status than to be corrupted. The demonic personality is pretty much immortal but at one point in the fic, she comments that if Sakura were to become an angel, her own (demonic) mind would be reduced to a vegetable in the process.\\
Reading this, I was thinking "Well that's the solution then, isn't it? A way to kill yourself so you don't have to suffer for all eternity. If you can't corrupt her, then you should put all your efforts into making the original Sakura ascend."\\
When I went to sleep that night I had a fascinating and detailed dream about it. I played the role of demon Sakura and with single minded purpose worked to help Sakura ascend. It was terrifying, because I knew I was doing the exact polar opposite of what I was told to do. If my bosses decided to check in on my progress they would realize that I had betrayed them and send me to hell immediately.\\
Finally, we fulfilled all the necessary requirements and were standing before the gates of heaven, ready to ascend. In the dream I had to go into some kind of room were my mind would be purged. I wasted a few precious seconds to turn to my partner, the other Sakura, and gave her a big hug before I stepped forward. I readied myself to become nonexistent. There was a bright flash and... I was still there. Something had gone wrong.\\
Suddenly and with eerie certainty I realized what had happened. The Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics was correct, the universe splits into all possible next states constantly. In almost all universes I had indeed died but there was a tiny chance that the mind purging would fail. It didn't really matter how small the chance was, it only mattered that it was there. And for the same reason that I was born on a habitable planet, my consciousness ended up in a universe where the process had failed. Despair came over me. Suicide wasn't an option after all and I already had betrayed my mission. There was no saving me now.\\
But then the other Sakura burst through the door and told me with a beaming smile that, apparently, my personality wasn't all that bad for a demon, which is why enough of my mind survived the mind purging and the forces of heaven decided to offer protection from my punishment in hell. At this point I woke up.

This was one of the best dreams I have ever had. Note that I hadn't had the idea before, that suicide might be subjectively impossible in a multiverse. In hindsight, the reason I was unable to die in my dream was probably just that I couldn't imagine what being dead would be like. Sorry for any awkward English.

** Ahh, are we talking about dreams?

This morning, I had a dream where I was at a magic school. I remember knowing that the magic was roughly elemental-based, but I don't think there was ever a really good explanation. I remember that the air/lightbender people were followed around by giant Strange-and-Norrell-style tunnels of turbulent light, stretching to the heavens, and someone joked about how this impeded their ability to sneak away from their parents. Anyway.

I was in the science classroom -- which just so happened to be my real-life biology classroom from high school -- and a guy brought in a magical object. Now, magical objects are Discovered, not Invented; while not Rare, they are Unusual and require Certain Masterie. Ahem. Specifically, it was a dark sphere, like a black crystal ball, and when you touched it, it shot out a beam of light opposite your fingertip.

"Shot out" is a bit of a strange word. It more ... refracted the light, in an odd sort of loose, scattered pattern, like ... well, a lot like light scattered through a window in my old childhood house.

Anyway, when you focused the light -- which was done by only touching the sphere with one fingertip (it came with a stand, although I was holding it, so it was a bit cumbersome) -- it deposited a button-sized diamond at where the light hit the wall. It would materialize and fall to the floor. I remember I was standing in the hall of my high-school while the dude was in the classroom spinning all this mumbo-jumbo about how he could hear the colors of the light, etc. And I gave the first few gems to the passers-by, because I recognized them as quite expensive, and I was in a charitable mood. But then I timed the orb and realized it deposited them at a rate of 1 jewel every 10 seconds, and we should stockpile the jewels so as to not flood the market.

So thanks, [[/r/rational]]. You've ruined my fantasy dreams with your rational economics. /stews in corner, looking for diamonds around bedroom/

I love the degree of functionality your brain managed to retain inside a dream. For me it's often hard to recall intrinsic patterns of thought \ analysis when I am dreaming, similar to how it's hard to read something inside a dream.

Just because there was some small chance of your plan going wrong in that case wouldn't mean that any plan for suicide would have a small chance of failure, though. You'd just have to kill yourself [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50V3eA2YYFI][with a gun with six loaded chambers out of six,]] not n-1 out of n.

Have you read [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional Brain Chip]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia_the_Purple][Qualia the Purple?]] If no, I think you'd enjoy them.

Also, please use more paragraph breaks in future.

The question is if such a gun can ever be build.

I have read Qualia the purple, never heard of Transdimensional Brain Chip.

Could still fail. The gun could jam, the bullets could all be duds or blanks, the firing pin could have been left out when the gun was assembled, someone could interrupt you, you could pass out / have a non-fatal stroke / etc.

***** To the point where once you actually achieve that it could well turn out that you are in a universe where the laws of physics are just different enough to still preserve a flaw in the supposedly perfect suicide tool. An example would be that extracts your mind from the simulated world in which you presided up to that moment.

**** The gun was a figure of speech, but I partially agree. On the scale of the universe it /could/ be possible to orchestrate such a suicide event that would end successfully in /all/ universes, but you (your overself) would never know until you tried.

One could say that extreme overkills like building a spaceship and flying into a black hole's event horizon would definitely work. However, when we're dealing with an additional dimension that revolves solely around your survival \ anthropic principle, I can see even that not working in all universes.

You wouldn't even have to consider universes with laws dissimilar to ours. The point of failure would just move further back in time. That is, the moment your spaceship reached the point of no return --- when in any possible outcome you were still guaranteed to die --- that branch of timeline would simply die out from your perspective. Your selves would only experience universes in which your spaceship wasn't even able to leave the planet (for various reasons), and so on.

Except that the whole point is that your flow of consciousness is preserved by the compatible points in the multiverse, no? What would happen to "you" in your scenario? Would it seem like you were transported back in time from the "suicide event horizon"? Would any sort of consciousness be lost the moment your death becomes assured, making the "you" that has achieved creating a device for perfect suicide automatically into a p-zombie? I find it more probable that you get transported into whatever parallel universe could prevent your death due to differing laws of physics.

****** No, different versions of the “same” consciousness don't communicate with each other at all --- in what /I/ was describing, at least (the already mentioned /Transdimensional Brain Chip/ works differently, for example). The ones that die simply cease existing, and the ones that failed at suicide continue experiencing a universe where events of seemingly unbelievable odds keep happening.

edit: Imagine, for instance, a person who's trying to defuse a hollywood bomb. Cutting the wrong cord will kill him, the right one will neutralise the devise. So in universes where he cuts the wrong cord, there is no opportunity for him to experience anything further --- those universes stop existing for him. In those, however, where he chose correctly, the versions of his self continue experiencing the world. So from their perspective they never died at all, they just chose the right cord to cut.

In a similar manner, if a character was forced to guess 1 correct option out of 10^{n} to not die (offered guns, rigged mines or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_%28film%29][/Cube/]]-style rooms --- whatever), only the “lucky” version of him would have the opportunity to continue experiencing the world post-choice.

******* The communication part was what prompted me to post those questions because any form where the consciousness goes back in time after death would require such. But if one is to follow the premise that subjective death is impossible because one always subjectively continues wherever one, well, still exists in the first place then the break-off point can't really be in a point in time that happens before one would permanently lose consciousness. Anything else would require that whoever manages to reach the hypothetical point of no return by constructing the perfect suicide machine would have to lose consciousness right then and there without actually firing said machine.

******** I think we are talking having different things in mind.

In the model I'm describing the consciousness doesn't go back in time. In context of OP's story and its discussion, the viewer's perspective just shifts to other versions of the same conciousness who were in universes where their spaceship never left the earth (for example).

In case of OP it was a demon who got protected by the divine forces, in case of book readers it's protagonists who manage to survive and win against incredible odds (so we don't even hear the story of the version that succeeded in launching their ship into a black hole).

In case of someone who's trying to kill themselves and always failing it would be because the ones that didn't fail and died just had nothing to experience as a success.

** Weird question, but, IRL, are you female? If not, also note that it's interesting that you dreamed as a different gender than you identify as. I've had one dream like that once (dreamed I was a different gender); interestingly, in that dream, I was two people sharing one body. One of me could make us go up, the other could make us go down, and that way, we could fly.
