** /These are the Iron Teeth. This is the north proper, the very knife edge of civilization. Here among the stark mountains and endless forests there are undiscovered treasures, amongst countless unmarked graves. Here monsters stalk the night and outlaws gather. It is the land of the desperate and the foolish. A place of singular wonders and crushing horror./

/Here, dwells Myagnoir the Doom of Coroulis, the Great Drake, the City Killer, the Greatest Enemy of Man. His coming sealed the north's decline that the wars of the south began, and shattered all hopes of safety from those wars' depredations. Amongst the icy ruins of the once great Coroulis he rules unchallenged./

/Here, the Forest People wait and plot their revenge on the kingdoms of men. Those that drove them from their ancestral homes, but whose once unmatched power now wanes. Amongst all this simple people struggle to survive, and carve out new lives for themselves far from the greed and wrath of kings./

/Now arrives a newcomer, a captive, a slave, a goblin, a spark onto tinder. The North shall burn, and only time will tell what rises from the ashes./

 

*Synopsis:* All Blacknail the goblin ever wanted was to live a peaceful life in his sewer home, and eat as much as he could fit in his stomach. He certainly never asked to be captured and whisked away to the far off Iron Teeth Mountains. There, Blacknail is taken in and made a servant by the outlaw Herad and her crew of bandits.

Among the monster filled forests and snow peaked mountains of the North he will grow into something far more than a simple goblin. As the world around him slides into ruin Blacknail will fight to survive, and learn to live with the men and women of the North. When an ancient evil rises Blacknail will be there to meet it, and leave his mark on the world forever.

However, first he has to get over his crippling fear of trees, and survive in a place where everything considers him to be the perfect size for a quick snack...
