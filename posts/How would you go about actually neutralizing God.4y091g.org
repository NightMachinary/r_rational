** The holy books are inconsistent enough that "how would we neutralize God as defined in the holy books" is underspecified. If he's capable of creating the universe in a day, there's probably not much you can do. If he has to send the angel of death to kill the Egyptians by looking at the marks on the doorposts rather than just waving his hand and having them all instantly die, he's a lot weaker.

** Well by the torah, I'd expect god to be neutralized by his own directives. By the king james bible, I'd expect god to be neutralized by his son basically going "Dad, don't be a dick". By what I understand of islam, I expect god to be neutralized by virtue of being multifaceted enough to see all sides.

In general this is a case of the invisible dragon in their garage. You can expect god to do nothing measurable or meaningful, where it can be recorded. Accordingly video cameras and regular recordkeeping effectively prevents god from acting in a detectable way. So I'd argue that god is effectively already neutralized.

Why would this be the case?

God in Islam iirc outright stated to [[https://quran.com/3/123-129][sending angels to interfere in a tribal conflict for Mohammed]], and angels have shown the ability to disguise themselves almost perfectly to deal with mortals.

It's not a being that you can expect to not act.

** God's biggest biblical weakness seems to be a requirement tor intermediaries. God only speaks to specific people, and even then usually indirectly through angels or signs. Direct action by God seems so rare that the few times it happens could very well be explained as elision: God "created" the universe in the same way that Steve Jobs "created" the iPhone.

God as supervisor rather than pure omnipotence... a functional polytheist pantheon hiding behind a single CEO.

In that case, convincing various underlings to revolt would be the obvious path to neutralizing God's influence. Indeed the (largely apocryphal - in the classic sense) failed revolution by Lucifer seems to imply such a previous vote of no-confidence.

I'd also suggest that pushing for boardroom politics would be risky unless we could also guarantee that whomever filled the power vacuum would have our interests better in mind than God did... a tall order whether it's a new CEO, a committee, or some sort of nascent shareholder democracy.

***** I was, of course, being humorous. Yours is an accurate reading as far as I recall.

Maybe continuing the corporate metaphor is the right way to go.

I stand by my "find better gods" solution. But maybe it is a hostile takeover that is required to "neutralize" the old order. Buy up part of a sphere covered by an old Greek/Roman god, and just work up the set. Sea, War, Farming, Writers, etc. Just with rational solutions and modern technology to answer prayers.

Maybe with the help of some of the more scary gods -- I'm thinking again Hindu, but maybe also Chinese, West African, or Native American -- never absorbed by the Abrahamic religion you could run a disruptive new startup. One reactive to customer needs, and able to quickly pivot into new areas.

** If Yahweh's book is mostly canon, everyone else should get at least the same level of treatment. That makes things...complicated.

Reality just became a crossover fix-fic. But, "/if it isn't logically possible given scientific observations, it isn't true/" still needs to be the rule of the day or nothing can be rationally determined about reality. Also, you can't just call a new god into being by writing it down. Otherwise, that would be happening all the time.

So literally all religions ever and everywhere can't all be true. That's not what reality acts like. Gotta trim things some.

You said big three, but let's do the numbers. It seems reasonable to say a religious book isn't "canon" if there aren't enough worshipers to prop it up. Let's say if you're looking at, oh, /10%/ or more of the population of the Earth, it gets added to the crossover fic that reality apparently is. That's an ass pull, but I did it without checking the exact numbers.

(furious wiki-ing later)

Here's what we've got: ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations]])

#+begin_example
  Religion        Adherents       Percentage
  Christianity    2.2 billion[3]  31.50%
  Islam           1.6 billion[4]  22.32%
  Secular[a]/Nonreligious[b]/Agnostic/Atheist...  
  ...             â‰¤1.1 billion   15.35%
  Hinduism        1 billion       13.95%
  Chinese traditional religion[c]...
  ...             394 million     5.50%
  Buddhism        376 million     5.25%
  (snip)
#+end_example

(Oh thank god [heh], those crazy ancient Chinese religious ideas didn't make the list. That would have been hard to manage. Ditto with Buddhism and their shit. No mountain-god-dragons, no hard to resolve reincarnation. Point is, it looks like Atheism + Hinduism vs. "God")

So, given that, two options when it comes to realistic deicide in a universe where it is possible:

1. *Just grab a spear or sword and go for it*, Greek/Roman/[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0yVUaL9CWs][Klingon style]]. This technique has a proud tradition in the only non-Abrahamic religion that is still "true enough" to count in this analysis. Staple on all the magical and religious stuff you can find and kill a god.

   It'll at least slow Him down if you take out an avatar or two and that will give you time to cut off the snake's head. Note: unlike Hinduism, this may not literally be a snake head.

   Just going ham on Yahweh is better than 3.8 billion or so (all Abrahamic religions' worshipers) killed due to ideological cleansing, the other proven way to "kill" a god's existence in our theory.

   /Negatives:/ may need a rocketship to reach heaven for the final boss battle. Constant natural disasters may kill hundreds of thousands. Popes will be unhappy about being constantly killed (both sets of them).

   /Positives:/ this has a proven track record in Hinduism. Good exercise.

2. *Find a better set of gods, then kill Yahweh*. According to the OT, they are out there. According to their religious books and teachings, they are awesome.

   Start a coalition of the willing. See if there are some disgruntled former employees from that famous Canaanite startup (protip: hail Satan). If Hindu religious books are right, this sort of thing happens all the time. See if you can get the Trimurti on-sides. Remember, tank, healer, and DPS. Need all three.

   /Negatives:/ this is basically starting a new religion, just with "disruptive" ideas gathered from existing ones.

   /Positives:/ it is *your* new religion, with blackjack and hookers. You'll have help with that three-part (two part now?) boss fight.

**** I think you're missing my point. This whole line of reasoning is also really shaky, and doesn't agree with OP's prompt.

#+begin_quote
  OP specifically stated that it was the Abrahamic god.
#+end_quote

OP didn't say no other gods existed. Those three books being "divinely inspired" doesn't preclude other gods. In fact, the OT explicitly states that there are other gods. The NT even has demons.

You are adding in your own constraint and not giving any reasons. I gave reasons for my expanded scope.

Lots of supernatural things are implied by three religious texts being really, actually inspired by a supernatural being. I'm saying the Hindu deities are most likely next-tier gods. Their people are fruitful and successful, their beliefs survive the test of time with numerous followers, and their books are ancient and predate Christianity. There is evidence that parts of the three "divinely inspired" books are based on shared oral history and precursor writings. A shared history of similar beings, instead of Yahweh existing in a vacuum--an assertion which isn't even backed up by the three "true" books in our scenario.

A final thought on this point: */OP did not even state that Yahweh was the inspiration for those divinely inspired books./*

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Something can be logically possible but not scientifically proven.
#+end_quote

True. Nothing to do with what I said, however. I'm talking about things from the books that aren't logically possible /given existing scientific observations/. Not just unknown or unproven, but /known to be false/.

If the Bible actually said the Earth is 4000 years old (it doesn't, explicitly), then that part would be wrong. It doesn't agree with scientific observation and best theories. There was no great flood that covered the entire planet and humans and a few animals escaped via divine hints. That doesn't agree with geological and oceanographic historic data.

OP said parts of those books would not be accurate. *I'm suggesting the existence of the supernatural doesn't throw out all of science. It just requires careful observation and new theories.*

#+end_quote

It is impossible based on current science, which was my constraint for reality. It also isn't very good logic, as it doesn't have very well formed assumptions that back the conclusions. Given observations about how the universe works, it doesn't make sense for there to be an uncountable infinity of angels and hidden divine war bunkers.

#+end_quote

This is so off it isn't even wrong. That isn't how anything works: logic, science, or epistemology.

The books are inaccurate, as OP said. And who says Yahweh can't lie when inspiring people to write those books? Really, this isn't a well thought out point at all.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I mean...the reasoning is simple: OP wants to have a discussion about countering the Abrahamic God. Thus he posits that the Abrahamic god exists.

He never posits a mechanism for this that would justify expanding existence to any other gods (*you* decide to posit that number of believers somehow matter, *you* impose a mechanism that justifies that leap).

So I never see a reason to infer this from the OP's stated words nor any reason to infer this from the OP's implicit desires. Like, if you read that post, it seems clear to me what he wants. And it's not about discussing the Hindu gods.

At a certain point you have to ask yourself where reason is taking you? It seems that you can add certain features and then extrapolate whatever you like,but then are we talking about what the OP stated? Neutralizing the Abrahamic god?

#+begin_quote
  True. Nothing to do with what I said, however. I'm talking about things from the books that aren't logically possible given existing scientific observations. Not just unknown or unproven, but known to be false.
#+end_quote

We don't even use those rules for scifi universes (and scifi doesn't have the metaphysical claim that God is transcendent). I wouldn't respond to a Culture-on-Earth hypothetical by saying that the Culture would fail cause some power of theirs doesn't work according to our science.

It's not just not how these things work by convention, it's not /fun/.

#+begin_quote
  OP said parts of those books would not be accurate. I'm suggesting the existence of the supernatural doesn't throw out all of science. It just requires careful observation and new theories.
#+end_quote

They could be inaccurate for other reasons, like the message getting corrupted.

Even so, you still have to maintain a "core" of "Godness" otherwise you're not really discussing anything like the actual God of the popular conception.

If the Islamic God says he knows everything down to the finest atom or something similarly absurd...tough shit if that contradicts some scientific principle.

If we tossed it all out then there's no point.

/Some/ of it may be inaccurate. But there are limits before we're not actually talking about God as seen by people or as written- making the whole exercise pointless- and you're just creating an alternate being to discuss.

Frankly, I blame the OP for this. Cause the entire scenario is flawed. God as described is kind of unbeatable, so the OP throws in a sort of weak caveat and never fleshes it out. So this is exactly what happens: you either extrapolate too much to find a path to something seemingly impossible or there's little to nothing to discuss.

****** Either we are talking about a world that makes sense and is like our own, or we're talking about complete fantasy.

OP *wasn't* discussing a world where, for all of creation, Yahweh existed -- a world completely unlike ours and with totally different rules -- but our world /plus truly divinely inspired religious texts and the god of those books/.

This is RWxBible^{3} fanfic. I assumed a rational world, with rational rules, and explained how that could even work based on how we see reality in the real world.

In this fanfic world, Yahweh cannot possible be the only god, because the Old Testament /itself/ says *there are other gods*. He is the "god of gods" -- at least, so He claims through Iron Age scribes. It is without question that the core "godness" of Yahweh in a world that actually has *A GOD* /REQUIRES/ other gods. I explained where and what those gods likely were, based on successfulness of world religions.

Your interpretation of the original question is lacking in rational depth and scope. You do not even attempt to posit a rational world.

** Apparently, it is possible to [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2032:22-32][win a wrestling match with God]]. Also, he's prone to making [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15][long lasting promises]]. Combining that creatively might be a way to get to the standard omnipotent-genie condition (which you'd want to be very careful with, obviously).

He seems to respond well to blood sacrifice, so a program of breeding large numbers of doves and pigeons might be in order. No sense wasting energy on lambs and oxen, unless there is found to be some empirical benefit. (Note: Mt. Carmel used oxen, but there's no explicit requirement of bigger and more expensive animals.)

The city of Sodom [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+18%3A16-33][could have been spared]] by seeding it with ten 'Righteous' people. So one way to neutralize God's wrath would be to make sure the world has a small clan of 'Righteous' people living in every city.

We don't necessarily know what Righteous is for the purposes of this rule, but there seems to be some type of bloodline effect involved rather than a purely behavioral property. Lot and his family are seemingly considered Righteous for the sake of the story, despite exhibiting what we might think of as reprehensible behavior, due to their relationship to Abraham. Of course, not trying to /rape angels/ probably factors into the consideration of what counts as Righteous, but there were probably a fair number of women and children in Sodom who had no part in that particular event. In any case, selectively breeding Righteous bloodlines and ensuring that a small tribe of ten or so exists in every city (especially ones known for wickedness) would seem to be highly advisable.

Another way to potentially steer divine will would be to use an artifact such as the Ark of the Covenant. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel+6][Obed-Edom]] got good results by hosting the Ark at his house for a few months, and presumably [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel+7:1][Abinadab's house on the hill]] had similar results in the twenty years it hosted the Ark. Such artifacts can certainly be dangerous, as God has been known to kill people who touch it without due reverence (for example, whilst trying to keep it from falling off of an oxcart, when it was supposed to be ported around on foot by Levites using sacred poles). Hosting it in a contaminated environment (e.g. dedicated to an idol such as Baal) tends to cause plagues to be released, so of course you don't do that.

One intriguing possibility is that Arks might be mass produceable. The question is whether there needs to be a new Covenant per Ark, or whether a single Covenant can have multiple Arks. Either way, you could have more than one Ark (assuming more than one Covenant is possible). Note that the Ten Commandment tablets of stone were destroyed and replaced; perhaps of the the broken tablets were to be repaired, they could be used to fuel a second Ark. Other types of spiritual artifacts might be collected and placed in suitable boxes to similar effect.

A good use for Arks of the Covenant (or Arks of Covenants, if you can talk Yahweh into agreeing to additional Covenants, perhaps one or more per generation) would be to filter un-Righteous people out of a given bloodline, making it extra pure over time. You could have a ceremony before a young man can get married where he has to touch the Ark with due reverence and survive. Since polygyny is tolerated by Yahweh, this wouldn't necessarily come at much cost to the tribe's ability to replenish its numbers. Those who survive the ceremony could also be given a special license, such that ten such individuals would receive pay for lodging in a Wicked city to prevent its destruction.

The Old Testament doesn't seem to have a Hell, but resurrecting the dead is desirable in any case. You'd want to preserve at least the bones of any dead people, since the [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2037:1-14][Valley of Dry Bones]] prophecy suggests this might be necessary. As far as I know, the only artifact known to resurrect the dead in the OT is [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+13:20-22][Elisha's Bones]]. During his life, Elisha also uses [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+4%3A18-37][full body contact]] with a patient to resurrect him, so direct contact with the bones may not be required. Such bones could perhaps be put in a box similar to the Ark along with other artifacts to keep them charged or to extend the range of their effect. Resurrecting wicked people would be important if there's a Hell, but it might be safer (less likely to trigger 'defilement' protections similar to the Ark in the temple of Baal) to use the bones to resurrect Righteous people first. More Righteous People in the vicinity would lessen any divine retribution in any case.

If Elisha himself could be resurrected from a partial skeleton somehow, it might be possible to self-replicate this artifact (assuming the resurrected Elisha has a complete skeleton, and eventually dies).
