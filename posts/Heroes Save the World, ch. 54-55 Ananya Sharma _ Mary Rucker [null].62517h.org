Also, as part of Kickstarter's All-in-1 event, trying to encourage campaigns that last for only seven days, I've launched a project to release a short story of mine. It's a 1,600 word short story about a fugitive programmer who stows away on the wrong spaceship, and if the project raises just $90, then it'll be released under a Creative Commons license for anyone to read or remix, forever and ever.

If you've been looking for an opportunity to support HSTW but don't like how Patreon is a monthly thing, then the $5 tier will also get you some other books that I've written, like a guide to comparative mythology.
