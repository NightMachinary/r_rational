It's about a man in a black hood who tests people who come across to him. There are like pink hoods and yellow hoods. At one point a guy accuses him of the test being a trick and the man in black gives him a blue hood or something. The final guy joins the black hood dude.

*** Further thoughts--

When reading Ted Chiang's stories, I got an impression of, as a theme running through all or almost-all stories, the concept 'futility'.

For Alicorn, I now get a similar impression for the concept 'sadness'.
