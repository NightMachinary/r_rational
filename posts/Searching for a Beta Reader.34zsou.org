Hi guys!

I'm writing my first novel, and currently almost 90 pages into it, with over 45,000 words. This is a full length novel that I actually want to publish, and consequently, unfortunately, I won't be sharing it here until its published. I do however have some side projects for fun that I have either already finished or am working on as well, so you will see some of my stuff around.

Anyway though, I've by this point far surpassed the ability of my friends to literature-nerd out with and discuss really meta ideas regarding tone and plot and such. I need a beta reader who I can bounce ideas off of, who would be willing to commit the time to help me get this off the ground. They would get to see the novel in a very early and incomplete phase, when I would be somewhat ashamed to show the world, in exchange for helping me with plot, worldbuilding, dialogue, anything and everything. I want someone who will really enjoy the story, and can get into helping me.

So here is a rough run-down of the story.

Aeria. A strange world where islands of metal and stone float through seemingly endless skies. The people who live there are somewhat primitive, with a feudal system in many areas, and the most powerful technologies available are those from the age of steam (with a few twists ofc). There is magic, and the story may appear at first as simple high fantasy, though it is far from it. It may also initially look very steampunk, and it is fairly steampunk in fact. It will be a Rational!story, but it probably won't use specific terms as the characters are unlikely to know those terms. I want everyone to act smart though.

If you're interested, send me a PM or post here. I'm looking for someone who is really into this sort of thing, and will really enjoy getting a first look at my world, so please be sure you're really interested before messaging.

Cheers!

** What if you're /not/ really into steampunk? I don't have a lot of experience with it as a genre. Would that give you a better perspective on the story, as I wouldn't be taking anything for granted?

Edit: missed that last paragraph there. Do you mean into reviewing or into that genre?

*** Into reviewing, you had it right.

And it may actually help not having much experience with the genre. I want it to be able to be something that you could use as an entry into the genre, so yeah, it'll need to be approachable anyway, enjoying steampunk to begin with is just a nice plus :)

*** The main character is named Riese, and she comes from a very simple agrarian culture that is in the process of attempting to violently overthrow their overlords.

** I am interested. I should say that my type of editing is fairly intense, and I won't really hold back on my own opinions. However, I generate my opinions with the knowledge that you can take them or leave them. I, unfortunately, do not have a lot of time to write myself, but if you want to see some of the stuff I've written, and see if the tone, theme, and maybe literary power match what you think might be good for yourself, well, you can check some of my stuff here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2485237/iSaint]]

I definitely recommend being very careful with whom you give the title of "editor" or "beta-reader" to.
