******* On a serious note, MoL was named MoL because doing something over and over again makes you better at it. The sequel would probably follower Zorian & co. After the events of saving the continent from a less than pleasant fate.

******** Yeah, I know the saying - "repetition is the mother of learning" (originally /repetitio est mater studiorum/). Just joking around.

I guess the sequel could simply involve the fact that Zorian & Zach at this point are so ridiculously strong they've got to make some ripples in the world around them... which is bound to draw some unsavory attention at some point.

********** Lol. Each with a different personality developed over the years of exploring and teaching one specific topic.

Also, uhm. There was this manga I read some time ago ("Interspecies Reviewers") in which a female and very attractive wizard used her simulacra to run a massive brothel all by herself (though in fact it seems like it's really a massive operation to acquire both intel and tissue samples from multiple customers). I'm pretty sure Zorian would not be into doing that, but Zach? Who could tell?

******** The Big Problem MoL2 would have to face is that MoL already pretty thoroughly explored its world, so there's not much left to explore to build a second plot on. ZZ are already going toe to toe with some of the nastiest beings in the world so they don't have much left to grow, and even if they did it would just denigrate the powerhouses of MoL by demoting them to 'big fish in the small pond'.

There's still plenty of good options, such as pivoting to a different kind of plot (though admittedly that likely takes the author and readers both out of their comfort zone) or opening up new parts of the world to explore (which is a tricky balance to avoid the problem I talked about just above) or switching to an entirely new character and starting from ground zero again. That last option gives the best potential for a greater series, since you can tell a handful of big stories and string them together into a mega-plot spanning the entire series, but it /does/ require that you abandon the protagonist you started this universe with.

********* But consider: sequel POV character is Kirielle

We would still get to see what becomes of Z&Z, but the antagonists can reset to small scale and the conflict can shift to Kirielle's attitude towards her two famous/powerful brothers (Fortov doesn't count here) and if she can ride their coattails or one up their achievements.

********* There's things left to be explored. The dealing with Zachs caretaker is already hinted including assassinations, so it could be a nice first arc. Plus fixing Zorians family would take a while (though both of these might get wrapped up in the last chapter)

The royal family could be enemies. They should have at least a couple on xvim / alenics level, plus a whole army Zorian is still afraid of. I'm actually disappointed we never got to meet a prince or princess.

There's the immortal 11. Some of them could be antagonists. I also think they discussed that the previous sovereign gate users might still be alive, possibly one of the 11?

Damien could launch an expedition to the dragon isles, I doubt they got much stronger in a combat sense the last reset, and they were afraid of the dragons then so they should still be a challenge there. Plus there's a whole hinting at "Atlantis" existing ([[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/continents-overview/#respond]]) and other expeditions they could go on, meeting new and powerful people. Zach sounds like a guy who would like to investigate the bottom of the dungeon.

Endgame could be an invasion from the demon dimension, or maybe Zach and Zorian "invading" the celestial plane.

Maybe Mol2 wouldn't be as long as Mol1, but it doesn't have to be.

Some problems include there's really not that much more to learn, so powerlevels can't grow much (which might be boring. Or maybe not, I don't mind really).

******* True, and the deadline before that, issued in early September, was October/November, which was only updated to December in (I think?) mid-November.

I'm giving this one a bit more credibility because it's predicting the release date with much more accuracy, and a time remaining until update is much closer to that of earlier updates (which, again, only tended to be a week late, if that).
