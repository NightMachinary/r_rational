Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}

**** That was a pretty great read! But from a narrative view it was kind of frustrating to see Matt essentially manipulate and lie to everyone for the entire story and get off scot free in the end. Carl's life is ruined and has to live with his friends' ultimate betrayal despite trying to live up to his obligations, and Matt gets no consequences for trying to dodge his responsibilities and even “gets the girl” in the end.

Definitely a fun short read but damn if that didn't feel like a karmic blueball lol

***** Spoilers, because I'm not sure how to tag on mobile.

No, I don't think Matt "got the girl". Sure, she liked him originally, but it was her best friend who realized what was going on and helped her. Also, I imaging finding out the guy you kinda liked has like 20+ years of experience on you and had absolutely no intention of ever telling you would be a pretty major turn-off, particularly given her circumstances.

Matt had to return despite his wishes to clean up the mess he created, and even his sister blames him for it, so he has no sympathy from anyone. I agree that he got off too easy, but life isn't always fair.

Carl ruined his own life, and pays the price. It doesn't fall to the girl he loves to correct his mental health, and they placed the good of an entire world over someone that used to be their friend. Thats the epitime of rational utilitarianism. In any case, she felt remorse and guilt, but believed that she made the right decision. I agree.

And the sister (dont remember names) was not at fault apart from perhaps failing Carl, but it was a very human and understandable failing- Carl's problems were impossible for her to solve, and she had enough on her plate. She makes a return and brings her friend. I'd say she got a happy ending but really she is hurt enough that it will only be as happy as she can make it from the end of the story. But at least she is home. She is a survivor, not a victim, and that is pretty powerful.

****** I don't think Matt's chances are as screwed as you make them out to be. Just to clarify, it's only 6-7 years that they spent in CV, since one of them mentions being 23. Given how messed up the other two that came back ended up being, I personally would think it's pretty understandable that someone I only just started dating didn't want to bring up a massively traumatic event that would make him seem insane.

As for Carl, it's true that he was ultimately the architect of his own downfall, and his obsession with returning to CV alienated the people who might have actually returned him there. *However,* and this is getting just a bit speculatory since the author was pretty vague on the details of their return from CV, but it's implied from Jen's surprise upon being returned, that Matt unilaterally decided they were all going back to CV without any warning or input from the other two.

Hence, Matt is directly responsible for creating a massively traumatic event by deliberately ripping away Carl's support structure, friends, and future in full knowledge of how bad it was for them the first time. I say that Matt's actions directly caused the damage to Carl's mental state that lead to his (essentially) psychotic break, and Matt's inaction by refusing to disclose that he knew there was a way to at least /help/ Carl's trauma by returning them to CV only worsened it, and further exacerbating it by treating their shared experience as a delusion is just icing on the asshole cake.

I do agree Jen was in no position to help Carl while dealing with the PTSD expressing from that same trauma. She absolutely does get a happy ending, which I can't really begrudge like you said, she had plenty on her plate. However, I hesitate to call her a powerful character within the context of the story on Earth, since much of her "happy ending" was created entirely by plot fiat. If not for her happening to come across the mysterious trail (made by who??? never explained) leading to the spellstone, her return to CV would have been entirely at the whims of Matt. Her greatest moment of agency is essentially being triggered by her PTSD and thankfully pointed in the correct direction. Beyond that, she is just coping with her trauma or being manipulated by Matt.

****** I mean... that's debatable IMO. If anyone, Carl appeared to be the one who wanted to go back to to CV the most, he just had no means to do so. Matt had a witch straight up tell him, Jen got lucky and found the stone anyway, but Carl put way more effort than either of them into the only avenue he had, given what he knew. It's honestly a bit annoying that the "mysterious person who puts the stone in the forest" is never revealed, since I was sure it would be Malcolm or whatever his name was. Instead it turns out that was just a red herring and Carl was fucked no matter what he did.

******* Me messing around with the idea; take what you like, at least one of these sounds like a writing exercise I should do; started writing this before I noticed you weren't /Gaboncio/.

After thinking on it, I've concluded that one of the parents should believe they've come back from Narnia*, the other thinks it was a trip to the future, one of their siblings thinks it's another world** and their friend is wondering how to get them counseling for PTSD, and they're looking into occult methods to get back to the other world.

*Or they've been replaced by a changeling. (Easy to combine with a family history.)

**And wants to know what independent technological/etc. methods they've developed. (Or magic.) The world's not going to conquer itself. (Or the multiverse, for that matter.) Alternate: thinks they went back in time (hence the trauma), and wants to know what it was like back then.

This sounds like a lot of work though, and that much drama probably needs comedy, so in addition to figuring out how to write a decent story (or crackfic? Is it a crackfic when it's an original story?), worldbuild*, and be funny (in writing).

*Or build off of someone else's world. Decisions, decisions.

Murder, Bribe, Tell Stories, Heal, Fix. That's not 7, so 7 sins is out... Though making "everybody right/wrong about what happened" is almost possible. (With magic another world could be like the future and the past; divination (before going back?) could enable foreknowledge, etc. Alternatively, it could be based on general predictions - knowledge collected from people from other worlds.)

** A Dresden Files RPG, but the city it's set in is a near-future anarchocapitalist charter city with a Pateron-funded military and heroin vending machines in all the for-profit charter schools.

The wizards use the overflowing pharmacopeia to bring about the states of mind they need to best use their magic (e.g. ketamine to use ritual magic). They've figured out ways to allow spirits of intellect to inhabit electronics, making them slow-takeoff AGI.

A considerable plurality of the White Council are trying to rebrand themselves as superheroes. Their leader is the caped alter-ego of the investor who started the charter city.

*** The To Aru Majutsu No Index setting might not be that far off from what you have in mind. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam][In Memoriam]] is a more rational rewrite of the first arc or so, and you might find details to lift from the original such as headsets that allow for dreams to be saved and shared, or the space elevator having magical significance much like a wizard's tower.

I'm not sure how Dresden Files magic would get along with the kind of surveillance state I'm assuming the charter city looks like, but maybe enough people carry around jammers that the mages don't stand out, or the interference mechanism only affects obsolete electronic systems that have since been replaced with optical circuits.

I like the idea of drug-enhanced magic, it's a shame the magical interference would stop them using transcranial magnetic stimulation headsets or brain implants.

With regards to rebranding as superheroes, that seems like it would lead to all sorts of fun conflict. Will the PMCs be out for blood when their Patreon subscribers leave them for the more charismatic capes? Will the other supernatural groups join in with this twist on the masquerade? What are the advantages of presenting oneself as a superhero rather than just being openly magical?

EDIT: Also, the Shadowrun setting might be close enough to give you ideas. The main difference is that magic is publicly known, but after 5 editions there's a lot of material about daily life in an ancap cyberpunk dystopia.

I'm not sure why you assume that there'll be a surveillance state. By assumption, there isn't since there isn't any /state,/ surveillance or otherwise. Sure, there'll be insurance companies who offer lower rates in exchange for allowing monitoring, but nothing like what /I/ usually associate to the phrase "surveillance state". But, since the landholder of the charter city is a White Councilmember's alter ego... lets just say that the developers who were willing to play ball with their construction so their buildings complemented magical flows got fast tracked while the developers who were less tolerant of her "eccentricities" got bogged down in bureaucracy.

Yeah, I anticipate a lot of fun wizard vs superhero vs mortal dramabombs (one of the players is being an Objectivist True Believer. If the joke doesn't wear thin, it should be fun). There's no particular /advantage/ to being a superhero versus being a wizard, it's more of a color politics thing. Both sides /claim/ amazing and obvious benefits, but it basically comes down to a difference of aesthetic.

The backstory is the leader of the capes learned quite a bit of magic on her own, but didn't think it was magic, she thought it was superpowers (this is an old character of mine whose high concept was "budding supervillain" [it was a hard time in her life, but {spoilers for Worm} she didn't do any worse then the pre-Levithan Undersiders. She came to the Council's attention when she robbed a "bank" which was actually a front for the Venatori. She didn't break any Laws of Magic, though she did break a few laws of the US Government] until she joined the Council and did a Skitter->Weaver-esqueheel-face turn). By the time she encountered the White Council, she'd already made a bunch of distinctly superheroish magical items (an enchanted mask, a warded bodysuit with a logo, etc) and by that time she just kinda kept up the shtick for fun. Fast-forward a few years and she's prominent in a more progressive clique of the Council and adopting superhero garb became a way of showing party loyalty. (Also, I imagined the White Council chambers with half of the Wizards in black robes and the other half looking like a comic book panel and I found that image too charming to not crowbar in somehow.)

Profit and security. Personal data is the most valuable commodity to companies right now, and it's value will only increase as our ability to predict people's behavior gets better. The addition of magically enhanced AGI would make personal data almost invaluable to any company that has a consumer base. Imagine a for-profit surveillance company that sets up cameras in crowded areas all over the city that can recognize where you are, what you're doing, and identify your current emotional state. That info is then sold to advertisers who use it to decide when you're most susceptible to their advertising.

Then there's the simple matter of every physical building being invested in it's own security, making surveillance necessary. If an ancap society has very loose laws, individuals might try to rely on the guarantee of retribution rather than deterrence in regards to crime. Sure, we might not be able to afford high level security, but after we identify you on camera we'll hire someone to come for you.

There are plenty of market driven reasons to surveil people, especially if AI exists in the world.

*** I've actually been thinking about a similar setting that takes place in modern times but with the recent emergence of magic leading to people playing hero/villain. Patreon or something similar seems like it would be a plausible explanation for how heroism could become lucrative (so it doesn't just appeal to a very small subset of magic users) without getting the government involved. I think a lot of youtube culture would create some interesting dynamics in such a world, where things like collaborations, faked rivalries, scheduled fights (or the horrific dis-tracts that have become common on youtube), and reaction/response/apology videos are used to help boost subscriptions. Apology videos might become commonplace whenever a hero crosses a line or says something that isn't particularly PC. I think it would be interesting to see how some heroes deal with the uniquely vitriolic nature of internet comments too, being told to kill yourself hundreds or thousands of times a day might be more mentally strenuous than the sort of criticism a newspaper/magazine might publish. Youtubers also wield a fair amount of power in the form of their viewers, singling someone or something out in a public video can easily lead to an outraged mob of twitter trolls calling for boycotts, harassment, and, often times, the hacking and release of personal information. User's of this system would probably have to jump through some serious hoops to avoid being doxxed and the creator of the Patreon/Youtube website would probably be targeted by the government almost immediately. Agencies that manage heroes/villains would similarly be targeted.

​

On the emergent AGI topic, I wonder if the fact that they are created using magic might make them more or less manageable (magical off switch?). I'm not familiar with spirits of intellect, but depending on how they work it could imply what sort of utility functions the AGI will have. Love the drug enhanced magic idea, btw.

**** Short version of how spirits of intellect work: when they're in the mortal world, they have to be housed in some sort of container during the daytime or they'll be destroyed. This usually has to be symbolically connected to intellect, so they prefer living animals or human skulls, but electronics also work. To make it consistent with the setting, I headcanoned that they can't inhabit anything with mundane electricity in it (so they need to be unplugged and the batteries removed) and in order to usefully interface with the actual electronics instead of just sheltering inside them, they need to have a custom-written operating system installed. They can connect to the internet via wi-fi, but they can't transmit /themselves/ (since it would require going through the mundane-powered router). In theory, they could use their interface with the computers to rewrite themselves, but the notion of self-improvement is pretty foreign to spirits of intellect. Even if they've read and understood /Superintelligence,/ they wouldn't necessarily (and, in my setting, haven't... yet) made the connection that that could be /them/.

** I'm running a side plot in a Dungeons and Dragons story where a dragon has begun introducing the gold standard to replace carrying actual gold weights around. The dragon has secretly started creating money without the gold to back it up but is so far keeping inflation low.

In my campaign, the rules as written are the laws that govern the universe rather than an abstraction. So when a resurrection spell says it costs X gold pieces worth of diamonds to cast, that means that whatever quantity of diamonds can currently be purchased with that amount of currency is the quantity required to cast the spell. If the dragon causes steady economic growth while still offering the gold exchange then the value of gold pieces will drop and thus cause spells that are pegged to the gold coin to drop in cost and dramatically alter the value of a life.

In a context where the raw materials to bring somebody back from the dead drops below the cost of feeding somebody for a month, what are some cultural changes that are rationally likely to happen in a mostly agricultural level society?

*** High-level clerics become extremely wealthy and powerful. Whether they're getting paid in a fee-for-service approach, or a weekly 'tithe' that might consist of money, goods, services and 'favors', they're rapidly going to become a dominating force in society. One way or another, most people will make sure that they are in the good graces of a cleric who can revive them.

This is exacerbated by how cheap human life becomes. Crusades may quickly become rampant, as the cost of war falls close to zero, and everyone becomes eager to prove their loyalty and faithfulness to their clerics. Theocracy quickly becomes commonplace, as the keys to social, financial, and military power all end up consolidated in the hands of a handful of high-level clerics. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle - as war becomes more common, it becomes more important than ever to prove your loyalty to a cleric who would revive you if needed, furthering the power of an ever-growing multitude of theocracies.

As the Great Crusades burn across the land, strategy quickly turns towards locating and seizing the enemy clerics, possibly converting them to your side by blackmail, bribery, or coercion. The warfare is particularly brutal, as mere sieges against holy cities can be held off nearly indefinitely by consumption of the flesh of those who die of starvation, followed by resurrection, in a perpetual cycle. Instead of trying in futility to wait out the defenders, attacking armies sacrifice lives carelessly in the pursuit of quick victory, scaling walls with ladders and engaging in bloody and direct assaults with overwhelming numbers.

As the crusaders close in upon the great temples that now form the seats of political power in most societies, they might feign a retreat or call to negotiate, or turn to plundering houses and burning homes. A simple ruse. You see, anyone slain in battle can be revived anywhere else in the world with a true resurrection spell. You can't truly kill a cleric. They would simply emerge again somewhere else. While the ruse is ongoing, the smoke still thick in the air and the sounds of battle and screaming maintain a cacophony of noise, special forces teams consisting of wizards, rogues, and high-level fighters move in invisibly and capture the clerics by surprise. They cannot be allowed to kill themselves. With the clerics secured, a horn is sounded and the rest of the city is wiped clean of defenders.

Captured clerics now have a difficult choice. Be held alive against their will indefinitely until old age takes them, or recant their heretical beliefs and pledge their loyalty to the gods of the invaders. Most are strong-willed, but some convert. Gradually the most powerful religions grow stronger and stronger as the weaker religions are purged from the world. In time, one dominating religion conquers the world. Peace ensues. One world, one religion, one True God.

I specifically want to avoid a lot of stuff that fantasy settings tend to get wrong, especially about geographic stuff (how many settlements are there of what size, how common are castles & how large are they usually, how expensive are goods in relation to each other, etc.)

I can't seem to find anything directly answering my questions - a link to a site or the name of a good non-fiction book would be very appreciated.
