Hi friends,

I just wanted to ask if anyone had any info about the next WtC release, which, according to the tracker sheet, looks to be quite large. Is there any info floating around about it, or is it business as usual?


** This is business as usual. Releases are typically about a month apart, but last month the lore doc was uploaded, which was also very large.

*** That's right, I forgot about the lore doc. Thanks for the response, and sorry if this is a relatively low value post.

**** I'm actually surprised it wasn't today. Wales always seems to upload on my busiest weekends, but he missed this one!

** I know Worth The Candle releases when it's done, but does the author have a fixed time of day or day of week for that? It worked really well when EY did it.

*** He's said a few times that he posts it after his son has gone to bed, and he lives in the Central time zone, so roughly 7:00 CST, although it varies. I don't think there's any pattern on day of the week though.

*** He releases it when it's done, it's partially in editing now, so it might be a week orso more

**** I think [[/u/jtolmar][u/jtolmar]] was more asking if it for instance dropped Wednesdays at 3 pm EST - not every Wednesday, or even on a schedule, but in a way you wouldn't have to check daily to see if there was a new release
