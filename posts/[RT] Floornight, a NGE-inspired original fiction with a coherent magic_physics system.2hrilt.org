** Whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. Being able to split up, read two books, and then reintegate and remember both is a /drawback/? It's like if you were lost in the woods and scared of bears, and you found a radio, and all you could think of is how to use it to kill bears.

*** Very good point. This is one of the main things I need to clear up if I ever go back and edit the story: Maria is one of the relatively few people who can actually be split at all. She's a power source for the same reasons she's a pilot, and this is not common. I kind of explained this by having Maria's waking routine in Ch. 6 begin with checking for reintegrations, when Ratio's waking routine hadn't in Ch. 5, but it needs to be more explicitly stated. (If any of the scientists could split, they definitely would.)

(I should probably also specify at some point that the amount of energy gained from integrating two branches increases with the "distance" between the branches, to explain why they don't just constantly split and integrate one person over and over again very quickly.)

** I'm on chapter 10 now, and quite enjoying it so far. Is this complete?

Edit: No, it is not. And while I liked it, I think it "suffers" from some of the same drawbacks that /Ra///Fine Structure/ suffer from, which is that the story is told without a coherent narrative thread - we are instead given the story in bits and pieces and left to figure out things for ourselves and fill in the missing gaps through inference. I think that more or less works for psychological horror, where part of the point is keeping the reader just slightly off-balance, but it's a style of writing that I like better when I can engage in a running commentary with other people so we can clue each other in.

***** Or just a new post whenever it updates. But given that all 21 chapters seem to have been put up at once, I have no idea what the author's update schedule is like, if there is one at all.

****** Hi, author here! I appreciate all the comments here and am flattered by the attention.

Until a few days ago Floornight was being posted only to my tumblr -- then I dumped it all on AO3. The updates are in 1-3 chapter blocks, and the schedule is erratic and based on when I feel like writing. If you want a sense of what the schedule has been, see the tumblr page [[http://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/fiction][here]]. (If you click on an individual update, you will be able to see when it was posted.)

The first update was posted on July 5 2014, which works out to a rough average rate of around 1.5 chapters per week, but of course I can't guarantee that will happen reliably every week.

******* Cool! I'm enjoying the story a lot - I'll probably be following on AO3 and posting new chapters to this subreddit as they come out. Looking forward to reading more.

****** [[/r/TrueAnime]] has two weekly threads, one for what all the new episodes which aired that week and one for any older things else the users have seen that week. Maybe something similar?

Also, I /really/ need to watch NGE, don't I?

** I'm really enjoying this story! I like the characters and the disconcerting nature of it. I feel more emotionally invested than with Ra, both in the world/science and the characters. My only complaint is the "Ratio" character seems a bit too much like Sherlock from the BBC mini-series, it's hard to divorce the two in my mind.

*** Well, they do both have Asperger's...

My mental image of Ratio is short with frizzy hair, but I can't recall how canonical that is.

**** Yeah, I think he's got short red curly hair, kinda' bushy. Yes I think he's short too. It's more the way he talks and acts, though.

***** Yeah, Ratio is supposed to be short (though I'm not sure I've explicitly stated that), with big curly hair (color unspecified so far). He's also described as "pudg[y]" in Ch. 20, which is not a word that would apply to Benedict Cumberbatch.

Behavior-wise, I do think the characters are drawn from similar broad "types," but I feel like I'm trying to write Ratio as less arrogant than BBC Sherlock, at least under the surface. It's been a long time since I watched that show, but IIRC Sherlock is quite confident that his unusual thinking style is simply /better/ than ordinary thought, where Ratio realizes that his unusual thinking style has its downsides, and has a fair amount of insecurity attached to this (see Ch. 20). He's also somewhat less distant than Sherlock -- the kind of guy you could imagine going out drinking with and having a good time if you didn't already find him annoying (cf. his friendship with Cecelia as depicted in Chs. 5 and 13, or his relationship with Jorge as depicted in Ch. 20).

I hope that helps, and I hope I don't sound defensive in trying to distinguish the two characters. I guess I feel like one of my goals here is to write an intelligent, socially inept character with an unusual thinking style /without/ doing a rehash of Sherlock or other notorious instances of the type, so it's important to me that the differences be there.

****** No, not at all. Of course you're right. I guess I just mentally tagged him as ginger, because white people with curly frizzy hair like that are often red-heads.

Yes, Ratio does clearly worry about his deductions and methods of thought, he just does really remind me of Sherlock. Not physically, just in that "going a million miles a minute the feelings of people are often irrelevant to finding the answer" type deal. He just came off that way to me.You don't sound defensive at all.

I'm really enjoying your story! I'm looking forward to more. Please post back here again when there's a new chapter!

******* I'm glad you're enjoying it! It's been hard to write lately because I've had the flu, but I'm getting better now, so there should be some updates soon enough. (The latest update was Ch. 22, posted on 10/2/14, and given your posting date I imagine you've already read it.)

******** I have! I read the entirety of what you've written so far in two sittings. I'm sorry you've been ill, hope you feel better soon. I'm really enjoying the alternate worlds you've got going on; I'm excited to see more of what happens with the rebellion in the plane where beings use pneuma producing slaves as a main power source.

******* Just wanted to mention that I've posted two new chapters. I've been very busy in the last few weeks and haven't been able to write, but hopefully there should be a less sparse update schedule from now on.
