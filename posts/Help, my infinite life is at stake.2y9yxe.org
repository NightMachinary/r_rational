Best thing is to look at who ascended last round, in 48, and do something different. It's pretty simple: either aim to be the icon of a style, or make up your own. Patrick Eternity was basically the culmination of high fantasy. Baxter was taken even old and lame because he wrote the literature of our species. /Shadowsaurs/ summed up czf. Etc.

****** Classic rule of fiction: write what you know. You've already admitted that you don't have time to properly familiarize yourself with modern culture, so don't even try; tell us about your own instead. The results of doing so may or may not be well-received, but at least it'll be genuine. A fake effort based on what you think the judges are looking for has no chance at all.

******** So? Write about a goat-tender. I'm writing [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/about/][a story about a swineherd]], and people seem to be liking it. Of course, he's living on an Earth colony where humans kept a great deal of their knowledge but lost their computers and useful metals to a meddlesome AI trying to save humans from themselves.

**** Wouldn't the government have an incentive to kill you and replace you with the clone that they will likely be able to make more loyal to them than you? In fact, how do you know this hasn't happened already?

Mind, the concept of /using/ uploads as /tooled labor/ sounds pretty disturbing. I think our colony might have to reinvade the planet.

SICKENING that they let militant names like yours exist, yet still censor shit about swastikas.

This is why we must REMEMBER SALAZAR, REMEMBER THE RACE IT SPAWNED and the doom they promised us, not be seduced to integration. And why we must take all possible measures to ensure our military competence.
