** The Joshua passage in full:

#+begin_quote
  And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
#+end_quote

All of this refers to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_(Canaan)][city-state of Ai]], rather than AI as Artificial intelligence. But, well, you should know the score by now when it comes to coincidences.

An apple foretells Eve's falling [in Eden].

****** - The author can take a week to solve something and have a character solve it in a second. Readers will assume that the character thinks fast.
- They can ask experts or research something and have the character solve it on their own. Readers will think that the character has a lot of knowledge.
- They can look into the pure facts of the matter and have the first character solve it from smaller clues. Readers will think that the character is perceptive.
- The author can create the world so that the character only faces problems they can solve. Readers will think that the character can solve /any/ problem.

These are all ways of creating characters that are smarter than the author is, and I think Scott's using all of them in UNSONG.

****** In this particular instance, he cheated by having Sohu ask Aaron that specific question about apples and oranges. While writing this chapter, Scott considered all the possible pun-responses first, then discarded questions that Sohu /could/ have asked, but which he could not generate punnery for, e.g. "How are bananas like pears?" It's entirely possible that before writing Unsong he penned a master list of 'things Aaron and Ana (and Uriel and Dylan) can say to flesh out their personalities and sound cool' and then worked them into the narrative as necessary. The readers don't see the material on the cutting room floor.

*** Perhaps THARMAS just uncovered a Name for its second time! If the first discovery of a Name is the tutorial vision and Names are valid even if klipatified, then it stands to reason that a large number of generated names would be simple klipot of previously-discovered Names.

Perhaps it discovered and then rediscovered the Healing Name or the Mnemonic Name or the Accelerating Name or the Flawless Function Name or some other Name to subvert the restrictions placed on it.

** I was wondering how we could be so close to the final arc, but this chapter definitely has the feel of moving towards a climax.

I think the most important questions right now are: if the Other King is in fact Robin West, what is she hoping to gain from the current situation with the nuclear missile? And if not, then who is he/she?
