** Interesting look into Ender's insights. It was hard fo me to figure out at first what had changed because of how long it's been since I've read Ender's Game. But I am pretty sure that Ender was only half as insightful as he was here, and hardly as self reflective.

**** I'm curious about the first draft, because I'm wondering what he'd reflect on more. It was well written, and the style differences only stuck out once or twice (awarding people points in his head, the /true/ question, etc.). It also seems slightly different with regards to Ender's conception of the war - I thought he was more like Dink was described here, seeing the teachers (or administrators) as the enemy than the Buggers.

Was this a one time thing, or will you be writing more of this?

***** In the first draft, Ender wondered what was broken in his own thinking.

My readers pointed out that Ender /never/ does that. He's perfectly happy to reflect on what's broken in /other/ people's thinking, and to vow not to make the same mistake, but he doesn't have uncertainty about his own cognition on the meta level.

Ender got a little seed of doubt from Dink's skepticism, but he always believed in the core of the war:

#+begin_quote
  The Battle School was so enclosed, the game so important in the minds of the children, that Ender had forgotten there was a world outside. Spanish honor. Civil war. Politics. The Battle School was really a very small place, wasn't it?

  But Ender did not reach Dink's conclusions. The buggers were real. The threat was real. The IF controlled a lot of things, but it didn't control the videos and the nets. Not where Ender had grown up. In Dink's home in the Netherlands, with three generations under Russian hegemony, perhaps it was all controlled, but Ender knew that lies could not last long in America. So he believed.

  Believed, but the seed of doubt was there, and it stayed, and every now and then sent out a little root. It changed everything, to have that seed growing. It made Ender listen more carefully to what people meant, instead of what they said. It made him wise.
#+end_quote

This is a one-time thing. I might tinker with it, but there's room here for at most one chapter, according to me (the book flows fine with the gap year, and I think it would be improved with one chapter in the gap year instead, and I think it would be /worse/ with two or more).

******* I read a series of blog posts criticizing the book one time. Much of it was nitpicky, but an interesting point was made that we're repeatedly told but not shown Ender's empathetic powers. He lets multiple schoolyard fights escalate to deathmatches when if he'd been more aware of his surroundings and a little less proud he might have been able to get away with a broken nose.

**** I really like characters examining their own thinking, motivations, and social context. It's something I like to do, but I really have only been good at it since college. So it is a bit unbelievable that a ten-year-old can be so self-aware. But then again, Ender isn't a normal ten-year-old.

Your writing is always an enjoyable read. Keep up the good work!

** It's been a really long time since I've last read Ender's Game. Probably a decade?

Can anyone fill me in on what's different from the original story? It's really similar to what I remember, but I don't know what changes to canon that the author made in this fanfiction.

*** I tried to make zero changes to canon.

This takes place in a gap year that is completely skipped over in canon, although there are events that are referenced and must have taken place (Ender being promoted to toon leader in Petra's army, Ender "talking Dink into playing along with the teachers"). My goal was to flesh out those and other related events as if the year had not been skipped in the original work.

**** This might sound like a weird nitpick, but has the canon made any reference to adjusting the brightness of the battle room as a way of changing scenario of the battle? I thought the only things they changed were the star positions.

Either way great chapter!

**** i found the integration of writing from the original and the inclusion of similar if not the same font formatting very disorienting

that could be overall a good thing, I wasn't as keen on it, probably because I've read it so many times the new felt accordingly at odds

So I think that's a well done, then

** I've read Ender's Game half a dozen times, and the best praise I can offer is that I was not immediately sure where card's work ended and your work started.

â€‹

The only slightly off note to me was Ender's musing about whether he should teach the other kids the techniques, since I thought that is what he was doing when he was teaching his launchies? But the book is a little more blithe about Ender's superiority (ie he's very quickly the best at the game) in a way that's inherently difficult to reconcile.

** This is a very good imitation of the style writing in Ender's Game. A few things stood out- mentally awarding points and thinking of the true question have been pointed out, but also the way Dink has trust but Petra has respect feels off. Those are vastly outweighed by the things done very well though; "All had emerged mysteriously from the deeper parts of himself, the places where seeing and thinking and feeling blurred together into something resembling magic" came close to making me think you'd intermixed text from elsewhere in the book with yours or maybe nicked that line from something else O.S.C. had written. The description of the battle was novel but also fit perfectly with the described capabilities of the rooms and as a design the teachers might throw in. Battle School slang felt fluid, and Graff felt longsuffering as always. Plus, the reference to our favourite urchin made me smile, though that was a much lower bar.

There's not a lot of spare room in Ender's Game for inserting chapters, but if you write any more of these I hope you share them!
