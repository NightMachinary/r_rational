*This is the companion thread for the biweekly challenge. Please post recommendations, story ideas, brainstorming, etc. in this thread.*

I love politics. Or rather, I hate politics, because it's horrible and toxic, but I love the play and counterplay of politics; so long as I'm viewing it more as a chess match and less like a decision making process, I end up enjoying the show. I also think that politics is one of the hardest things for a writer to get right, because there's a strong instinct to just write the other side off as stupid or ignorant without actually trying to pass some form of the ideological Turing test.

Politics in science fiction and fantasy holds more of a draw for me, because an author can create a new issue from whole cloth and then explore where the ideological (and political faction) lines can be drawn. It's fascinating to me to see political explorations of necromancy or human-brain interfaces ... and in my opinion, it doesn't really show up as often as it should.

(Apologies for the brief summary, it's National Novel Writing Month.)

I would say that the difficulty in writing politics is making both sides look stupid and ignorant which is a lot more in line with the reality of politics in a non-rational populace. What's the need for coherent sensible politics when buzzwords and catchphrases do more work?

In short, people are not "rational" if by "rational" you mean "AIXI". Of course, AIXI has numerous flaws listed out in the literature about it, /and/ can't exist in the physical world. When you try to come up with definitions of rationality that /can/ in principle apply to physical, embodied beings with no a priori knowledge beyond their learning algorithms, you get definitions under which human beings are approximately rational. It is, of course, possible to /make/ something /more/ rational than a human, but that requires building in additional information, literally writing more bits of code into the learning algorithms.

*** To me, that sounds like an oversimplification. The US political system certainly has many systemic problems that have become very apparent this election, but to write off the situation as "people are morons" is unproductive. What is productive is to understand why the system is the way it is due to what interests people are incentivized to pursue.

Political campaigns aren't build on catchphrases, those are just marketing slogans designed to attract attention from potential voters so they might reconsider their position and also give current supporters a tribal identification to latch onto. It's easier for people to process, especially when they're distracted from politics by their own busy lives.

***** Individuals have enough difficulty being rational by themselves, when they group together those biases are even more likely to take hold just by pure volume. Tribalism is a significant source of bias, but we can't exactly prevent it since grouping up to pursue mutual interests ahead of others is a basic survival mechanism. Some people have more empathy for those outside their tribe than others, but in the end we all have people whose interests we value more than others even if it's just our loved ones. That's not a bad thing, that's just what us humans are programmed to do.

I would still call it good vs good, it's just that each tribe has a different definition of what is good that is predisposed to helping their tribe over others. It's a politician's job to fulfill their constituents desires, but no one can get everything they want so they negotiate to get as much as they can. Of course, not all constituents will be happy with the end result or what had to be done to get there, so politicians have to project an image that doesn't encompass the whole truth. Outright lying is possible, just like it is for any human, but being found out will destroy the trust they've earned.

Trump is an anomaly in the context of political history, and he can't be used as an example of anything until the campaign is over and we can see the consequences of it. All we can examine right now is the lead up to his campaign, look at the ideological shifts within the GOP over the years. In general, politics around the world has seen a resurgence of populism in response to both rapid change and a lack of change in different areas. Both sides think their grievances are being ignored by the political system and are flocking to candidates that defy the status quo due to their frustration with it.

If you're writing a story which contains two party politics in the back or foreground then I think unless you have a population which is rational making them appear good vs good to a reader seems wrong to me. Go read 90% of political discussions from just 100 years ago from example and both sides would be difficult to describe as good, and that's from both a hindsight and a much more in depth look in than the average citizen would get (depends if your story has your character super involved in the depth behind scene or not). Once you're detached from the environment that political machines have built up it's very difficult to see sides as good.

Of course you can do it and it'd certainly be interesting to read a story about 2 rational political parties debating for a rational audience (though I think eventually you'd get very few debates since it'd come down to axiomatic disagreements).

My understanding of it has always been "you can't use force of any kind, even to enforce agreements or laws." (Since laws are just agreements writ large, that makes sense.) I've spoken to one or two advocates of the theory, although I suspect they may not have been the most knowledgeable about it, because as soon as I started asking about tragedy of the commons they had no answer.

Could you answer a couple immediate questions for me, and point me to some good resources? ("Read the Wikipedia references; they're a good start" is a fine answer if true.)

In an anarchist society where there is no state or private property, how do you:

- Motivate people to do unpleasant jobs?
- Prevent tragedy of the commons?
- Deny pyromaniacs the right to burn things down?
- Build anything that requires significant capital and/or extends far from people's homes, like a transcontinental railway?
- Defeat the Dunbar number?

EDIT: Note that I'm talking about real-world-style societies made up of real-world-style people, not ones with post-scarcity or "super-rational / super-intelligent people" advantages.

It makes sense in a setting like Eclipse Phase, where infrastructure that carries both resources and information is so efficient and universally accessible that it's easy for people to organize intelligence effectively without government coercion.

Where the interesting political drama comes in for anarchism, at least for me, is the fact that the society admits that every "law" is just an arbitrary decision by the citizens. Even if there is some semblance of law enforcement, criminal trials could be decided by popular vote rather than judges and juries. It's an environment where tribalism can easily take hold, which can make for interesting conflicts.

** I think there is space to write a compelling story around international politics and The Security Dilemma.

Lots of work has been done on this area in the study of international politics but basically it explains how 2 or more states (led by rational actors) can reduce their overall security (through the increased threat of conflict) by attempting to increase their own security.

For example, the USA is worried about the USSR so it moves some ships a bit closer to Russia and/or builds a missile shield. The USSR sees this as an aggressive move and so responds in kind...boom escalation.

Couple of key things the theory relies on which could become good story elements are:

- All weapons can be used offensively, ie there is no such thing as a 'shield'.
- A lack of perfect communication and understanding of the intentions of other states
- The risk of believing your own propaganda about another state (eg, those 'dirty commies, you cant trust them').
- The fact that if you don't respond to another states actions it can leave you in a position of weakness.

Wish I could write fiction worth a damn, but I think someone else might be able to do something interesting with this central dilemma in politics.
