Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I want to talk, briefly, about ergonomic considerations for fantasy worlds with multiple species.

There's a [[https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html][great article on "the flaw of averages"]] I'd recommend checking out that's all about how the Air Force switched from making things for the "average in every way" man to making things that adjust on multiple metrics to men within a fairly wide range around average.

Assuming that technology and society are far enough along in the fantasy world, eventually people will start having some inkling that design considerations need to take different races into account (and even if that's not a consideration, it's something that authors can/should think about as part of how a foreigner interacts with local culture).

With a wide(r) range of body types for multiple kinds of humanoids, if you're designing (say) seats on a train, or beds in a hotel, you need to take into account a lot more variable, either by making things adjustable to the specific needs of the person using it or making it sufficiently generic that /anyone/ can use it. The former is expensive, while the latter sacrifices comfort/efficiency.

So what would this look like in practice? Because of variable width, chairs would be less likely to have arms and bench seating would be more common. Because of variable height, doors and ceilings would probably be built to accommodate the tallest humanoid, and seating would also need to account for people with very long (or very short) legs -- booster seats would probably help a bit, but it's not a full solution. Variable /weight/ means that things are engineered to the upper end, unless the society in question is fine with just saying "no rock monsters".

I'd really like to see a fantasy novel dealing with some aspect of compliance with fantasy ADA compliance -- maybe a backwards kingdom that's being brought into the international community and needs to bring their government buildings up to code. The analogy to real-world disabilities might be a little too on-the-nose though. Also, I'm not sure how you'd pitch it to potential readers.

(This all gets a lot more complicated when you start introducing non-humanoids into the mix, naturally.)

*** For trains used by the less affluent, there would have to be a standard of some sort. There can't be much downtime between stops or the company running the train would lose revenue, so they can't have much in the way of customization unless it can be done quickly on an individual basis. Most likely there would be standards and norms in place to accommodate as many people as possible while some ethnic groups may be shafted if size and other factors necessitate drastic changes.

Another way around those issues would be race based train cars. Daandle-Trens have a very specific sitting posture that necessitates vastly different seating situations from humans else they get extremely violent. So a company that has railways that service both the Imperium and the Daandle Collective would have passenger cars that would hold either Daandle-Trens or humans. The Daandle-Cre while at a higher average height to humans have a rather similar sitting posture so the Daandle-Imperium Express would seat humans and the Daandle-Cre in mixed-race cars thus lowering costs.

*** In addition to adjustability, I'd expect Fantasy-Diversity-Act-compliant companies to be focused on modularity, to be adjustable on a macro level.

So if you advertise your hotel as "All races^{\}within) ^{the "23 most common races" Imperial list, Elder Dragons not included\}) welcome", you're gonna have equipment and procedures to be able to refit your rooms for specific races. So you'll have a few titanium beds with synthetic moss in store for the occasional Rock Monster client; a few low tables and chairs for when a Dwarven scribe congregation books; and since storing every different configuration of furniture is expensive, low-cost inns probably have "you either book in advance, pay premium, or get the one-size-fits-all service (or no service at all)" race-dependent policies; eg Goblins who don't book ahead get the uncomfortable one-size-fits-all solution, Volcanic Elemntals who don't book ahead often get no service because the inn has no heat-proof bed and chairs in store.

** Sorry about the wall of text ahead, but I'd really appreciate your thoughts on this magic system I'm designing and the way it would affect society and technological development.

The magic itself is everywhere. Anyone can do it, and it has the same effects regardless. Essentially what it does is imbue items that you've made with magical power. The more you worked on the item from the beginning of its crafting to its end, the more power the finished item will have. This also means that items that take longer to make end up with more power because of the additional time spent working on them. You can use someone else's creation, but it will be roughly half as effective as it would be in its maker's hands. In addition, time spent on the upkeep of an item counts towards the imbuing of the item with power but is about half as effective as the actual process of creation is. Maintaining an item that was not yours can eventually make it 100% effective again.

There are three stages to the magic imbued into things, and for the purpose of explaining, I'm going to use the example of a sword. The first is the strengthening of Physical Traits: hardness, sharpness, flexibility, etc... It simply makes the item qualitatively better. The second stage is Conceptual Traits. In this example, the sword you're making a sword has reached the amount of time necessary to start changing its Conceptual Traits and you make the sword embody the Concept of Cutting. This could take many forms depending on the mindset of the creator. For instance, a sword that is meant to cut should be able to cut regardless of length, so the cutting edge of the blade begins to extend beyond the edge of the sword. Or perhaps instead, the maker feels the sword should be able to cut regardless of the armor of what is being struck so it becomes better able to slash through armor with little resistance. The third stage is the one I'm having the most difficulty with, but it has to do with Platonic Ideals. Basically, at this stage the sword becomes the Ideal of its Concept. The Ideal Cutting Sword would do basically anything that different creators could have done to a lesser degree with their Conceptual changes, but at the same time, it requires the creator to shift their mindset to each usage as it comes.

The reason I'm having difficulty with that is because it simply seems too powerful to really be practical in any setting, but then again the amount of time necessary to make something that realizes an Ideal rather than just strengthening Concepts is ridiculously long. As soon as you start making an item, you can begin to change its physical traits, but the effects become stronger the more you do. At roughly a hundred and fifty hours, you can begin to change Concepts, and again, the effect strengthens the more you work on it. At roughly four thousand hours, the item begins to change from a Conceptual item to an Idealized one, but the process is very gradual and is done by layering Concepts on the item.

What would a society in which this magical system has always been existent look like? I'm envisioning one in which there is even more of a power divide between the rich and the poor because the rich can spend their time and money on crafting more magical items whereas the poor must spend a more significant portion of their time on trying to survive. By having the disposable time and income to dedicate to the project, the rich ensure that they will always have the most effective magical items, which in turn makes their social status solid.

However, the world could also turn out more idealized than that other prediction. A farmer who has created their own tools and maintained them for their whole life could feasibly feed a much greater number of people proportionally to their efforts. This could create a population boom, a technological revolution, a literal revolution, etc... as many booms in agriculture have done in the past.

Which do you think is more likely? What seems broken about this magic system?

**** It depends mostly on the quality of the item itself. The process of attuning an artifact to yourself works best when you're fixing damage to it rather than just shining it and oiling it every night. Any of the best items that stand the test of time are going to be items that had durability as one of the physical attributes that were enhanced, or were made of very good quality materials in the first place and so won't need as much intensive maintenance.

That being said, it also takes more time to attune to an artifact the more magic has been imbued in it so while it is possible to obtain and bond with an Ideal level item, it would take a very long time. It's probably still better than making one yourself from a time spent perspective just because you get to use an already powerful item while attuning it, but given that the high level fights in this setting would basically turn into a battle of concepts and ideals anyways, there is a sort of upper level power cap. IE is your Ideal Cutting Sword better than my Ideal Defensive Body Armor. Or even, is your visualization of what the ideal cutting force looks like better than my visualization of the ideal blocking force.

*** Well, my first thought about this was what happens with art, what happens when you use tools that you've spent time on, what happens when you scrap it and start ove with the stake materials and the same idea or theme, and how does this affect things like farmland, buildings, plants, and animals? Farmers spend all day, everyday taking care of their farms, and this can be extended to anything on a farm, from a grove to individual fruit tress, strains of plants, the farmland itself, etc.

If things can get conceptual, and it applies to things like land and living things, you get into mythic territory, where you've got a pomegranate tree that improvising you in someone's domain, fruits of knowledge, etc.

**** Hmm I hadn't thought about the effect on plants or animals, but in regards to the art, it would really depend on what the artist intended. If the artist wanted to elicit an emotional response, or evoke beauty, then the painting would change to reflect that.

The idea I had to represent that was an autobiographical account handwritten by a narcissistic. He's writing his life's story to try and convince people to believe him more, and when they read his handwritten copy of the book, or he reads it aloud to people, they do.

I'll have to think about what kinds of effects could be applied to plants and animals though because that could change things as well. Like a horse you raised by hand and helped deliver could be the next Pegasus.

***** I don't think a single generation could make Pegasus, but would instead take a couple of generations at least. Even then, it would probably be a seven league horse rather than one that flies, or otherwise one very well adapted for the environment that bred it.

Have you read of Ars Longa, Vita Brevis? In the same way, it might be diffcult to make something capable of granting immortality, it might take generations to store enough magic, but it would happen. After that, it would just take a society putting in enough literal man hours to get it spread around, or even less if it's a plant or animal.

I think that your world would tend to the mythic, with gods and monsters (escaped Pegasi?).

Actually, poor people would have an advantage over the wealthy, since they have to spend so much time maintaining stuff. Knives, fires, there's this thing called perpetual stew, where you just keep adding whatever's on hand to the pot so you don't starve, bread starters, people who make their bed are technically maintaining it, laundry and clothing repair, there's a bunch of things poor people do that rich people don't bother with and that poor people have to.

I think farmers would imbue magic for harvest, hardiness, nutritiousness, and other things like that. Medicine men, wise women, priests, shamans, etc. would go for potency and efficacy.

Edit: If the performance of a piece has the same effect as the piece, then bards are a thing.

More abstractly, nobles would work on their persona, image, bearing, etc. Nobles would work on their makeup style.

A fighting style can gain conceptual effects.

****** The problem is, I'm not really sure I want the magic to be transferable. So even if plants or animals can be imbued, I wouldn't want it to be something transferable to their next generation. By that same logic, then raising a child would be imbuing them with magic and humanity as a whole would grow stronger magically over time which just seems incredibly inelegant as a solution. I think It's probably easier to just say that in the constraints of this system, living things cannot be imbued.

There could definitely be workarounds, such as a field that's been worked on for generations that has the imbued Concept of Growth and therefore crops in the field grow faster.

You definitely bring up a lot of interesting points as to what is imbuable and what is not that would have some interesting ramifications on my setting that I'll have to think about, so thanks for that!

******* Alternatively: people's inate magic calls other peoples magic a bitch and kicks it out of it's house. Alternately, anything that has a mind does the same.

Alternately, the difference between imbuable things and unimbuable things is ownership. Someone owns themself on a fundamental level that plants don't, and magically speaking that animals don't.

/Alternately,/ in the same manner that your bards charm person spell is in some ways inherent to him, animal/plant bloodline magic is reset with each new generation. I think that might be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how your system works, but I think that it would work, since otherwise bards could use 7000 year old battle hymns to cast opposing armies into illusory worlds or summon literal gods.

******** Between the two of those, it's more to do with innate magic rejecting other people influencing it, but then again I could change my mind later depending. There's a lot to think about.

In regards to martial arts and musical performances, I think the reason I'm not going to let the power creep on those get out of hand is going to have to do with the minor differences. There's always going to be differences between people's actions whether it be from their understanding of how to do something (like how some guitarists do some weiiiird finger transitions to get to different chords) or from different body types making certain things need adaptation. That combined with the need for every user to adapt to the style before they can begin to infuse it with more power would mean that in-setting it would take a long time for the power of these things to increase appreciably.

*** This magic system reminds me vague of a book I once read, called "The Practice Effect"; wherein a planet is found where 'practice makes perfect' takes on a new meaning. The more you use a tool for its intended purpose, the better it gets at that purpose; thus, if one wants a /really good/ axe, one makes any old axe and uses it for hours and hours and watches it get better and better and sharper and sharper; city walls can be strengthened by beating on them with clubs (but not so hard as to actually smash them); and a sufficiently rich man will hire guards to stand at strategic points in his house, where they can appreciate the artwork and thus cause the artwork to practice being appreciated and thus keep the house looking nice.

--------------

Now, how does this translate to your setting? The first thing to come to mind is this - that /time spent creating/ is valuable. If I want a perfect sword, I can spend four thousand hours - or I can pay a local blacksmith (an /exorbitant/ amount) to spend four thousand hours on my behalf. Sure, it's less effective for me than it would be for him, but it's still as effective for me as something I would have spent two thousand hours on, plus, as a bonus, I didn't actually have to spend two thousand hours on it. (A /smart/ rich man will specifically request something that has /not/ had its Durability enhanced, so he can then work on enhancing the Durability himself and get a head-start on attuning it to himself).

--------------

But then there is also the question - what exactly is an object? Sure, a sword is easy to see as Improved in various ways - what about a farm? A kingdom? Or some sort of institution - is it possible for a Chief of Police who really throws himself into his work to create a patonically ideal police force (opposed, naturally, by a platonically ideal thieves' guild)? What happens to the rookie who joins one of these institutions - does officially joining the Ideal Thieves' Guild give one the power to instantly open any non-Ideal lock? Does a warlike King create a platonically ideal army, while a more economically-minded monarch creates a platonically ideal tax system?

**** Thinking about this further makes me think that rather than do a flat time-spent algorithm for everything, part of the limit to magic capacity should also be based on the quality of the materials used as well as the complexity of the item being built. It would do a lot to nip problems like exceptionally complex heirloom items in the bud while still allowing for more technological growth and progress.

As to what constitutes an item, I think it has more to do with the mental state of the creator than it does the actual 'itemness' of something. If the creator of something can conceive of it as a self contained thing then it would act as such. I also replied to someone higher up that I don't particularly want to allow for living things to be effected by this system because then we would get human beings who are inherently magical simply because of the time spent by their parents raising them. I think it's an easier solution to say that living things have an inherent energy that is incompatible with this kind of enhancement.

Institutions being imbued with energy is a really interesting concept because it sits in that weird middle between being a concept and being alive. An institution relies on a lot of moving parts to function which means there isn't really just one contributor to its success. I still haven't decided whether or not to allow for multiple contributors to an item, or if I do, how that would effect the strength and usage of the item in the end.

You raise some interesting questions that I'll definitely have to think about, so thanks for that!

- You can say the same about a clock. The man who makes a clock may also be the man who makes the mainspring, but he is unlikely to be the man who mines the metal.
- While it is true that many institutions are made by many people, it is nonetheless possible for one person to be the driving force behind an institution, to truly pour his heart into it.

...on the subject of clocks, here's another point to consider. A clock can clearly be an Ideal Clock (which I imagine is one that never needs winding and is always perfectly on time). But, surely, a mainspring can also be an Ideal Mainspring - what happens when the Ideal Mainspring is used (perhaps by someone else) as part of a clock? (What about adding to that Ideal Hands, the Ideal Clockface, and perhaps even the Ideal Cuckoo?)

**** Thanks for your criticisms! The point I started trying to make is satirizing the obsession we have with artisanally made goods, but it then evolved into an idea of a world in which the cottage crafting industry never really died out. We as a society value things that took an individual a lot of time to make even though it might not always be as good as a machined version of the same thing, so I wanted to make a hypothetical situation in which it's the other way around.

As far as the way I'm presenting it, yeah it is presented much like an RPG mainly because that's one of the ways I'm considering exploring this world: by running it as a quest on SV or SB. As it currently is, I'm not trying to capture the entire nuance of it but instead to present it in a way that could be easily understood.

However, your criticism that conceptual effects aren't as interesting as the visual or dynamic results of effects, I think I have to disagree with entirely. The presentation of the effects in prose is where readers would get the vast majority of the visual or dynamic effects regardless, but I think the magic system using concepts works primarily because it's dependent on the psychology of its users. The association cause and effect which is then subverted by a magical twist because of the mindset of the magic user.

I also think that not literalizing the model, while useful from an outside perspective, would not be as visible from within the system itself. Using ideals or concepts as the vehicle for which the item acts leaves a lot of room for interpretation and exploring the psychology of someone as they use it. I think this would both obfuscate a lot of the rules and demonstrate the way thought process affects or interaction with the world.

I hope this clarifies my thought process about the whole thing!

*** You mentioned it in your post, and I agree that an idealised item seems very broken, as anyone with enough time could create a killing sword, and if it takes all the minor ideals someone could come up with - well, bad things happen.

So what if, theoretically, the sword had to learn the new conceptual changes from interacting with others? This makes heirloom items have an interesting significance (as they become more powerful as they are handed down, and means older is better in this case) and also puts a pseudo cap on power. After all, why would you give your personal weapon that could kill you in a single blow to someone who may want to kill you. Even if the weapon becomes more powerful, there is a risk beyond putting your eggs in one basket. This means that powerful items are A, rarer, and B, more powerful if older.

The system on its own is actually really cool, I've haven't heard of anything like it. As for possible consequences, people will develop WMDs just a little earlier than expected. Bombs are an early invention after all, though by the looks of it, it would be a slow process. There may also be a different economic system, as the quality of mass produced items is objectively worse in a lot of cases, so there may be more artisans and such.

I could also see idealised artwork and literature creating interesting propaganda states, where posters on the walls are magically compelling if they are large and long-lasting.

**** I think the way I'm going to go about having a cap on power is something I mentioned to someone else further up, but basically limiting that amount of energy something can be imbued with by its complexity and the materials its made from. It seems the best solution to stopping ridiculously broken heirloom items being something people constantly stumble over.

You're definitely right about bombs becoming much more deadly much more quickly which is something that hadn't even occurred to me. Afterall, the Chinese invented gunpowder back in the 9th century which allows a lot of time to develop deadly weapons alongside this magic system.

In regards to idealized artwork and literature, it's difficult to quantify what sort of effects it could have since it entirely depends on the mindset of the creator, and even then has a lesser effect on other people because they're not wielding it in the same way. That being said, propaganda would certainly be more compelling under this system as well. Thanks for giving me some stuff to think about!

*** I realize I'm a bit late to this party, but have you figured out how magic will leave the system? If people are spending, say, 1 hour a day on average maintaining their non-magical stuff, you get a new conceptual item at a rate of about 1.2 x <world population> per year.

Now some of those will break down beyond repair eventually, but considering that magic items become more durable the longer they are around your setting will end up accumulating more and more magic over time.

A couple of solutions that occur to me is that magical items could lose their 'charge' the longer they've been sitting without maintenance, and/or the process of attuning a magical item to yourself makes it lose some of its 'charge'. With both, it would mean that even longstanding magical items that have been passed down through families without degrading due to time left alone would still not grow out of control whereas neglected items would eventually become magically inert.

** Hey!

Do you like /genocides/? Are you looking for a nice real-life setting to take inspiration from for you dystopic post-apocalypse settlement, with all the human right abuse, sexual exploitation and inescapable poverty that entails? Or do you just want to make yourself miserable for a whole week?

Then look no further than the Rohyngia genocide in Myanmar and the subsequent refugee crisis in Bangladesh! It has all the human misery, death and systemic injustice you could ever think of.

Anyway, I've just been studying this stuff for a presentation. It's pretty horrible (in one BBC interview, a Rohyngia said his people was like a football: everyone's kicking them); the gist of it is, they're an unrecognized ethnic minority in Myanmar; they've consistently been the victims of human rights violations for decades, and recently the Myanmar military has started a purge where tons of them have been tortured and killed, deported to Bangladesh, or put into what amounts to concentration camps. The Bangladesh government doesn't know what to do with them and is so far keeping them in overcrowded refugee camps (Bangladesh itself being one of the poorest, high-population density countries in the world), and is hoping that the UN will strong-arm Myanmar into accepting the refugees back (which is never, ever going to happen).

Point is, it's pretty good inspiration material if you want to write a Worm fanfic in post-Leviathan Brockton Bay or something.
