** God damn. I feel like I'm repeating myself every chapter release, but it blows me away how you consistently write such excellent chapters.

Cooldown: The conversation with Raven was very interesting. I don't think Juniper was in the wrong with his bloodthirstiness. I do like how Raven approached the conversation though. (Mostly. There is something to be said about her disrespecting his wishes for downtime, but I can understand why she wouldn't want it to fester.) Even if I don't think he did anything particularly wrong, it was worth talking about. I'm actually getting a little worried about Raven. I had wondered why she never put in the time to master a magic besides library magic, but to hear that she had and it had just been stripped from her is rough. I know loyalty is a bad metric and that she is an ell, but its also a little concerning how low her loyalty still is. I do think Juniper is making a genuine effort to connect with her, but most of the time it's just been a little off. That's the vibe I get.

I have less to say about Grak and Amaryllis. Juniper and Amaryllis continue to get along really well. It's interesting to see how they are meeting each other halfway. Juniper is putting more effort into being a better person and she is putting in the effort to be more empathetic and understanding. Good stuff. Grak is becoming scarily powerful. I'm not even sure how you'd counter him if you had too. (Short of something that's explicitly bs like Shia or a dragon.) A little worrying to see him question Juniper's sincerity these days. Its unfortunate that loyalty is always there in the background poisoning the well. In Grak's defense they almost certainly would have never become friends without it.

Coda I: Well. What a way to bait us before leading in to the upcoming horror. Honestly, I don't feel bad for Hyacinth. She brought every bad thing that happened to her on herself. Maybe there was an alternate path that would have prevented all of this, but I find it hard to believe. If she actually cared about Larkspur, then that path was ruined by him trying to actively hunt down and murder Amaryllis through brazenly illegal methods. Even worse they had abandoned Anglecynn with no plans to come back. Hyacinth actively dragged Amaryllis to Anglecynn then has the fucking gall to act like what happened is somehow their fault? Yarrow and Zinnia committed the greatest taboo on Aerb in an act of unprovoked aggression. Hells, Amaryllis tried to work out a deal with her. If Onion runs black sites like the one Juniper was put it is clear that he is just as guilty as the rest of them. I'd buy that he cares about his family, but it doesn't give him a pass for being so immoral. No. She gets some small amount of pity for the baby and that is it. If she hadn't been so brazenly self centered maybe she could have pulled her head out of her ass long enough to realize she is the architect of her own doom. (Not a knock on the writing, just my reasons why her guilt trip didn't work on me.)

And then Shia LaBeouf out of nowhere, but not actually because his existence was very cleverly reminded to the reader in the previous scene. Juniper handled him very well, its just a shame about the dragon who was also carefully foreshadowed. What a great way to end the chapter. The dread was palpable.

Coda II: I gotta say, the mental image of Shia with his arm buried in a gold dragon's eye was not one I expected to have today. Watching everyone pull out the big guns to fight him and seeing him just shrug it off was excellent. This story has a gift for engaging action scenes and its truly incredible how varied they can be. I'm surprised that the GM hasn't smacked down Juniper for unicorn bones yet. I know it is a limited resource, but its bailed him out of a lot of fights at this point. I'm expecting them to run out of bones, try and kill a unicorn for more then get it excluded. Either that or more opponents like Shia who have some ability to counter it.

Family: Damn. I liked Pallida. Rough for her to be gone so suddenly. (Of course she's not actually gone, but for the purposes of the time scales the story works with she is.) Not terribly emotional about Gemma for similar reasons that Juniper laid out. I think I covered my opinion on Hyacinth relatively well earlier. Good on them for killing Rosemallow. I'm worried about Amaryllis's emotional state, but Rosemallow always seemed like a dangerous ally. In retrospect meeting with her at all was a huge mistake from a loss of life perspective. From a personal power perspective I think this is probably one of the best possible outcomes for the group. Amaryllis's new virtue is bonkers. It is the perfect bonus for her and to some extent seems to be the DM accommodating the group's general distaste for politicking. I look forward to seeing where the story goes from here, and I wonder what tricks Blue in the Bottle has up his sleeve. (Assuming they still do that quest.) Probably some truly degenerate necromantic effects beyond even what we've already heard about him for it to be exclusion worthy.

  The conversation with Raven was very interesting
#+end_quote

It has a lot of parallels to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26687037][the conversation we see between Juniper and Tiffany in flashback]] where she's talking about him taking Arthur's death as an excuse to be self destructive and lash out.

#+begin_quote
  “I worry that you,” she stopped and bit her lip, “I worry there's a part of you that's sinking into it. It's ... well, my uncle, he has a CCW license, and the way he talks about maybe having to use it one day it's like you know that he's just high on this fantasy of getting to shoot someone to death.”

  “You think I wanted Arthur to,” die, but I couldn't get the word out. The words were coming out monotone anyway, devoid of the anger that I should have been putting behind them.

  “No,” said Tiff. “No, no no no, it's, the thing I'm trying to say is that it's like you're waiting to show people how much you're hurt. And I get that. I want to scream at them too, to ask how they can just keep carrying on when he's,” dead, she couldn't say it either, “gone. And I know that I was this, interloper, I wasn't his best friend, I know it's harder for you.” She was quiet for a while as she blinked back a fresh round of tears. “I'm worried that you're hurting, and there's something alluring about the pain, because it's a righteous, meaningful pain. I,” another sigh and a deep, steadying breath, “don't want you to keep going down this dark path.”
#+end_quote

But in that case he dismissed her as not understanding, but with Raven he's more open to it, which shows a degree of character development.

Good to see the companions noticing/calling him out on his behaviour. Interesting none made the connection to him manipulating his Spirit to remove pain that was discussed in the thread for the last set of chapters. Actually, did he ever tell them he did that?

*** My read would be that she considered the first stages of their conflict to be part of the standard "game" that the nobles play. Which has implicit rules on how much it is okay to escalate.

But Onion escalated it by kidnapping Juniper et al, (which she either wasn't part of planning, and Onion did it because he's a sociopath who considers "the game" beneath him. Or she considers it acceptable to use violence agaisnt a nobles minions, not them directly).

After that, from her perspective, June and Amy escalated by moving from a legal battle to a trial by combat that killed Onion with a figleaf of legality. Then they poisoned her and Phlox to cement their power. (Again escalation outside the accepted bounds) So she responded with the only weapon she had that matched that level

**** I disagree. I think Hyacinth is fairly representative of reactionaries throughout History, because she doesn't generalize ethics. I think the defining line for her character was, "we never would have done what we did if we'd known what you were." The only thing that her side ever respected was power. They'd have tried to kidnap, mindfuck, and kill without remorse. Power is something that is used against the less powerful, and it's better to destroy everyone than give it up. The other side is evil because they're the the other side, and thus anything is acceptable to destroy them.

Her side was already grossly violating the rules well before the group went back to Anglecynn. Onion already was using trial by combat against other people before she was even born. Larkspur was making deals with Doris Finch, which the text seems to imply she knew about. Her side sent paramilitary agents after Amaryllis, and she never shows having the slightest second thoughts after she found out about this.

Was Mary raised by the worst spider to perceive the world as a spider? The text repeatedly implies that Mary is over-cynical, seeing everything as a calculated act of manipulation. How many moments of "is this just an act?", and then reflexive self-doubt "why am I thinking it's just an act?", have we had?

Hyacinth claims that Onion and Larkspur had straightforward, authentic relationships. There's very little "playing the game" in personal interactions that gets revealed in the Anglecynn chapters. She's growing warmer to Joon, and I wonder if that's going to extend to her remaining cousins, too.

****** I think you're giving Hyacinth too much credit for meaningfully playing her own game here. Based on what we've seen in this update, it really seems like what we saw throughout the story from her was Hyacinth as manipulated by Rosemallow, as a member of Onion's (and Larkspur's) faction. She seems less like a pointlessly adversarial bitch and more like someone completely out of her depth. Not that she was a nice person, but I feel some amount of sympathy for her.

As people have pointed out already elsewhere in the thread, our views on Anglecynn's nobles come mostly through Amyrillis, who sees them all more or less as Rosemallow. And while there certainly seems to be truth in that perspective, Onion and Hyacinth at least seem to have been very much not that way. Being full time Machiavellian doesn't actually come naturally to (most) people. Our view on the lost king's court has been pretty one dimensional, until now, and now that we've seen the humanity in the den of vipers, I'm almost sad we probably won't see much more of them.

That said, I'm still 100% with Juniper. You can't take fighting a man named Onion seriously.

*** The optimal path against Hyacinth was assassinating her long ago. She had gone after them so many times with absolutely no provocation on their part, sicked dragons on them, ambushed a peace negotiation, plotted to have them kidnapped, tortured, soul screwed. There was no possible basis to work with her, and leaving her alive was leaving a dagger at their back -- a Surprise dagger as it turned out (a capability they knew she had). After fighting so long to keep Hyacinth alive for no real benefit, and massive downsides, Amaryllis suddenly kills Rosemallow despite it being much more practical for Rosemallow to stay alive and help them. I'm really not sure what that's supposed to mean about Amaryllis's character growth. Did she learn her lesson from Hyacinth? Does she just love her mom a lot more than she lets on to herself?

**** Rosemallow was inherently untrustworthy. Her background machinations helped escalate the conflict far beyond what the party was comfortable with and is the reason Hyacinth went off the deep end. Killing her was the smartest play considering Rosemallow murdered Amaryllis's mother who was her ally at the time.

That said I do agree that they should have assassinated Hyacinth. For all the moralizing certain members of the party did about Juniper's bloodthirstiness, it turned out one strategic murder would have saved a lot more lives. Though to be fair thats only easy to see in hindsight. I think considering the knowledge they had they made the best decisions they could.

From their perspective, Onion agreed to a trial by combat, and died after trying to kill them. He knew the risks when he went in; Hyacinth would have known that, and wouldn't have killed herself over it (even if she hated Mary and Joon for the rest of her life).

What pushed her over the edge was her unborn child being killed. She told them about it, but Mary and Joon didn't take it seriously because /they're not the ones who did it/, and it just didn't occur to them that someone else could have poisoned Hyacinth until it was too late.

From their perspective, they played completely fair, and they won. From Hyacinth's perspective, they killed her unborn child out of sheer pettiness after killing everyone else she cared about.

Her reaction to being told "Give up power, or we kill you" was to answer "Not going to do it, you need me too much".

I'm reminded of that Twig quote that goes "when you have an institution that's designed to breed cutthroats, every now and then you end up with someone who just can't stop cutting".

The pattern with the Penndraigs so far has been that they just can't stop themselves from backstabbing people, even when it's really damn clear it's going to get them killed.

Yarrow's reaction to being told by someone he knew had killed a kaiju (sitting next to one of Uther's knights) that they would kill him if he used his entad was to go "Meh, you don't go anywhere in life by listening to threats" and use the entad anyway.

I'm pretty sure if they'd let Rosemallow go, she would have been exactly the same. She would have kept pulling shortsighted, sociopathic grabs for power, no many matter how many times she got caught, no matter how much Joon threatened her, because in her mind /consequences are something that happens to other people/.

******* I think you are correct about Anglecynne, but I don't think Rosemallow is short sighted. She is very long sighted. She is the opposite of Hyacinth because she only backstabs with careful consideration of the long term consequences, whereas Hyacinth does it over and over, trying to salvage the failure of the last betrayal with an even higher stakes betrayal. Fully giving up the reigns would be giving up the game, something that Rosemallow apparently believes would lead to disaster. She believes that rationally Amaryllis knows she is worth way more alive than dead. Knows that she can prove her (medium term) good intentions / behavior to this uber soul mage, and figures that Amaryllis is negotiating. Amaryllis says "the offer on the table is..." Rosemallow refuses, and makes a counter offer. Amaryllis responds by killing her. I think Rosemallow didn't take Amaryllis's emotions regarding her mother into account, because Amaryllis should be very logical and optimal like Rosemallow is, like Rosemallow trained her to be. So I suspect Rosemallow would have been the perfect ally, while very carefully building a lot of contingencies to betray them, that might or might not have ever been triggered.

In a past career I worked on nuclear power plants, and around strategic weapons. Part of making sure bad things don't happen is making sure you don't have single points of failure, if one thing fails you still have plans that work around it and procedures to bypass it, or alternate sources. Onion and the Aunt are almost single points of failure for their competing systems (As an aside I'm really looking forward to finding out what thier fundamental disagreement is or if the are just allusions to our own tribal politics hard power/soft power dichotomy) and Mary has shown us the while corrupt and a nest of vipers the lost kings court is a mostly competent bureaucracy, so I don't expect soul hacking someone would be much more effective than a humint source, those are very damaging but are also something that is actively worked against.

TLDR I think even if you make the modifications permanent Soulraping is too much of a known quantity for the lost kings court not to have active measures in place. They'd inevitably get caught. Besides from a general transhumanist perspective: it's mindcrime.

I'm not sure irreversible is the right term, but it's pretty clear that Hyacinth was truly grieving over Larkspur's death and wanted the simple truth about his death from Amyarillis in the Mirror Room ( Chapter 185). After A. refuses to acknowledge her part in it, H. leaves to sic Yarrow and Zinnia on Joon, Raven, and Pallida in the Prince's Room (Chapter 180).

Additionally, if Amyarillis and Joon had spoken earnestly after the trial (Chapter 193), somewhere private as she asked, perhaps Hyacinth wouldn't have unleashed ACSLB.

When she left she found out that it had gone disastrously wrong which is why she rushed back in the room to make a hasty deal. It's also why she desperately argued to prevent Amaryllis leaving the room to find out what she had done. The whole "deal" fiasco was done in bad faith by her the entire time.

While it works emotionally, there in Chapter 185:

" If Raven was here, now, walking into the Hotel Delzora, then when had the enemy action in the Prince's Room happened? It must have been during the meeting, but when? The obvious answer was that it had happened when Hyacinth had stepped out, or been precipitated by something she'd said to someone on the outside, but that meant that she'd made a contract in a hurry because they had been trying to kill Juniper in the other room"

Hyancinth's emotional state after the trial is similar to that in the Mirror Room. More bitter obviously, but I think there was still a chance at that point of straight dealing with her and avoiding the nuclear cannibal.

In the Mirror Room chapter: "Hyacinth arrived in the Mirror Room after not too much time had passed, late, but only fashionably so." This to me indicates Yarrow/Zinnia were already in the room with Juniper's group before Hyacinth ever entered the Mirror Room. To my mind Hyacinth never really cared about making a deal and the whole thing was just a pretense to soulfuck the party and turn them on Amaryllis while she was away from them.

******** That's an understandable interpretation. That said, this story has a history of unreliable narration so I'm not going to place too much stock in Amaryllis's immediate guess about what happened when she still wasn't even sure what had happened. I actually agree that Team Juniper made a disastrous mistake. I just disagree about when and where it happened. I think Hyacinth had this image in her head of them all being patsies of Rosemallow and treated them as such. It's why when Amaryllis appeared to accept her deal it caught her off guard as much as it did. Then when the party went and met with Rosemallow it to Hyacinth confirmed all the awful assumptions she had about them. At that point she decided to go full hostile and created a meeting in bad faith because in her opinion Team Juniper were already bad faith actors as well.

With all that said, I still think Hyacinth is a self centered fool. Her life would have been so much easier and better if she had never intentionally dragged the party back into a country they wanted nothing to do with. I don't have much pity for her even if she had some misguided ideas about what kind of people she was dealing with.

*** Larkspur is explicitly mentioned early on by the people trying to kill Amaryllis in the Risen Lands, but they don't meet Larkspur until Chapter 38, immediately after going to Cranberry Bay. It's possible that a different path of action early on could have avoided him, or other quests could've come first, which could've changed the nature of the conflict. In Chapter 37, to address the Rat Rot and Soul Magic concern, they were also considering heading to Quills and Blood or Caledwich- Larkspur could've still tracked them down due to Doris Finch/the elf reserve, but maybe Caledwich would've meant standing for trial rather than getting into a firefight. Somethings would've gotten worse, others would've gotten better.

Furthermore, that's just for meeting him. There are a good dozen chapters between when they meet him and when they kill him, including the chapter where they come up with exclusion zones and potential quests. Because Juniper keeps pushing it off, I'm always curious as to what quests/storylines would've been in play if they'd done 'They Say You Can't Go Home Again' or 'Straddling Worlds' early since they were seemingly earlygame quests. Assuming rat rot and boneitis are constants, once Amaryllis' rat rot was cleared, there were a lot of chain of events that could've led to picking up soul magic. 43 is when they get a bunch of quests, including Kuum Doona. 57 is the start of the next major quest after Larkspur, breaking Fallatehr out, but breaking him out early would've changed things, let alone being able to come to a temporary agreement with him.

For the point of no return, I think handling the final conversation better (with empathy) would've helped, and even summoning the Cannibal someplace secluded might've actually been better for Joon and Mary. It's the little things that add up. More realistically, it was probably when Rosemallow killed Hyacinth's unborn child.

** [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dnp2ne/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_172176/f5zhygw/][A while back]], I thought Mary had taken to the bible because of endings and beginnings, alphas and omegas, but really biblical themes pervade the entire overarching narrative: creation, the problem of evil and allowance of suffering, the apocalypse, finding faith in an imperfect world, redemption, the promises of the one true God, and [possibly spoilery theory] a sacrifice of the son of "God", who also /is/ God. Where Mary's gone faithful (which is quite rational with theistic proof), Joon's taking the Übermensch approach.

Joon continues his streak of either stomping his foes or getting stumped.

Stupid anagram: Maritally His Ms

'di era' means you, right?

It would not surprise me in the slightest if Joon kept his one leg, at least for a while. He seemed very confident that Solace would fix them up "better than before" - just like she did for Grak, but Druidism doesn't always work on proven certainties.

Not to mention that she /already/ fixed the missing bones in his leg just a short while ago, and both she and the Locus are going through shit.

** I'm just sitting around and wondering how much Rosemallow influenced the story.

We had Amaryllis get Zone'd in a rushed trial for nonserious crimes, at which point everyone sent to deal with her dies and she starts popping up all over the place.

The reason WHY she got Zone'd is probably the same reason Larkspur was trying to kill her; Rosemallow. As she was raised as Uther's direct descendant by Rosemallow with hilarious inherited power, wealth and directed education she was intended to be an extremely useful tool to change Anglecynn.

With limited information (and poor memory) we have the Phlox/Onion faction doing these things to oppose Rosemallow. Joining the Host, talking to Larkspur, Hyacinth or Onion would've potentially led to different routes.

Then Juniper and company blunder into Anglecynn, cozy up with Rosemallow kill Onion and accidentally drop a dragon on the seat of government. Valencia, if applied, would've been able to diplomance. Instead Amaryllis went and found out her mom sucked.

TLDR; Rosemallow won because she killed Amaryllis's mom, she lost because she raised Amaryllis.

From the perspective of someone else (like larkspur) there's no reason to think that Amaryllis is anything but totally loyal to Rosemallow (her substitute mother who trained her to be a political player). Sure she didn't stop her getting dropped into the exclusion zone, but she then almost immediately escaped, coincidentally picking up a bunch of powerful artifacts and allies in the process. If you don't know what Juniper is it seems like an obvious setup

So everything where she is trying to get away from Anglecynn can be read as the Rosemallow faction building up an independent powerbase outside the control of the normal Anglecynn political system. Which is a scary thing.

Yeah, going with the Aerb as therapy theory, my guess about the next step is how he deals with being in a position of power over others (while earlier arcs were him dealing with equals).

So far (with the guards and onion) he seems to have relished the power somewhat sadistically. Now that he has all the power of Anglecynn at his back, on top of his ridiculously powerful combination of magics, he has to start making decisions where he has all the power about how he'll treat people now.

So I think Fel Seed's power would prove useless against the Actual Cannibal (unless he is Uther and knows the trick).

** Quite the conclusion to the book!

Juniper has been seriously injured on plenty of occasions and promptly restored by his leveling ability.

That said, aspects of the interaction between the soul and level ups have already been presented to us ("Boneitis" quest). And for symmetrical limbs he can copy from the other side. I wonder how that plays into his prosthetic. His soul will be the template used upon his next level. If the prosthetic is that great, maybe his soul shouldn't have the leg either.

As for the injury to Amaryllis, that was unprecedented. At a few points in the chapter Juniper did something deserving experience, but never enough to level. That doesn't apply to anyone else. A more enduring consequence.

Next: clones. As described, the clones wouldn't be able to use entad prosthetics. That might also be a constraint on the nature of the restoration/replacement, an argument for healing rather than any alternatives. Otherwise the clones couldn't make as many public appearances. On the other hand, the fact that clones can think and plan and write is hugely valuable in its own right in a rational(ist) story. Think of all the science.

Giving the information that she has to the Hells seems like it might instigate some problems down the line.

Given the situation it seems possible that at least one member of the Court wasn't caught in time either way, so I suppose knowledge of an Uther candidate is going to filter through to them and they definitely have the nuance to put two and two together with their own problems.

** Often with an antagonist there is the question of what motivates them. Why are they opposed to the hero of the story, why do they do what they do? Sometimes the audience's ability to discern said motivations is of lesser or greater importance to an author, and will be made correspondingly more or less explicit to the reader through the narrative.

There is a common refrain, not just in writing but in social psychology, that "no one thinks of themselves as the villain in their own story," and many authors will take great care to abide by that axiom. Even if they never spell it out for the reader, they themselves will usually have a good handle on why their characters do the things they do.

So with that, let's talk about dearly departed (or is she?) Rosemallow. Firstly, I don't believe any rule of writing is ironclad (particularly not the one I've just articulated, which I don't believe to be true, anyway). My favourite novel of all time is /Blood Meridian,/ and Cormac McCarthy doesn't even give a damn about punctuation therein. With that context, I'm noting that what I type here is not a criticism, as such, but rather an observation.

Rosemallow appears to be utterly inhuman. She seems concerned only with power qua power. Her motivations are not only opaque to the reader but perhaps to herself. Maybe she no longer has actual motivations beyond the accumulation of influence, the security of her position, and the ability to hinder or harm her enemies. Mary put it better than I could, in 195, anyway:

#+begin_quote
  “You talk about that like it matters,” replied Amaryllis. “As though there were any policy you wouldn't budge on, any tenet of faith that represented a line that could not be crossed. As though you even had a coherent memeplex.”
#+end_quote

Her entire life is bent to political machination, such that she comes across more machine than not. Reading her admitting to her crimes, and reading June seeing her murder an osentensible friend in Amy's mother for barely more reason than that the opportunity arose . . . was disconcerting. And fascinating. However, her lack of humanity, in a word, did simply make her less interesting than Hyacinth's more personal vendetta, at least to me.

I think, all said, I will be sad to see the back of the human cast of antagonists in Anglecynn and their maneuvering. Although that may be an almost ironic label to give Rosemallow and her ilk. I've found that throughout WTC all the most gripping conflicts have been those where June and fellows have been pit against other people in tense, dramatic stand-offs moreso than when he's up against some Tarrasque-esque force of nature.

Particularly Everett and co., Fireteam Blackheart, that fight against Raven, Fallatehr, or the recent string of all of Mary's relatives. Less so Mome Rath or the Cannibal, who, speaking of, did live up to the hype. He's been a narrative sword of Damocles since his introduction and he delivered in terms of raw power.

Anyway, I've now rambled on in a couple directions for far too long. Book 8 definitely delivered in terms of hyped climax from everything after Yarrow and Zinnia came on stage.

*** In terms of the cannibal, I was a little let down that the solution was revealed in a sort heavy handed manner exactly as he showed up. As far as I know this had zero foreshadowing.

But that is a relatively minor gripe. i really like how the story implies the Dungeon Master lost control of the story, just as real dungeon masters do. The power up to Grak feels planned and story relevant. The power up to amaryllis feels a lot like the Dungeon Master apologizing to his PCs for letting his storylines get all garbaged up. Like he told his players "sorry this gaming session was an unrewarding shit show, here's a massively powerful buff to get rid of all this accumulated nonsense I've saddled you guys with in the story."

In general, I have been half-thinking that Shia LaBeouf would not show up at all just because any method of defeating him would almost seem cheaply earned. There's also the issue that in a world that runs (for June anyway) as rather Harder fantasy (in terms of crunchy-ness) he's a very Soft monster, if you catch my drift, in that he simply operates 'by horror movie rules' and is basically unstoppable.

As to the DM, he's probably one of my favourite characters, but I imagine those chapters are a bitch to write. He gives me a sort of vaguely /The Seventh Seal/ vibe.

From a purely utilitarian standpoint, if it serves the purpose of maximizing utility then it is not evil. However, as far as I know just about no one seriously holds a purely utilitarian standpoint, and with good reason. The idea that one person's political power can be synonymous with utility also seems deeply, delusionally flawed. But I wonder if Rosemallow would even rationalize things to herself that way, by the end, or whether she didn't bother in her own head. As you said, she seemed in certain ways more device than person as a character.

** These chapters were a lot of fun especially in how some of the foreshadowing paid off (the big fight). I was just as surprised as juniper at the dragon appearing.

I'm disappointed in the interactions between amaryllis and Juniper except probably the end of Family. It felt like there was very little romantic tension between them. Also there were a couple points where it looked like Mary was disappointed in Juniper, especially after the court battle and the actual battle.

***** Yeah. It traces back to Amaryllis feeling like she is being left behind by Joon and the gang back in the Time-Chamber pregnancy arc.

Right now Raven can give Joon similar protocols and opsecs that she developed owing to her experience with the Endless Library and Uther and being really old, Grak is becoming OP and is close to being the best in the world in what he does, Bethel is OP, Valencia is better at social stuff than her, and the Locus/Solace provide what anything is missing in between them.

Add to that what Amaryllis got for her virtue doesn't really help her in contribute something new to the party. It helps the narrative stay away from blah, blah, blah, politics and planning but those are her strong suit. She feels set aside. Its probably why she wasn't as excited as Joon expected her to be.

Love is helping her hide the crime by mutilating her aunt's corpse and leave it with victims of an Actual Cannibal.

Strangest romance ever but I love every bit of it. Still ship Juniper with everyone and everything especially Bethel. 'Cause I could and I will.

*** I don't think that schloss can apply to anything Earth / Juniper D&D group related, and the paper bag is definitely that.

Anyone who Googled the ACSLB rule-page (I did only because I honestly didn't believe it existed, it sounded like such a ridiculous premise for a campaign that I was sure Joon made it up) saw this coming as soon as Joon said he "had a potential solution", a long time ago.

Can't seem to find the chapter though, it was a throwaway comment so I can understand why people think the solution was too meta and came out of nowhere.

“I am,” I said. “I mean, I just don't think ... for my purposes, I don't need to actually kill him, just incapacitate him for a bit, and I don't think that I can just stick a bag over his head.”

“A bag?” asked Pinno.

“Long story,” I said.

** Wow, what an ending to the book.

I'm worried about possible blowback from killing the dragon. Seems like the Draconic Confederacy won't take that easily and it might affect the Bluebeard quest.

Two big new companion abilities. We didn't see much of Grak's, but we already got a sneak-peak of Amaryllis's with Simaryllis.

Speaking of Grak, it felt like ages since we had had a scene with him. It was nice to finally have a conversation between him and Juniper.
