Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So, mostly trolling, but despite the whole thing being mindless happy fluff and nearly all the side characters holding giant idiot balls nearly all the time... I hereby declare this season's "Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle" anime is, in fact, rational fiction.

Hear me out:

- MC makes full use of her (initially few) abilities and inherent properties of the world, up to and including death not being permanent, to experiment with and learn about her environment and expand her options

- Although MC is not very knowledgeable, and some "facts" others have taught her are blatantly incorrect, she tests her knowledge and learns from her tests

- MC has goals which, although not aligned with commonly accepted human morality, are consistent and well defined

- MC directly, ruthlessly, relentlessly exploits all objects and sentients in her environment and properties of it to achieve her goals

** I'm taking a leave of absence from school until classes are in-person again. I spent the 7 years before law school working remotely, and a big part of the reason that I went back to school was for the human interaction. Zoom classes are both significantly lower quality and completely fail to satisfy the human interaction component that I desired.

There are plenty of logical reasons to take a leave of absence, and I'll be working on a really interesting startup during my leave -- but it still feels a bit like I'm wimping out/giving up. This pandemic sucks.

*** I'm about to start grad school in January and wish I could defer for another semester, but I have $3,000 in non-refundable tuition deposits and $60k in grants saying no. I'm hoping to milk every last util out of online classes in the spring, and that vaccines will roll out fast enough that I can be on campus with some semblance of normalcy in fall '21.

Glad you figured out an alternative, and I hope you get back to school sooner than later.

*** This pandemic does suck. I'm now recognizing that I was way too emotionally biased against the idea of taking a gap year between high school and college. If I could do this year over again, I'd defer enrollment.

** u/Roxolan:
#+begin_quote
  There is a story that the Powers tell, that the scientific world began when the angel Za'afiel smote the Earth. It was before humans were around, or at least, they were in Eden, but the dinosaurs were there, and one of them defecated on or near an angel.

  And so Za'afiel smashed the Earth.

  And the Earth couldn't just say, “That wasn't my fault.” Because whenever you say that something isn't your fault, what you're really saying is, that /could/ be my fault. Maybe. There's something there. Maybe I'm just an ugly and broken enough world, what with dinosaur digestive issues and all, that I deserve K-T extinction events.

  So instead it did things one better, and said: of course I don't deserve that, because /there's no such thing as deserving/.

** I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/jycuyj/received_these_emails_backtoback_this_week_no/][graduated last week]] and will be starting my first "almost-real big-boy" job next Tuesday! Have a good few projects to choose from, none of which I'm really familiar with, so lots of learning & exciting times ahead. Does anyone here have any hot beginner tips & tricks for new postdocs? Also, if anyone here's a programmer or data scientist -- those are my main fallbacks in case academia doesn't work out -- so I'd be keen to hear how best to make myself more attractive to those industries these next 1-3y (anthropology grad... [[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k08ei9/recent_anthropology_grad_w_little_formal/][more details here]]).

Otherwise, today is Black Friday, which despite its US origins has become something of an international holiday. Are you buying anything? I made a list of things I'd like to get in case there are any good sales:

- a lightweight, portable laptop, ideally <14" w/ non-soldered storage and memory, with 8c/16t, able to dual boot into windows / linux (i.e. good driver support), or maybe a macbook pro

- a graphics card capable of gaming at 4K/60Hz on "high" settings in recent titles, with freesync support, and also decent at graphical computing in a pinch -- maybe a used Turing or an in-stock Big Navi / Ampere

- a tablet to read articles / books on, maybe the 4th gen 13" iPad Pro, or one of the 13" e-ink screens

- a telephoto zoom lens for my camera -- the Sigma 100-400mm E-mount being my top desire atm

- a decent road bike, to upgrade my 7 year old $150 hybrid for commuting

- moar weights (both DBs and Plates) and an incline bench, for lifting purposes with gyms closed in the indefinite near-term

Probably not gonna get all of those this year even, but keeping my eye out for deals (mostly through the weekend -- going hiking in a low-service area today) and trying not to get too much random shit (which I've already failed, having bought a bunch of whey and a Kindle Oasis, the latter of which will mostly get used for reading stuff off here). Anyone here looking for anything in particular?

**** I think software compatibility would be my biggest concern, especially also wrt comparability with as-yet-uncertain security (e.g. medical confidentiality) software. Otherwise I'm “professionally” most familiar with the macOS ecosystem, since it's also what most of my colleagues use and what I've used historically (e.g. the bash shell, Xcode... there are workarounds, sure, but I like the “native” support, since otherwise I've used hackintoshes the last 5 or so years and the tinkering can occasionally be a headache). Plus the build quality and aesthetics are nice lol :) and I wouldn't be using it for any heavy lifting, that would all be outsourced to clusters, so budget-wise I'd be shooting for the ~$1k range anyway. On top of that, one can take advantage of occasional promos, e.g. Best Buy and Target are currently giving you a $20 gift card with the purchase of a $100 apple gift card, effectively ~17% off if you shop at either store. But yes, going back to Linux is certainly on the table!

***** If you need work-issued spyware on your laptop (as I do, and many others as well), they need to either buy/reimburse the laptop or provide you with one. If an employer demands that you both provide a laptop that you paid for and that you install oversight software on it, I hope you are aggressively looking for a new employer and triple-checking your contract and benefits, because that kind of toxicity is always systemic/structural.

Xcode is very nice but VSCode is perfectly fine, zsh is zsh is zsh, etc.

*Do not* get one of the new M1-chip macs as a developer. The fact that it doesn't run Docker or Homebrew is basically immediately disqualifying.

****** Ah, true --- I should ask if we can rent something through work, I think I'm just a bit shy to ask (and my new PI is around two orders of magnitude better funded than my old one, so presumably has room in the budget for computer hardware)! Though having one of my own would be nice for side projects and other personal use, and I do so like shiny toys...

I have heard to steer clear of the new macs though, with their recent vertical integration / new CPU architecture, at least for a generation or three. Would maybe even go for the 2015 13” MBP --- had one up until the start of this year, when a student stole it while my back was turned lmao

******* I have known dozens upon dozens of fresh-faced young postdocs and grad students, and almost every single one was "a bit too shy to ask" for this or that, or didn't think it was a big enough deal to bring up.

*Ask anyway*. Your job is a job. You exchange your labor for money; they exchange money for your labor. None of your money or capital goes into the job, and none of your personal time goes into the job.

If your PI wants you to supply your own computer, it's your computer, and they don't get to dictate what you do with it or what software you install on it.

(This has been your intro-level Pastarant about academia's broken expectations of postdocs/graduate students. Don't even get me started about working hours. Just say no to unpaid overtime for any position with less than 1% of the venture's total equity.)

******** Ah I've always maintained an aggressive (if not downright irresponsible) work-life balance, probably working closer to 20 or so meaningful hours each week, if that. But I'll be sure to ask about the computer situation :) I think it's also just that going through the formal channels is such a rip off that spiritually I'd rather just spend my own money, especially if it's for something that'll serve multiple purposes and will allow me to recoup costs later (e.g. when Ryzen first dropped I put together an 8-node cluster for around a tenth the yearly buy-in for the equivalent amount of compute, which ran most of my grad school projects and will probably get sold off in the coming months with fairly minimal losses).

******** Thought to follow-up on this -- asked for a laptop and was given carte blanche, so I'm getting a macbook with a few upgrades (e.g. to the i9 processor, 64 gigs of memory, etc.). Also told that if I needed anything else, like a fancy ergonomic desk or eGPU / server etc. to just ask. So it sounds like that shouldn't be a problem, at least!

*** Programming is not for everyone, but if you think you'd enjoy it, I suggest learning the bare basics of a few domains like front-end web or app design (ReactJS/React Native or Flutter, along with a basic understanding of JavaScript), back-end development (JavaScript, and a framework like NodeJS or Django), software development (I'm not entirely sure what's in use today, so I suggest you look into it on your own - best bet I have is on Java or C++), or machine learning (Python, and ML frameworks like Tensorflow). Again, just try the basics to figure out what you'd be interested in, because tastes wildly fluctuate between these - I enjoy front-end development, but I detest working on the back-end, for example. Beyond that, you learn best in practise, so I'd recommend doing/collaborating with others on projects like websites, apps, or open-source contributions to frameworks, or freelancing, which does bring in some nifty side income.

There are some very good courses to learn all of them, although depending on how you learn, there are some website guides (like w3schools) that might be better (I learned front-end development from one of those, and ML programming from a course).

In data science, there are some well-researched resources to learn it the best you can. Here's [[https://80000hours.org/articles/ai-policy-guide/#resources][one]] by 80000hours.org, and [[https://humancompatible.ai/bibliography][another]] by FHAI. They both recommend Andrew Ng's [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning][course on Machine Learning]] as an excellent starting point.

If you're asking specifically about creating a resume attractive to companies, I'd recommend finding projects to work on either alone or as part of a group (there's a lot of space to find ideas while you're learning the concepts, and there are always people looking for collaborators on their projects online), and if you have the time, getting an internship in the field, or working with someone on a research paper.

**** Thank you for the advice! :) I have some familiarity with the specific tools you listed, and will probably gain more in the coming years. I've heard side projects and academic work are not very highly regarded by industry, at least compared to actual experience at actual companies. Do you know if that's true, or if it varies by type of position (I think my ideal job title in this possible future would be some sort of “Senior Data Scientist” type thing at a FAANG-like company, rather than at a random startup, though I'd also be more than happy to start in a junior role or work in a less established company initially).

***** Actual experience is definitely regarded more highly than side projects and academic work in general, but I assumed you wouldn't have the time for that if you were busy with your current job. Although, the point about projects is a very generalized one, because most side projects by CS students are basic or unoriginal. If you work on a good project - something that you could deploy, or publish a research paper on - that's valuable on a level comparable to mid-tier work experience.

****** Yeah, I probably wouldn't want to go for any full-fledged internships or anything, but my soon-to-be position is still considered a training program, and the PI is very flexible with what I'll actually be doing (there are a bunch of initial projects I can pick from to hit the ground running, but he's also cool with me using whatever data or technology I want to work on anything that's at least vaguely relevant to the lab's overarching theme). Those initial projects won't necessarily be the sexiest, but they should be pretty interesting and impactful still (probably not nature / science / cell flagship tier, unless we get really lucky results, but in their broader publishing groups).

******* I don't know much about your field, but I have seen people in fields seemingly unrelated to programming make use of prediction analysis or reinforcement learning to great effect. I admit a lack of experience in this area and advise contacting someone who switched from a field related to yours to data science, but from what I understand, a good methodology would be to learn just enough of the basic concepts in ML/DL to get a rough understanding of which direction seems promising with respect to your work.
