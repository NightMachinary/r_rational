** Harsh but fair. This fanfic fall in to the surprising large intersection between [[/r/sneerclub][r/sneerclub]] and [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

*** ...but I was told that although the author of HPMOR has made many science errors and had them pointed out to him, never even once were they pointed out by the people of the sneer?

**** I had to reread your comment 3 times because Poe's Law. If it wasn't for “people of the sneer” I might still be unsure.

** I feel like this is one of those things where people who agree with the author on something go "haha, so true", people who disagree go "what? This doesn't seem true", and the people who agree go "dude you're taking this way too seriously, it's a joke".

** This is a masterpiece of crack fic. I love that you only rewrote the scenes that matter to the jokes you wanted to make. I was laughing every minute or so! The beginning of chapter four was so silly, I loved it. Also the part where Quirrel told everyone that Harry is a fascist. He's a fascist that wants his subjects to be happy and healthy, which means that he's a fascist but his brand of fascism isn't bad, in principle (separating the morals from the word definition is something people often struggle with).

I don't know why you named this after Rick and Morty. I haven't seen much of the show, but neither of these characters seemed at all like Rick or Morty.

*** I mean. There's good rational Twilight fanfiction. Not liking the source material doesn't have to matter much.

**** And truly excellent My Little Pony fan fiction. I've only watched a few minutes of the cartoon sometime after I read Friendship is Optimal, just to see what it was like. And haven't felt the slightest desire to see any more of it.
