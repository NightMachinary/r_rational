Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Someone laughs. You make an inquiry regarding the reason. Unfortunately, it isn't a quick joke or silly image but something that requires a fair amount of context (say, between one and five minutes of explanation).

Would you prefer to get that context, or just be told that there's a lot of context that you don't have and so it wouldn't be funny for you?

** I've only seen it once so I'm not sure yet, but I think I might think Jurassic World is a better movie than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

That's not as much of an insult as it sounds like; I long ago came to the conclusion that movies are an inferior medium for conveying narrative (can you imagine condensing season 1 of Stranger things into a 2-hour film /without losing anything important?/ or BioShock Infinite? or /any/ book? the best book-to-movie adaption I've ever seen is /the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe/, and that's probably due to the fact that the book only takes about an hour longer to read than the movie's run-time), so I give movies a lot of slack and tolerate a lot of their irrational BS. /As far as movies go,/ I like Jurassic World well enough. It's definitely better than the train wreck of Jurassic Park III.

Fallen Kingdom was beautiful - better cinematography than Jurassic World, great CGI - but... idk. It felt empty, like the sole reason for its existence is simply to set up the next movie. I enjoyed it while I was watching it, but thinking about it afterwards... idk. It feels like Fallen Kingdom is nothing but two extended "the plot requires it" sequences; like there were a lot of short "the plot requires it" sequences in Jurassic World (like the I-rex escape - why no tracking in the paddock? why no landlines? why no cell service when it's outright stated that the I-rex is sponsored by Verizon and there's probably severals of cell towers on the island? why walk from the paddock to the car or drive the car into the woods when the I-rex could be 30 feet away? why not transfer the animal to a permanent paddock when it's still a juvenile?), but all the little "the plot requires it" sequences lead into something else (if only another series of "plot requires it" sequences), and in Fallen Kingdom... idk.

I'll need to see the movie again, maybe I'll change my mind after seeing it again. Or maybe not, because I felt like I'd already seen it before when I was sitting in the theater. If you've seen all the trailers for it, you've basically already seen the movie. The trailers basically used one shot from each scene and put them in roughly the order they occur in the movie, and that's pretty unbelievable.

There's one pretty significant thing they kept secret, and it has to do with the little girl. I thought she did a better job of acting than a lot of the adults, but the "twist" that centers around her... idk. I can't figure out the point of /"her being the thing that she is"/ other than having someone to do /"the thing that she does at the end of the movie,"/ because *for once* the main characters decide to do the rational thing but then the little girl jumps in and does the irrational thing and I guess the script required someone who would "have a reason" to do the irrational thing so they made her be the thing that she is... idk.

If I had to sum up my feelings about Fallen Kingdom, it'd be "idk." I'll need to see it again.

*** I just got back from seeing it. I thought it was one of those frustrating movies where I could see the germ of something good, but it was obscured by ... well, action was a big part of it, but also a little bit too much pandering, especially with regards to morally reprehensible characters being set up for the audience to hate, then extended sequences where they all get killed by dinosaurs (which I'd call textbook torture porn if the movie wasn't PG-13).

Germs of good stuff:

1. Claire gets called out on her complicity in the events of the first movie. Given more runtime and less of a focus on action sequences, I feel like this whole movie could have been about her overcoming her guilt over what happened in the first movie.
2. There's at least some focus on the question of commercialization, which seems like fertile ground. The dinosaurs were initially created in order to be a tourist attraction, and in this movie there's a definite question of "but what are the dinosaurs /for/?", which gets a few lines but not much more. If they wanted to do a deep dive on animal rights, that would have been the way to go; dinosaurs cost time, money, and require a lot of expertise, which just isn't going to happen without some economic /purpose/, short of a billionaire bankrolling the whole thing. Admittedly, [[#s][spoiler]]
3. I actually thought that the little girl was a brilliant addition ... that was completely squandered. If you wanted to provide parallels to [[#s][spoiler]], then that's a great way to go, but it all remains unexplored subtext, probably because it's a little bit too divisive of a question for a Hollywood action movie, especially if it's not going to be a focus. The movie did basically nothing with it.

**** In an age of binge-watching an entire 10-hour season of a show on Netflix in the span of a few days and pouring 150 hours into a videogame over the course of a couple of weeks, 2 hours seems paltry in comparison. Hell, the youtubers-who-play-videogames I watch make videos almost that long on a regular basis. I've watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN-bvbdUc8E][a /three-hour/ game of Uno]].

I know there aren't just novels, there's also novellas and short stories, but I feel like a lot of movies are the equivalent of trying to crunch a 300-page novel into a 20-page short story, and the rest of them are trying to stretch a 5-page short story into a 15-page short story. Neither of those feel optimal to me.

***** Movies give pretty good enjoyment value per unit of time spent watching them, and are cheap time investments. Yeah, a good book is amazing to finish, but if I spend 10 hours reading a book for it to end unsatifyingly, then I'm going to feel much more put out compared to a 2 hour movie that was similarly bad precisely because I had much less time invested in the movie.

Also, I think action movies don't have good translations into other mediums. There's action in books, certainly, but it isn't precisely the same to me, and live action movies are much better able to do action scenes well than similar live action TV shows. Mad Max: Fury Road couldn't have translated it's action scenes into a TV format, because a TV series wouldn't have made as much money, and thus wouldn't have had the same budget. There's animated action movies of similar scope, but that's basically a different genre given the relative budget and importance put into the different mediums.

You can somewhat consider the MCU to be a long running, expansive TV show where each episode happens to be a 2 hour movie, and given it's popularity I think that does lend credence to your idea that TV is better than movies.

I'm really hoping the His Dark Materials thing on the BBC shows this off. Like, they're going to give the Golden Compass about 8 hours where that piss-poor movie from a decade ago only gave it 2 hours. At an average reading speed of 200 words per minute, the Golden Compass takes about 9.5 hours to read. Two hours just isn't enough sometimes.

** So, the US Supreme Court [[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-494_j4el.pdf][ruled]] this week that states can force companies outside their borders to collect taxes from the state's residents, or so called Internet Sales Tax. It was a 5-4 decision, but a mixed bag of liberal and conservative justices on either side, so the politics is somewhat a wash. The jurisprudence is an absolute disaster (Kennedy doesn't seem to have a strong grasp of the English language). In particular, the problem is that a state cannot force a company to collect taxes unless it has some connection with the state, like a physical presence. Kennedy decided that a /virtual/ connection is sufficient, like say, because everyone is virtually connected by the internet (hence my complaint that he doesn't understand language). He makes all kinds of arguments about "authority" to impose taxes, but isn't that somewhat different than power?

So, my question: How is a state supposed force compliance? Is a state supposed to send their state troopers into another state to seize assets from a non-compliant company?

If it's across country borders it becomes a lot more questionable, but it probably depends on the country's relationship with the US. If the other country is entirely hostile, what would happen is that if the owners of the company ever entered the US, they would be arrested.

Can you give an example of this? Have the various states entered into an agreement to enforce each other's laws?

The example given in that article describes a man suing a Delaware-based comapny in a Delaware court. In the end, they could only enforce their decisions if the owners physically entered a cooperating jurisdiction.

So what happens if CA sues a NY based company for breach of a CA law? They'd have to do it in a NY court, wouldn't they? I can't imagine such a court doing anything but laughing and tossing the case in the bin.

This is not terribly satisfying to me, as I'm not particularly interested in looking up thirty year old cases.

What really irks me is that Kennedy thinks that "sufficient connection" is that residents of the state send a company money (<= $100,000 per anum) or that the company sends residents parcels (<= 200 per anum).

CA would sue the NY-based company in a CA court. The NY-based company would be expected to send a representative to the CA court. This is the exact same as many other circumstances where companies/people get in law suits in places they are not located in.

Again, not convincing. A NY driver getting a ticket while visiting CA will have to deal with the ticket for much of the same reason he was able to use his NY license to drive in CA: because the states have an agreement with each other to cooperate in these matters. In particular, this NY driver will have been in CA while violating a CA law. I suppose I can imagine scenarios where someone visits a state, breaks a local law (not governed by an interstate accord) and leaves. I think the states have an extradition agreement for things like this. But I don't think those apply when the person in question /was never in the state whose laws were violated/.

I can also imagine cases where contracts are made across state borders. I'm certain there's something where the states have agreed to uphold contracts entered into in other states. Again, I don't think it applies, as selling something isn't the same as a contract.

Maybe there's an example of a company selling a product that doesn't satisfy CA regulations? Even though the company isn't located in CA, if they sell it to a CA resident and ship it into the state, the state can sue? Is this a thing that has/can happen?

/Taxes/ distort the market. This is a fundamental economic truth. Before you can talk about "distortion" you have to have a baseline -- distorted /from what/? The only baseline that doesn't seem totally arbitrary to me is "the way things are now." You might take baselines by considering historic norms, and that sounds okay, but it's also kind of arbitrary and demonstrates why "distortion" shouldn't be considered a bad thing at all, in a general sense.

That's fair. Thinking about it, I realize such a mail-forwarding scheme is straight up tax evasion, but in the same sense that not paying the use tax is tax evasion. Difficult to detect and difficult to prove intent. After all, there are legitimate reasons for people to use mail forwarders. On the other hand, such services also come with their own problems. (I know some companies won't ship to them, because they can't verify the destination, and foreign entities sometimes try to use such services to avoid international tariffs.)

Note that the US-politics ban is a subsection of "Keep [[/r/rational]] pleasant and on-topic", and that as moderators we can legitimately do whatever we think will serve the purposes of the subreddit.

In this case, we judged that the parent comment is related to but not /about/ US politics, and unlikely to cause problems. If that last bit changes we'll just remove the whole thread.

** How can anybody enjoy such works as [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Highschool_of_the_Dead][/Highschool of the Dead/]]? Desperate zombie survival and gratuitous panty shots [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Mood_Dissonance][fail to mix]], I think. It just smacks of trying /way/ too hard.

The key word, of course, is =gratuitous=. All this lewdness would make a lot more sense if, in this new, chaotic world, [[http://i.imgur.com/QdrLLo5.png][the male characters were scheming about how to rape the female characters, planning how to protect the female characters from being raped, and forming rape gangs and anti-rape alliances with each other (and, for the anti-rapists, with female characters---but is that "male ally" who just clued you girls in to the coming struggle actually a spy who's trying to lure you into an ambush? Or is he just some hapless schmoe who's been threatened by a rape gang /into/ luring you into an ambush, on pain of death if he betrays them, because they want to capture their meat unsullied in a quick ambush rather than damaged in a bloody battle?)]]*---but nothing of the sort is happening, so the effect is a complete /non sequitur/ for the viewer. See also [[https://komperaklause.deviantart.com/art/The-Fruit-Part-1-601172516][this interesting story]], which does an /excellent/ job of combining survival and eroticism.

*I frame this as a male-vs.-female contest because the anime's titillation (at least in the few episodes at which I glanced) is derived entirely from the girls. I once read a reversed-gender-roles hentai manga** and thought that it was fairly interesting, and I'm sure that a post-apocalyptic female-on-male-rape-squad scenario would be interesting to watch as well. (Someone probably has made a /Fallout/ mod for that, come to think of it...)

**It was somewhat funny. The male protagonist was a high-schooler who had somehow been teleported into a mirror world where women were dominant and boisterous and men were submissive and chaste (and, since this was a hentai manga, everyone adhered to stereotypes). He proceeded to confuse and shock all the girls in his school by acting forwardly in a manner totally uncharacteristic of mirror-world boys. I didn't bother to download it, unfortunately.

Speaking of gratuitous errantry from the beaten path, gratuitously-loose /translations/ make me angry as well. Why does [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][Project Gutenberg's translation of /The Three Musketeers/]] need to translate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cu][=écu=]] as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(English_coin)][=crown=]] when the word /actually/ means =shield=? (See also the English cognate =escutcheon=.) It doesn't translate =livre= to =pound=, does it? Yes, a numismatist will tell you that [[https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces27889.html][Louis XIII's French écu]] and [[https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces52427.html][Charles I's English crown]] were vaguely equivalent in value (3.23 vs. 2.06 grams of gold, according to those links, but [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Swashbucklers/][/GURPS Swashbucklers/]] lists them as being around $20 vs. $25* over the entire 17th and 18th centuries) and that the écu displays on its reverse side not just a shield but also a crown atop that shield---but =écu= is not =couronne=, and =shield= is not =crown=.

*A "GURPS dollar" [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/basic/][is defined]] as the typical price of a loaf of bread ([[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Low-Tech/companion3/][or a pound of grain---or, more broadly, half the amount of food necessary to sustain a typical character for one day---in an urban area]]). It's meant to be a constant measure of value that's valid across all campaigns.

One of the coolest parts of [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/][HTML]] is that you can remove the ambiguity of italicization. If I italicize something in Markdown, that italicization must have its meaning deduced from context: Is the italicized text the name of a ship, the title of a book, a non-English phrase, or a stretch of text that I want the reader to imagine me saying in an elevated tone of voice? In HTML (with [[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp][C]]S[[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp][S]]), I can /differentiate/ all these meanings: <i class="ship-name">Titanic</i>, <i class="book-title">GURPS Basic Set: Characters</i>, <span lang="la">et cetera</span>. Isn't it <em>awesome</em>?

This one? It is a series so maybe you meant one of the other 5.

So... you like it because it's inherently satisfying to include your actual, precise meaning into what you write? Because otherwise, if all your different styles are italics anyway, it doesn't really make a difference to the reader.

*** The reversed gender roles hentai is: Teisou Gyakuten Sekai by Amahara

As for why someone would like Highschool of the Dead, I remember reading in my teens while I was going down the list of all ecchi manga, and enjoying it for its, in comparison to other ecchi and horror manga, level headed and intelligent characters. Now a decade later, I can still appreciate it for its dedication to pushing its ecchiness, its gun otaku-ness, and its self awareness as a b movie turned to comic form.

Too bad the writer died.
