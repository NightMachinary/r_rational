*** Harry realizes that the Unicorn he killed in the Forbidden Forest was Rarity from My Little Pony, and the Elements of Harmony may or may not be Infinity Stones.

**** Do I have to have read or watched MLP or the Avengers in order to enjoy?

Also, I don't remember Harry killing a unicorn? Voldemort does in the first book, tho

***** You definitely do not have to have watched The Avengers and no characters from the Marvel universe are (or will be) a part of the story. The crossover is thematic, rather than direct.

Being exposed to MLP would likely make the fic more enjoyable but I set out from day one with the intent for it not to be a prerequisite to enjoyment. I hope I've succeeded, but I'll let you be the judge of that!

** I vaguely remember getting very confused a few chapters in and giving up on this, but I don't remember why. Maybe I'll try again.

** I'm a little disappointed that it's been so long since we've seen Hermione. It seemed at the start that she'd be a much bigger part of the story, but I don't think we've seen her since Rhapsody in Blue.
