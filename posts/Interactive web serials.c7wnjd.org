So I was thinking web serials would be a cool way to take Fair play who dun its to the next level.\\
Once in a while the author asks for the audience's take on something - a characters motivations, the answer to a mystery, their best guess for what some other character will do, that sort of thing.

And their conclusion will be the one the main character gets to as well - so they get to see how right or wrong they where and face the consequences.

Was this done anywhere already, or better yet, is there one ongoing?


** Like quests?

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]] is a quest written by me and [[/u/Velorien]] that has been updating twice a week for 3.5 years now. After each chapter, the readers vote for what the protagonist should do next. The game is ultimately based off the Naruto anime, but has been /heavily/ modified in order to rationalize the setting. Still, if you think that magical ninja kung-fu punch wizards attempting to uplift a deathworld sounds like fun then you should definitely stop by.

** Hmm, [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/]]?

You can post suggestions in each page, and it may be taken account to create the next page.

It's still ongoing now, but it's like 80% done maybe

** Hmm yes, like quests. But also not like quests.

I started reading wildbow's Department Sixty Four, and it gives me the same feeling Choose your own Adventure books did. It feels like there are no right answers. You don't have a good enough grasp on the consequences of your choice to make it meaningful. And I imagine 90% of people are choosing one option imagining one thing in their head but really wildbow meant something else.

Like [X] discipline the employee who spoke out of turn.

Could mean a stern talking to, or a one week stay in solitary.

​

HPMoR's ending was close to what I was thinking, but I read it after it ended and couldn't make myself stop at a cliffhanger :)

​

I was thinking more like a murder mystery where after being shown all the evidence the audience gets a change to try and figure out who did it.

That sort of question has a clear right answer. You know exactly what it means to guess one name over another.

​

Or maybe after a fight with a super powered villain who's power isn't quite clear you try to figure it out. This also has clear consequences. If you think they can walk through walls but actually they can teleport, then in the next chapter when the villain kicks your ass you know it's your fault.

​

Maybe someone can recommend a quest that's similar to what I was looking for? or gives choices that are more clear cut.

Quests shouldn't just offer a "pick A or B or C" without some ability to post clarifications, ask the author what they mean, suggest alternatives, and otherwise comment. That way, people can give examples of what they have in mind.

And a good quest author won't necessarily use exact vote counts to decide what to do next, they'll give more weight to suggestions that include rationale and sound sensible.

So, less of a quest, more of a puzzle for the audience to figure out?

I can imagine a story like that, but that would require much more clever puzzles than I've seen in most stories, and good ways to deal with failure. Quests tend to gain readers based on the responsiveness and creativity of the quest author. Most choose-your-own-adventure books have a lot of bad endings and very few good ones. Good quests don't have only one right answer, they have many, and the author won't know all of them in advance.

** Prequel adventure is the best quest I've ever read. [[http://www.prequeladventure.com][www.prequeladventure.com]]

MSpaint adventures is probably the most well-known but it got too confusing and convoluted for me and some parts of it are too difficult to read.

** I've played this for a while:

[[https://storium.com/]]

It's an interesting sort of LitRPG, multiple players just sort of take turns writing small sections of the story, using cards to play as their guide. I only tried one match which unfortunately died out due to one key player just disappearing (and another one was an idiot who couldn't write for shit and had zero self-awareness whatsoever, so he kept derailing everything else the others did). But in that game I played the basic plot was that of a human sacrifice murder mystery, HP Lovecraft meets Agatha Christie. Played with a good pace and with good writers though it ought to be pretty fun.

** I believe Forge of Destiny was done this way (but it is being rewritten), and its sequel is currently doing using that method.
