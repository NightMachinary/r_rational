** Now with the correct chapter number! 8-)

Sam and DASI walk the tightrope--how fast can you change things, even for the better, without a disastrous response?

Here's a bit of non-spoilery puzzle: DASI had to tell Black Swan about the board meeting discussion. Why didn't Black Swan already know? She has both ability and motive to monitor it herself.

I'll post the answer in a couple of days, to give time for speculation.

** I'm enjoying just as much as the earlier works. I don't fully understand the Lizard rules, although I'm not sure if I'm supposed to. Still, it's interesting to see a society get rebuilt by force majeur. As to why Black Swan wasn't monitoring -- she was focused on something else? It's been too long since I read earlier chapters. so I'm not not sure what that might be. Alternatively, maybe DASI shielded the room because she didn't want Black Swan messing things up.

*** I haven't gone into detail on the Lizard transition law, or the compatible subset the EDU is using, at least not yet.

Black Swan can't spy on Minicode's board meetings without violating both US and EDU law--she's heavily short their stock, so that would be insider trading.
