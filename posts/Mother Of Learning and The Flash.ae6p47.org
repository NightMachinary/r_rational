So, I watched Flash after the latest MoL chapter. And it got me thinking, can Flash be exist in MoL universe?

After some thinking, I realized that superspeed is something we have already seen. The hasting spell IS super speed. Cast it and start running, the better the hasting spell, the faster you go.

Which led to two major revelations:

a) Flash leaves a trail of lighting behind him. Given that we know that all this is nothing but magic leaking through spell boundaries (like how a perfect missile is invisible), Flash is terrible at superspeed. QI is probably Zoom

b) Velocity 9 has an equivalent in this world - the abilities potions made from select magical creatures exhibiting these traits.

I know it has very little with Rationality per-se, but it was fun deducing none the less.

Damn Hollywood, that's not canon in the comics.

** Terrible at superspeed probably doesn't do it, as you wouldn't get speed that great if you were bad. If you were bad and could still just abuse superspeed to flash levels, it would be the single best spell ever.

*** Flash has a huge mana pool and is bad at the shaping necessary for the Hasting spell, then. He's the Zach of Haste.

**** Huge manapool doesn't necessarily cut it. It would still have to be cheap to be like flash, who can just spam it. And I'm pretty sure that being bad at the shaping means you are bad at casting the spell and it is not as effective so you are not so fast.

If Haste gave flash level speeds it would be the ultimate spell. First one to use it would win every time. You wouldn't even need any other spell for fighting, you could just stab them.

Superspeed of flash/supes level and physics don't really mix either. You'd need a reason for why everything doesn't get wrecked. You can't just run and put your feet down on those speeds without wrecking yourself. F

***** Maybe his pool is actually rather small, but he has instant recharge. So haste is the only thing he can cast, but he can do so constantly.

****** Actually, that makes it more reasonable.

It might be divinely granted ability. He has an insanely huge mana pool, but very very poor mana shaping skills. So much infact, that he can't cast anything. But he has also been granted a divine ability to autocast Haste. That and instant autofill of mana pool.

That is, his mana pool regenerates while he is standing and delivering punchlines. That is why he is so talkative.

I am pretty sure Zorian would want to analyse him, in that case. Now that he CAN sense divine energies.

*** In any munchkining story haste pretty much already is the single best spell ever--so long as you don't just accidentally age yourself to death. In any combat situation where your opponent isn't arbitrarily immune to damage, you can cause arbitrary amounts of damage with correspondingly arbitrary amounts of speed--and avoid damage to yourself similarly.

DC's the Flash always makes me roll my eyes because he should be able to instantly win any engagement. Even mental attacks shouldn't work because his speed of thought, which is required to run that fast without hitting anything, should allow him to notice the onset and avoid or disable the attacker before serious harm occurs. Even if his powers require staying under the speed of light to avoid the weird running-into-the-speed-force stuff or whatever it should be basically impossible for anyone to beat him, and even just throwing pebbles gives him firepower on par with all but the biggest intergalactic villains.

MoL's restarts are in some ways just another version of haste--after leaving the loop it's like he's been hasted for a decade with the caveat that he couldn't affect anything in the world permanently except his own mind/soul.

In some respects even intelligence is just haste. While there's certainly a working memory component (things you can keep in mind at once), intelligence is mostly just about coming up with ideas /faster/ than other people. If you come up with them fast you can afford to discard more of them and consistently act on better ones.

*** How about a waste heat model? There is no 'perfect spell', only perfect enough for a given energy level.

This means a perfect missile isn't actually invisible. Rather, at the energy levels being pumped into it, the flaws that still exist don't give off enough light to be visible. If you dumped ten times the mana into the spell, much more energy would be wasted through the flaws and the spell would glow again.

The Flash works in the same way. His 'speed spell' is optimised to be able to handle very high energy levels and that is how he casts it. A normal haste spell would explode at those speeds. But because of the high energy levels, you get waste light and more of it.

He's no bad a shaping. He's juggling mountains (which takes really good shaping to be able to do at all!), but because mountains are so big, of course some boulders get dropped.

**** Also consider that the limiting efficiency may differ between spells. Perhaps a missile can be optimized to 99.9% efficiency with only minute radio emissions, but a haste spell is maybe 60% efficient at best at typical conditions and acceleration. The Flash doesn't suck at haste, he's in fact so good that he's the only one to be able to use it cost-effectively in combat.
