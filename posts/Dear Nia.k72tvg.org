** Just fyi, the premise here is that you setup an experiment before forking occurs to talk to forked timelines, but later on they suddenly talk to timelines that split before the experiment was set up.

*** Nia invented a technology which allows different quantum forks to communicate with each other. Then she died in a global thermonuclear war. Her husband got his hands on the technology and contacted another version of Nia in another quantum fork, one whose husband died in that war instead. But he isn't the first grieving version of himself to contact that Nia, and she cuts off contact because there's nothing she can do for him and doesn't want to be heartbroken all over again.

He dies, alone and cold, in the war which failed to rend the world of the Nia who cut him off.

Then it turns out there's another Nia, in a world which didn't have the war, who contacted other versions of herself to get those transcripts, and used them in her PHD thesis. The man who accepted her thesis also tried this and was promptly overwhelmed with existential horror, for which he required therapy. They forwarded the entire thing to the military to hopefully stave off that war, and the many worlds march on.

**** Oh, that's the way I understood it. Was hoping there's more, it all seemed a bit unsatisfying, sort of Bradbury-like, don't you think so?

******* I generally find them somewhat inconsistent in their quality, and feel that their style of existentialism is drab and uninteresting. In fairness, I haven't watched them for a few years

******** I agree for the most part, but the voice acting is very good imo and he puts considerable effort in the videos.

***** You can read Jack Vance's short story "Rumfuddle" if you want a different take on the same premise with somewhat more development.

*** Nia and Soren are a couple.

Nia invents a machine that let's you send messages to parallel universes.

A drone bombs their house, killing Nia in one universe and Soren in the other.

The Soren that survives uses the machine to contact the Nia that survives. She tells him that this is goodbye and that she's not /his/ Nia (and he is not her Soren), but he doesn't accept that and wants more.

She uses lots of science and philosophy to tell him how wrong he is, he uses raw emotion to tell her that he isn't wrong in all the ways that count.

In her world peace has come. She cuts communication with Soren and moves on. Soren on the other hand is surrounded by war and despairing and angry.

Timeskip.

Some Nia uses conversations with parallel family members (and selves maybe) do write a philosophical thesis and gets a(nother?) doctorate. It's not clear to me if she's a third Nia who never lost her family, if the Nia writing the letters lied about her family status to the Soren writing the letters, or if the person congratulating her is just confused.

The end.

You might have gotten confused because everyone was voice acted by the same person.

** This is interesting, but it's also part of the increasingly common representation of romantic relationships as men petitioning women, who get nothing out of it, for affection. Which is just incredibly depressing about the state of society.

*** If your takeaway is that gender matters here, then you've missed the point. It's not about the romantic aspect. So long as person B cares about person A and can't let go the story works.

If you swap Nia and Soren, or if it was two men, or two women, or a parent and their child, or two siblings, it would still be the same story with the same outcome.
