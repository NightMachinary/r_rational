** Will this be continuing? I really like the premise.

I wasn't very clear on what was happening in the beginning -- I got that the humans used mustard gas, but I wasn't clear on why they were putting up shields and all that. As to destroying the world but it must have had something to do with the gate opening and then not closing -- did they dial a black hole?

I'm certainly intending to continue it. I don't yet know how it's going to end so I'm not ruling out that I'll accidentally write myself into a corner or run out of steam, but there will definitely be more chapters.

It's deliberately a bit under-explained, to be further elaborated on later (the intended chapter 2 is from the PoV of the people responsible), but yes basically that's what happened.

**** If you are going to continue it, then why does the chapter numbers show 1/1? This usually means that the story is a one-shot. Is the continuation going to be a separate story?

Great story by the way.

** As a big time fan of the series, I am happy to see rational SG fan fics. Really enjoyed your first SG fic on how the Ancients inadequately software tested their Gates.

Looking forward to seeing how this one goes, especially since Baal is one of my "favorite" Goaulds. Do you intend to include Anubis in your fic ?

How about the ascended Ancients and the Ori ? I assume post-singularity players will break a rational fic really fast.

*** I'm deliberately keeping the scope of the fic limited because there's just so goddamn much SG1 that I could never hope to do it justice. It will cover the events of the war until their conclusion, whatever that may be. It will probably be ~ the level of content of a 3 part episode. There may be other Competent!SG1 fics depending on how this goes.

(I tend to describe this as competent SG1 rather than rational SG1 because the characters aren't necessarily more rational than their series counterparts, they're just good at their jobs)
