** I posted about the audible version here before about 6 months ago, but now it's in text format! Which is great for people who don't like listening to their books.

Andrew Rowe ([[https://www.reddit.com/u/Salaris/][u/Salaris]]) is the author of the Arcane Ascension series and he's coming out with another book, /How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps:/

#+begin_quote
  For thousands of years, there has been a cycle: a Demon King rises and conquers, and a Hero is reborn a hundred years later to defeat him. Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him to save.

  And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan.

  She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'lltravel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete. And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy.

  She might not be a Hero -- but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.

So I figured since people here already loved the previous books he's written, you guys would like knowing about this one too.

** I remember thinking this was interesting when the audiobook was posted before, but I'm more interested in text format and decided to wait for it to come out as a book, then completely forgot about it.

The sample chapters are pretty good. I like the author's writing style, and the MC seems interesting. It's not enough to say for sure that the book itself is good, but it seems promising at least.

*** Imho it's hilarious with a fun riff on Zelda and general fantasy tropes; the solutions are generally clever and a few will surprise you.
