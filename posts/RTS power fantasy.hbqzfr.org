Does RTS power fantasy exist? Usually we have isekai that are classic RPG power fantasy. You upgrade your stats, maybe a couple of companions and then the author is unable to maintain proper power levels and it degenerates.

I mean stuff where we have distinct enemy factions and the protagonist upgrading and building fortifications and armies. Stuff like world of Prime or Daniel Black ( besides his strange sexual themes). Lines can be blurred with a normal isekai and yet a RTS approach allows us to see the end game much better without getting lost with an overpowered protagonist and nothing to do.

What do you think? Do yo know other instances? Do you believe it is worth calling it a separate genre?


** Would the large amount of fanfics involving planetary annihilation/total annihilation/supreme commander count, in your opinion?

*** If you are talking about cross-fics I have issue with commanders holding massive idiot balls. Any instance of supcom in a world of Worm, for example, will completely trivialize anything if they just spend a little time on scaling up. Infinitely replicating army of self-sufficient drones doesn't really offer itself for a challenge.

**** Worm is one of the few universes where that approach runs into definite problems, actually. Scion is a powerful precog and can casually kill a Commander. So is and can the Simurgh, and a few parahumans.

**** There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/]] which is long and has a consistently high quality, it also avoids the idiot ball aspect thanks to the timescale, the story starts out with her having managed to cludge together something that outputs refined feedstock at a rate that could optimistically be called drop by drop, WOG says it'd take months to go from that to any proper SC unit by which point the story would be pretty much over and since she's not putting everything back into increased production it'll take significantly longer. Though it's hardly an RTS power fantasy.

** Seems like a subset of military fantasy/sci-fi? Like Practical Guide To Evil has a lot of bits upgrading military units and army compositions. I'm not actually sure what would be different to make it more RTS-like. Focusing on upgrading units even more? Putting a gamey layer of upgrade trees and numbers on top of it?

** They aren't super rational but like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7080862/1/The-Swarm-of-War][The Swarm of War]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.30535/reader/][Factory Isolation]] Have bits and pieces of what you sound like you want. Also [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/thousand-40k-multicross.30012/reader/][Thousand]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1/Saruman-of-many-Devices][Saruman of the many devices]] again have elements but like well RTS in general are kind of dead. WilyCoyotee is right in asking if the grey goo supreme commandery type fics are what you want then there are a bunch of them. But like in terms of the purely rts type fic conversions its like on the hand hard to make a whole cloth system and like theres kind of an issue of character interactions beyond like oh this is an interesting tech or usage of units.

​

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fallout-nuclear-metal-au-self.651417/reader/][Fallout: Nuclear Metal]] also has elements but it's mostly as a side part and not the main focus of fic

** I think its hard to write a relatable MC. Like in MC your really distinct form the stuff happening on screen. Like sometimes you have a commander that's "you" but its just a better unit in reality. And battles are really separate. Like even in campaigns you have to re-build every game.

** I don't think RTS is the wording I'd use, it's not real time, strategy is a good enough descriptor though I get it, but I do prefer tactics games like XCOM over rts.

​

I've frequently requested and praised on the use of power caps and the fact that it allows for unit vs unit and large scale conflicts rather than no power cap scenarios. Examples of these are more generally found in published books rather than webfiction though.

​

An example that comes to mind if Prince of Thorns. There are no super powerful people in that world. But the MC is Evil, read the first chapter if you can handle him the story and writing are top tier. You can find it for free if you look hard enough.

​

Historical fiction in general, including alternative histories also tend to have these elements present in them. If you find some in fantasy settings that are readable, no need to be good, tell me I'd love to see some of them.

*** Is Prince of Thrones fantasy? Fantasy creatures and magic are present?\\
Yeah RTS is probably not a good name as turn based game can be better. Any other fiction you would recommend?

**** One of the most interesting parts of the first book is discovering that world, but if you want the spoiler I can tell you if you ask me. But yes there's magic and strange creatures.

Biographies of certain historical figures fill that niche somewhat. Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, the hardcore history series on Genghis Khan, maybe Napoleon but that's a less interesting period for me so I've never bothered..

The manga Kingdom is mostly this, the pacing got very slow and I dropped it last year, but up till then it was good. His troops get stronger, he raises through military ranks, the side character who's the king does diplomacy, the enemies counter and defend his strategies..

Though there's hardly any intelligent or interesting use of tactics or strategy going on other than the author making it seem that way by making the characters say so.

***** Just finished the first book. It is quite good. More edgy they I expected. Yet the worldbuidling seems interesting (even if mutations and atomic weapons should not work like this).

****** They get less edgy as they go. Second one is a LOT less edgy. First one is more of a hey this is as bad as it can get here if you don't like it leave now. The kingdom building and rulership aspects also increase.

Book of the ancestor has better worldbuilding, but more focused on individuals instead of armies and rulership. Most mutations are hinted as being non radiation related though.. It's also 1k+ years and weapons that changed environments drastically so it's not too jarring imho.

Edit* also notice other interesting changes in people like people being taller on average in the story. It kind of makes sense given sexual selection and female preferences, but also not, because bigger people need more food and their food production capacity likely decreased after the fall and yet they have other advantages like better crops than our ancestors did in the same technological level so it's fun..

** I would say some "use modern technology to take over a low-tech world" - stories are a lot like what you talk about. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire][Enlightened Empire]] is a good example, albeit it is almost annoyingly realistic about the time and effort it would take to actually do this, even with a protagonist who happens to be an expert on the matter. (Don't take me wrong, there is plot and such to keep you entertained while the long-term plans are slowly bearing fruit.)

** Ender's Game, where Ender unwittingly controls the human fleet? Figured that was kind of an RTS interface with the Ansible allowing instant communication. More RTS than anything resembling a normal real world military command.

Would probably be more interesting to read a Moba-fiction. That at least seems writeable.

** If you're willing to branch out to CN webnovels there's The World Online. It's a Chinese VRMMORPG peggy sue, practically its own genre by now. In this case the twist is that the game in question offers players the choice of playing as wandering adventurers or as local lords in territory management mode.

The scale of things eventually got away from the author a little bit, IMO, but there's a couple hundred solid chapters of entertainment there.
