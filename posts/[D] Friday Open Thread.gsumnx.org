Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Almost four months ago, I was sent, after a conversation where I mentioned how much I wished there were more stories written with special focus given to intelligent characters and internal consistency, a link to this community.

I was almost happy when the quarantine was announced.

I have been enraptured with many of the stories here; I have been an avid reader of fanfiction for over fifteen years and never have I been this satisfied. Luminosity, Radiance, The Metropolitan Man, Branches on the Tree of Time, A Bluer Shade of White, Pokemon: The Origin of Species, Friendship is Optimal, and now finding myself rapidly approaching the current end of Animorphs: The Reckoning, I cannot have enough of it. I feel spoiled. It's all wonderful.

A gracious thanks to the authors of these works and this community. Soon, I hope to offer my own contribution.

*** Welcome! We're all a little crazy here, but don't get intimidated.

Also, if you liked The Metropolitan Man (and BotToT and ABSoW), you'll probably like Alexander Wales' other works. I recommend The Dark Wizard of Donkerk in particular.

Also, Wildbow's works (Worm, Pact, Twig, Ward, Pale), are very popular. They're more divisive though: the story is usually less focused on decision-making than most works here, the pacing is really intense and chaotic, and it gets really dark. Also, they're really long.

That's a contradiction. Clearly the community hasn't done a splendid job if they don't select things a part of the community wants.

Also, this is beside the point because as I said, a community will also select for porn but that doesn't mean that all subs should allow porn. Just because a community selects something doesn't mean it's good, appropriate content for a particular sub with a particular focus. There's no point in subreddits if they're all just "ran" by users who upvote and post the exact same content.

** Something I'd like to see in a rational fic, especially a LitRPG, is situations where characters intentionally weaken themselves for a long period in order to become stronger later on. I don't mean "my build isn't good now, but wait until I hit level 50!" cases where their power growth is exponential so it seems slow at first. Instead, I mean cases where they become weaker than they were. Where a graph of their power level over time would look more like a roller coaster than an incline, albeit one where they eventually end up higher than they started. The characters only getting more powerful can be monotonous, and this could allow them to revisit old monsters with their new knowledge. Then the characters can beat the monsters via knowledge/experience, rather than higher damage, and the reward could still be meaningful.

One idea I've thought of that would allow this in a satisfying manner would be "prestiging", where the character sacrifices some of their abilities/stats/power/level/whatever in exchange for a theoretically higher growth rate or power cap, or a rarer ability. This would also allow them to get rid of abilities that the character never/rarely uses. After all, how many characters get an ability in chapter 10, use it for 3 chapters, get a better ability in chapter 13, and never use the first one again? This would allow for a rational explanation of this behavior: they traded up. Maybe they sacrifice their high level fire skills and ice skills for a low level temperature control skill, that, once leveled up, is more versatile or faster or something. Maybe this is how hybrid skills are created in that universe?

Anyway, if there are stories with this element already, please let me know.

*** Sounds like a xianxia novel. The protagonists often "restart their cultivation" in order to gain power a new way and raise to greater heights.

Unfortunately, xianxia is one of the most aggravatingly irrational genres out there - or, at least, mainly consists of aggravatingly irrational authors. However, rational takes on the genre would be a good place to start with in looking for something like this, since it's already an established trope.

You show up in a new world and single handedly outsmart everyone at the system they all Iive their lives by. It's the equivalent of a modern person sent to medieval times becoming the best swordsman in the world by luck, but even worse. Having them reset their levels/build to exploit or fix past mistakes would be much more realistic and entertaining.

*** I once read a xianxia crossover fanfiction into the Narutoverse where a high leveled (not in the LitRPG sense) cultivator took their cultivation and gave it back to the world to both appease/bribe it and use it as a springboard to travel to another world which happened to be the Naruto world.

The world traveling was done so they could grow because they basically reached the level cap of their world. I recall that if cultivators took their cultivation with them something bad would happen.

They effectively become mortal and when they get to the Narutoverse they see chakra and ninjas as novel but a bad way.

Like someone messed with the bodies of the people to basically make them cripples in their eyes.

Anyhow the mc's plans in the Verse would have put them into conflict with the main cast. I think it was eating the bijuu

But other than that I don't remember much. Which is to say I don't remember the title, where it was written, how I found it, whether the mc was a chick/dude or if it was rational.

All in all giving up power in the present for rewards sounds cool and to be it sounds like the sort of thing a system could also have in the form of a gacha interface/minigame.

Thinking about it further this concept I see working in time travel works as well? Like in Reverend Insanity the mc as you put it

#+begin_quote
  the characters can beat the monsters via knowledge/experience, rather than higher damage, and the reward could still be meaningful.
#+end_quote

Though it's more applied to people than monsters. But 'prestiging' doesn't happen.

I can also point out a couple of VR novels (novels about Virtual Reality wit LitRPG elements) where the mc gets sent back to the past and then uses knowledge/experience to get ahead.

But in those cases (the VR novels) the choice to go back in time is usually unintentionally and not done with the purpose of getting a higher level cap/skills but is instead a side bonus on a quest for edgy vengeance. As a result they all sort of blend together unfortunately. Also no 'prestiging'.

In the end I recommend Reverend Insanity, a Chinese translated WN due to the mc giving up their cultivation and blowing themselves up in a bid to time travel with a less than 10% success rate.

Be forewarned though, the mc is unapologetically amoral. Though as a consolation prize no one seems to hold an idiot ball. Oh and 1687 chapters.

** Now the social distancing is almost evaporated where I live (don't worry, we have had 0 cases of community transmission for like a month. We're in a very lucky part of the world), I'm no longer going to be working from home 2.5 days a week.

I started the couch to 5k running program using the extra time I was saving by not having to commute (I normally cycle, so traded one exercise for another, more intense exercise). I went from barely being able to jog a minute to being able to jog for 25 minutes straight in about five or six weeks. It's absolutely shocking to me, the amount of progress I've made. I don't love it yet, but I like it fine, and I seem to be losing more weight than I'd expect given the relatively modest calorie expenditure (but I suppose ~300cal extra a week adds up? I think I've lost 2kg/5lb).

Protip: I invested in an expensive sports bra and it made such a difference.

I'm really worried, I guess, of going back to work... because I want to keep running. I was hoping that the semi-lockdown would stay long enough for me to get to the point where I can run 6km, which would let me commute on foot, but that's another month or so away I think.

I don't know really what I want to say here. I was talking to my psychologist about how everything seems to be coming up MagicWeasel during this pandemic, and I feel kind of bad about that. She told me not to, because it's good that I'm happy. And... heck, I'm glad I improved things. I'm glad that my local politician has been doing the right thing and lead to us being able to slowly scale back the restrictions with hopefully no continued community spread. I'm happy?

even in peak pandemic social distancing, we were only allowed to work from home 50% of the time. I'm honestly surprised we were ever allowed to work from home /at all/.

*************** [[/rdloop][]] Loopy?

...yeah, there's a strange mix of some virtual social interaction but no actual physical contact which would probably worry some people a lot more than it does me.

*** I've started a 5-days-per-week parkour regimen towards the beginning of the lockdown. I'd like to keep it going, but I'm going to move to an apartment soon, and I don't think the regimen is going to be as easy to maintain once doing parkour means jogging to a public park, instead of just going out into our house's garden.

**** I'm not entirely sure what parkour is (I mean, I know it's basically jumping over shit, but the details escape me), but it seems to me that it was invented for running through cities, wasn't it?

Regardless, hopefully you're moving somewhere with a park relatively nearby, because I bet you the jog would be a great warm-up!

** Hi, I just found this sub today, and I really liked it! However, I'm still trying to understand the "tags" of posts.

[WIP] = work in progress

[FF] = fanfic

[D] = discussion

I get those, and I assume [RT] stands for "rational". But what does stuff like [RST] and [BST] mean? Am I missing something?

*** [RST] is rational/ist/, meaning it's not just intelligent characters with sane-ish motives acting in accordance with their values, but that the work aims to demonstrate or otherwise teach real-world applicable thinking skills.

No idea what [BST] is.

#+begin_quote
  Is the story [RT] rational or [RST] rationalist? Or is your post [META] discussion about [[/r/rational]]? Is the story a [WIP] work in progress, or [C] complete?

** Thoughts sloshing around, whimsical fiction:

-----

"The sea of bitterness has no end; turn back to the shore."

He's telling me what they've all told me--there's no end to this, just give up.

The corners of my mouth go up, and I chuckle for him to see. As a scene from years ago seems to overlap in my mind with what my eyes report, I raise my arm and reply-- "The sea of bitterness is vast and infinite. The sea of bitterness is LIFE. A struggle without end is exactly what I'm wishing for."

​

His eyebrows lower sorrowfully, and even as he brings his staff into a ready position he speaks once more. "Put down the knife and immediately become a Buddha."

As my breath quickens, my pulse thuds in my ears. The overlap becomes stronger, the second scene before my eyes clearer with the increased memory-resonance.

Blood all around as I kneel on the floor, shaking. A different man walks toward me, smirking. Calm, complacent. In the corner of my eye, the last fragments of my attention that haven't descended into gibbering terror or despair are fixed on a small butter knife, fallen under the table.

In front of me in the present, a man with a staff running towards me. Once more, "Put down the knife and immediately become a Buddha!".

In front of me in the past, a man with a cruel smile walking towards me. "The sea of bitterness has no end; turn back to the shore." He's telling me to give up.

In my ear, or maybe in my mind's ear, in the past, a whisper--a scattered thought that I cannot yet call my own-- "He's going to kill you. PICK UP THE KNIFE!"

​

I'm terrified, as I was back then. The man in front me of me now is also quite a bit stronger than the one back then. But... the knife in my hand is also quite a bit sharper.

** I typed this out last night so I could make this comment as soon as the thread was posted, to give people the opportunity to bury it if nobody wants to see it, because that would be /totally/ understandable. I really wasn't particularly interested in seeing it myself.

Smack-works sent me a PM that is allegedly supposed to be about covid-19.

One of the things he said in the message is:

#+begin_quote
  Please let rationalists know about that possibility, please don't put your personal opinion about this or about rationality itself in the way of this... ('cause this possibility is too important and stakes are too high)

  (P.S.) All my bans are still in force - I can't make a post or an answer anywhere in lesswrong/HPMOR."
#+end_quote

Apparently he's been banned, so there's that at least.

The thing is, I can't figure out what it actually is that he wants me to tell all you silly rationalists (if you don't remember, he's more intelligent than all of us combined, so I guess it's not surprising that I'm not smart enough to figure it out).

All he said about covid-19 is this:

#+begin_quote
  In every thread I write about COVID (without mentioning it directly) and about old men and about my situation... [The ellipsis is part of his message, I'm not omitting anything, he just trails off.]

  If what described there is truth AND applicable to real people we have a genetic-biological + neurobiological discovery that trumps (by its importance) discoveries of evolution and genes combined, because it is both biological and cognitive discovery (well, by proving just what is in the links we make just an unheard of ground-breaking 20 Nobel Prizes neurobiological discovery, but as a LW-rationalist you will be able to deduce that genetic explanation is the most probable one)
#+end_quote

He included thirteen links to posts that he's made in other subreddits. Every single one of the posts is about the speaking patterns of fictional characters (and also bands like Linkin Park and Nirvana).

He also said to me "I can show you your speech pattern if you want."

There's nothing about covid (either directly or indirectly), nothing about old men, nothing about "his situation," nothing about his "unheard of ground-breaking 20 Nobel Prizes neurobiological discovery," nothing at all about the "possibility" that he said he wanted me to relay to "the rationalists." Just a bunch of rambling about speech patterns.

I haven't messaged him back yet, and I think I probably shouldn't.

I'm not including any of his links. His username is u slash Smack-works, if you're aware of who he is and the posts he's made then you can easily find his "speaking patterns" posts if you're curious enough to inflict that on yourself. I'm just over here like... /Why?/ How the bloody hell is "the speech patterns of fictional characters" supposed to have anything to do with covid-19? And why did he decide to single me out as the messenger of this "theory"? Has he PM'd anybody else?

**** I don't remember when it was, maybe like 6 months or a year ago, and I don't remember if it was on here or on [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]], but he made a post and there was a long discussion there between him and me and somebody else on the topic of whether or not Smack-works is schizophrenic, and apparently Smack-works's native language is Russian, and the other guy spoke Russian as well, and after that other guy had a conversation with Smack-works in Russian he said that Smack-works sounded totally coherent and didn't sound crazy at all. So I think it just sounds like schizophrenia because he's not as good with English as he thinks he is.

But yes, I also think it's strange that his posts on other subreddits have gotten responses so different from the responses to the posts he made over here in this neck of the woods. Maybe it's because he didn't come out of the gate telling the people on those other subreddits that he's smarter than all of them combined and that their worldview is stupid, like he did here.
