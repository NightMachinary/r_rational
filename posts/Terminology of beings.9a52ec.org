** I'm deeply confused by this post. The article is disorganized and incoherent, and as far as I can tell absolutely unrelated to rational fiction.

You've cross posted this grammatically disturbing essay to art subs, worldnews, timetravel, and aliens. Why?

*** A cursory check of OP's posting history suggests that he often posts stuff from the linked site to many subreddits like this, so I'm going to suggest that the answer to your question is that he wrote it, and wants people to see it.
