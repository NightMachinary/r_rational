** I gotta say, I am thoroughly intrigued by this (seemingly) lighter and fluffier alternate timeline, even if I know it probably won't ever be explored further or elaborated on ever again. The little hints of things that somehow went differently (the lack of Bethel and Solace, for example) and offhand references to events that didn't happen in canon (like the "monster of the obsidian plains") definitely spark my imagination.

Also, I can absolutely relate to June's desire for a War on Christmas and I'm glad to see I'm not alone in those feelings.

*** [[https://youtu.be/V7nSKqfBk6k][Carol of the Bells]] is the only Christmas song I actually enjoy. Mostly because it just sounds cool, in a creepy-dramatic way, but also because the juxtaposition with the cheerful lyrics makes Christmas sound like an unstoppable force that will change everything and everyone whether they want it or not.

Which, you know. Accurate.

  “Juniper,” said Amaryllis, looking at my gifts. “Was that the best you could do with wrapping?”

  “You have your own idea of Christmas, and I have mine,” I said. “It's tradition to use too many pieces of tape, have to slap on scrap pieces when you miscalculate how big the boxes are. Or you just put everything in the nicest bags you can find.”
#+end_quote

Since this is [[/r/rational]], I would like [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1140][to note]] that "when recipients open a gift from a friend, they like it less when the giver has wrapped it neatly as opposed to sloppily... [because] recipients set higher (lower) expectations for neatly (sloppily)‐wrapped gifts, making it harder (easier) for the gifts to meet these expectations, resulting in contrast effects that lead to less (more) positive attitudes toward the gifts once unwrapped."

Since first hearing about this effect many years ago, I've rest assured that my sloppy wrapping technique may persist in the ultimate service of friends' joy :D

edit: also, if entad shops exist in the main timeline, why haven't Juniper and co. cleared them out yet? Trivial-sounding effects might be able to interact in strange and powerful ways.

*** Well that's interesting. From the abstract, it sounds like neat wrapping is preferred when the recipient is someone who you have a more ambiguous relationship with, though. I'd be curious to see their experimental setup and data, but not $7 of curious, and I don't have journal access anymore.

In lieu of the actual paper, [[https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2019/12/05/no-it-doesnt-matter-how-nicely-you-wrap-that-gift-except-when-it-does/][here's an article about it]] that reveals some of the deatils.

***** Neat! Thanks!

So as usual for a psychology paper, the test subjects are a bunch of university students, and if you have reason to think they're not representative then that might be a problem. On the other hand, the effect sizes are pretty convincingly large.

I'm a little confused by their study 3. This shows that neat wrapping is preferable for gifts from acquaintances, and sloppy wrapping is preferable from friends. However study 1 involves giving gifts to test participants, and found that they liked the gifts better if they had sloppy wrapping. Do the test-givers count as friends?

** As fun as this story was... I want to analyze it for hints...

- They still got the backpack, I bet the DM had that planned out as fun item, so he ended up with it.

- Locus but no Solace... this would tie into the idea that Solace is holding the Locus back? Or maybe Solace died and Juniper was further skiing with Locus loyalty and managed to leverage that somehow?

- Fenn is still flirty with Joon but he never made a move and they don't seem to be together... maybe the Unicorn blood is the key factor that moved things along.

- Has Juniper not learned Groglir yet on this timeline? No translation of the terms and Grak doesn't switch languages to explain easier so I don't think he has learned it. Also, he originally learned it after Fenn died.

- His blade bound skill is good enough to cut a Christmas tree down. Is his build substantially different? No wait in respec he has level 21 and thus the basic blade bound bonuses... and Nascent blade bound was at level 10 anyway.

- They didn't watch any Christmas movies or listen to Christmas music, +so it seems without the time chamber Amaryllis hasn't been able to tech up as much (but she got some down with her power converter).+ no wait it mentioned at the beginning she had been watching Christmas movies. So Amaryllis managed to work in some teching up time one way or another. I guess Juniper doesn't associate strong feelings/traditions with Christmas movies (with my family we have a few cult classics we always watch every Christmas and a few more we often rewatch, so I subconsciously assumed Juniper would have at least one Christmas movie he wanted to watch).

- It seems without the time chamber Fenn and the others haven't read up on Earth Culture as much? Amaryllis has because of course.

- Entad shop is cool. Interesting to see something like that.

- Valencia still likes Harry Potter!

- interesting that Juniper could anticipate that cutting down the tree might bother the Locus and he could read its facial expression. Maybe a better relationship with the Locus which ties into the conditions that allowed the Locus to escape its limits?

Is the entad shop owner Forty-Two the changeling, Uther's Knight? Because he reacts strangely to Raven being mentioned and apparently looks younger than his age. It seems like a long shot and if the entad works exactly as described his lifeline would be lengthy, but it's also an interesting number to choose.

*** As I conceived it, the Marvelous Moving Mansion has a really inconvenient method of moving around, which is that you turn a bunch of dials and it will find you the spot that most closely matches those parameters, which has all sorts of implications and problems with it.

High wilderness, high urbanization can mean a few different things, depending on how you quantify those, but a few general thoughts:

- If 'urbanization' means lots of people, you could have a more 'wild' city that's grown up without a lot of central planning, infrastructure, etc., something like Kowloon Walled City. Here, this would be interpreted as 'urban wilds'.
- If 'urbanization' means lots of infrastructure and build up, and wilderness means a dominance of wild systems, then you could end up in a city that's undergoing some kind of collapse or turmoil, like a civil war, disaster, or something of that nature.
- Most conventionally, you would have the stereotypical fantasy cities that are completely in harmony with nature, either built in and among the trees, or otherwise with wilderness being a defined part of the city, integrated rather than cleared away.

** Other than the obvious divergences back in Uther's time it feels like Juniper maybe never went for soul magic and so didn't get into a spiraling pissing match with the DM of trying to break the world. He's actually trying to become a god through straight levels. Maybe it's just a non-postmodernist version of Aerb. Either way, I'd definitely read this version of Worth the Candle too.
