Are there any 'modern' fantasy stories that fall under the rational fiction tag? I've had someone recommend the Dresden Files to me, but I was wondering if there was anything else out there that counts. Also, I posted about my own story a few days ago, and I really appreciate the feedback and criticism! It means a lot, and it's super motivating! I'm sorry if that sounds annoying or self promote-y. I'm just super thankful for it all.


** N. K. Jemisin just published a badass book called /The City We Became/ this year about the avatars of the boroughs of NYC awakening to fight off an extradimensional threat. It's fucking cool, and the audiobook has the best production quality/sound editing of any I've ever listened to (which is a lot).

** I personally really like the lore books for the Tabletop RPG Vampire: the Masquerade. They are all self contained stories, so you don't need to know much about the RPG itself.

Just to give a little glimpse of the setting, stories follow vampires who belong to one of the 13 Clans, each with unique abilities and cursed in a different way.

These aren't sexy twilight vampires though, they are predators who are clinging to their humanity and playing out a facsimile of a mortal life in order to keep their urges at bay.

All of the Vampires descend from Caine, who was cursed by God to walk the earth for all eternity. Thus he is the first generation vampire. As you go down the generations, Caine's blood gets more diluted and vampires become weaker.

In the current Modern Nights, blood has weakened so much that there are now half vampire/half human hybrids that are extremely weak, but are also able to walk under sunlight and not suffer much from the vampiric curse. Elder vampires consider this as a sign of the end times, but they like to keep things close to their chests and vampires younger than a few centuries usually have no idea about it.

While the street level stories of vampire skulduggery and murder is going on, there is a hidden global intrigue between millennia old elder vampires. Some of them are trying to awaken their Clan's progenitors, also known as Antediluvians, while others are trying to prevent it lest they all be destroyed. It is also possible that both sides are merely puppeteered by Antediluvians themselves through subtle mind control. Antediluvians are 3rd generation vampires with god-like abilities, however it is in doubt whether they are dead, alive or in torpor which is vampiric hibernation.

** Pact/Pale (by Wildbow) is a worthy mention. Obviously Wildbow doesn't write 100% rational stuff, but one feature of all his stories is the extent to which the worlds are explained using logically consistent rules, and Pact/Pale (which are set in the same world, but disconnected from each other) are no exception.

I especially like how he explains the masquerade, which is IMO the hardest thing to get right about urban fantasy: everyone, from humans to supernatural creatures, are incentivized to keep the existence of magic secret for a bunch of really good reasons. Particularly interesting is Karma, because for everyone you bring in you're responsible for some of the negative Karma they gain, which means both that you don't want to bring in too many people, and that you want to carefully vet the people that you do bring in.

Also they have Wildbow's usual standard of interesting powers and characters whose motivations are thought through and shown well, but that goes without saying. Pact is a bit too intense throughout for a lot of people's taste and doesn't do a great job of showing off a lot of the cool worldbuilding it sets up, but Pale makes up for both those problems and was intended to do so without requiring people to read Pact first.

***** The best way to describe Pact is an extended million word fight scene, but not one of those martial arts ones. It's the fight scenes where the hero gets stabbed three times in the stomach, and half the fight is just exhausted, sweaty men trying to stand up because they are that tired and in pain, and by the end of the scene he's killing the other guy by drowning him in a blocked urinal.

** I'll toss in the Rivers of London series, which follows a young British Policeman as he is launched into the world of supernatural crime, British wizardry, and local gods.

Part urban fantasy, part police procedural, this series is a great companion to the Dresden Files. It has many of the other series' charms, with very few of its flaws (power creep, male fantasy, deus ex machina).

The audiobooks are truly among my very favorite; the voice actor really personifies the MC in a way that few Voice Actors can.

The worldbuilding is strong and deep, the banter is snappy and witty, the characters are realistically flawed and human, and each book manages a tidy plot while tying in with a larger story arc. The series is less rational and more rational-adjacent.

8/10 would recommend to any Urban fantasy fan.

** If I'm allowed to plug my own work briefly: The Daily Grind is a modern exploration of how normal people would react to the discovery of a classical D&D style dungeon. Except the dungeon looks like an eternity of cubicles, and the monsters are staplers.

First few chapters are iffy, but the writing does improve over time quite a lot.

** I highly recommend the Skullduggery Pleasant series. It's urban fantasy with some pretty impressive magic being thrown around. Plus you get some nice scenes where the book goes "OK so we know how this is a trope in books, so we going to specifically not do that." which is pretty nice. Some examples of magic being used:

Flying, walking in walls, teleportation, fireballs, folks getting their head ripped off then putting it back on with blood magic and regenerating the damage, true name magic, etc.

**** Yeh it's honestly a pretty good series. Pretty long too. First 9 books are a great self contained story I can vouch for. After I haven't had a chance to read. It starts off kinda small scale and such, but eventually you get some pretty impressive stuff being thrown around. Good humour too (from what I remember. Been a bit.).

One joke I remember abit:

Two characters discussing how to infiltrate an enemy lair. 1st character: OK I'll go first and scout out if it's safe. 2nd: Why? 1st character: because I want you to be safe. 2nd: But if you go and it's not safe and you die I won't be able to get out of here alone. And that's not safe. 1st: True. But then I'd be dead so I won't be around to feel bad about that.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28687/the-last-science-se][The Last Science by Etzoli]]

In emergence of Magic in modern world, magic is seen as new science, although not all magic is bound by natural science and even straight out ignore physics law it's clear that magic have pattern and have it's own rule. First batches of newly awakened people are from college and surrounding area, they learn magic by pattern, make hypothesis, try discovering it's limit, and it's own rule, creating dozens of spells, incorporated natural science to those spells then trying various ideas, learn where they make mistake and where the succeed at, lot of experimentation in the process of learning. They approach magic with scientific method.

With all potential and wonderful things magic will bring it also causes problem, complication and conflict among everyone involved. Also the story narrated from multiple point of views, readers may not agree with some characters but you can see the reason and train of thought of characters and understand why they behave like that.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28307/the-zombie-knight-saga][Zombie Knight Saga]] is really fun, and surprisingly consistent (even rational at parts). The premise is that the main character dies in chapter one, and is revived as a "servant" to one of many grim reapers, which nets him powers.

Really good power usage and powers in general. Worldbuilding too, although that takes a while to really show itself. Some villains come off a bit cartoonish imo but it's not handled in a bad way. It's the closest thing you can get to Hunter x Hunter in literary form.

** unironically, I would recommend the *Sookie Stackhouse* series (also known as Southern Mysteries) as well as *True Blood* - the TV series based on these books.

Now, the series is (mostly) vampire romance, but it tends to deal semi-rationally with all of the practical questions one might have about the supernatural. Like, how exactly can vampires inherit wealth? How can the do taxes? If vampiric blood can heal humans, should there be a vamp on hand in every hospital? What would be the social, economic, and political ramifications of vampires "coming out of the coffin" and artificial blood being invented for them?

My favorite little bit about the series is that the vamps in it do not have vampire fangs in places of their canines, which would be extremely awkward to feed with: they have pointy "rattlesnake fangs" over their lateral incisors, that snap into place for feeding. This way, their fangs actually match the fang marks on a victim, and do not require them to gnaw through the neck to reach it with their canines; as would be necessary with the "traditional" type of vampire fangs.
