** Not only is this story a work of science-fiction/science-fantasy fanfiction, a genre I know is dear to our sub's heart, it features a rationalist protagonist, a rational antagonist, and AI safety.

*** It's a story that's basically built around modern concepts and lingo that's wearing Star Wars like a skin.

A crudely scalped, stapled together skin.

The part that amused me was that Rey is set up as this HPMOR-style character and never actually does anything.

Thanks for sharing it, though.
