** Is this interesting to someone who's fairly familiar with 40K but only knows about Evangelion by osmosis? The total of my knowledge is approximately 'Giant Robot Anime deconstruction, the robots are their mothers, they kill angels, Shinji should stop whining about the unexpected harem and get in the fucking robot already.'

**** I'm a little unclear why he wasn't getting in the robot in the first place. The obvious reason would be 'He is a teenager and is too busy having sex with the unexpected harem', except that I'm pretty sure he was not doing that, and also the harem were in their own mom-robots? You'd think some combination of "Man, that's a Giant Robot!" and "Oh god oh god we're all gonna die" would work for anything short of hormone-induced stupidity.

But I'll take a look in any case.

***** In the first episode, he very nearly dies to the angel well before he gets anywhere near the robot. Then he was a couple kilometers from an N^{2} mine, which is supposed to be as close to a nuke as you can get without actually using nuclear material.

Also keep in mind that he's been isolated from people for most of his life (i.e. 14 years!), his father abandoned him when he was quite young when his mom died, and he suffers from a catastrophic lack of self-confidence.

Then he's shown this fucking terrifyingly huge robot (which, as he is told in the very same scene he sees it, isn't a robot but a biological mecha), told there's a 0.0000000001% chance of him successfully activating it, /but please please make it work or we'll all die./

And /then/ dear ol dad comes back, says that he basically amounts to nothing, and tells him to get in the very same robot which killed his mother.

**** I do not remember if it was Niven canon, or from another author's short story in the universe, but at one point humanity met an extremely capable non-scream-and-leap covert operations kzin who was apparently a messenger for the Kzin empire. He indicated that the Kzin attacking humanity were basically the dregs of fringe nobility, their personnel untrained compared to Kzin official military forces. They were allowed to attack humanity because the only other way to keep them from causing havoc within the Kzin empire itself would be to engage in civil war. If humanity pressed an attack against the Kzin empire, all sorts of hell was going to break loose.

**** Not just Fan Fiction. Most amateur entertainment writers have this problem. They get a great idea, and maybe it is legitimately a great idea. The story carries itself for many chapters, and then the writer realizes they had a great idea, but, uh, how does it end? Sometimes they just stare at the screen a few days and drop it, sometimes they continue it lamely. Sometimes, I'm sure, natural instincts supply a solution that's good enough to not be flat.

I know damn well I'm guilty of exactly that in my earliest writing, and I'm only starting to really understand how writing for entertainment actually /works./

****** A lot of books have been written on how to write a story. I'd never read any of them, flying by the seat of my pants for over a million words, with hints and minimal guidance from other people. Then I bought a book about plot and structure - the author doesn't speak in literary mumbo-jumbo (except to poke at it now and then, and draw attention to what the literary jargon actually means), and it really opened my eyes. I really have high hopes for my next story after Set In Stone, and future Set In Stone books.

Not going to plug the plot and structure book here, again (I have mentioned it before, but I really feel uncomfortable constantly plugging it publically) but if you want the name of the book, send me a PM.
