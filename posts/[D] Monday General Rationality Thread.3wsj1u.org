Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** What do people here do? From what I remember of the last time we had a survey, the average age of [[/r/rational]] was somewhere in the twenties. And of course we're all nerds even by the standards of Reddit.

So are you a student? Do you work for a living? In either case, is it in a field related to rationality or writing? Are there any full-time authors in the subreddit (living the dream)?

I'm planning to be a stay-at-home dad in the near future, probably with some software/web contract work on the side and downtime devoted to writing and editing (more of the latter than the former). I'm 29 years old, white, and male, if you want demographics. I live in the northern half of the Midwest.

*** Twenty year-old college student double-majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I'm planning on going to graduate school for cognitive science research since I'm more interested in studying brains than trying to recreate a brain out of silicon.

Shockingly, cognitive science is helping me to learn more about AI related stuff than actual computer science classes on AI. It's probably due to the fact that I'm taking specialized classes which overlaps my two majors, but /still/.

Hopefully cognitive science will allow me to better practice rationality skills, but with the publish-or-perish problems in academia, I kinda doubt it.

I don't really have any interest in being a full-time writer, but I still want to try writing a book at some point.

***** I know right?!? Cognitive science's where I first learned about neural nets and Bayes nets, and how to actually program them. In AI classes, we keep spending time on how to represent logical systems and do inference and deductive algorithms which nearly anyone can tell, after a few months, are mostly useless for real-world tasks. Stuff which uses probabilities in some way to represent uncertainty, such as mixture models, are the way to go.

What are they doing spending an entire /year/ on AI methodology from the 1990s or earlier? That's a fourth of my college years and I want to just freaking skip ahead to the cutting-edge research already!!! And no, I don't think I actually need that much of a grounding in the basics to get the more relevant stuff. My teacher basically admitted the same thing.

For all I know it might be different in the really advanced classes, but it's taking so long to get there and I'm finding cognitive science research to be so fascinating that I've decided to not continue with computer science research in grad school.

One might expect this to be a job that trains rationality skills, but, largely due to the publish-or-perish pressures of the job, I'm finding that not to be the case at all; if anything, my job trains you to make superficially plausible arguments which pass sanity checks from reviewers skimming your work.

***** Check out my oldest Powerpoint on the subject. Metacognition: Tricks and Traps in Differential Diagnosis.

[[http://www.slideshare.net/notmy2ndopinion/differential-diagnosis-16351069]]

slide 13 and 25 are about the Dual-Process Model and slide 28 is about the realities of trying to balance Intuition and Intellect in the hospital.

Slide 37 illuminates some of the current strategies that master clinicians employ, but there's further research into things like cognitive debiasing.

I also advocate for avoiding "Analysis Paralysis" which is really about being an efficient third year clerkship student. This means taking only 5-10 minutes to think intensely hard on a problem, finding an evidence based solution quickly (using information mastery) and then moving on.

Discovered Tyler Cowen a few years ago. Then Bryan Caplan last year. Then SlateStarCodex earlier this year. Scott somehow introduced me to HPATMOR and the Sequences. Then I found this Reddit in the last six months-ish. You all introduced me to Worm, Metropolitan Man, and the fantastic challenges. Only disappointment is when you all went to 2-week challenges. I miss reading your stuff every Wednesday...

My goal next year is to write two books. First priority is a non fiction about situations where "good enough" should be the goal (Malcolm Gladwell style with better science). The second is fiction about children superheroes and the conflict between two in particular. One with the ability to move her consciousness back in time into her younger body and the other an effective super human intelligent "AI" (to use terminology from this Reddit)

These are two studies that appear to reach opposite conclusions on whether antidepressants cause autism after controlling for level of depression. The first of these was frontpage at reddit today.

*** The study seems to single out SSRIs in particular, but the fact that taking /any/ antidepressants had a negative effect makes me suspicious.

They have a large number of different mechanisms, some acting on entirely different neurotransmitters (e.g. NRIs, tricyclics, MAOIs), and if they all have a similar result then perhaps it is the condition being treated that causes the result (or, alternatively, it applies to a larger class of psychoactive drugs than just antidepressants).

That said, I have no medical background and can't critique it from that perspective. I just get suspicious when somebody finds an effect which is at an unusual level of specificity (in this case, singling out antidepressants vs. all psychoactive drugs vs. specific classes of antidepressant).

#+begin_quote
  The risk was persistent even after taking into account maternal history of depression (29 exposed infants; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03-2.97).
#+end_quote

From the second study's abstract:

#+begin_quote
  In models adjusted for sociodemographic features, antidepressant exposure prior to and during pregnancy was associated with ASD risk, but risk associated with exposure during pregnancy was no longer significant after controlling for maternal major depression (odds ratio (OR) 1.10 (0.70-1.70)).
#+end_quote

The difference there seems to be whether they're adjusting for *maternal depression* or *severity of maternal depression*. This would explain the two different results. I don't know whether this is actually the case though, since the articles are behind paywalls - that's just a guess based on what I can see.

(The argument would basically be that "pregnant women with depression" and "pregnant women with depression /and on medication/" are substantially different populations because the ones on medication are more likely to be /severely/ depressed, so you don't just need to correct for depression, you need to correct for severity of depression.)

** I need a quick math sanity check.

I have a hyperdimensional glorp emitter that emits in four dimensions. I place this somewhere on a flat plane and then walk away from it. I pull out my emissions tester and it tests at a 0.5 glorps. From this, I can infer a circle around the transmitter with a radius equal to my distance from it. Inside the circle, the emissions tester will read at /more/ than 0.5 glorps, while outside the circle it will read at /less/ than 0.5 glorps.

Let's say that I want to increase the size of that two-dimensional circle. If the glorp emitter were merely three-dimensional, doubling the area of the circle would be as simple as doubling the power of my glorp emitter. The intensity is given by 1/r^{2} and the area is given by πr^{2} which means that they're both proportional. A circle with an area of 4 will have a minimum intensity of half that of a circle with an area of 2.

However, my glorp transmitter /is/ hyperdimensional and while the area of a circle is proportional to the square of the radius, the intensity of a hyperdimensional emission follows the inverse-*cube* law. If you want to double the size of the glorp circle, you don't just double the power of the emitter, you multiply it by 282.84%.

So first, I want to make sure that all of that is correct.

Second, I got that specific number at the end from entering numbers into some formulas in excel, so that I would have a chart of the relationship between intensity, area, and radius, but I'm a little unclear on why that's the case from a mathematical standpoint. The relationships I keep coming up with don't seem like they properly explain it.

Formulas:

1. The surface area of a hypersphere is given by 2π^{2} * r^{3} where r is the radius.
2. Emissions that are four dimensional rather than three dimensional therefore follow an inverse cube law instead of an inverse square law. This is given by 1/d^{3} where d is the distance.
3. The area of a circle is given by A=πr^{2} where r is the radius.
4. The radius of a circle, given the area, is √(A/π).

*** The circle is an abstraction, a two-dimensional slice of a four dimensional hyperspace. The surface area of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere][glome]] is proportional to the cube of the radius (everything else is a constant), necessitating an inverse cube law. The area of the imaginary circle has nothing to do with it.

Assuming emissions strength /s/ and tester distance /r/ from a 3 dimensional source, the measured intensity will be determined by s/r^{2} . If the distance becomes 2r, that's what gets squared which means that in order to keep the intensity constant, it requires a /quadrupling/ of the source strength: (2r)^{2} = 4r^{2.}

In four dimensions, the inverse cube law requires an /octupling/ of source strength in order to double the radius of the imaginary circle if you want to keep measured intensity constant: (2r)^{3} = 8r^{3}

Don't let the imaginary circle get in the way of your calculations.

**** It's that circle that I care about. This is (predictably) for something that I'm writing. (Maybe I should have led with that, but I like keeping things under wraps. Sorry for any confusion.)

Imagine that the emitter is a cell tower. Now imagine that if you ever have less than a certain amount of cell signal, you die. In that case, you probably build your entire civilization around these cell towers and what you're really interested in is the circle that's formed on the surface of the earth, because that's what defines total livable space.

If you double the radius of the circle, you have to quadruple the source strength, but that doesn't matter because you also get to quadruple the livable area (and you don't really care about volume).

But if the emitter is emitting in four dimensions, then the relationship between surface area of the two-dimensional slice of a four-dimensional sphere (the slice which defines your livable land) shares this different relationship with signal intensity.

Edit: I think I have it figured out. If you want to increase area by /x/ that means increasing signal strength by /x/^{3/2} which gives 2.82 as a result when I feed in 2 (for doubling the area).
