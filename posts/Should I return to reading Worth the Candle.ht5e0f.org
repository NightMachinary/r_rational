I absolutely loved WtC for 100 chapters or so. However, I eventually dropped it for a specific reason. I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to advise me on whether that reason was really true, or if the story takes a turn and does something different. Spoilers incoming:

As the story goes on, the plot driver increasingly becomes narrative theory. Juniper believes that the narrative needs to escalate in a specific way: as he becomes more powerful, the encounters and challenges will also become more powerful, at the exact level required to provide a serious, potentially unwinnable situation. Furthermore, he'll experience personal losses, in his relationships, that are more or less inevitable. There's more to it than that, but I think that's a decent summary.

My issue with this is that it made the story feel really, really predictable. True, I didn't know exactly what wacky event or villain would pop up next. But I knew the narrative shape of it -- because Juniper seemed to be correct in his narrative theory, which he endlessly expounded and agonized over in between encounters. It began to feel like Shakespearean tragedy -- knowing that tragedy is coming and helpless to really do anything about it -- which largely doesn't interest me.

Anyway, to be clear it's a great story, top 10 in the genre IMO, I just got exhausted by the feeling it gave me as a reader. I already tried picking it back up once and read up to the chapters with Mome Rath, but those chapters only further confirmed what I was feeling about the story. I want to read more if it changes, though.


** The next arc kinda maxes out what you are describing, but the latest published arc published (ending chapter 205) pays it off really well and dramatically changes things. I'm looking forward to the next arc, I think the characters are developing in novel ways.

***** That's been my hope too, with Juniper's belief in how the narrative theory "ought to work" being the actual reason why it is currently verifying, all because the DM makes the world work the way the PC expects it should work ; and this being a future point that Juniper and gang have to disprove to Arthur once they eventually meet him - so that Arthur realizes his being trapped by narrative was all his own doing in the first place.

I.e. regarding the plot, the tension was pretty low for a good part of the third arc, once it was determined that the red robe has fled the loop.

That said I was one of the "Wow, this story was a great ride and I'm so sad it's over! ....here's hoping for an epilogue!" people, and the person you're replying to had completely missed the point behind these comments (the point was, we want more of the good stuff, not that the story was bad.

****** Oof, Worm's author is offender #1 when it comes to writing predictable challenges that scale to exceed the power of the characters by the precise amount needed to be nearly impossible. He's gotten worse about it over time, too. I tried to start Ward a couple weeks ago and had to nope out after the first fight, because it was just a frustrating, shitty mess of "ooh I'm slightly too strong for you".

I actually felt like WtC was partially based on wanting to call out the narrative theory cycle that produces that kind of stuff. And that was even fun, until it went on for too long.

***** Eh, I wouldn't call everything else garbage, not by a long shot. I think LitRPG is actually much harder to rationalize and turn into a believable story than the broader fantasy genre, because it's inherently about something trivial (a game) that has no reasonable purpose for existing (especially looking at the grimderp System Apocalypse stories here).

WtC kind of slides around that criticism by acknowledging that the world is fucking ridiculous and utterly broken, and that the reason for that is that it's a poorly cobbled together collection of ideas from a single person, and also only exists to antagonize that same person. In other words, it didn't find a "solution" for the challenge facing the genre as a whole, it just created a very specific solution for itself -- and that solution still has the potential to fall apart when the story reveals the full justification for it.

Some other stories are trying to create fully-fledged worlds that matter for more than a single character and/or provide a solution that would work for the whole genre, and I think that's worth points for effort, and mega points for success, if any should actually succeed.

For example, The Wandering Inn was barely readable to me at first and I dropped it like 5 times during the first couple arcs but I think it's genuinely good now, I look forward to the releases every week. Practical Guide to Evil was really roughly written at first too and I love that one now as well.

I'm basing that solely off arcs 6 and 7, but I think it's fair to consider the latest 2 million words of a 5 million word fiction. The problem is how a new reader would get into it. Skimming? That's unique to webfic; no traditional fantasy author ever had to worry about spending their entire career on one ongoing story, and they all have notoriously bad stories / series that got buried under new stuff (e.g. Glen Cook's Dread Empire versus the Black Company).

Similarly to TWI, I tried PGtE and bounced out early on, but never gave it another chance. We've been arguing all through this thread but I suspect we're actually seem pretty similar in terms of taste, so I guess I'm going to pull up my socks and give it a real try. Thanks (if I don't hate it).

It's long-winded but I honestly prefer that in a serial. The author is insane no idea how she churns out 40-60k words a week this consistently.

But yeaaah I've never been able to recommend it to a friend lol. "Just lightly read/skim the first 1 million words and it gets great I swear!" Not the best sell.

And yeah I'm pretty convinced our taste is very similar, hope you didn't get the impression I was arguing angrily or anything, just a good discussion. I would thoroughly recommend PGtE, it's the same situation as Wandering Inn where the first 1/2 arcs are very mediocre but it gets much better. I think I've heard English isn't the authors first language and if true it makes perfect sense, it becomes more and more fluid as it goes.

********** Gotta chime in that you need to read Practical. The first arc is a little slow, but particularly from book 2 onward it's absolutely on another level compared to anything else on TWF or on Royal Road. From your comment I may need to give Wandering Inn a 3rd try, I kept getting stopped at the first or second chapter. Honestly it being insanely long is a plus for me, I keep knocking out million word stories in a week and as long as I know it gets better I'll probably stick it out. The writing in the first chapter and a half is almost painfully stilted though.

But, it's a long haul to reach the very best material. My advice: if a particular character annoys you, just skip their sections. A lot of readers apparently do that for characters they find disagreeable or morally objectionable.

Mostly the the negative things i see from other readers is that it's too long or that pirateaba changes character perspectives too often. But all the people that say that just don't get the story or the format it feels like. It's a huge story and it's gonna take years and years to tell it properly.

******* The webfics, not all LitRPG, that I have open on my phone right now (meaning I'm at least mildly interested in another chapter) are The Wandering Inn, Wake of the Ravager, Delve, the Zombie Knight, Seaborn, A Journey of Black and Red, Blessed Time, Returning, and the Menocht Loop. Some other stuff I like, such as The Gilded Hero, update so infrequently that I periodically forget they exist.

** Honestly, I kind of like the narrative thing, because we're never /entirely/ sure whether it's actually true, or just something Juniper is seeing due to his own background. Maybe Aerb does run on Joon-style narrative. But maybe it runs on Arthur-style narrative, which is subtly different. Or maybe it's neither; it's just that Joon and Arthur came close to getting the framework right.

Essentially, we still don't know if there are underlying frameworks that Joon is missing entirely, which could become problematic. He seems to have found something which is broadly correct, but the world is stuffed to the gills with weird shit that can suddenly leap out and be horrifying. We already know that there are memetic agents, memory-wipers, and ways to alter people fundamentally. How do we know that such things didn't happen to Arthur - and might have /already happened/ to Joon and co?

** This is really funny. I think the reason you dropped the fic-- that it's getting too predictable, I think that's exactly what the author is going for 😂

I may be wrong, of course. It just struck me that I do that kind of thing all the time :)

**** I think he is going for it as well, but I think he is doing it to subvert it.

The way I view it is that it was necessary for the narrative theory to be addressed in character due to the plot. But further than that I think it's a predictable sequence for a little while because the author is trying to make sure we "get" how the meta-narrative system works (kind of like PGtE, if you've ever read that, but in a more acknowledged way).

I'm not quite sure when you stopped, but after it's established to an extent the author begins to subvert it and play with it. Because now that the characters are aware of it, it's no longer a useful way to predict what happens sort of thing. If I knew when you stopped and what specific parts you took issue with I might be able to better answer if it gets subverted or not.

** While in the begining of the story, the difficulty of encounters was obviously being scaled to his combat power, more it seems that obstacles are being crafted to challenge his own growth. To pass a specific obstacle he must overcome one of his personal failings, instead of just figure out how to hit very hard.

While to a point can be a different brand of predictable, I think it still allows a varied and shifting story.

***** I actually think that was the intention of the entire conclusion to that book. To demonstrate once and for all that Juniper has reached a level beyond comprehension/mortal levels. I'm not sure where the author is going to go with it, but I think the exclusion zone with Doris is better in the end because of it. That we are back to him solving problems with guile now that he has demonstrated that most simple martial challenges in the world are binary for him (either he will obviously win, or obviously not).

** If you're into literary rpgs I'm liking Elemental Arena. I'd place it in the same bracket as Delve. Elemental Arena is above in pacing, perhaps as it's earlier on in its development and still has a kind of frantic energy that comes from a life or death story, but I also really like how well integrated the system is into Delve's world.
