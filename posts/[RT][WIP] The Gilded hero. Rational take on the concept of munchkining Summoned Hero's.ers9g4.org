** I just caught up to this fiction, which hasn't been on RR for even a month yet, and it is probably one of my favourite Isekai Stories already.

It is a rational breakdown of a fantasy world in which a King somehow managed to glitch the hero summoning Ritual to work on repeat. So he naturally became the most powerful person around.

The story is from the perspective of a 'hero' summoned possibly 100's of years later. Where the summoning of heroes is now an institution, and heroes now a commodity, if a valuable one.

He is a rational character with pretty solid development so far, though the story is still rather early in its run, with less than 200 pages.

Please give it a shot, I know being a RR author is tough, and I would love to see this succeed.

*** I am caught up and I enjoyed the 40 chapters. It is a realistic take on isekai. It always bother me on how romanticized Isekai is. How being put in an isekai scenario is a dream come true. The author knows that to and so far there is no wish fulfillment, harem, or OP cheat abilities.

**** Well, he /does/ have an OP cheat ability, it just isn't unique or particularly valuable to him specifically.

***** What OP cheat ability? The general accelerated growth is given to all the summoned heros so I wouldn't call it an OP cheat ability. Other than that, he has high intelligence and wisdom, which is mostly useless to him right now.

****** The hero growth is OP, in context of their world, it says that the Hero's can gain stats in days when the average person requires months. It doesn't /seem/ OP so far, but it has gained him some interesting niche skills that will likely only continue.

******* Yeah fair enough, his growth is quite OP, but all the other Heroes seem to have the same growth rate, so I wouldn't say it's a cheat. I think the real OP cheat will prove to be his ridiculous INT and WIS stats.

******** You might be right, though his INT and WIS may be high for a Newbie, we don't know what an actual Mage's intelligence and Wisdom look like. Also, from what has been hinted at, the physical stats aren't just physical, STR might have something like Willpower rolled into it, from what we have seen.

*** that's funny, because I love the prose. Simple and to the point.

Though to be fair when ever a book is overly prose heavy I tend to skip large sections of the writing.

*** Haha, well it is RR can't expect perfection. The author says they are doing it mostly for fun, which is kinda worrying for longevity but explains why he isn't seeking absolute perfection.

Honestly, it is /much/ better than most Webnovel.

** I like it, but there's a ton of punctuation errors that are really annoying.

That said, it shows good character development and world-building, and is definitely better than 99% of the isekais "hero summoned to beat the demon lord" or "hero gets a trash skill...until they use it properly!" stories.

The ending for chapter 41 was great.

*** Punctuation errors and rookie errors are just something that needs to be accepted when reading most WN's and amateur stories. The Author isn't a professional writer and doesn't have the time to go over the story with a fine tooth comb to find all of the misplaced commas and incorrect capitalisations.

I feel like encouraging these authors for the work they have done is more beneficial than shouting them down for not being perfect.

And yes, chapter 41's ending is great, I just want more!

*** Not yet, the author has shown that he is reliable with his previous story, but the latest chapter had a monologue about how this isn't a business and he is just doing it for fun. That screams to me of someone who doesn't want to commit too much to something, for fear of getting burned. So we will have to wait and see, I hope he sticks with it, cause it's a great story and definitely has potential.
