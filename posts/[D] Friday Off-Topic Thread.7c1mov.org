Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

--------------

Many thanks for the responses to last week's whinefest, both here and on Discord.  After considering the problem for a bit, I've decided to set combat aside for a little bit and work on revamping the Bill's PC tool that was prematurely started at the beginning of this project.  Many of the issues with working on a combat system involve the sheer number of immaterial prerequisites that exist, and so hopefully by switching gears I'll both rekindle some motivation while addressing those concerns somewhat.

Bill's PC (for those just tuning in) was [[https://imgur.com/a/pUlOy][an app for composing Pokemon JSON files]].  At the time that it was dropped, it could save and load type definitions, species definitions, and move definitions, as well as do fancy things like mass import from Bulbapedia and do a fancy [[https://i.imgur.com/uKh8uv8.png][graph stat compare]] to help visualize the differences between authored pokemon.

I was actually quite happy with the way it turned out, and it would have continued to be the canonical JSON authoring tool I used if not for a fatal blunder: I had not realized at the time that WPF is an absolutely Windows-only framework, considered too complicated to be worth porting to other systems via mono and their ilk.  This was a surprise to me, and was unacceptable; I myself don't care to use Linux or Mac, but I also don't care to restrict the users of these programs, not when it's reasonably easy for me to build things in a cross-platform manner.

With that major lesson in mind, I got it into my head to make the new version of Bill's PC web-based, which would solve some problems while bringing in a host of new ones, the first and foremost being that I don't know hardly anything about coding for the web.  (I've maintained API endpoint servers before in ASP.NET where the fact that it's a web server is basically a minor, incidental detail, but that's practically tangential.)  I'm fairly confident that I can pick it up, based mostly on the fact that I previously picked up Lua and SupCom modding over the course of a week, but that might still turn out to be horribly arrogant of me, so I guess we'll see.

My starting point was “write a mostly client-based web app in javascript” and thus began a slog of blog posts and wiki diving trying to find what the best framework to do this in would be.  (I'm not interested in reinventing the wheel and building everything from scratch, why do it when the javascript community can do even that for me?  :V)  I mostly want an out-of-the-box framework that will tame the web somewhat for me without requiring oodles of frontend-specific experience.

Finding posts appealing to my background has been surprisingly hard.  Most everything has been either for frontend gurus and so using jargon that is way over my head at this point, or targeting Babby's First Programming Language and thus a waste of my time.  I eventually gave up and just took a stab at choosing a framework based on vague gut-level feelings, which landed on me experimenting with Ember.js.  So far it seems to be alright, from the perspective of someone with nothing else on the web to compare it to, so barring any last-minute revelations or advice, I'll probably end up sticking with it sheerly through momentum.

That said, any advice?  Framework, library, or tutorial recommendations?  Angular, Vue, and Backbone all came up in my searches, and I will probably look at them if ember doesn't work out (in roughly that order of precedence), but I'm really just stabbing at shadows, here.  Feel free to help me change my mind.

*** Looks like you named all of the most popular frameworks which handle frontend development aside from React. That omission seems kinda surprising to me since I've gotten the impression that it's /the/ most popular. That said, I consume a fair amount of media related to web development and it's my impression that you can't really go horribly wrong by choosing any of them.

I personally use Backbone for day-to-day development at work, but I wouldn't recommend it over any of the alternatives you mentioned for a few different reasons:

- It seems to generally be considered outdated.
- It's less prescriptive about /how/ you do things. That's not inherently a downside, but it can be pretty bad when you're working in an unfamiliar area. It's like being tossed a box of tools and told to have at it. The end result can be pretty hard to maintain if you don't have the knowledge and discipline needed to use a consistent design throughout.
- It's not really "batteries included", which means it's up to you to choose how to fill in the gaps and make sure everything works well together.

I guess that's :+1: from this internet stranger. Good luck!

**** The reasons you list as downsides for backbone are largely the reasons I chose not to even bother persuing React, with the exception of age. It's apparently got almost no structure to it, in exchange for having the best handling for UI all things considered, to the point where some people use React /on top of/ one of the other frameworks to get the best of both worlds. This isn't really a positive for me (as you point out), since I'm a beginner and prefer to have some structure to lean on. Plus, I'm a C# developer; I'm /used/ to having a certain amount of prescription to go off of, and I'm not sure I'll ever really want a truly wide-open sandbox.

Thanks for the second opinion, tho! It's good to see I haven't veered /too/ far off the beaten path.

*** I've worked a lot in Vue the last few months, and I'm pretty fond of it. I've only glanced at the other frameworks, but I feel like Vue is the most "declarative" of them; in that most of your code describes what you want to get, not how you want to get it.

The Vue.js approach to say "I want to have one version of this tag for each element of this array" (a scenario that comes up pretty often) is to add a v-for attribute to your tag; the React.js approach involves string concatenation.

That said, I would probably recommend React.js over any other framework, because I think it's the one most likely to be maintained on the long term.

** So, I'm applying for a job - give myself a 10% chance of getting it, 50% chance of being interviewed. Deadline's Monday at midday, at which point the job I'm currently doing will be advertised (I've been told) and I'll have to apply for /that/ (I'm currently doing that job but being paid for a lower level job, it's more complicated than that but it's close enough).

Anyway, to apply for government jobs in Australia, you have to write basically a 1 page essay on 3 different "selection criteria" - so basically, 3 long answer questions about why you are good at things, with examples (my three are road and bridge design, construction and maintenance; project and contract management; and managing financial and other resources). I /also/ need to submit a resume but it's not nearly as important. They'll use my selection criteria to work out if they want to interview me, the resume will be a tiebreaker/sanity check (e.g. if I said I managed a road project but my resume only shows me working at McDonald's), and they'll interview me, if they like me they'll contact my referees, my referees will have to /fill out a form/ that it is /illegal to lie on/ saying I can do all the things that are on their list of job requirements, and then if I'm in the top after all that, I'll get offered the job! Yay! (and the $15/week payrise!! DOLLA DOLLA BILLS Y'ALL).

People in the [[https://complice.co/room/lesswrong][lesswrong productivity chatroom]] (recommended, shameless plug) are quite surprised at this process; they're more used to the more typical process (that is used for most jobs here; it's the government that's weird) where you submit your resume, they contact your referees, you go through a few rounds of interviews, and you're offered the job or not. (Or: your uncle's friend needs a software engineer and you get the job through sheer nepotism).

But surely, there must be other "standard procedures" for applying for certain jobs in your neck of the woods, dear reader? Or is it just the Australian government that is weird?

(btw the stated reason for this process is it's meant to be less discriminatory because you're judging them on their ability to do work rather than judging which school they went to, who they worked for, etc)

(aside: I asked my current manager if he'd be one of my referees. I gave him the list of job requirements and said please make sure he can endorse me for all of those because if a referee can't endorse you that's kind of bad. I've been working for this guy a good 10 months. He says he can't endorse me for having skills in e.g. road and bridge design because the road and bridge design I do isn't /identical/ to the type of road and bridge design I'd be doing in the new job. He did this for a bunch of items on the list. This was rather shocking as the job is open to the general public, so they are quite willing to hire someone who doesn't even have experience doing work in the same organisation, but apparently my manager thinks that because I design $9 million road projects I'm completely unqualified to ever design $100 million road projects! /rant)

*** Uncivil engineers are better. They don't depend on government to get a job.

But yeah, that process is real screwed up. I understand that government processes are driven by a CYA mentality, and every screw-up is answered by more WTFery. Hence the laws penalizing references for lying.

So, job hunting. An employer puts out an advertisement with all the skills they want an employee to have, and maybe advertise a salary for someone who has a quarter of those skills. Then people with none (or very few) of the skills apply, and try to fool the interviewers into hiring them. Maybe some of them even believe they have the skills.

In order to stand out, you need to show not only that you can do the work, but that you can do it better than other people. Usually that means showing your knowledge of process and risk mitigation. Personally, I like hearing about people's mistakes: what went wrong, how did you deal with it, what did you learn? If someone says they never make mistakes, or that they learned the wrong lessons from them... you get the idea.

Anyways, good luck!

**** Plenty of non-government jobs around for civil engineers. 99% of the time, the actual design work in my job is done by a private civil engineering firm. Government jobs are extremely flexible and have extremely strong job security, and given I'm the only full time worker in our household of 3, that's a priority. Plus an /actual/ 37.5 hour working week!

Also for me personally, I'm 6 months away from unlocking my long service leave, which is an Australian thing where after you work somewhere for 10 years (7 in government), you get 3 months of paid leave. It used to be so people could go back to England (one month on the boat each way, one month in England, was their logic), but we've kept it around. I plan to use it in 2019 to spend 6 months in a francophone country and finally get to a good level of fluency. I'm considering spending a month of that in Senegal as they have some great affordable immersion courses there, and it's safe enough, but my partners are both not comfortable with the idea at all (one because of the mosquitos/malaria: another because he's worried it's dangerous, and it's /not like I'd be going to the border with Mauritania/, but being in Western Australia /everything/ looks a hop skip and a jump away to our sense of scale).

I like your point about mistakes. One of my most formative experiences as a young engineer was when I was surveilling a bridge maintenance project and I had to deal with an Aboriginal monitor - they watch the site during riverbed disturbance because the local mythology is that the Wagul (giant snake) slithered along the ground to form the rivers, so the riverbed are where its belly touched the ground, so they're sacred. Long story short, there was an issue with the monitor not being invited on a day that he was meant to be there. I knew in advance that this would happen and raised my concerns with the site foreman and he said that they'd take advantage of a loophole and it'd be OK. I escalated my concerns to my manager and he agreed with the foreman. I /wish/ I'd escalated my concerns higher and higher until /SOMEBODY/ listened to me, but I was fresh out of uni and didn't have the courage to talk to people. Long story short, the loophole IS NOT THAT WEIRD TRICK THAT ABORIGINAL MONITORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT, the monitor was /PISSED/, and my boss's boss had to drive 45 minutes each way to talk to the guy and calm him down. My conscience is clear because given my knowledge and experience I did everything I reasonably could be expected to have done, but I wish I could have done it differently.

I don't really like that line of thinking. It makes some sense on an object level, but on the long term [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2013-02-05][you're training people to be better meta-liars]].

People can and will use the "If I admit to a lesser fault, people will assume that I'm honest and I'm not hiding any larger fault" strategy. (the first time I remember coming across someone else mentioning it was in lit class, when reading Racine's Phèdre)

This is called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout][Limited Hangout]].

Regardless, getting people to talk about their mistakes works anyways. It still filters those people who can't bring themselves to admit they aren't perfect; and in other cases it helps you get an idea of the person's experience. Even if they lie about everything, the "test" still works, because you can't fake knowledge.

** Increasingly weekly update on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIWf3Nqudgh18j4RK8bm4zOTSKUFl6l9Igvdg1adzGE/edit][The Tesseract Engine]], my ongoing game engine project.

--------------

Last week, I decided I would use the Minetest engine as a base for my own voxel engine. A bit of context I didn't provide then, was that I'd already tried to this exact thing one year ago, and quickly abandoned it on the grounds of the Minetest engine code being a nightmare to read.

The reasoning of me-minus-a-week was that he had become way better at reading code and refactoring projects than me-minus-a-year, after spending an internship doing mostly that, so he'd have an easier time. Well, after spending a few days immersed in Minetest code, I'd say both my "past-me"s were right: I've gotten better at reading code and /my god/ the Minetest code is messy and unreadable. I think I can use it as a source of inspiration, but it will still be faster to do my thing from the ground up.

For those of you who have a limited understanding of programming (which I'm guessing is roughly 0 people), what I mean by messy code is mostly "code that isn't properly compartmentalized". So the part which deals with update the player's movement also deals with a bit of drawing the UI, a bit of updating the sounds depending on their position, a bit of updating the displayed position of the pickaxe you're holding, etc.

The problem with working with messy code (especially for refactoring) is that it's way harder to think about it. If a piece of code only deals with a single concept, then you only need to think about that concept when writing the code. If a piece of code deals with 12 concepts... you get the idea. Any modification you make is more likely to have consequences you didn't foresee, to break in ways you might not even detect until you've forgotten you even rewrote that code, etc.

Minetest is a particularly bad offender; it's an open source project, which means everyone can and does propose modifications to the code, which obviously makes having a coherent vision harder; the project creator mostly left years ago, which means no centralized decision-making, and the code is littered with "// Note to self: maybe this feature is deprecated?" type of comments.

--------------

Anyway, refactoring Minetest is out. I guess what that leaves me with is "Make my own project from the ground up", which kind of feels like a step back.

Last week I was worrying about my lack of progress, I said I was bike-shedding, and now my plan is "do the same as before except with more planning, and using this failed thing as an inspiration". Hurraaaaay.

Seriously, though, I'm weirdly not worried about this. I've opened a text editor, compiled some things, got into the "What does this code do and what should it do?" mentality, which is closer to coding than I was before.

I feel like I've progressed in some abstract way that's invisible everywhere except in my head, but it's still concrete progress. Seeing how someone else does the thing, even if I don't like their approach, gives me inspiration and ideas on how to do the thing.

I guess I should probably make a plan of what I intend to get done before next week, but I have no idea what I can or will do except "Have a plan". Well, I'm confident anyway. Mostly.

** After many delays due to scheduling and waiting until I was in the mood for madcap insanity, I finally finished the first season/Battle Tendency arc of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It was plenty of fun, though my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vz27p/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dm432zghttps://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vz27p/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dm432zg][enthusiastic addiction I posted about when I started]] has unfortunately waned. I'm definitely looking forward to Stardust Crusaders, I actually like villain of the week stories, but I've gone from shamelessly loving the insanity that is JoJo to /just/ liking it and I can't help but feel disappointed.

I think it's due to the pace at which I consumed it. I was only able to binge Phantom Blood and ended up taking a three week break before watching the climax of Battle Tendency over the course of another two weeks, so the plot lost its momentum. Since I found both arcs to lack character development or emotionally satisfying conclusions, it's harder for the series to maintain the surreal madness high I want from it over a longer period of time.

I still want JoJo to be a part of my life, as everyone should, so I'm faced with the quandary of how to consume it and other serial shows with my new schedule. I'm working 12-hours a day, four days a week, listening to podcasts as semi-background noise. All I can watch during the week are relaxing episodic shows while the weekend features my Mom and I binging series together when the dogs she watches for her job finally settle down.

I'm going to have to start scheduling when to consume entertainment on my days off. I have a massive backlog of tv, movies, comics, books, and even some video games that I would like to get to. I'm used to picking what to do based on my current mindset, and failing to make a timely decision due to the sheer number of choices combined with insecurity over starting something new without finishing something else first. So I'd like some advice.

Don't forget: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence][Any person accused of a crime should be considered innocent until his guilt has been proved.]] A failure to punish ten guilty people ([[http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm][more or less]]) is preferable to the punishment of even a single innocent.

As a person who for some time now has felt strongly associated with a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction][community]] that constantly has been receiving [[http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5gtu94][frivolous]] accusations of crime, and as a person who once was dragged into court by his ""zero-tolerance"" high school on a frivolous charge of [[https://criminallawyerinnj.com/terroristic-threats-nj-charges/]["""terroristic threats"""]], I am inclined to regard unsubstantiated accusations with a /very/ high degree of skepticism.

While I think that this is an important principle in terms of criminal offenses, I think that's too high a bar for everyday life, and for the average person is tantamount to saying that you shouldn't update your model of a person based on new evidence.

For example, if my base probability that an upper class white male is a rapist was /x/, then on knowing that he's had a rape accusation made against him, my probability should be higher than /x/, right? And if he's had multiple rape accusations made against him, from multiple women with no connection to one another, and there are key details that line up between their accounts, and they had little to gain from these accusations (and much to lose), all this contributes to me updating the probability that this man is, in fact, a rapist.

And I'm not going to just say "well, he's no more likely to be a rapist than anyone else" because none of this can be proven, because first of all that's not how the human mind works, and second, I don't think that's actually a useful way to interact with the world, mostly because the primary reason to do it would be as a universal civilizational norm, and I already know that others are going to wildly defect from it.

And even as a norm, it's of questionable utility. Always believing the accuser has the pitfall that people can make false accusations and ruin an innocent person's life, but always believing the defendant has the pitfall that people can just get away with any crime for which there's not going to be direct, non-eyewitness evidence (e.g. most sexual abuse or harassment). So to my mind, there has to be some /balance/, some standard of proof that we, as a society, have when talking about things that aren't provable crimes (because they aren't provable, or aren't crimes, or both). And in my opinion, "innocent until proven guilty in a court of law" is too far in favor of criminals (or people who have done reprehensible things which aren't actually crimes), in light of the difficulty inherent in getting that proof, especially for private individuals.

**** Full agreement here. The principle of presumption of innocence is for criminal courts, where the full might of government can come against the defendant. It is not a shield against the opinions of others.

I reserve the right to change my opinion of whoever and whatever I choose at any time, for any reason; and I recognize that everyone else has that same right. Proof of innocence or guilt is not needed.

***** I think the problem here is that we have a hard time getting the base-rate of people being accused of particular crimes, irrespective of guilt, and also actually finding out the relative likelihood of accusation, given guilt.

So, like, yeah, we're actually missing most of the terms we'd need to consider accusation /direct/ evidence of guilt. We're marginalizing over a whole bunch of uncertainties about false accusations, non-unity rates of accusations by real victims against their abusers, non-unity rates of accusations by real victims against the wrong person, etc.

****** No, you're right, it's a very complex issue. It wouldn't be fair to discriminate against someone because of a false accusation, yet this happens all the time. This is why there are libel laws.

And in everyday interactions with people, we're more often trying to judge a person's /character/ rather than guilt or innocence. If we wanted to be fully logical about making judgement calls, we'd have to apply a whole suite of techniques. Accounting for the halo effect is just the beginning.

The fact that most of us can't be fully rational all the time means we often get hoodwinked. Sometimes we behave as though a particular politician is the second coming of Christ, and he ends up being a scumbag. Or you date that girl even though there were plenty of signs she's a cheating whore. We can be really bad judges of character sometimes.

Ugh, the gamergate controversy is everything I hate about the internet. The wikipedia page is currently a super-biased mess; a draft intended to "present both sides" (I don't remember how well it did that, but it felt more balanced and informative to me) as been sitting on the sidelines for years.
