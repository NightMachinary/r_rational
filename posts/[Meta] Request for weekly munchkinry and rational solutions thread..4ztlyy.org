Where we will brainstorm to solve and/or abuse hypothetical scenarios posted. What do you think about this?


** Well, if you post them for a month or two and there's sustained interest, I'll add them to the automatic list - that's how all our current threads got started!

**** Partly because we require a chapter-per-brainstorm in payment for the attention of [[/r/rational]], following an epidemic of low-value posts of this type and to encourage /actually writing stuff/ rather than just talking about it.

Given that such a regular thread would be exempt (as eg weekly general discussion is exempt from most rules), I think there may be interest.

** In terms of munchkinry is anyone here familiar with Dungeons and Dragons or any other tabletop roleplaying games? And if so which ones?

My personal preference is pathfinder amongst the DND games and in terms of munchkinry Anima:Beyond Fantasy. I think Anima is a terrible game to run or play but as a thought exercise for munchkin builds it's incredible.

*** D&D 3e (and variants like PF) is the munchkin's dream, as it attempts to simulate every aspect of the world with rules (which takes power away from the GM or "common sense"), and has tons and tons of content designed with varying levels of skill and foresight.

I'm familiar with a bunch of other RPGs, but their rules tend to be either much less flawed, or much more vague. Haven't tried Anima.

I'll give props to D&D 5e for being /terrible/ at actually defining its key rules terms. It allowed me to write [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2e92hw/5e_find_steed_cone_of_cold/][my masterpiece]].

**** I don't think that the caster being the only target of cone of cold follows, I don't think that a spell necessarily needs to have a target and thus I don't think having two targets means the spell is cast twice, but what do I know? I've only played 5th ed for like 4 sessions.

***** u/Roxolan:

#+end_quote

The pic's reasoning is sound there.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think having two targets means the spell is cast twice
#+end_quote

This is a stronger objection. A reasonable interpretation is that the spell having two targets just means its cone has two points of origin.

But then you have a single cone with two apexes, and geometry breaks down.

#+begin_quote
  but what do I know? I've only played 5th ed for like 4 sessions.
#+end_quote

Don't worry, this is just a rules-as-written intellectual exercise completely unrelated to the game as it's actually played. Nobody would get away with this at a gaming table, or even try.

** Is anyone here familiar enough with Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series to tell me why Gold isn't the best form of allomancy in that world? What stops someone from pulling information from an alternate past that is very similar from there own and very recent? Can I decide to not fight someone who I met 1 hour ago then burn Gold to work out his fighting style from the past where I fought him? This gets much more powerful because you can get information from people from conversations that never happened and with bribes you never paid etc.

*** I don't think you can control what alternate you get, and given the magnitude of differences between known alternates, precommiting to providing information would likely either fail due to your alternate changing their mind, or due to events diverging.

*** Anything. We can tackle difficult challenges from known fiction or create something new. We can take a fictional power with clearly defined rules and find ways to take over the world using it!

Or munchkin our way through tough problems. Anything really.
