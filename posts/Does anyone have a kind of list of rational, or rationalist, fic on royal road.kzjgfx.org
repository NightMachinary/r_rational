The only that comes to my mind is RE Trailer Trash, and it's pretty good.


** Below is my follow list, not all rational but I get turned off by irrational things so you may enjoy them as well. I also do not keep up with all of them anymore:

Yeah I like that, not following cos im not up-to-date. Don't know why its rated so low on RR, I'm assuming just cos of idiots. I have paused after the duel arc though because I don't like tragedy and feel like it will just go down hill from the high lol.

***** Gotcha... What parts made you cringe? It's been such a long time since I read the first few chapters.

It's weird, I can't really remember the tragedy, in fact it's basically wholesome to me. There's great tragedies in the background though (the origin of Veird...).

Thus you may like it quite a bit or hate it. I would recommend giving it a try though to see which category you fall into. I personally think its a great read.

*** If you enjoyed "I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!", then I strongly recommend "The Essence of Cultivation" by the same author ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation]]), about a sort of D&D wizard that finds himself in a world of cultivators.

The downside is that it's fairly short and on Hiatus, but other than that I found it really good and hopefully the author will resume it at some point.

**** I started that one but the the protagonist constantly belittles/manipulates/dismisses the other main character just became grating really quickly. The clash between how hurtful the protag is towards the only other main character and his drive to help people in general from the catastrophy is completely unrecognized and it's hard to read.

**** ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I have no idea why there are so many babies triggered with delve on this sub. Sure its not WtC or MoL but its more rational than 75% of this list so yeah, obviously it will fit in the "More rational than normal" criteria.

****** u/Dragfie:
#+begin_quote
  Delve is not rational, though. At all.

  It just has a short early arc with lots of fun numbers,
#+end_quote

Sorry, I am using the rational/rationalist definition on the side-bar. Rational means that the characters make decisions in-character, the world is consistent, etc not that the MC is a genius or rational or we get a lot of math, that is "rationalist". So Numbers != rational.

The first sentence makes me think you are thinking of "rationalist" instead of "rational" cos a story being rational isn't a yes/no, its a scale like quality: the more inconsistences the story has, the less rational it becomes. IMO Delve has low enough inconsistencies to be classified as "rational". It not having numbers or being slow paced or frustrating does not affect how "rational" it is.

#+begin_quote
  As far as comparison to the rest of the list, why push back on things no one knows about?
#+end_quote

Sorry what? What do you mean by that? My bar for "rational enough to not detract from the story" is low enough to cover about 50% of the stories in my list to give you an idea of where it is. So Delve fits well above my bar hence I call it "rational".

** Don't know of a master list.

I think Mother of Learning qualifies in spades.

To me, litrpg =/= rational, but if you like those I found delve and seaborn to be good candidates among lots of trash. I award points on the worldbuilding being rational and put the protagonists in the middle of the pack for rationality. (They're no Ender or HPEVP, but they try, and you can make a good argument for rationality as well as pointing out many many flaws) Both are incomplete and ongoing.

Can't think of any others right now, but I'd love to read what anyone else would put on a rational list.

** Some stories in RR with the loop tag are rational, would recommend looking there.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=Loop]]

You can search for other tags as well that might lend themselves to being rational. The rational subreddit often recommends RR fictions so that might also be a place to check.
