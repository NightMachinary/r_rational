** I love this story. With that being said, I think this is actually not a great demonstration of the Anthropic Principle, or at least it was an improper way for the Hero to approach it.

The hero has been summoned to a desperate land, which has been assaulted by the Dust countless times, and each time survived due to a sliver of luck. Early on, the viewpoint character states, “The Dust is terrible and our world should long since have ended. We are not fools enough to believe we could be lucky so many times by chance alone.”

But it turns out that this actually /is/ the correct conclusion, or at least that's what the hero believes at the end. He thinks that the Anthropic Principle is the real ‘cause' behind the Counter-Force; that the world has only survived so many times because otherwise he wouldn't have needed to be summoned in the first place. He could not be summoned in a world in which the Dust had been victorious, or in a world in which the Dust had been defeated once and for all; so of course the Counter-Force isn't real---it's just the Anthropic Principle at work.

This is a bad assumption. All things being equal, a hero who is summoned to assist a world in need should expect to find themselves in an average world---one in which there had been only one or two conflicts with the Dust. For the world to come to the absolute brink of destruction, over and over again, countless times (there are 37 heroes who say something similar to what this hero says immediately upon being summoned, so I think it's safe to say that we're talking at least triple digits) is so spectacularly unlikely that this is clearly /not/ an average world. It is so extremely unlikely that the existence of a Counter-Force being real is something that the hero should genuinely consider as being possible. That he does not do so, and instead immediately goes to the Anthropic Principle as a solution, is in my opinion a poor evaluation of evidence.

"Wait, the resolution to that story was pretty much an incarnation of the moral, 'Oft evil will shall evil mar?' I am going to need to look at your previous heroes' tales to see if each had a coherent thematic throughline, because real life shouldn't."

The good news, if an Author is playing for drama, is that the world should never lose one of these conflicts (although in a world running on narrative logic, that should of course never be stated aloud). The bad news is that these catastrophes are bound to go on, regardless of the hero's efforts, for as long as it amuses the Author.

******* Even if I'm unfamiliar with a /particular/ narrative, the structure of a modern Western narrative is pretty unmistakable, and the following selection hints pretty heavily towards that kind of structure:

#+begin_quote
  The boy whose dusty heirloom sword proves to be magical. The peasant girl who finds herself the heir to a great kingdom. Those who discover, in time of sudden stress, an untrained wild magic within themselves. Success born not of learning, not of skill, not of determination, but unplanned coincidence and fortunes of birth...
#+end_quote

... That sounds a lot like the beginning of most stories based around a Hero's Journey structure. There's really no good reason that a hero should typically come up from nowhere to save the world, /except/ that it provides a chance for exposition (in the form of the reader learning the rules of the world along with the protagonist), and for a character arc.

When you think of actual people who are in a place to do heroic or otherwise notable things, they usually aren't people who were recently raised up from nothing, or recently gained incredible gifts, they're people who were in the right place at the right time to do something incredible simply because their job is to be in that place most of the time: think firefighters, rushing into dangerous situations, or scientists, working hard on vaccines or treatments that either aren't needed until they are, or are proven unsafe or ineffective until they find one that isn't.

If I were in a world in which the path to defeating a foe always, coincidentally, seemed to route through the path of maximum dramatic tension, I would, again, either be suspicious that someone is telling me a mythologized, misunderstood, or outright false version of events, or that the world is somehow under the influence of someone who wants the story of that world to be as compelling when re-told as possible.

***** No I'm not missing that fact. I'm explicitly talking about it.

If you find yourself with a winning lottery ticket, it might be reasonable to not immediately assume something is amiss like you are being pranked or there was a printing error. But if you buy several lottery tickets and all of them are wins, you should, with overwhelming confidence, assume something is up instead of concluding that you have just witnessed a ~ 1 in 1,000,000^{10} event.

Just like if you find yourself in a world which has survived disaster on many successive extremely lucky occasions. It may be the case that the author has placed you in an extraordinarily unlikely world, but you would not be correct to conclude so unless you are aware you are in a story. Without meta-level knowledge or some other overwhelming piece of evidence, you would rightly assume there is an external cause unless presented with overwhelming contradictory evidence for something so unlikely.

If this is not clear, consider how this situation differs from the canonical anthropic example of airplanes returning from dogfights/bombing raids with bullet holes in their wing but never in their engine. Notice how the average case is what justifies the anthropic conclusion with the alternative being that the bullets simply luckily missed the engine every single time up to now.

Probability and logic don't just go out the window because outcome X is also correlated with observability.

So yes, someone has to end up in the long tail but if you are at all rational, you have decided to forgo being correct in situations where the overwhelming majority of evidence points to a wrong conclusion in favor of being right when the evidence points correctly.

*********** Think about the airplane example and its parallels with the story. Each airplane is like a universe. Those airplanes that get shot in the engine and don't return are ~ those universes that lost a fight against the dust. Those airplanes that come back with only holes in the wings are those universes that have won battles with the dust. Each bullet that goes into the wing instead of hitting the engine is a won battle.

In the airplane case the famous solution is to realize 'just because I am only seeing damage done to the wings doesn't mean that there isn't damage being done to the engine because damage there may correlate with whether or not I see it'. The parallel in the story is saying 'just because i am only seeing universes with only victories, doesn't mean there aren't losses since losing universes wouldn't have people left to summon me'.

That reasoning is fine, which I believe is your point.

The problem here is on the other side of the probability measurement so to speak. If your planes are coming back with a couple bullet holes in it, then the conclusion absolutely makes sense. But if a plane comes back and it was hit 37 times and all 37 happened to hit the wings, then you start wondering what exactly is going on. If the relative probability to get hit on the engine is 1/5 then the probability that this plane returns is 2 in 10,000 so getting this information is fairly unlikely given your theory that the engine is the real problem. however its even worse than THAT since we aren't dealing with 1/5 odds of defeat in the story. As the story says, these fights are already lucky. If we conservatively say that each of these fights with the dust is an even 50/50 shot, then the probability of that plane returning becomes 7 in 10^{12.} Astronomically unlikely. Thats the problem. The enthropic conclusion depends on the system functioning entirely probabilistically but the evidence being shown points at another conclusion even taking that into account. Sure its possible the user was dropped in a really really unlikely universe, just like its possible for a plane to be shot hundreds of times but never in the engine. But if you needed to come up with a hypothesis after exactly a single plane had returned, and that plane was shot hundreds of times in the wings but has no bullet holes in the engine, then you would be right to wonder whether maybe the engine is reinforced already or if they are deliberately targeting the wings or something.

You will still have universes with a counterforce that looks like luck but actually follows a law (other than "we just happen to find ourselves in a universe where it happened that way"), and you will have universes where the observed counterforce is just a result of them finding in a universe where things happened that way (with no deeper explanation).

The proportion of the first kind of universes is much larger than the proportion of the second kind of universes.

Most importantly, magic operates using mind states, rather than fundamental particles, so while a force (in an ordinary sense of the word) that looks like luck is very improbable, because that would be too mind-centric, /magic/ that looks like luck isn't, especially if the luck works towards preserving the universe in existence.

So I think when judging the weirdness of the counterforce, you're considering what ordinary forces look like (physics) (and so you conclude that it's obviously coincidence), and not what mind-centric magic could look like.

But I can see that with a certain prior about what magic looks like, you'd arrive at that conclusion, I would just use a different prior.

That implies there is a mechanism that over time converts a universe from non magical to magical or vice versa, since they're all descendants of the same tree. We are already granting the possibility there's something similar with the values of fundamental constants (that's what the original Anthropic principle is about, after all) but this one happened in the past few hundred thousand years at the most because these guys are modern humans.

That's a good point, but this counterforce (or luck) only saves the world by an act of luck. That sounds very complex (and therefore improbable) in a magicless multiverse, but if you have magic, concepts like "save the world" and "luck" aren't necessarily complex at all.

If I understand you correctly, you're saying that world-saving luck-generating magic is so improbable (even in a magical multiverse) that the /extremely/ small fraction of the universes where those events /just happened/ is still greater than the fraction of the universes with luck-like magical counterforce. But I think that for any reasonable prior, it turns out to be smaller, not greater.

In case you really mean "definition": Definitions don't have predictive abilities. A definition simply means connecting a word to a particular concept. It's not supposed to have a predictive ability (that's what a theory is for), and it can't have any.

In case you mean that my theory doesn't have any predictive ability, I disagree: I predict that if the hero attempts to win, he'll win by something that will appear to be luck (instead of defeating Dust by bootstrapping himself to become powerful enough and defeating it in a way that will appear to be lawful).

Your theory, on the other hand, predicts that the hero either defeats Dust in a way that will appear to be lawful, or that he'll lose.

Both our theories therefore have a predictive ability.

That's not a good analogy - for this analogy to hold, we'd have to be in a multiverse with universes where some of which would contain god (who would be the explanation of the fundamental constants in those universes), while other universes would be godless and would have the correct fundamental constants just because of anthropic principle.

In that case, I'd argue that we're probably in a universe with god, using the same reasoning.

This reasoning doesn't work in our universe, since we /don't/ know if we're a part of a multiverse with both god and godless universes.

The problem is that in lawful universes, the probability that you accomplish a complex goal by luck is so small that it can't practically ever happen, so I ignored that option. So the way I rephrased your theory /isn't/ logically equivalent to your theory, but it's practically equivalent to it. (Hence the hero says "the Counter-Force isn't going to help you this time," as opposed to "the Counter-Force might or might not help you this time.")

************* Yeah I think thats a fairly simple way to approach it. There are universes where the dude is lieing and where there's a counterforce ...etc. The way you 'win' most often is by picking a reasoning strategy that works in as many as possible (weighted by probability). Even if there are some universes where concluding 'anthropics' makes sense, After seeing 37 won battles in a row, you have to move onto other hypotheses.

There's more, like for example think about how in the airplane example the planes go out, get shot at a bunch of times, and then return whereas in the story, the hero could be summoned after the first battle or the second...etc. In the airplane example this would be like examining the airplane in between bullet shots. This has a significant effect on the distribution you'd see which also drives down the probability of it being pure anthropics in a way thats a bit laborious to explain.

*************** Yeah thats mostly right. To clarify the point though: If you think about the plane example, consider all planes that get shot 20 times, the only ones that return are the ones that get super lucky and survive all 20 shots. You survived 10 shots? we don't see it. 1 shot? Dont' see it. Even though if there's a 50% chance of survival then there are equally as many planes that die on the first shot as all the rest put together. You only get to see the ones that survived all 20 shots, everything else is hidden. Whereas in the story, you have a chance to get summoned for the first battle, and for the second...etc so you actually get to see all those situations. So the only difference from normal stats is that you don't see the defeats. Thats 1 outcome out of 21 compared to 20 out of 21 we don't get to see with the planes. Thats a huge difference in the number of outliers are in your distribution.

Long story short, anthropics does some fucky stuff with the stats but in this case its not as fucky as you might expect which makes seeing such a massive outlier even crazier.

p.s. when I say you get to see all those situations what I mean is that they show up in your distribution, so when you use bayes rule to think about what type of universe you are in, seeing an outlier doesn't change the likelihood of being in an anthropic universe as much.

*** it's a strange scenario to try to build, from a bayesian perspective. You need to have a certain level of improbability to be justified in invoking the Anthropic principal, and yet the more improbable the situation the greater the chance that there is a real counter-force behind the events. so what evidence WOULD point to the Anthropic principal being more likely than a real meta-agent?

​

edit: or, we can pose it more generally. If we assume our understanding of physics is correct, what is the probability that Magic is real, given that we see evidence of it working?

A case of "magic" occurring -- say, for instance, a fireball appearing when you incant a specific spell -- could be explained by low-probability coincidences, like spontaneous combustion happening at just the right time by chance when you spoke the words.

There is some world in which it happens with perfect consistency for you 999/1000 times, and fails from there on out. Even if we've seen it work 1000 times before, if to the best of our knowledge it is physically impossible for magic to work this way, but it can be explained by coincidence, it is more reasonable to assume that magic *isn't* real and we are just in a low probability world, right?

In order to believe magic is real, we'd need to reach some threshold of evidence high enough to overcome the probability that everything else we know about physics is wrong. But what is that threshold? Can we ever reach it, personally?

For the world to come to the absolute brink of destruction, over and over again, countless times (there are 37 heroes who say something similar to what this hero says immediately upon being summoned, so I think it's safe to say that we're talking at least triple digits) is so spectacularly unlikely that this is clearly not an average world.

What does it matter? If many-worlds theory is real, there are INFINITE worlds. The peaceful ones won't summon heroes from other planes to help them with their troubles. The ones that were destroyed clearly can't. What's left? The ones that survived. Once, twice, or 37 times. Though, yes, the ones that survived 37 times are a lot less common - but there's still an infinity of them.

That said, I agree that jumping entirely to the notion that the Counter-Force never existed with this little information is unwarranted. A more complete development of this idea would have that be the twist at the end of a long novel where all other possibilities are explored and ruled out.

***** Yeah, not the best choice of word IMHO, something sounding like "quantum" or "wavefunction" would have made the connection more obvious.

** Yes, it is a little odd that magic exists in this world, inter universal summoning spells and immortality at the very least, and yet the "hero" dismisses the possibility of any form of probability manipulation that looks like the counterforce.

Since there are an infinity of worlds, there is not only an infinity of worlds in which the answer is "anthropic principle," but also another infinity of worlds in which the answer is "someone is covertly using magic to screw with probability." Not to mention an infinite infinity of other worlds with various other explanations that result in a useful counterforce.

I would think the "hero" would be trying to weigh up which of those infinities was the bigger infinity, hence the more likely. And the "anthropic principle" infinity, requiring more luck, would look to me like a smaller infinity than all the other infinities.
