*** I think the closest he's come is when he levelled up on entering Silmar City, which cured the rat rot. That probably doesn't count as magical, though.

However, a level up did fully replace the parts of his fingers (including the bones) that were cut off by the thaum-seeker. Maybe he could solve his current problem by removing all of the drained bones prior to a level up?

Fenn makes a good point in that regard:

  “Killing that gold mage is not our end goal. I know that's probably the best path you to get another level up, and gods help us that might be necessary, but the thing we are actually trying to accomplish is getting Amaryllis back to us.”

Though she assumes killing is necessary for leveling up - but is that true? I would bet that Joon gets xp gain from winning diplomatic encounters as well.

*** I think there's a very big difference between "this plan is stupid" and "this plan is so stupid that it would have required the equivalent of divine intervention". People make the reputation/money trade-off all the time, especially against unsuspecting customers, and I have to think that was even more true in a time when there was no internet and reputation was more purely word of mouth.

His plan didn't even necessarily have to be "I'm going to extort you", it could have been "I am going to charge you for fixing this thing", which is what crooked car mechanics often do. The first thing that he did was say that he would have to look at the tattoo; he's badly off-script by the time he gets punched in the stomach, and I don't think he'd have to reveal that he fucked them, just that this is a problem only he can fix, mixed with a complex explanation about skin magic he could make up on the spot.

At any rate, I think there's enough information to maybe conclude that the plan wasn't particularly smart, but I don't think it's so not smart that you have to say that this only happened because god did it.

That's the best valid argument from anyone here that actually makes sense for the context he's operating in.

There's still a risk that they would have forced him to fix it for free (he botched the work after all, so the plan is still not very smart), but in your case his scheme might actually have been sustainable.

***** The tattoo mage /did/ have access to not-insignificant magic in his skin.

If it helps, imagine it as a 5th level wizard trying to pull one over on what he thinks are probably commoners, only to have them come back and be /much/ stronger than he had expected them to be, maybe a pair of 7th level characters, and found himself more scared by the prospect than he thought he would be.

And once all that's going on, he has access to magic, but that magic is an escalation, and they've already revealed that /they/ are strong, fast, and have magic items, plus they seem really willing to straight up kill him. So using the magic of his tattoos is actually not a great idea, because it's likely to result in a full-on battle in his shop, one that he no longer thinks that he would win, especially because they're acting really unconcerned about it.

****** It doesn't matter if they are commoners. The damage to his reputation alone should be enough to curb this behavior in the bud because it will create unfavorable situations for him. He lives in a city trying to do business, not in a lone hut away from civilization.

Right now the more favorable theory is a third actor that was forcing him to do it, but that third actor wouldn't have any motivation (excluding the DM), so it all falls apart.

******** I don't think that is a convincing argument for extortion. You need to add additional conditions like his escape being time sensitive etc. and make more and more excuses for why he didn't choose other options available to him. Purporting an extreme amount of time-sensitiveness means that they would have been one of his last customers. Therefore his best option would have been to extort them right after making the tattoo.

As it is, the story shows that he is still receiving customers and doing other work, not to mention he could never know when, if ever, they would actually try to retrieve the box from the tattoo. It could have happened a month from now and he would not have gotten shit for this effort if his escape is truly imminent. It could have happened a week from now and then he'd have at least 3 weeks to spend with a ruined reputation.

The tattoo mage is either an idiot or there's another factor at play, which I am calling "the DM".

That's not mutually exclusive with other options. A good DM would keep in-game events plausible, so there has to be an explanation for what happened, even if on some level it happened for game/story reasons.

Trivial examples include /barging into his shop while he is serving a customer/ as has happened in the story /already/. Another one is telling people about it; word of mouth was clearly good enough to get them referred to him.

You have a lot of options there, and rival shops might even help you.

Ultimately, no amount of rationalizing makes his actions any less implausible.

The umbrella category is an entity whose powers and knowledge and motives essentially make them some kind of DM, even if that entity is the gamification system itself.

There isn't any way to save the tattoo mage's plan. It's just plain stupid.

*********** If Zeke's plan had gone correctly (i.e. if Amaryllis' party /hadn't/ turned out to be an unexpectedly strong group of adventurers), he would have had a considerable degree of leverage over them. They can't afford to retaliate as long as he has control over the tattoo, so going and blabbing about extortion isn't an option from their perspective. If they wanted the teleportation key back, they would have had no choice but to give in to his demands, and it doesn't matter what they say about him /afterward/ if he leaves Barren Jewel immediately after receiving the money.

This incidentally also provides sufficient justification for why he didn't extort them immediately after finishing the tattoo: he didn't need to. Without knowing exactly how powerful Amaryllis' party was, he had no reason to believe that they could just barge back into his shop and threaten him the way he did, which meant that he was free to make his demands at whatever time he considered most convenient. At this point, we could postulate a number of reasons why "immediately" wasn't the most convenient time... but that's largely irrelevant to the main point, which is that in Zeke's mind, this was a /risk-free venture/--once he completed the tattoo, he could do pretty much whatever he wanted from that point up until he gave them the code word, and there wasn't a thing anyone in Amaryllis' party could have done about it.
