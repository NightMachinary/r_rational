I know right! Body paints /completely clash/ with the various fluids that leak from a tortured prisoner.

God, some people.

** So, if the Twilight Road is established and functions as intended, does this mean the seven princes (minus the dead one) can get back to Salia fast enough to fuck over Cordelias plans for succession? The law stating that they have to show up in person was supposed to allow her to put puppets in place and become a de facto tyrant of Procer.

Also, the Twilight Road needs to be added to Mario Kart as a twisted, mirror-realm version of Rainbow Road.

*** Only Cat and her people can build the gates, so I assume they won't be able to exit near Salia without her help, though Roland might be able to figure something out. Hard to say if she'd help them though.

**** Cat mentions at one point that the war would take them to Salia to forge a peace. I'm guessing she'll be going there pretty soon.

Of course, I don't think the successors are with her, so it's unknown if that would throw a wrench in Cordelia's plan.

** While they're all distracted, Zombie Saint sneaks through the portal.

Probably not. Still, I wonder what they did with her corpse.
