What follows will probably be a rant. Spoilers for Luminosity and the general direction of Pact ahead.

So, after you finish a fic, you know how you can summarize it in a generic way and find out what "groove" the story fits? The most well known is probably the hero's journey. Protagonist from humble background finds out he is special → is hunted by some sinister force → finds out how to use his powers, achieves character growth, makes allies, faces hardships → finally triumphs over the evil force, leading to a happy or bittersweet ending.

Very cliche, true, but enjoyable. And there are other such formulas, in fantasy, science fiction, romance, etc.

You can play with these formulas, of course, or just make a new one. What I've noticed in some rational and rational adjacent fiction, though, is formulas that are not enjoyable at all. And worse, you only realise it when you're already invested. Stories with no payoff.

Let's take Luminosity as an example. It reads somewhat like this. We get in the head of a likeable, introspective, rational protagonist. → Major change happens in her life. Changes species, finds love. → Nothing major happens for a lot of words. There are one or two minor conflicts. → Main character overreaches, makes some shortsighted choices. → Predictably, (mostly) everything she loves is destroyed. Angst follows. The end.

Is it a realistic outcome? Sure, I guess. Do I want to read it? No. There is no payoff. No choice the protagonist made ever ended up mattering, except for her mistake. You can write a story about anyone. It can be about a prisoner of war, getting tortured for 600 pages straight, without managing to do anything in the end. It has happened, it is deffinitely realistic. But why would I want to read it, or write it for that matter?

Now that I am talking about constant torture, let's take Wildbow as another example. Pact can be summarized as this: The protagonist is playing a high stakes game of Texas hold'em poker. However, the dealer has decided to only deal him out twos and sevens. No matter how well he plays, he can never win. We read about his constant stream of defeats and his angst until inevitably he loses everything. The end.

Am I being somewhat uncharitable? Probably. Still, I think that is the bigger picture of the work. And Pact would be amazing if the plot was about anything else - the writing, the worldbuilding, they are truly excellent. Instead, it is about a man getting beaten down for a few thousand pages.

It's not like a story like that can't be done. The [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/SonOfSunsTrilogy][Son of Suns trilogy]] is one of my favorite works of fiction, and for a lot of it's length it is literally torture porn. But the protagonist has to get up in the end, be clever or persistent, and actually achieve something. Else why are we reading about him, when we could have been reading about anyone else?

I suppose my question is, why do people write stories like this? I do know that a lot of people find them enjoyable. I just want to know why.

(I might compare it to edging, though, actually, if we're going full force on the sex analogy. There's generally no release with these things, just a build up of tension---sexy pleasure in one case, stress in the other---and then the process stops and we move on with our lives.)

** In the case of Luminosity, the second part, Radiance, provides at least some of what you might have been seeking.

To the bigger question:

#+begin_quote
  I suppose my question is, why do people write stories like this? I do know that a lot of people find them enjoyable. I just want to know why.
#+end_quote

Part of it is just the joy of being transgressive. There's joy in telling a story that diverts from expectations, because it means that the story can be fresh and new, even if there are only one or two diversions. Stories that do things that stories aren't supposed to do have, by this metric, their own intrinsic worth.

Part of it is that fiction can provoke lots of feelings, tragedy and sorrow being one of them, and some people enjoy ... well, maybe not being sad, but having their emotions provoked. People like to feel fear from horror stories, for example, because they like that feeling, even if it doesn't come with any catharsis at the end.

Part of it is that fiction can /say something/ about the world, and sometimes, you have to have a tragedy to do that. Sometimes the world ends. Sometimes a couple breaks up. Sometimes bad things happen and it's just /bad/, there's no recourse, there's no real resolution. An author might have to have a "bad" ending or torture a character in order to express the thing that they're trying to express, and a reader might be willing to accept that torture in order to "get" the message in this weird form of communication that is prose fiction.

*** I do agree with your point, and my problem isn't with tragedy per se, but mostly with despair. "Tragedy happens, what can we do about it?" Is a useful message. "Tragedy happens, what can we do about it? Well, turns out that the answer is nothing! We can only be miserable forever." may also be useful message... in a short story. But residing in that character's head for an entire book is just torture.

I suppose that the "You are immortal, but now get to be sad for the rest of time." in luminosity's ending just rubbed me the wrong way, but at least it ended after that. I might give the sequel a shot, now that I saw that the main character is different.

*** It's hard to understand or care about that emotional depth, though, when it's so unremittingly awful that by 2/3 of the way through, you just can't care anymore.

With the exception of Evan, there wasn't a single character in Pact whose fate I cared about. Everyone is basically a giant asshole and even Blake felt like a weird, broken tabula rasa (on some level I get that that's the point), but I just found it hard to give a shit about him. /Especially/ after the bit with the drains.

And then there's supposed to be this huge, dramatic thing where like the fate of the town is in question, and I all I could think reading it was, "good, just get dragged to hell, Jacob's Bell, because you're a goblin-infested shithole and the world's better off without you."

Having said that, the world-building itself is /wonderful/. I think I would've cared about literally any story OTHER than Blake and Rose Thorburn. Like the Astrologer - who was her mentor? What was that relationship? Why was she so broken up about his death? Were they lovers? What was their magic like? They sounded really fucking interesting.

Even Peter Thorburn, giant asshole that he was, sounded like he had a more interesting backstory than the story we saw. What was going on in his life? How did he self-sabotage every meaningful relationship he had? Show him being clever and snarky and vaguely attractive because some poor girl thinks that kind of cynicism is "worldly" after her sheltered upbringing. But then the relationship sours and eventually they break up. She grows and learns and ends up a better person for it, but Peter's still stuck being a giant asshole, unconsciously carrying the Thorburn karmic debt.

Or the Knights of the Basement? What's up with them? They sound freaking hilarious.

Or what happens when a practitioner lies and becomes forsworn. We read a lot about it, but we never actually take that journey with someone. Let's read about a person we like who finds out the supernatural is real, does the ritual to become a practitioner, and then gets put in a situation where s/he has to lie or sacrifice something infinitely valuable to them. Then we follow as their life crumbles due to the lie. Somehow they make some huge sacrifice that earns redemption and some small measure of power returning to them, but the lie they originally told gets revealed anyway.

He does become an asshole closer to the Execution part... I'm only hoping that's what the author meant because he's now simply looking for excuses to do some killing and I don't like if that had still been meant to be "sort of good".

** I completely agree. Much of my enjoyment of rational or rational-adjacent fictions I choose to read comes from the rational part having intellectual payoffs that less rational fictions rarely do in an elaborate manner . There may be some awesome torture porn rational fic out there where there is a excellent happy ending, but I will not be the one to tell you about it. Unless there are small victories, small payoffs, reading the stories you describe is pure boredom.

Most of the tragedies I've enjoyed are shorter stories or not fiction, because I never expect a happy payoff in a short story, and history has the benefit of probably being true.

For me, a generalized "good" ending give a vague sense of hope and expansion, like there are infinite possibilities that could happen in their futures. A tragic ending usually feels like the exact opposite, and has the bad effect of retroactively making the entire story pointless (from a certain perspective).

A positive ending that doesn't feel like a cop out or a deus ex machina is hard. A positive ending that feels like the characters earned it is hard.A positive ending where even though you expect it, it still felt at times like they might not have made it, is hard. A negative ending is easy. Shit happens. Shit happens all the time. It's always going to be easy to make a bad outcome realistic.

As for why people would write stories like this, it's because humans in general focus on the negative way more than the positive. And when people write, their stories often reflect some aspect of life. So it's not surprising sad stories get written when the author tries to ground the story to reality in some way.

** I predict you will be fully happy with the ending to the sequel, Radiance. To me though, it swung things a bit too far the other way; Luminosity's ending made me feel desolate sadness and loss, but Radiance made me feel a bit cheated of any sense of loss at all; it's basically a "too perfect" happy ending that didn't feel fully earned.

All stories have to choose to fall somewhere on the continuum of sad to happy endings. Dystopic novels like 1984 tend to have downer endings to drive their point home, and I think that makes sense because it fits the narrative theme of the story, but for me the best endings are never at one end or the other. A happy ending needs a note of loss or worry about the future, and a sad ending needs a note of hope.

There's a rule I read somewhere that when writing a story in which the heroes lay down a plan, either they don't say it out loud and the reader only finds out as they execute it, or they do and then the plan has to fail and be amended at the last minute. Radiance doesn't do either - the final battle has the heroes making a plan, saying it out loud, /and then said plan works like a charm/. Which makes a lot of the ending feel rather unnecessary.

No, that wasn't it. You're thinking of an early event in the sequel. The reason everything fell apart in Luminosity was because Bella awakened the whole wolf tribe, which then proceeded to do what the wolves do, namely kill trespassing vampires, and as soon as word of this got out, other vampires came over and hammered them.

I just happen to be a customer who want my hero to triumph by the end of the story. If providers don't provide what customers want, then don't expect a repeat purchase.

EDIT: (I almost decided to not post edit, it's low impact given this comment current vote count)

It seems I don't define triumph the same way you do. A hero ends up saving the whole other people from the worst is never enough for me. I want the hero crush his/her/their opposition and live more powerful/influential/richer in the end. A suitable reward for a job well done. Or did you not read the Thread? OP require pay-off for hundreds (or thousands) of pages of beatings.

Worm gives Taylor a start over. That's it. After all her suffering. The same thing her father get without torture she's treated to. That's not triumph for me. That's just, "Oh, my hard work manage to keep me at the same place I begin with." Her sacrifice pretty much worth a whole lot of nothing. No ability that can help her lives her new life easier. No comrade to call upon for help or just emotional support. No enemy which their suffering she can enjoy. Nothing. An exact no-reward situation the OP is complaining about. If you think that end is better than pre-bullied Taylor, good for you. I keep my opinion it doesn't worth the hassle.

This is taking things out of proportion, but frankly, I'm tired speaking about this one fiction. On one side, I'm grateful for this subreddit subscribers who first tried to make sense before countering my argument. They are why I'm here, to present a view so that it get torn apart, if it could be torn apart. After all, I don't form opinion if I didn't see the truth in it. But on the other side, every time I present opinion about Worm, a whole lot of people just disregard it and go on praising teh fic. I start to think the majority of fandom cannot take shit about it. Their love for the work is blind. Of the three replies this comment get (yep, three is not a good number, somebody might have opportunity to get bigger number in the future), only the most recent one offer a good counter (thanks [[/u/dinoseen][u/dinoseen]]. Your opinion is not new to me, it can't convince me to change my opinion just yet, but the way you assign importance to things is good stuff). I hope it gets most upvote. It would be very disappointing otherwise.

*** There is a big triumph at the end of Worm. Sure, it also comes with a big price tag for the protagonist. That is also the case in Lord of the Rings.

*** You should try Twig, if that is the main thing you want. It's actually my favorite Wildbow story.

**** Twig also has the best character writing in my opinion. Obviously an author improves over time, but it's even better than what little I've read of Ward. The worldbuilding is easily more interesting than Worm, too, practically neck and neck with Pact IMO.

*** Spoilers for worm

I felt like Worm arguably ended on a triumph. Literally saving all of humanity is a pretty big win. We get an awesome final fight scene. She doesn't even stay brain damaged, she just doesn't get to keep her powers. Sure, it'd arguably be better to have them, but that's not absolute and given everything that happens it's not such a big deal really.

I think that something of that nature is planned eventually for With This Ring, but it could take another 20 years to finish.
