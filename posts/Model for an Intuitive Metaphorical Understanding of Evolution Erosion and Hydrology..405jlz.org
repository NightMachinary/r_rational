** I think a large part of the challenge lies simply in the language we use when talking about evolution. We anthropomorphize evolution. We talk about it in terms of 'evolution causes X' which is I think the main problem. Its nouns, they're the issue really. In English, there's not enough differentiation between groups of nouns, its all a big homogeneous mass. The result is we group things like people together with things like blind idiot forces acting on the world. I follow Sapir-Whorf and think that issues like this might be a result of issues with the language underlying the conversation.

*** Sapir-Whorf in its weak formulation seems reasonable. The strong version would have to contend with the commonplace phenomenon of categories that do not have words assigned to them. It's also threatened by the likelihood of reversed causality: our words are defined to adhere to the categories we accept as a currency of communication.

The weak version admits the possibility of reversed causality, and can be explained through a mechanism of cognitive cost, though this only quite makes sense for the communication of ideas as opposed to internal thought, which might be demonstrated through verbalistic thinkers adhering closer to defined categories than non-verbalistic thinkers. But at least when communicating ideas, if not directly thinking them, a majority of communication will use the least and least-complicated words to do so.

This could be related to the power law distribution. It could also be used to hypothesize some memetic selection pressures (a cultural Sapir-Whorf), though we don't have a good memetic theory yet.

*** Is not the human tendency to attribute agency to everything, and in particular something that has designed things as complex and amazing as life, something caused by being human rather than the language?
