** Something is tickling my brain, and I can't tell if I'm missing something or if I'm nitpicking.

In chapter 68, Cat rips the scaffolding off her soul and goes full Winter. It's written to be a huge, dramatic move. See here:

#+begin_quote
  Winter was no longer a thing tamed. It ran wild through my veins, through my Name, and a scream ripped its way out of me. My blood was red ice, my bones snapped and beyond it all my heart beat once -- and ceased... Winter had taken it all and left nothing behind that would warm me, no refuge to reassure me that I was still Catherine Foundling.
#+end_quote

She seemingly has a major personality shift along with new powers, kills Ubua, and in the beginning of the next chapter, she freaks out Vivienne. But then her conversation with Malicia and Black is... practically the same as old Catherine? She gets mad, she mentally discusses her love for Black, she puts Callow first... but she doesn't seem like the preternatural, "above all of it," ice-hearted fae creature she should be and was for 1/3 of a chapter.

Same in this chapter. Her conversation with Juniper, even her internal monologuing, all sounds exactly like old Cat to me. She still feels sympathy, takes her oaths seriously, hesitates, and even gives a Callowan oath. Winter (fae-style) doesn't even get mentioned, nor does cold, or ice. Despite her blood "turning to red ice" two chapters before, she cuts herself and bleeds like normal with no mention of this change.

If we cut out the parts about her going full Winter, I really would see no difference between how the old Cat acted and how Winter Cat is acting. But I really expect to - it was a big change, right?

So am I missing something in the dialogue, like her mannerisms changed somehow (besides reacquiring a limp) or her personality being subtly off? Or maybe was it not actually as big a change as I expected it to be? Or, and I hate to suggest this because I really like this series... is it just a weakness in the writing?

**** I mean, he did... but she was acting normal even before then. There are some Winter mentions in the convo with Black and Malicia, and I feel like Cat was a little off her normal tempo there... but I don't see why stopping her Name transition would make Winter suddenly disappear. Especially when it had practically shaken loose the Squire Name anyway.

I'll say, I DO expect that the Winter change will be addressed in an upcoming chapter. I'm just saying that right now it feels like it was supposed to fundamentally alter the character... but it hasn't. I worry it won't until it's the focus of the chapter, when I feel like good writing would have it subtly infuse everything Cat does /until/ it gets directly addressed.

** Black's coma is probably caused by his Name - a more advanced version of what happened when Cat let The Lone Swordsman go. In a way, while betraying the Tyrant is perfectly in-line with the Black Knight's Role, destroying an evil super-weapon is definitely not.

I'm surprised Cat is able to bleed after accepting her Winter power in full. Wasn't her blood made out of ice? I'm still hoping a new Name will present itself. Cat's ability to maneuver the story is game changing and I don't think she'll be able to do so much as Winter fae with a husk of a Squire in her.

*** I suspect Black stopped her transition to the Black Queen, and now with Procer bearing down she'll end up with a different name.

Alternatively, I could see Cat never transitioning at all. To take up a proper role gives more power but it does narrow what you can do, and for someone whose endgame will probably be going after the gods themselves that sounds too limiting.

** Daoine gets their gestalt back thanks to Cat, Juniper now leads Callow's military, and Cat is on the cusp of open rebellion. Reverb indeed.

Kinda wish we'd seen a resolution to the events of last chapter, beyond a mention of Black's coma and the Tower's silence, but setup is important, I guess.

Unrelated: does anyone know if EE announces when a chapter is the last in a Book? I feel like we're very, very close.

****** Is the wandering bard the heavenly counterpart to Triumphant as Scribe suggested in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/villainous-interlude-cadenza/][Cadenza]] If so does that mean the preponderance of competent lawyers don't go to hell? I'm thinking "Good omens", Crowely, and EULAs, because the disparity in their actions in the realm of creation is a bit surprising.

RAFO is of course a valid answer, you've more than got me hooked, and baring exposition/revelation as my thread on the topic implies I see the picture and want the wandering bard's tale to end.

** So who betrayed General Istrid? Juniper ruled out Sacker, and we saw no hint of betrayal in Ranker's interlude. So if it's not goblin conspiracy, then that left Malicia and Procer.

However I think Cat missed an obvious culprit: Black. Purging his most loyal followers to make way for Catherine's would be exactly the kind of thing he would do, especially since he thinks that he doesn't have much time left.

Continuing this thought, maybe he's only pretending to be in a coma for the same reason.

*** I like Malicia better for it. Black was going to need some convincing on the topic of nukes; if he thinks there's any chance the legion can hold the Vale, he's never going to agree keeping the superweapon, for all the stated reasons. Thus, Malicia has an interest in weakening the legions, first by sending them into Akua's grinder right before Procer invades, and second by culling the top Marshals.

What was Malicia's plan for using the superweapon though? I thought it needed Akua's Bind to control the devils?

******** With the bullshit luck heroes are blessed with such an endeavour wouldn't be entirely impossible for them.

Remember, all information regarding the ability of a breach being closed comes from Named Mages firmly allied to Evil and that side don't have the benefit of bullshit luck. Closing them would take either an insane amount of ingenuity or more mundanely (well mundanely in this setting) a Miracle. Hierophant's entire schtick is observing Miracles, deconstructing them and making their power his.

It stands to reason that there might just come forth a Heroic Named that makes use of Miracles from the Gods Above; Hierophant's Heroic counterpart. Something like The Messiah or something similar. A Hero that employs Miracles and would easily be able to close said breaches since doing the impossible is one of the definitions of a Miracle. We've seen a watered down version of this before in the Bumbling Conjurer.

If they kept the Weapon or used it I have no doubt that situation would create the correct narrative weight for such a Hero to emerge and a Hero like that would be practically impossible to beat.

Eh... he's got contingency plans for the Calamities, sure, because we know that Warlock, Scribe, and (likely) Assassin would go after Cat. But I don't think he'd kill Istrid. Her daughter leads Cat's legion, and while Istrid was a huge Black loyalist, I always had the impression that it was more because of what he made of the Legions (and orcs) than following him reverently. If Black told her to follow Cat if he died, I think she'd have done it.

Not to mention that if Black was going to start purging, I doubt he'd leave the goblin leaders alive...

**** Istrid has no personal loyalty to Cat, and might decide to side with Malicia against Cat when Black is gone, and that's why she has to go.

Goblins are untouched because they have a different understanding of loyalty and will follow Cat when it seems like that is the more advantageous thing to do.
