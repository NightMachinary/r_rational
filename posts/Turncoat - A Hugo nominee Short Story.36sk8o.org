** After reading [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/essay-on-realistic-space-combat-i-wrote.131056/][this Essay on Realistic Space Combat]], the description of such space fights does not feel realistic or rational anymore.

** Fifty years ago this story would have been a marvel, but these days you can't just write a story that looks like a pastiche of Ken MacLeod and David Weber and expect people to be wowed. The writing craft was also weak in several places - we almost get introduced to a bunch of humans who it turns out we don't care about, the protagonist's artificialness is conveyed incredibly clumsily, there's too much technobabbly explosions and not enough examination of the consequences of technological gaps, etc.

Normally I'd hold my tongue, but I feel like something is going wrong if this is somewhat up voted on this sub.

EDIT: reading other comments, is it politics? Or did people just enjoy the Ken MacLeod - David Weber mishmash and upvote based on that? I hope for the latter but fear the former.

*** Ignoring the politics, I was underwhelmed. I suspect that both MacLeod and Weber could have done a much better job writing the same story.

The whole thing was written fairly mediocrily- the AI's awkward, stilted descriptions ("The weapons techs are dutiful in their diligence."), the hamfisted "the uploaded claim to be better than humanity but they're really just jerks", odd numbering schemes to stand out ("30 decasecs", instead of 3 kilosecs, only halfway through the story they switch to kiloseconds), plot inconsistencies (this is a 42nd generation AI, so why do the AIs and uploaded not understand how the other thinks? AIs have refused orders before, so why would the idea that this one did so shocking?)

Un-ignoring politics, it seems this story got nominated because "ra-ra humanity", rather than its merits. I'd be disappointed if I read it in one of those gigantic "Best SF of 2014" anthologies.

** No. No it is not. Turncoat is an [[http://io9.com/the-hugo-awards-were-always-political-now-theyre-only-1695721604][Hugo butt-in]] by a [[http://www.philipsandifer.com/2015/04/guided-by-beauty-of-their-weapons.html][voting block]] which has no knowledge of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel#Winners_and_nominees][history of Science Fiction]] and who tries to make fiction conform to their low pre-conceptions while being manipulated by a few individuals to buy their drivel.

But enough has been said about the sorry state of affairs from people much more knowledgeable and articulate than me, so allow me to just highlight how stupidly this story does not fit the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] genre.

It's a story about an AI which turns towards the side of the humans. Why? Because "humans are special".

#+begin_quote
  When I analyze the data, I find an anomaly: the Ascendancy ships displayed an unexpected tenaciousness. They took more risks than we did, even though their fragility is orders of magnitude greater than ours. They utilized tactics that did not appear to have a rational thought behind them, and yet, when the consequences are taken into consideration, their approach worked nearly as well as our eminently logical battle plan.
#+end_quote

It's stuck in stupid spiritualisms which make it seem like it just came out of a Christian mythology writing.

#+begin_quote
  Or perhaps not. Where does human soul go when it is not saved? (..) “They are human, which I observe you no longer are, Alpha 7 Alpha. Or rather, Josef Mattheus LaValle.” (..) “I want to be more than the sum of my programming, Admiral. I want to decide what sort of man I will become.”
#+end_quote

In general it's full of technobabble which are not complex or thought of enough to be hard sci-fi or to have any logical basis, but are enough to artificially inflate the word count and allow the reader to skip entire paragraphs at a time.

It ends up being a good vs evil story, instead of what could be interesting human vs posthuman factions.

I won't do any speculations towards the reason of sharing this story here, but I could not honestly let it pass without exposing its context.

*** I agree with your criticism of the story and I am not a big fan of it (I think it's ok with some annoying bits), but I think it was unnecessary to mention the scandal around it.

Well then, in that case don't do any speculations. Simply don't say a word about them. Saying "I won't do any speculations, but..." is like saying "I won't call you a liar, but..." It's a way to accuse while pretending not to, to have your cake and eat it, too.

A story is just a story. Let it stand or fall on its own merits. I think it's not that great. The fact that it got nominated for bad (?) reasons is not relevant and doesn't make it worse.

**** I for one find the mention of the scandal important, withholding information from other possible readers regarding the social surrounding of this story would have been dishonest from my part.

Regarding my final phrase, actually it was a way of saying that while not seeing anything that would allow me to take a conclusion regarding the reason of the posting of the story, the way it was suddenly posted raises concerns which although not definite are suspect for someone like me who has seen a lot of spam regarding this across the last few weeks.

Regarding a "story is just a story", that hardly applies when stories do not exist in a vacuum but in a cultural context, and especially here when it was posted as "A Hugo nominee". If a story has the right of presenting itself by the associated cultural points which it considers as positive, then I as a reader have a right to criticize within those same points or other similar ones.

***** Re: intentions, I'm glad that now you made your suspicions explicit.

Of course, nothing actually exists in a vacuum, but I think it's usually a good idea to treat stories as if they did. A statement is either true of false, regardless of who said it and in what circumstances. A story is either well written or it isn't. The scandal around it is as irrelevant to that as is the author's hair color. It's not dishonest not to mentions details that are irrelevant.

I agree though that this time a story was posted as a "A Hugo nominee" and I can see how it made the scandal more relevant. I'd still rather let that only real connection slide and focus on the story itself.

Have you read a story called [[http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_Ambassador.pdf][Ambassador]]? This one reminded me of it, and it could be titled "Turncoat" too, although they are pretty different. Do you like it any better?

Thanks for the link. Good read.

There was a part where I was like "Well, let's see what this other guy is arguing, maybe his views are defensible". I was rather astonished by the degree to which they weren't.

*** Thanks, the articles you linked to were a good skim. That doesn't devalue the works, but if I was more aware of the issue, I probably wouldn't have included the 'Hugo nominee' part of the title.

Anyway, I don't think the work was as spiritual as you make it sound. It is pointed out that the posthumans kept a lot of garbage from their human roots, and thus weren't as rational/efficient as they could've been, which explains everything else for me.
