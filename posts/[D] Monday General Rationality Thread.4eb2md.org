Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Rational fiction has ruined my enjoyment of standard media. I got two free tickets for the cinema this week, so I used them to watch Deadpool and Batman vs Superman. Deadpool was still fun because the jokes were fantastic, but I kept noticing plotholes. BvsS was a disaster for me. I spent the whole damn movie thinking about plotholes and characters holding the idiot ball, to the point that I didn't enjoy it at all.

** I'm thinking of starting a *Hell Week*. Read abut it on [[/r/getdisciplined]] and its a technique for avoiding procastination and dealing with bad habits through intensive avoidance of distracting stimulus.

It seems to work best when its a deeply ingrained bad habit. I think I may resort to this due to having spent all weekend watching Flash rather than working on productive stuff. Anyone knows of any other techniques to be more productive?

I tried Pomodoro but I always find a way to avoid using them and thus render them useless. Same with my alarms in the morning, tend to learn ways to crack them and fall asleep again...

My go-to alarm technique: switch up the alarm sounds every few weeks. I find it's easier for me to ignore a noise in my sleep if I know it's an alarm. My brain is an arsehole.

Another thing I've been contemplating is sticking a picture of someone you want to impress (Thomas Edison, your six-year-old self, whatever) where you'll see it if you go to procrastinate. Then you have to imagine yourself explaining to that person why you're dicking around on reddit again instead of being productive.

**** Pretty sure that wouldn't work. In my experience, trying to motivate yourself by concentrating on a known motivating stimulus (inspiring figure, people you want to impress, etc) will only make the stimulus less motivating.

My vague understanding of it is that there is some sort of conservation of motivation going on, whether you call it willpower or energy or whatever, and that your best bet is better investing your motivation and making fallback plans for when you run out, rather than trying to make motivation appear when you don't have any.

This is all based on my own experience and that SSC article I read once, so I'm not actually sure any of it is true.

While writing my therapheutical/emotional CV or autobiography I stumbled upon the fact that both my parents were excellent physical caregivers. Always a bandaid at hand or ready to feel for fevery temperature with a hand.

However they were pretty bad at other positive types of care, esp. emotional, so of course I'd get positive feedback for being whiney, which pattern consisted well into adulthood.

I have had trouble keeping a regular schedule. I may get 3-4 sessions in over a week as I planned, but invariably something happens to throw off my schedule, or I'm too tired or overworked one day. And then I find more excuses why it's ok to skip this one. And then I stop altogether, until I can work up the motivation to start again, sometimes a month or two later.

*** Start small and progressive overload it, dude. What you're trying to do is build a habit of exercising, and once that habit is built it becomes mostly effortless. But trying to jump in the deep end all at once is tricky, since getting proper exercise can be hard, especially when you're tired and overworked. So don't try to get "proper" exercise to start!

Instead, for the next couple weeks, put on your gym clothes and go to the gym, but don't actually do any exercise -- go get a drink of water and leave. This is a fairly trivial task and doesn't require much effort, so you should be able to properly motivate yourself to do it, even when you're not feeling like much. I mean, you're just driving to the gym (or w/e), it doesn't take long and you can do it even when exhausted. Then, once that habit is built and the action feels automatic and effortless, incrementally add another step -- now, instead of just going to the gym to drink some water, take a few minutes to do a few light stretches -- nothing strenuous, just roll around on the yoga mats or something. I personally like Joe DeFranco's Limber Eleven, but you can do the Agile Eight or the Fast Five to start, and slowly work your way up to the full Eleven. Once you finish stretching, go home. Do this for a few weeks until it too becomes an ingrained habit. Then slowly add a few exercises in. Consistently do those for a few weeks. Then add more exercises in, and more and more, until you're regularly and consistently doing whatever full workout routine you wanted to build a habit of in the first place.

Program your progressive overload in a way that best suits you. If consistently going to the gym in your workout clothes is too difficult and you can't keep it up for a few weeks in the first step, deload a bit and just put your workout clothes on at home, then take them off immediately after. Then upgrade it to going out to sit in the car for a minute or two, and then just drive to the gym and back, and then do the water at the gym thing, then walk around the gym aimlessly, then do stretches, then walk on a treadmill while listening to audiobooks, and so on. Baby steps, bro. Ease into it!

*** Two ways.

Find someone to be accountable to. You can either get an exercising buddy you don't want to disappoint by not showing up to the gym (you can even hire a trainer if you want this badly enough), or have a friend who you pay $20 every time you don't go as a punishment.

Another option is to make the exercising fun and engaging enough that you find yourself looking forward to going back again. This would be sports, martial arts, yoga, or some sort of activity you do as part of a group. This shifts your motivation from extrinsic (I'm only doing this because I want something else which is to be healthy) to intrinsic motivation (I'd want to keep doing this even if I don't get any benefit).

Second, the schedule and facilities should allow for no excuses, excluding injury. I have a gym I go to, which is close to my house, so there's no reason I can't go. It's indoors, so weather isn't an excuse. It's the first thing I do in the morning, so I can't claim I'm tired.

I leave a pull up bar propped against my bathroom door - if I could, I'd put it in a doorway permanently. I sprint instead of walk, and stand instead of sit.

***** For some things, sure. If your biological relatives have schizophrenia, then your own prospects are considerably worse than mr random in the general population, whether raised by your biological parents or adopted at birth.

The brain is a machine. Your genes are the blueprints. You can have shitty hardware, you can have shitty software, and you can have a combination of the two. It's an extremely /complicated/ machine, to the point where psychology is going to remain its own field for centuries if not millennia, but ultimately it's just a slab of matter. Just like height and eye colour runs in the family, so does a wide variety of behavioural quirks and personality traits. That doesn't mean nature plays no role - for many things your genes provide the slate and life and the people around you paint it.

As for schizophrenia, [[http://www.schizophrenia.com/hypo.php#genes][twin studies]] show that if your identical twin has it, your chances are around 50%. Which is magnitudes above the general population.

It's seldom /100%/ biology. Typically it's a mix, where certain genes are associated with elevated risk. There are also non-genetic biological factors, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder][Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder]], which /will/ make you more aggressive, impulsive and short tempered, and usually lowers your intelligence to boot. That's a transformation of your psychology that just plain sucks, and it can't be cured.

Granted it doesn't say quite as much as the platonic ideal of a perfect experiment where we can afford to throw ethics to the winds and abduct a pair of twins then keep them separated on the off-chance that they might develop schizophrenia, but that's not something scientists are allowed to do and would introduce other problematic variables besides.

Presumably your alternative explanation would be that schizophrenia is socially transmitted? Or perhaps something to do with how one is raised. Or that schizophrenia is completely randomly distributed amongst the population. In all three cases you would expect to /also/ see ~50% incidence of schizophrenia in one non-identical twins so long as the other twin has schizophrenia. This is not the case, in fact:

Therefore, schizophrenia had a great deal to do with genetics.

  And since nobody else in this rationalist thread is willing to give a testable prediction
#+end_quote

I made a testable prediction, and then I tested it. I did not know whether fraternal twins would have the same incidence as identical twins when I wrote that line, and then I looked it up (tested it), and it turned out my theory was correct.

I don't know why you seem to have decided that for your hypnosis thing to be right /the entirety of science/ must be wrong. It's quite confusing. Especially since we were just talking about schizophrenia and then you decided to go on an extremely long and completely irrelevant rant about hypnosis for no adequately explained reason.

We've had a similar conversation before, even. You appear to be repeating this pattern fairly frequently and it never convinces people, which would probably be quite frustrating. So I'm going to identify the things you need to understand to be able to convince people. From what I can tell:

You need to understand science, because you don't.

You need to understand how statistics works.

You need to understand how proving things works.

Because this? Even /if/ you were right, your current mode of argument is indistinguishable from the rantings of any number of internet denizens, and that makes it completely unconvincing to rationalists. Not because of who you sound like, but because it signals that you do not understand and thus we need spend extra time checking over all your conclusions before accepting any of them. You don't need a PhD, but you do need some understanding of how the truth-seeking part of science works.

Until you get that, you will bash your head into this wall again, and again, and again.

************* You misunderstand. In order:

No, because that is not a fundamental invalidating flaw. What you described are called confounding variables and can be controlled for using a reasonable sample size.

I believe I understand why you refuse to acknowledge it, I just don't think you have a good enough reason to throw out an entire field regardless of whether or not one part of that field has issues in your estimation. Nor is it pertinent to the singular point I was trying to make: that schizophrenia specifically and mental illness in general is at least partially genetic.

Relevant, yes. More important than other considerations? No.

Relevant to the treatment of schizophrenia, yes. Relevant to the question of whether or not it is at least partially genetic, no.

Obviously a rationalist should be convinced by a correct argument. I am not convinced you have one: you have not shown me one.

It is not a valid excuse, but it is how these things work, and I was trying to help you to understand this.

Yes: frankly I don't care about your claims of hypnotism. It is not relevant to my field, it is not relevant to my point. I care only about whether or not schizophrenia is at least partially genetic.

You also remember our previous argument, and yet you followed exactly the same path as last time. The path which has led, once again, to you convincing no-one and wasting your time. I am trying, this one last time, to help you realise that this method is doomed to failure. Understand: until you actually take the time to understand science you will not understand how to convince people such as these. You will also not understand how to tell if you are actually correct or just someone who has been suckered in by a charismatic speaker.

I know you think you know whether you are right or wrong already, but you do not. Just as teenagers we thought we knew everything, and we did not.

Learn to be more than you are, or do not. I care not. You now understand the outcomes each choice will lead to, and I will not make your choice for you.

If you want to talk more, I will talk only about whether or not schizophrenia is at least partially genetic. All other avenues of conversation will be unproductive.

************** "whether or not schizophrenia is at least partly genetic"

- I place a VERY low p on the induction of schizophrenia in a person with no brain... with any environment what-so-ever.

- I place a non-negligible p on the (at least occasional) induction of schizophrenia in /people/ by means of arbitrary environments.

Therefor, I say with very high confidence that it is something about humans with brains which makes them, but not the brainless, get schizophrenia.

Less robustly, I suggest that it would be possible to genetically engineer an human which developed normally, but without a brain, and thus that the difference between brainless and typical humans amounts to (in this case) a genetic difference.

Thus, I say with high confidence that the propensity to develop schizophrenia is genetically determined.

:-p

But, more seriously, while it is true that confounding arises from sparsely populated experimental designs, which could have very few total tests, it is not generally true that increasing the number of replications of a design "unconfounds" the results.

For a trivial example, if the people running a study don't record the height of the participants playing basketball (at all!), they are going to have an awful time if they try to go back and determine if height makes you better at scoring.

For a less trivial and more relevant example, if you only record the scores of two groups:

- Those who are tall AND born on a Monday

- Those who are short AND born on a day other than Monday

...your study has no power to distinguish between the two effects. I mean, you'll reject the "Monday" hypothesis, because your prior for that effect is very small, and your statistically significant effect is ALSO explained by a variable that you have a large prior for... but that's different.

In a sense, then, all a twin study can do is make the alternative explanation for an effect sufficiently absurd that "genetics/womb environment" gets the nod...

...so, what particular flavor of twin study are we talking about in this schizophrenia study? There's different types, ya know...

To clarify: I have not at any time said that it is purely genetic.

I am curious, what kind of study would satisfy you? What experimental setup that is possible to implement would give a result that you would accept? How exactly would you control for environmental factors in order to meet your required standard of proof? Obviously such a standard exists, because you've been convinced by it, so what exactly would be required?

***************** That's great and helps me understand your job, but we weren't talking about your job and it doesn't really answer my question. Unfortunately, personal experience is notoriously bad at allowing professionals to make predictions outside of their very specific area of practical experience, while inflating their sense of confidence in their ability to make predictions. Inside of their area of expertise, they're golden, but as soon as they step outside that area even by an inch, it's no longer the case. You clearly believe in evidence at least in some forms, because you accept the evidence of your senses while improving yourself in your profession, and have been convinced by that evidence that your approach is correct. Tests are simply a standardised form of that.

All these politicans answers and skillful misdirections are making me think you don't actually believe the point you're arguing. You seem to be afraid of taking a testable position because you know that you'll then be proven wrong. So, we're talking money down, cards on the table, no weaselling out of this one. Name a fair test that would give an answer to this question, and predict what result we would find if your theory is correct.

To my current understanding your theory is that shizophrenia is 100% environmental effects - that is basically everything except genetics. This means that in your theory none of it is because of genetics. If this is not your theory, then don't hesitate to tell me.

For the record my theory is that shizophrenia is around 50% genetics and 50% environmental effects, +/- 30%. There: I've put down my testable prediction. If you are in fact right, then it should be simplicity itself to name a fair test that will prove it to be so, and I will then accept that you are correct.

******************* That is not actually a fair test for a number of reasons. First, you know that no such test exists at the current time. Second, to prove your theory wrong you would need far less than 80% accuracy. Third, since 80% accuracy is on the highest end of my own prediction you're actually asking for me to show a greater effect than I in fact predicted. Fourth, because the various risk factor genes are are well... various, it is perfectly possible to show that individual genes are responsible for higher rates of schizophrenia while still not having an effective diagnostic tool, simply because people have not yet had the time to identify all of the risk factor genes.

So quit fucking around. I just asked you to give me a test that shows petrol can be used to move a cylinder, and then you asked me to show you a working internal combustion engine before you'll believe me.

********************* Downs is caused by a second copy of chromosome 23 and almost no environmental factors at all, it should be no surprise that you can detect that pretty easy. Since as you've noticed Schizophrenia seems likely to be an umbrella term referring to a number of different disorders with different genetic factors all of which leading to somewhat similar-ish symptoms, it should also be no surprise that this is a more difficult proposition.

Still, distinguishing that it is genetics at all, /that/ I can do:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v18/n4/full/gim201584a.html][People lacking a section of chromosome known as 22q11.2 have a 20-25% chance of Schizophrenia.]]
#+end_quote

I think you'll find graph 2 on this next one quite informative:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.schizophrenia.com/research/hereditygen.htm][Those who have a third degree relative with schizophrenia are twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those in the general population. Those with a second degree relative have a several-fold higher incidence of schizophrenia than the general population, and first degree relatives have an incidence of schizophrenia an order of magnitude higher than the general populace.]]
#+end_quote

Hopefully I've proven my point, these next ones are less proof and more just there to give an idea of the number of different genes that seem likely to have a causative effect.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Genetic][Many genes are believed to be involved in Schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. Many possible candidates have been proposed, including specific copy number variations, NOTCH4, and histone protein loci. A number of genome-wide associations such as zinc finger protein 804A have also been linked.]]

  [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15263907][Other genes that are associated with Schizophrnia include including neuregulin, dysbindin, COMT, DISC1, RGS4, GRM3, and G72]]
#+end_quote

Finally a note from Schizophrenia.com on the best current methods for calculating risk:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.schizophrenia.com/szgencounsel.htm][Calculating the recurrence risks (or the risk that schizohprenia will re-occur in a family - either in future children a couple may have, or in other existing family members) is complex. It is not yet possible to test whether an individual has specific genes (though this is changing quickly), which would increase their chances of developing schizophrenia. Therefore genetic counselors must use empiric data (figures obtained by counting how many people with schizophrenia also have specific relatives with schizophrenia), coupled with their knowledge of the client's family history. Specifically a genetic counselor may calculate risks of developing schizophrenia by using a Bayesian calculation (a type of statistical estimate) on the basis of empiric data and the client's family mental health history, alternatively it may be possible for a genetic counselor to see a clear inheritance pattern from the family history. Generally, the family history review will try to look back for three or four generations.]]

It's not /supposed/ to impact your job. It's supposed to sit there and be true. You said:

#+begin_quote
  "How was it proven that schizophrenia is a hardware problem"
#+end_quote

And then later,

#+begin_quote
  "It's a catch-all label for vaguely superficially similar problems that implies exactly nothing about the underlying causes"
#+end_quote

So I decided to sit down and prove that to a certain extent that it is a hardware problem which can be predicted by genetics. I think that's what I did. Nothing more, nothing less. You did not make it easy for me. Maybe after however many years this type of research will get you the test you're after.

Edit: I suppose the most relevant way it impacts your job would be if you're talking to a patient and they ask about their odds of having kids who also have schizophrenia, you can now confidently turn around and say "13%". Presumably you don't want to go around mis-informing your patients about things which have a major impact on their lives.

Genetic counselling works by going over your DNA and your genetic predisposition for certain traits in combination with your partner's, to determine what your offspring's chance of having certain traits is (usually severe illnesses, because it's generally too expensive to use for small stuff). A genetic counselor helps people (usually as couples) weigh up their risk of having a kid with a particular trait and plan on how they'll go with caring for the kid.
