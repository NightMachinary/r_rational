** And we're back! I took a break over the holidays, then realized the vignette I'd been planning needed to be part of the main story, because too many background details were relevant. I rewrote it into the first scene in this chapter. Lots of fun physics and background for people to speculate about.

The name Learning is About to Occur was inspired by Ursula Vernon, and that style of name for starships by Ian Bank's Culture series.

*** It's a very good name. I thought "Culture" the moment I read it.

*** I got a laugh out of that one. I heard it in a very ominously relaxed-yet-determined voice.

"The aliens are still coming, Captain. No response to our messages."

"Hm. They appear to think we are too weak to bother negotiating with. Lieutenant, power up the main gun. Learning is about to occur."

**** The best thing about Learning is that he is fairly lightly armed--his specialties are projecting fake or misleading sensor data, messing with communications and the like. An enemy admiral might be patting himself on the back at destroying an isolated squadron before he discovers it was just a few drones and a bunch of projections by Learning--while the rest of the fleet got past him. Learning sometimes takes time 8-).

** Speculation: the variable light speed thing seems simple enough. Lower SoL means easier to manufacture BHs. Then feeding it until stable in our continuum.
