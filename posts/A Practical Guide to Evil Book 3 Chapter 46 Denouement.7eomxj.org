** One chapter late, but I was pretty relieved when I read that Catherine's plan for dealing with Summer and Winter had been imagined/approved by the Empress.

Ending an eternal war between two extremely powerful factions of eldritch beings with no regard for human life is something you /don't/ do without adult supervision.

  It said a lot about my life these days that I was largely unmoved by the sight of a man sitting by my naked body elbow-deep in my chest without my say-so.

*** I really enjoyed this part:

  “So things got fucked,” I summarized. “How'd that translate to ‘get elbow-deep inside Catherine without even buying her a bottle first'?”

  “I wish you would rephrase that,” he sighed.

Ah, Masego. Your straight-man shtick never gets old.

** From the comments:

  So, Queen of Winter has to Let It Go? Ok.

I hate everything about this, including the fact that I don't hate it as much as I want to.

Edit: about the chapter itself, it's been a long time since Catherine has received a reminder to get her shit together and a longer time yet she needed one. Her recent behaviour reminds me of the aftermath of the first battle with the lone swordman, when she acted completely out of character due to external causes. I think there's similar fuckery going on right now.

** Scaffolding around your soul when going into battle with a sorcery-based antagonist?

What can possibly go wrong.

** So she gets to keep her winter power after all. Possibly even comes out stronger if they figure out a permanent way to use it safely. Not what I predicted, but certainly intriguing.

I do worry about how resolute she is growing about becoming callous. She is right about her enemies, and so her hand is forced to a certain extent. But I do hope she keeps sight of the fact that this was all supposed to be a purpose. There was a reason she wanted power, and it was not for its own sake, nor for the sake of squashing her enemies. Practical Evil, not simply Evil.

** Nice. And the build tension never goes down. Last entity of Winter. A lonely queen.

So is Ranger alive and well? Who won in that match?

*** Archer was screwing with Masego in chapter 44, and Cat joined the fun. Zeze from making a childish nickname of Masego.

#+begin_quote
  “That sounds bad,” Archer whispered at Masego. “You've been in wars before, Zeze. This is bad, right?”

  “Don't call me that, you horrid sweaty goblin. And she's Callowan,” Hierophant whispered back.

** I've been holding off on starting Volume III until it was finished, but man, I don't know how much longer I can hold out. How long would you guys who've been reading along think it'll be til this volume wraps up? Another 5 chapters? 10? 20?

*** No idea. It's already longer than Volume II and it doesn't feel like it's going to end anytime soon. The current plot could easily take 10-20 more chapters before it can reach a resolution that's not a massive cliffhanger.
