So you can strategically takle the gyms in the order you want based on how difficult their theoretical best would be for you to beat. Whether that be to make it easier for your team or to get more renown as a trainer.

I suspect that'd keep scaling at one point. I suspect skill plateaus quicker than a sixteen-badge run, so at that point it'd be just fighting everyone at their best and it being a solid challenge.

**** Erika is plausible, she's a younger leader with a counterable type focus. Blaine and Surge are more experienced, but they have similarly iffy monotypes (Amy's brother did pick Surge as his 8th). On the other hand, the gym leaders are holding back even on 8th badge/membership challenges; perhaps those three just play a bit more seriously, closer to their full potential, to compensate for their weaker monotypings/skills.

And of course Brock was the pushover [[https://images2.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED34/5198cd964677b.jpeg][Bubble the Onix]] gym on paper, and he ended up with rock snake godzilla. Lord knows what nonsense the other gym leaders get (Contrary Serperior for Erika?).

Also, in the games Poison is one of the status effects without a secondary effect, the way Paralyze cuts Speed or Burn cuts Attack. I always thought Poison should reduce Evasion or increase PP use or something to reflect that the pokemon is not just losing generic "hit points" that don't mean anything until they're at 0, but actually feeling the effects of the poison as they fight.

***** Janine's Arbok was pretty frickin scary when it was just slithering around. I'd hate to put any of my pokemon in front of that thing's fangs. I can only imagine Koga's pokemon would ramp that up another notch or two for the 8th badge. He'll also probably become an E4 member as well, attributing to his battling skill (probably second to Giovanni in Kanto).

My money would be on Blaine, Misty, or Erika. Blaine as I see him spending more of his energies doing research rather than improving as a trainer, Misty is quite young and possibly quite green in relation to the rest of the leaders, and Erika for what ManyCookies already stated. (Although a Vileplume with full access to Effect Spore AoE's, Chlorophyll's quickness, Strength Sap's longevity and debilitation, and Solar Beams bright enough to blind people as well as burn them up Kamehameha style would be frickin terrifying too.)

** Great chapter as usual! Always sad to see the characters go through trauma, but I guess it helps them grow. I highly doubt Blue, for example, would have been able to survive the encounter if he hadn't already dealt with similar situations before. Shame about him losing such an ace though. Did you perhaps allow him to lose Kermui because it was so powerful and Blue was still relatively early in his journey, forcing him to adapt? Maybe I'm just overanalyzing things.

Oh, and this has nothing to do with this chapter in particular, but I was wondering something about the world of your story. Do Mega Evolution and Z Moves exist in this world and if so, how do they function? I imagine they would work much differently in your rational story as opposed to running on the power of friendship and dancing like in the games.

Here too. It'd understandable when the entire sentence is read but the reading process is made unnecessarily more difficult.

#+begin_quote

I'm nitpicking more and more here but this could be interpreted as fear that her pokemon will suffocate and kill her.

#+begin_quote
  Aiko spends another moment paralyzed with indecision, trying to decide what to do.
#+end_quote

Again, nitpicking but "trying to decide what to do" is redundant with "indecision."

#+end_quote

Ambiguous it.

#+begin_quote

Redundant bed.

So why's dune gendered and an Onix is not? Then that in and of itself is stylistically weird.

Maybe "her fear for her pokemon" would sound better? Also now that I've read the sentence like 5 more times, it looks pretty run-on to me.

#+end_quote

Probably because Dune matters to Aiko as a person, whereas the onix - while technically having a gender - matters as a threat, an obstacle.

Both pokemon have genders, so could use "s/he", and both, as non-humans, could validly be referred to as "it" - in general. In this case, though, using a personal pronoun for one and non-personal for the other makes sense in context and removes the ambiguity.

#+begin_quote

I don't see any advantage in adding the word. It's unambiguous as it stands.

  Aiko is tempted to raise her heavy ball, but even as she debates the risk of it, unsure of what one will do if their mate suddenly vanishes, they're already done and fleeing toward the exit that *the mother* came from. Elaine scrambles to get out of their way, returning her graveler as she goes.

Looks like it, though I dunno how obvious Onix sexual characteristics are so dunno whether it makes sense that she knows.

*** Nah, it's not as bad as the inevitable interlude chapter that is going to be coming up next month. We're about due, and this seems like the perfect place to put an update on what's going on with Delia's murder mysteries (especially if they end up affecting the events on the boat). Personally, I'd like to see what Mewtwo's been up to; he must be getting lonely going on 15 chapters without our company.

** Hello there! As always, the story is awesome. I'm still working in a table rpg adaptation, and I have stumbled upom the aura topic. I don't know how you will deal with it, so I thought I would both ask you your ideas and share mines too (probably not compatible with yours as I take the types as connected to actual elemental powers)

My idea is to take the mind-soul/aura-heart dynamic, based on the eastern concepts. Well, mind actually is your version, the thoughts linked to some physical phenomenom. The types related to it are psychic (duh), dark (I guess) and ghost (you have yet to explain that one)

Then we have the aura, the eastern concept of spirit (very different to plato's) which is heavilly conected to "physicall vitaliy", hence fighting as its main type. Every living being has an aura, but I consider types able to "pulse" as able to harness their aura in a lesser way. Those are water, dragon, phychic (heal pulse, that might be hard to explain) and dark (that will make cool stories. Mind blocked, but able to burst their auras)

Lastly, "heart". IIRC, in eastern cultures the organ hosts the feelings and life of the individual. With the modern science, it had been dismised... like the fairy type. I will leave it that way for now ;)

Also, I pretend to use those concepts to explain legendary pok√©mon, with their legendary hearts and auras (need a cooler name tho)

Well, what do you think? Sounds cool? Potential? And how are you going to do it? I'm specially interested in your version of ghost types

Have a nice day!
