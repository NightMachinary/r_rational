** I will say, it is annoying that the judges commented on one person not getting credit for the dolls they saved because they were given to them instead of them saving them. But the person who saved them does not get credit for saving them and then giving it to someone else for safety.

May be intended, but definitely would be frustrating in world.

*** I think it is intentional, they were ignoring any good things people did, or made it seem small compared to the bad

Edit: I just realized this title is "Fair Judgment" and whether it being fair or not is in question, so now i'm definitely sure it's on purpose

**** It's clearly intentional, they aren't willing to let first tier guys anywhere near their prestigious academy. :D

He knew how to beat the elemental and he actually managed to do it, thing which they also completely missed. At his level he should not be able to do that.

***** I think that there's some sort of disconnect here, and [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Gelifyal][u/Gelifyal]] can correct me if I'm wrong.

We've spent a bunch of time in the story so far with Seti, and some incredibly high level people(dragon, high level shepherd), but we haven't gotten a real look at what your average Prestige student is supposed to be capable of. Without a real mark for comparison, it's hard to say whether the judges are being unfair(don't like low tiers) or lenient(Seti's bullshit mind-controlling air). We saw glimpses of Aiden, and that one vivimancer lady, and I would speculate that their abilities could be just as bullshit(no-impact /Limitless/ style unlocks, anyone?).

I would encourage the author, if doing a rewrite, to add a short encounter with a random Prestige student earlier in the story for reference, so as to establish power levels appropriately.

****** #+begin_quote
  This whole situation reeked of insincerity...It was as if they had decided their judgement prior to the exams.
#+end_quote

Seti was under the impression that the judging didn't seem fair.

#+begin_quote
  The bravery comment made Seti think about her running away in fear and dropping her doll. Odd that they didn't mention that.
#+end_quote

Seti noted it was odd that the judges picked and chose what details they wanted to discuss.

No spoilers, but this already happened quite literally :o!

It's okay if the judging frustrates the reader with how unfair it may appear, as several contestants have expressed that very same feeling!

******** lol I'm tight lipped about Dream Eater, so no secret will even be hinted with that plot line.

Don't worry too much about my comment o.o! I don't think Seti would even be capable of differentiating between Prestige level strong and Dragon level strong, as both are astronomical levels of power in comparison to himself (think of Henry's analogy in chapter one: one million seconds versus one billion).

****** They could at least give that he is exceptional for his level instead of just dismissing him completely even if they wouldn't still let him in. He completely beat everyone else there.

*** My guess is that they publicly reject people but in the private interviews they offer them some type of probationary position. This judging literally has a crowd and is being broadcasted to the public.

Think of the spectacle that would result of Seti, as a tier one, being publicly accepted into prestige. I think it's fairly obvious that his joining won't be made public.

Think of this as a reality tv show. The one girl accepting while the other two rejecting makes perfect sense. They just want to appeal to the public right now. So of course its unfair.
