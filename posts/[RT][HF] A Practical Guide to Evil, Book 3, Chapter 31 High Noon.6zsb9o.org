** Interesting. Hierophant seems like a neutral name to me, but I can't see Masego getting less... evil.

Also, doesn't Hanno have a name in his archive for the Thief of Stars? Thief just stole an actual star. That's pretty sick.

** For others that like me have no idea what a Hierophant actually is, Wikipedia helpfully provides

A hierophant (Ancient Greek: ἱεροφάντης) is a person who brings religious congregants into the presence of that which is deemed holy.[1] The word comes from ancient Greece, where it was constructed from the combination of ta hiera, "the holy", and phainein, "to show". In Attica it was the title of the chief priest at the Eleusinian Mysteries. A hierophant is an interpreter of sacred mysteries and arcane principles.

Now he healed archer and adjudant, while talking about miracles, miracles are in creation, a different thing from healing magic, it comes from gods, maybe he can manipulate them? or cause them himself? It would tie into his search for understanding creation if he intruded into the domain of gods

** Ha! That ending caught me by surprise, which is always fun. I do kinda wish "Yoink!" was an Aspect... Imagine how much crap Thief would have had to deal with after!

So, this opens new puzzles:

- Thief is a heroine, and we've seen before that she can release what she steals. Might she turn on Cat at the worst possible time?

- Masego was blinded in the transition/fight when his glasses shattered and pierced his eyes. Is this permanent? Will he absorb the power of his glasses?

- We know 2/3 of Archer's Aspects (right?). See and Flow. What's the last?

- Rampage is a great aspect for Hakram, but seems a bit less of a fit for Adjutant... Is that just my take on it?

- What is Ranger waiting for? I still think she's the "and one" part of the Battle of Four Armies and One. Does she want a Queen or King?

- Edit: what is the "upset" that Cat really wants to save for later? And who does she think she needs it against; the Summer fae or Diabolist?

Still, an excellent chapter and a great ending!

Amazing chapter. This and the last few have reminded me of one of the things that makes this story so great: its moments of just sheer fun, from the over-the-top crazy action to the quips and witty banter that's been there from the start. The closest thing I can compare this aspect to is The Dresden Files, with all the compliments that implies.
