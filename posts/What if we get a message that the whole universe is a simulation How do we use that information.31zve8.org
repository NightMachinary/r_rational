** From Accelerando: "He slips his glasses on, takes the universe off hold, and tells it to take him for a long walk while he catches up on the latest on the tensor-mode gravitational waves in the cosmic background radiation (which, it is theorized, may be waste heat generated by irreversible computational processes back during the inflationary epoch; the present-day universe being merely the data left behind by a really huge calculation). And then there's the weirdness beyond M31: According to the more conservative cosmologists, an alien superpower -- maybe a collective of Kardashev Type Three galaxy-spanning civilizations -- is running a timing channel attack on the computational ultrastructure of space-time itself, trying to break through to whatever's underneath."

** Typically the goals upon finding out everything is a sim is to abuse the system: to attack it to either escape the simulation to underlying reality, or to make the simulation better in whatever way you define that, typically resulting in either victory and the end of the story, or problems arising followed by conquest of the problems and either return of status quo or the victory as above. See examples: Yudkowsky's That Alien Message, Vinge's The Cookie Monster, Chalker's Well of Souls books, the Matrix movies, the game Star Ocean 3, a lot of [[http://qntm.org][qntm]]'s stuff, some of Greg Egan's stuff, and a whole host of others I am not thinking of at the moment.

** I'm reminded of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo][this video]] by Veritasium. When trying to figure out how something unknown works or if it is true, you should try to disprove what you believe.

Now, what we are given from the letter is that there are 3 things that were programmed to behave weirdly. Those 3 things are human consciousness depending on a brain, some "logical paradoxes", and quantum uncertainty. Naturally in order to prove that we are not in a simulation, we should attempt to disprove one or more of these beliefs. We could create an artificial consciousness or discover what causes the observation effect in quantum measurements. I'm not sure what logical paradoxes are supposed to exist but they are usually some kind of argument which is not really something that exists per say. We can't really prove we are in a simulation with these however.

I guess convincing evidence that we're in a simulation would have to be some kind of action that violated our commonly known laws of physics, like the moon suddenly appearing on the opposite side of the earth but with no observable physical manipulation. Maybe having some law of mathematics rewritten to where it no longer makes sense and creates some kind of paradox. I think the only way to prove that we are in a simulation is to show that the simulation is alterable in some way, otherwise it can also be explained simply by "that's how things work".

** If we just get words in the sky saying "This is a simulation"? That tells us nothing that philosophers haven't already speculated about for a long time. It will confirm one particular theory true, but we've already got quite a lot of literature on what happens if we are in a simulation, so... all we know is that /this/ already-formed hypothesis is right and /that/ one is wrong, it's only a few bits of information.

All right, there's a little bit more than that - it tells us that God learned to speak English, that we've been noticed, that the universe doesn't exist solely for the benefit of stars or electrons or even Martian bacteria but for /us/. Which is good to know. Alternatively, it tells us that we're not in a simulation, just the victims of the world's greatest prank.

But if you're going to tell me I'm in a simulation, I'd appreciate some practical data too, like the API keys.

Not saying I could never come to believe it, but... extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and /spectacularly unreasonable/ claims require /spectacularly unreasonable/ evidence.

Looking at this from the other direction: suppose it was possible for your own sensory input to be falsified and for everyone in the world to lie and say their sensory input agreed with you. What would it take for a rational mind to be sufficiently skeptical in this situation?

After all, even if this world was a simulation, it's been playing by very consistent rules so far. Knowing it's a simulation won't change that. In fact, knowing that it's a simulation would just make me worried, because that would mean we have some rather evil gods on our hands who are apathetic at best.

A game designer is evil if they have sapient life in their games that they don't treat as well as possible. If our world is a simulation, then it is many orders of magnitude more complex than anything a typical game designer could create, and the comparison doesn't really follow.

***** I'm not sure I can agree with your assessment of evil. I can't categorically reject it either, but I would feel more comfortable with apathetic as a likelier reality. With no ability to interact with the creator of the simulation, we would have no way to assess their attitude.

For all we know, the creator is an incompetent, and broke something an unfathomable time ago in our simulation. They've spent the last several billion years of our subjective time learning and trying to fix it, progressively making our lives better...

In that scenario, I'd say they could be considered something of a hero to us, since they didn't just scratch everything and start over.

And I suppose it's slimly possible that a simulation could just have gotten out of its creators hands rather than being intentionally made with cruel elements, but that seems like a fairly unlikely scenario.

********* so then if the simulators have moral values similar to yours, then they would agree with you. If the simulators moral values are similar to the 96.8% of people who do eat meat, then I would expect the simulators to be fairly dismissive of our own moral weight.

Without knowing the purpose of the simulation, it's hard for us to say if they can easily change our circumstances. Perhaps changing our circumstances would void the purpose of the simulation, and lead to them shutting the entire thing down.

Now I'm not saying it's the case they couldn't change the circumstances. I'm saying we don't know their incentives, we don't know their limitations, and we don't know how similar or different their moral reasoning is from ours. With those 3, huge knowledge gaps, we can't say with any high degree of certainty that they are/aren't evil, or that they do/don't place moral weight on our existence.

*********** One thing about our current society is that as technology has progressed and we've become wealthier, we've been less and less tolerant of questionable human rights practices. Presumably a society capable of running emulations like the one we would be in is far above us from a technological standpoint, and wealthier societies tend to care more about ethical issues. Many psychology studies that were considered fine 75 years ago would never pass an ethics board today.

Given that running simulations is so obviously rife with moral conundrums, it seems logical to me at least that they would perform some kind of cost-benefit analysis to determine if running the simulation is allowable.

The fact that it's likely a technologically advanced, wealthy society running the simulation seems like at least weak evidence that a cost-benefit analysis was performed at some point in time before beginning the simulation, and if it passed a cost-benefit analysis, the suffering likely exists for a reason.

Perhaps our moral weight is insignificant in comparison, but in that case the overlookers of the simulation would be so far advanced from us that I can't possibly fathom what purpose they would have for such a simulation in the first place that could possibly justify their actions. And even if our suffering is relatively insignificant, it's still an immense amount of suffering, and they should be able to know this. So they still wind up being either immoral or amoral.
