** Man if Praes is a pit of vipers then the Dominion is at least a bunch of fighting roosters. If nothing else the failure of most of the Good nations to liberate Callow is if not excused than at least understandable in the light of each of their national failings, even before the increased espionage of Praes focused on sabotaging other nations rather than it's own or Callow.

**** I wonder if Grey Pilgrim's now lost influence over the Dominion was keeping some of the extremes at bay, like he was the unofficial leader people were looking to him for guidance previously is that included in their metaphorical crown? Like Saint was only kept under some kind of uh leash to be blunt by Grey Pilgrim's you know authority did that influence the situation? Rogue Sorcerer also started being more vocal in his protests post crown sacrifice but at the same time the situation was rapidly snowballing downhill.

***** No, Tariq specified when giving up his crown that it was a crown given to him by his familial inheritance, rather than the unofficial kingmaker he eventually became via his actions and reputation.

  “It will be mine,” the Grey Pilgrim said. “Though the Dominion of Levant has no kings, I was born to the bloodline that has ruled it since its founding.”

And right after, Kairos suggest killing Tariq's descendant to make him wear that crown.

 

#+begin_quote
  “Oh, please do have him elected Holy Seljun,” the Tyrant grinned. “That would be delightful. We'll have to have his... great-great-nephew? Close enough, I think. We'll need to have the current Seljun assassinated first, that is my implication, but worry not. Mercantis offers very fair prices on poison these days.”

****** But does it work like that? the passage that i was thinking of was in chapter 34 " But what you will be surrendering, in truth, is rather more abstract: it is you ‘right to rule'." and then later clarified to be

"Though the earthly crown will not be taken from your brow, save if you yourself do so, you will have lost the authority of a ruler in the eyes of the Heavens,” the Grey Pilgrim said. “Lingering in that role after discarding it before Gods and men can only bring calamity.”

“I figure it'd be subtle at first,” I said. “Small nudges. Crops get a little worse, people listen a little less. If you keep holding, though, then it's a different story.”

“Disease and strife,” the Peregrine said, “and they will only grow, so long as authority is kept.”

​

And to me it's not super clear that you can necessarily separate the right to rule or the general leadership out from the more Kingly authority. Like he can certainly say that it's his inherent position based on his birth but does him saying that it is so define the situation? Like the way that i interpreted the assassinating of the Seljun was that Grey Pilgrim has a claim to the position but because he doesn't have it yet and so can't give up a crown that he didn't have, but Grey Pilgrim doesn't explicitly have the position that he's arguing that he's giving up in anything but the unofficial capacity in the first place. If that makes sense.

****** But he isn't a sovereign or if he is it's not by the position that he claims that it is, well kind of. He is the Grey Pilgrim which in this case gives him if not outright rule then at least the beginnings of it especially considering he's of the family of a, but also the, Grey Pilgrim which gives him claim to the seat of Holy Seljun. Which is as he says the closest thing to a ruler that the Dominion ever has. But the problem is that he's not officially a claimant for the throne, he is only "a man who'd once been proposed heir to the Tattered Throne." from Peregrine II (the Tattered Throne is in reference of the position of Holy Seljun). Any authority that he had was gained based on his own actions and to a certain extent the Name that he had.

They had every opportunity but value-rigidity blinded the Crusaders to alternative plans. Dammit, they went to the work of cutting a stairway through the mountains so that's the route they're gonna use !!1

***** The Queen in Callow had a godlike power that turned her more unstable every time she used it, and not only would she be forced to use it a lot to take Praes but it would fuck up the grand alliance, which would otherwise end the wars between the 3 western powers and eventually let them take a swing at the dead king.

******** The dilemma that Cat is Cordelia's best and only real ally against the Dead King at the moment, also that Cordelia's standing and arguably the whole Grand Alliance is built on extremely uneven ground. Cat at this point could force the whole thing to come down just by being defended by troops from Procer against any Good nation. That every nation in the Grand Alliance has been ground down by either fighting Praes or fighting Callow, and that the casualties that they know are going to come from fighting the Dead King are going to leave them vulnerable. The kind of vulnerabilities that other ostensibly Good nations are quite willing to take advantage of if they have the advantage.
