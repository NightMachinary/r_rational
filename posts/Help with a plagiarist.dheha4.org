** [[https://support.wattpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/204471770-Reporting-Copyright-Infringement]]

Since you're not the owner of the copyrighted work, stick with reporting the story. Also if you're still posting chapters, get your readers to report it on Wattpad as well.

#+begin_quote
  *How to report Published content if you are not the owner:*

  Clicking the report button on the story description page OR when on web clicking the "..." on any story part and clicking "Report Story"

  After you click report story, you will select that you are reporting copyright. After doing so, you will be brought to a separate reporting form and will be required to provide all links since the DMCA form does not track the story link you reported from.

  Tip: For the "original source," please include a link to a listing if you are reporting a novel. A link to the Amazon or Goodreads page for the novel is ideal so we can view a free preview and easily investigate.

****** You own the non infringing parts of the derivative work, which is going to be quite difficult convincing a judge that any part of it is original unless you made substantial changes.

For example, EY's Harry Potter would be partially owned by EY and JKR. JKR owns the parts that match the character she created (history, appearance, name) while EY owns the parts he created (Modifications to history, behavior). Now if another author decides to make an R!Harry, but just copies EY's Harry to make it happen without doing the work to create a unique character, EY would own this other Harry outright, and since Harry is a defining feature of the work, may even own this other story entirely if the unnamed writer fails to make a case for fair use.

Here is an example of a case where the author of the original ended up owning the derivative even though the derivative was a whole new story (thanks to ChronoDAS for linking it originally). [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Stallone]]

**** Sorry for being vague: I meant that he/she isn't the owner of the Naruto copyright.

+I don't believe fanfiction authors are entitled to DMCA actions.+

Apparently "derivative works" fall under the Copyright Act, but it's still unclear without some lawyering whether derivative work authors are entitled to DMCA action.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-are-derivative-works-under-copyright-law][*What Copyright Protection is There for Derivative Works?*]]

  The copyright on a derivative work covers only new material, appearing for the first time in the derivative work; it does not cover any preexisting material from the original. So the character of Superman is not covered by the copyright on the film Superman, since the copyright on that character pre-dated the movie; but any elements new to the film received their copyright from the date of Superman II's creation. What this means are two things: (1) if you license a work from its author so you can make a derivative work based on the original, you do not obtain the copyright on the original---you gain only the right to make the derivative work agreed upon; the owner retains all rights to the original and all its elements, and (2) the copyright on the original is not extended by the creation of the derivative work. This used to mean more than it does today, since copyrights exist for the life of an author plus 70 years, and if an author makes a derivative of his own work, then his copyright won't change regardless. But what it does mean is that if a second author makes a derivative work of the first author's original, the copyright on the elements of the original is measured by the life of the original's author---not the derivative work's.

  With “new versions” of work becoming more commonplace, the lines between a new creation, a derivative work and copied work can be blurred. With all these gray areas, it's important to do your homework before you set out to create and publicize something you believe is completely black and white. The take-away: get a license or get a lawyer.

** The disclaimer seems visible enough, it's the first thing people see when they click. You may have the legal right to stop them, but as far as I'm concerned they did nothing wrong, since they credited you clearly. They CERTAINLY didn't "plagiarize" you considering they were very clearly not intending to pass it off as their own work and stated that their intention was to share a story they enjoyed in a way others would find more convenient.

Like I said though, you are unfortunately legally in the right, since the law does not agree with me that the creator should have no right to limit how people use their work so long as it is properly credited as theirs (things become slightly more complicated morally when money is involved, since we're unfortunately in a capitalist economy where it's necessary to make a profit to survive, but in this case there isn't any money involved anyway). But I certainly don't see how you can pretend to hold the moral high ground when your own work builds off of others copyright, and I doubt you sought permission from the original authors any more than this so-called plagiarizer did.

JK Rowling sells her books, you've posted your online for free. As far as I can tell, the only thing that someone mirroring your story can do, in this case, is good. Heck, I don't think that you even could hypothetically make money off of it, considering that it's a fanfiction, and it might therefore be illegal to do so, though I'm not /totally/ sure about that.

#+begin_quote
  But this person just copy pasted directly. Which I think I have a right to be annoyed about. Even if they put the disclaimer, lots of people skip over that. If you look at the conversations on their author profile, it's clear that readers have mistaken this for an original work.
#+end_quote

Oh shit, somebody else is getting credit for something they didn't do! The HORROR! Even though they explicitly said they didn't make it, and realistically speaking it probably is drawing more attention to your original upload, there's a chance that people might not understand!

With that said, my point wasn't that you were stupid for caring about "worthless internet points", I totally get that! Recognition for your work always feels good, and is probably the main reason that most people create art in the first place.

My point, rather, was that a mirror of your story isn't going to reduce that! Like, I just don't get how someone putting your story up somewhere else would /lower/ the traffic to the original.

EDIT: Additionally, as an explanation for the aggressiveness of my tone, I suppose it was probably because I felt defensive of the mirrorer. You're accusing them of wrongdoing, when I can't see how they actually did anything bad. I was, in my own eyes, responding to aggression with aggression. In retrospect that was silly of me.

***** 1. It doesn't matter that op is posting it for free. They may decide to take down the free bits and charge for it in the future. As author it's their right to do so (assuming they work out the details with other copyright owners who might have a stake) the thief who mirrored the story is illegally taking the author's ability to do so away.

2. Assigning credit to the owner of a copyright doesn't make it ok to then copy wholesale. In fact the only place it's appropriate is academic papers where one person builds on another's discoveries (or if the academic field is literature, the one person adds original commentary). Why you're defending such an act with melodramatic BS is unclear.

3. Besides the points in part 1, if the owner of the characters used decides to make op take the work down, op is unable to do it and the thief is implying that they have permission by giving credit and then posting the work as if they have permission. This can cause all sorts of trouble for op.

I'm not trying to say that the law isn't on OP's side. And if they do indeed intend to work with the copyright holders and charge for it, then this all makes sense.

But it seems based off of what they've said so far, that this isn't the case. As such I'm trying to convince them, by appealing to their morals, that letting the story be mirrored would be the logical and most beneficial thing to do.

Also, I kind of doubt your third point. In what way did the reuploader imply that they have permission? By giving credit? Personally, I would never have considered that to be a way of stating permission, and I don't really see why you do.

It's equally ridiculous to compare remixes (which add value, like a response in a conversation) to simply reposting and copying wholesale others' art without permission (which adds no value and is kind of a dick move)

basically my issue is that you're opposing the idea that we should let artists engage with their audience themselves,and instead advocating that we should view it all as mere content consumption and let content aggregators accumulate all the engagement

I hope that the irony that arises when you pair this with an opposition to capitalism isn't lost on you; the reposter here is playing the role of a corporation, an exploitative barrier between the artist and the effects of their work, without consent

****** I do understand. My main disagreement is just with the idea that you have any right to control over your work (and thus that there IS any obligation to ask you) once you've put it out there, aside from requiring that you be credited. In truth, the only reason I'm not against ALL intellectual property is because we unfortunately still live under capitalism where you need to make a profit to live and be happy; if that weren't a factor, I don't honestly believe that you'd have any right to control over your intellectual labor so long as you were credited for it. And we've established that that's not relevant here.

I do get your frustration that maybe the credit isn't effective enough, but I'm not sure that a few people missing the disclaimer is a huge enough issue to outweigh the advantages of people being free to rehost works of fiction. In the long run, it's beneficial to the survival of your work as well. FF.net won't last forever. But if people are free to rehost, it can keep being spread around indefinitely.

Well, that's a pretty specific requirement. I've made art of various kinds (mostly music), which I do allow others to reuse, rehost, etc. as long as I'm credited. But I'm not really a writer, so no "300k-word thing"s, and I've admittedly not worked on one project consistently for 4 years.

I'm not trying to be rude. You do seem to be much more reasonable about it than most people (some people somehow don't get that it's unreasonable to say people can't make fanworks of their own fanworks, etc.). But here's another angle to look at: It is not AT ALL unheard of for fanfic authors to mysteriously one day decide to take down their fanfic, even in-progress like yours. If that happens, the survival of the art relies on others having rehosted it. You may think that you personally would never do that, and you may even be right, but none of the rest of us know that. Rehosting is vital for the preservation of all forms of art.
