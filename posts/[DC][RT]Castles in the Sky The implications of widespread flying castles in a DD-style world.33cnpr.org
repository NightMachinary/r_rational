** If you want /trade/, you don't do it with a flying castle. A castle's purpose is primarily defensive - that's why you have thick stone walls and battlements, and sometimes a moat. If you wanted to simply move goods, you wouldn't make a castle, you would make something that maximizes cargo space while remaining light and maneuverable (and not bloody expensive to build). Castles are not known for their aerodynamic properties, and if you're moving them with a giant sail, you're better off making them out of something not at all castle shaped. This is true even if the base levitation spell doesn't have any increased costs based on mass.

Instead, you would make flying ships.

(If you want a justification for flying castles, you need to give some better incentives for their existence - for example, some dangerous predator on the ground, or some dangerous predator in the air that would tear any /normal/ ship apart, or a method of propulsion that explicitly doesn't have any respect for mass or aerodynamics. And then you're still going to run into problems with the logic of it, because you have limited space available to you, which means that you would have to start cutting out all the extraneous functions of a castle pretty darn quick.)

Human beings would /totally/ have flying castles if could, for absolutely no practical reason whatsoever other than that it's cooler than a regular castle. If there's a /practical/ reason for it, that would just be an extra bonus.

(Think of skyscrapers. Sure, they save ground space as a neat extra side effect and maybe that's what first spurred the push towards taller buildings, but mostly we just make them excessively tall because it's cool and kind of a competition. Or the pyramids, which basically began as "I want a really, really, really impressive place to put my corpse". Humans are not particularly practical creatures.)

**** I think skyscrapers are a bad example, but I agree in general principle. If a floating castle were possible, someone would build it in order to stroke his ego. But I don't think that you would see it used in trade like the article suggests, nor do I think it would be the norm.

The world is full of big flashy things that only exist for social or psychological reasons. But the world is /more/ full of things that exist because of economics, and would stop existing as soon as economics dictated it. Look at the long-haul semis that clog the United States, or strip malls, or the precision engineering that goes into an aluminum soda can. I'm totally fine with having some mad king float his castle because his wife made him a cuckold or whatever - but suggesting floating castles as the primary vehicle of trade doesn't make sense.

***** The rational of skyscraper example is that it /starts/ with a mild practical consideration (hey, let's save space) and ends with absurdly tall towers just because.

Similarly, even if there's an /extremely mild/ practical incentive for flying castles, it's very quickly going to spiral into every grand king wanting one.

(I agree though, if castles aren't the /best/ method of doing trade, they won't be the primary form of trade)

****** I would argue that it's not a mild consideration at all, in the case of skyscrapers.

#+begin_quote
  Speaking of such enterprises from the financial aspect it is a rule that holds almost invariably that where the building costs less than the land if properly managed it is a success and where its costs more than the land it is usually a failure. The land value is established by its location and desirability from a renter's standpoint hence high rentals make high land values and conversely low rentals make low land values. The building is merely the machine that makes the land pay. The more economical the machine both in construction and operation provided it fulfills the needs, the more profitable the land. At the same time one must not lose sight of the fact that the machine is none the less a useful one because it has a measure of beauty and that architectural beauty judged even from the economic standpoint has an income bearing value. In my judgment the best equation of building and land is that the building should represent about two thirds of the land value under normal conditions.

I mean ... sure, the optimal height for the Empire State Building was [[https://books.google.com/books?id=rQ0XAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA186&ots=P-R7EDOukI&dq=clark%20and%20kingston%201930&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false][75 stories from a purely economic standpoint]] and they added on an extra floors for observation decks and a (impractical) mooring tower. But the primary driver that got it most of the way there was economic in nature. This was not a mild consideration at all - the impractical urges don't actually push the building height that much higher.

Whereas something like the pyramids is a much better example, because it served no practical function at all.

***** No reason to put tall towers on flying castles. You can just levitate 1000 meters higher, if you want better view, and that 30m tower won't help much - not worth the material and structural problems.

On the other hand there should be windows in ceiling and in the floor to allow 360 degree visibility.

That's not entirely true. Skyscrapers are built because putting money and people who will work with it in proximity to each-other tends to generate extremely high real-estate costs. When there's not as much money in your region and civic planning isn't completely borked, you can usually spread out quite a lot, and thus don't need skyscrapers. When there's tons of money but you feel no compunction about needing lots of people in proximity to it, you can build suburbia/exurbia, and basically California happens. When there's neither money nor population, you just have plain, ordinary rural poverty, which tends to spread itself somewhat but not too much.

This is why skyscraper construction tends to correlate so well with economic bubbles.

*** If you're carrying vast amounts of expensive cargo, you'll need to protect it. I don't know if the flying castles will look like what we normally call castles, but that doesn't make them not castles. On the other hand, the lack of nobility does make them not castles. Flying fortresses would be more accurate.

Edit: Boats can't really be made of stone. Flying castles apparently can. It has downsides, but it has upsides as well. Someone can't burn down a stone flying castle. Perhaps they'd have wooden ones for flammable cargo (so burning it down removes the entire point of piracy) and stone ones for non-flammable cargo.

** Castles are expensive, even if all you need is a stone cup with a roof. It takes a long time for even one flying castle to pay itself off relative to an extra camel. It takes a long time to see /any/ revenue.

Maintaining a camel requires a decently skilled peasant earning a pittance. One such peasant can maintain dozens of camels. Adding an additional camel to a caravan is a small, incremental cost, and you see a return on the investment pretty quickly.

Sure, it takes twenty caravans to match the cargo capacity of one flying castle -- but you've got your first caravan loaded, traded, and returned by the time the castle's got its foundations laid. Hell, if you have the capital for a whole castle, you can have all twenty caravans provisioned and sent out. And that's probably not including the cost of lifting the bloody thing off the ground.

Housing artisans to work on finished goods? That seems kind of silly. The artisan gets to view strange cities on occasion -- but probably only three or four, ever -- but she gets a small bunk and poor rations and has to deal with the castle tilting in the more turbulent winds. The castle loses out on thousand cubic feet and a thousand kilograms of storage (the person, the bunk, professional gear, food, and water). Moving raw materials instead has a bit of latency, but it's much more efficient.

Gardens on a flying castle? That seems rather silly too. The weight of water, dirt, and wood spent on one fruit tree would feed one person for the entire expedition, probably, and it would produce far less food than that. The reason you bring livestock is to have fresh meat, so unless there was a pressing need for fresh fruit -- but it would only be available in one season.

Sending in flying castles to conquer an island with a valuable trade good? You can do that will ships, too. A flying castle is just a granite-clad battleship.

If you can build a cheaper structure to fly, and you can keep it in the air cheaply, and it moves as fast as a camel, then you have an argument for flying structures for trade. But this thing is outrageously expensive to maintain. Or if castles scaled significantly better -- one person being able to maintain the spell for anything from a flying dinghy to a small city -- you could make up for the expense with the outrageous capacity. Think one castle handling several percentage points on a major trade route, with a complement of, say, six mages keeping it aloft. But at the efficiency they're talking about, I don't see it happening.

*** Exactly what I came here to say.

If you can read windspeed and direction for various heights other than where you are, you can move the castle up and down in order to change speed and sometimes direction. But still, you're dependent on the wind at some altitude blowing in the direction you need.

It's safe, but it's pretty unreliable.

*** Boats [[http://www.discoverboating.com/resources/article.aspx?id=253][can sail upwind]]. If the wind across the castle is perfectly homogeneous and the castle is already moving as fast as the wind, you are stuck, but if there's a difference you can use that difference to do work. I'm not sure if a flying castle could move against the wind using wind power only, but I wouldn't be surprised.

**** If you have differences in wind speed, you can pick up speed by flying in circles. If the wind is moving and you're not, then from another point of reference you're moving and the wind's not, so you can turn around and be travelling faster than the wind, but going against it is still impossible. If you're already still in still air, you'll never move. Changing the point of reference to already moving in moving air won't help.

As long as you have limitless moving air and still water, there's no theoretical limit to how fast you can go. But if everything's moving at the same speed, you have no power source. From the point of reference where it's all stopped, there's zero energy, and no way to increase that.

** I think I can buy most of this, actually.

Levitated objects in this system clearly take off and land by just sort of being lowered vertically to and from the ground, so it's pretty obviously most efficient to give them a flat base. Air resistance would seem to imply a boatlike shape, but if you assume they fly "diagonally" it could still look castle-y.

I'm not an expert on pseudomedieval architecture, but I think these castles have base area as a limiting factor (there's no mention of "overloading" castles, but flying cities run into "unknown scaling issues") and "big stone tower" is the tallest kind of building around in pseudomedieval settings, right? Maybe stick some gardens on the roof, because why not.

The military potential of this sort of thing are absurdly broken, so I can completely buy that the first "flying castles" were literal castles people used to drop rocks on each other. The article seems to imply that modern "castles" still haven't quite escaped the assumption that they're military in nature, which is probably why they're not known as "flying warehouses" or somesuch.

The magitech stuff seems a tad ridiculous, but it's running on an unknown magic system in which "magic sails" is apparently a plausible explanation for how one would move ... I don't even know how much weight is implied by this, but it's a lot. It receives no explanation, but there you are.

Stuff I'd do if it were me:

- The obvious route would be to try and extend your castle out sideways and downward once it's in the air, assuming the magic doesn't arbitrarily forbid this.
- Cost aside, I don't see why you wouldn't have backup spell-engines or wizards ready to "catch" you if you start to fall. Seems like a basic precaution to take.
- Is there no teleportation magic at all? That doesn't seem very D&D-y.
- Not sure I buy that "gnomish spell-engines" and "mortal spellcasters" balance out so perfectly, instead of one or the other being much better.
- It makes more sense to build in the air and just never land, unless the magic prevents that somehow (maybe you have to set up markers on the ground to "target" the spell, or something.)
