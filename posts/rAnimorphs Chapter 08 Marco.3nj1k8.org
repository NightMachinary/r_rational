*** When re-reading Chapter 7 in preparation for this chapter, I got to wondering how the "overwrite" process would work with intelligent creatures. If Jake does get his consciousness back from this, I came up with an exploit; someone can morph Elfangor (or a civilian can be forced to morph Elfangor), and stay in there until Elfangor's mind overwrites their own. Then they have his knowledge and skills.

I think there's a reasonable chance this is a possibility, because that would explain why the author made the "resonance" exist; it ensures that they can only have one Elfangor, not dozens or hundreds.

However, I also wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work, because it would fit into the current "You're all fucked" mood of the fic.

Heck, depending on what the size limit is, you could just grab a toddler and do it. Kids are cute, but the replacement cost on a two-year-old's minimal life experiences is, well, minimal.

Edit: if there weren't the resonance problem your best bet would probably be to just kidnap a bunch of people and turn them all into Elfangor. These people would come to shitty ends anyway if the war were lost, so you may as well kill them. You could make a hundred copies of Elfangor, and the minds you destroyed would still pale in comparison to the millions and millions that you saved (or, as Tobias points out, the quintillions in the rest of the Galaxy who would be saved by denying Earth to the Yeerks).

******** On thinking about it for a while, I'm surprised none of them have gone "So all of you have acquired me, so let's bring back Elfangor and hope that when this is all over there'll be a body left over to bring me back." Morphs have resonance, but I presume there's no problem with (eventually) mindcloning an ordinary (trans)human(ist) and only giving one version the morphing power, who then would sacrifice themselves to resurrect some other acquired shape.

You'd have to do a bit of a dance - you can't acquire from morphs, so designate the person who has the original sacrifice backed up "backup one", designate our sacrificial fork "throwaway" - Throwaway would acquire Backup One, then Backup One would permamorph into the original sacrifice, resurrecting them - then Throwaway would permamorph into Backup One, resurrecting them in turn.

** So to counteract the terrible mood of this chapter, let's list out the possible positive sources of help that haven't been explored thus far:

Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill, and whatever remains of the crashed dome ship. (Personal expectation: He could very well be dead, the Andalite structure could be different and he not have been left alone, or the Yeerks could be en route to recover the Andalite technology from the remains. Outlook: Not good.)

Erek King and the Chee. (Personal expectation: Might not exist, might not be friendly, or might be restricted from interfering in any way due to their programming. If they exist in any form similar to the originals, this might be their best bet. Outlook: Unknown, but possibly positive.)

Visser One/Visser Three political infighting. (Personal expectation: I actually thought the original series was pretty accurate in terms of showing a large organization dealing with political in fighting, from my experience with corporate culture. That having been said, given everything we've seen, the author seems willing to change enough from canon that this simply might not exist or they might just work together. That said, the focus on Marco's mother this chapter makes me think Visser One is likely to play a part in the future of the plot. Outlook: Could go either way.)

The Ellimist and the Crayak. (Personal expectation: Probably doesn't exist, if they do, it remains to be seen what if any impact on reality they have. Outlook: Probably irrelevant.)

Things that could help the Animorphs but likely won't:

Yeerks in their native form are vulnerable to high temperatures and oatmeal. (Unknown how this information would be acquired.)

Kandrona Ray requires a high amount of power, possible to disrupt the feeding source by knocking out the power feed and somehow disrupting the generators.

Yeerks may not be intrinsically evil, so maybe they'll encounter that one host/symbiote species to allow them to stop the spread of abduction?

That's what I've got so far. Amy other ideas from others who have read the original books?

*** The Ellimist almost certainly exists in The Reckoning, and has already affected the outcome of the story twice, probably three times.

Elfangor said the seven of them (Elfangor + Animorphs) had been moved into place by what the Animorphs might call God. If even half of the coincidences in the original book (Cassie has unusual morphing powers (True), Tobias is Elfangor's son, Visser One is Marco's mother (Probable)) are true, this is too unlikely to be coincidence.

Even in canon, this is not coincidence; when Crayak agreed the Ellimist could have six champions, the Ellimist stacked the deck. Then Tobias randomly finds a sperm whale of all things just lying on the beach. In addition, the Ellimist deciding that the six should have unusual cognitive abilities is probably a thing.

The other thing that could help is the Time Matrix, but that's so OP that I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist in The Reckoning.

***** Agreed. It seems pretty obvious that Crayak would have set up Esplin and Alloran during the 'setup phase' so to speak, given the unlikelihood of such a thing occurring. Not only is an Andalite-Controller nigh unheard of in canon, Alloran himself is literally the worst possible Andalite for the Yeerks to have captured, at least among the set of Andalites Esplin has met. It screams of a Crayak move: "The best Andalite mind in your army is captured by the Yeerks, and is mine now. Your move Ellimist. No tagbacks, remember?."

As for moves 'on camera' ... I may have to read what's been done so far again. It may also be possible, as I mentioned earlier, that the Ellimist gets more 'moves' than Crayak, as he clearly controls the weaker side in this conflict. Depending on your definition of 'on camera', I wouldn't be surprised if Crayak disabled Elfangor's planet-killer to prevent an Ellimist win. Or perhaps both sides agreed this would be done in order to set the stage for the conflict.

I love the fic so far, by the way. The combination of rationality, speed, and lethality is amazing. I follow along with very few fics, normally preferring to read it when it's completed, but I'm definitely looking forward to participating in the ongoing theorycrafting with this one. This is something I NEVER do, for fear of spoiling the story, but I don't think that'll be a problem here. Even if we solve some of the mysteries, the story itself will still have twists and turns we couldn't or didn't see coming.

The issue with having the Ellimist/Crayak is that you either end up with a Rube Goldberg contraption of events leading to the finale, which seems unlikely to make sense in an explicitly rational fic, or he's vastly underpowered for some unknown reason.

***** In Cassie's viewpoint chapter, she morphed an elephant in a very specific series of steps in order to hide it from her mother for as long as possible.

Technically, it has not been determined that this is not a standard feature of Reckoning morph technology, but I'd say there's an excellent chance this is a nod towards Cassie's canon ability.

In canon, the Ellimist and Crayak agree to rules in their contest, as they almost destroyed the galaxy in their battle during the Ellimist Chronicles. I imagine similar rules apply here. My current guess:

Each side is allowed a certain number of setup moves, which have occurred before the fic began. The Ellimist, having the weaker side, might be allowed a certain number of extra moves within the game itself, or perhaps he set up the sperm whale during the set-up phase, and it didn't finish until the 'game' had already begun.

**** u/MugaSofer:
#+begin_quote
  The Leerans exist
#+end_quote

And ... are they anything like canon? Because canon Leerans were perfect telepaths, and broken as all hell.

***** Currently all the reader has is an oblique reference from Visser Three:

  /If the Andalites had indeed managed to overcome three (possibly four!) of the morphing technology's largest weaknesses, then the Leeran morph (with all of its disadvantages) was now the only method of determining which of his subordinates could be trusted./

*** I have no idea what I'm talking about but: How about the people in the cages? Say they got a little bird into the weapons locker, changed into a gorilla, gathered up as many weapons as they could then ran them over to the cages. Some of the people in those cages would understand immediately, start shooting. The ones who didn't get it could be used as cover. The demons would be quickly outnumbered.

  The Ellimist and the Crayak. (Personal expectation: Probably doesn't exist, if they do, it remains to be seen what if any impact on reality they have. Outlook: Probably irrelevant.)
#+end_quote

The weird coincidence of the whale washing up on the beach at the exact right time was called attention to already, i think thats likely ellimist inerference as in canon

**** Small question: in canon, that was actually Crayak, acting through the Drode, was it not? Ellimist unwilling to kill an innocent whale, and all that?

**** I should maybe have re read some of the earlier chapters since I suppose I'm missing some things. Thanks for pointing it out.

  Yeerks may not be intrinsically evil, so maybe they'll encounter that one host/symbiote species to allow them to stop the spread of abduction?
#+end_quote

In canon there is a Yeerk peace movement who want a more symbiotic lifestyle, or use the morphing technology to leave their bodies and become other creatures permanently, i could see something like that happening given the emphasis on Yeerk internal politics already
