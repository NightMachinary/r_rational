** That idiot starts hitting stuff with 1hp instead of figuring out some heal magic.

*** There's a lot of reasons why he wouldn't go straight for healing magic, but I see that I haven't really made them clear in the story. I'll either clear it up in the next chapter or edit this one.

As it is now, I agree. He looks pretty stupid.

**** As he is safe, and didn't heal with new level, his priority should be getting that 1 hp up. He could have died hurting his hand. He could die tripping on a stone.

His creation is up, he could just whip up some medicine or something.

I'm a bit surprised resting didn't help with hp at all.

Though, I admit, if I suddenly got magic abilities my priorities could shift too.

Unlikely. It's pretty hard to do 1 damage, most hits won't even register before they do 3-10 (unless it's damage over time thing, like bleeding or poison). This is what I should have told the readers, but i sort of forgot (lol) so now it seems like Isaiah is just metagaming.

Same here. You also have to think about what sort of person he is. He's a pretty smart and rational person, but above that he's a huge dreamer. He's been fantasizing about this sort of thing his entire life. Discovering that he might be able to fulfill those fantasies might be messing with his decision making just a little.

****** You might say it's hard to do 1 damage, but the guy doesn't know how the system works. In some systems a splinter on finger could do actual damage.

******* Yeah that's what I'm saying, he's metagaming. I just edited the chapter a little, adding this right before he tests his enforced arm.

"If I hadn't smacked into the waystone on my way here, this would be a questionable idea at best. While in Fresno I scraped my ankle, stepped on sharp objects, and of course ran into a large rock. None of them killed me, even though I was at one health. Either it's hard to inflict damage on yourself, or the small hits somehow don't even register at all. Either way, I'm confident this won't kill me."

Is that good enough, or does it feel like a cop-out?

******** Much better I guess.

Still I'd have gone for a healing spell or at least something ranged. I don't think tanking is a great idea in this kind of thing. But that's just my preference.

I did like reading these.

********* Thank you. I don't intend for him to be any sort of tank. Quite the opposite, in fact.

********** Yea the title does give it away, but he goes for enhancements for hitting stuff first. I guess it's just testing the system.

** Decided to go for rational-adjacent instead of rational after receiving a comment I very much agreed on. Let me know what you think about the story so far, and if anything about it bothers you. Thanks.

** Quite enjoying the story. So far it's well written and far above the usual Royal Road fare overall.

I like the mentions of lucid dreaming, especially since it's clear that you've either practised it yourself or read about it. Hell - I've not lucid dreamed a lot, but I also found that having structure for lucid dreaming "magic" makes things a lot easier to do.

*** Yes, I've been lucid dreaming for about as long as I can remember dreaming at all. It's really a one of a kind experience.

Glad you're enjoying it so far.
