I'm thinking on a story that will be about a school for superheroes, something like "HPMOR meets Incredibles".

So far I've figured that one of my heroes will be able to create portals, and another will have superspeed.

Now I'm thinking on some more cool superpowers that a person like HPMOR!Harry could invent a lot of creative applications for.

** I'd recommend not giving anyone super-intelligence because it's very hard to realistically write about such a character since they would take actions you would have never thought of.

Instead give people savant-like abilities such as perfect video-like recall, easily learning and doing insanely complex mathematical operations mentally, and can think far more quickly than other people. It's a lot easier to write since such a character will be a lot like a Hollywood rationalist who can recite tons of facts easily, but won't necessarily be any better at making decisions than other people.

**** Your interpretation is correct.

I was mostly thinking of something like the hero can set a goal to be completed and a way to accomplish the goal. The hero will then work on reaching the goal as soon as possible. There is some leeway in that the hero can take his/her time and not destroy him/herself trying to complete something like "get strong enough to bench-press 500 pounds" in a week. But the hero will not feel as if it's a burden to get over with, but rather as something pleasant he/she would like to do (i.e. to be very motivated). However, if the hero can't accomplish the goal with an arbitrary amount of *will*, then the goal won't ever be completed.

I did think of an interesting drawback where if it turns out the goal doesn't need to be completed any more, the power will force the hero to deal with an OCD-like urge to complete the goal anyway (like doing the laundry, but if someone else did it already, then the hero will still wash the clothes). But that means if a task becomes impossible to complete, the hero can go crazy trying to do it. Also if it's something like "fast for 50 days", the hero will kill him/herself doing so. It's a double-edged power.

Hmm, using it for something other than task completion...I would say only if the hero believes it can be done at all. If the hero is cocky enough to believe he/she can resist torture indefinitely, then the power will make it happen. But if the hero thinks it is impossible, then the power won't kick in. To me, it's dependent on a good deal of introspection and knowledge about one's psych. A little Dark Arts in Rationality would be very helpful for our hero.

Anyone who wants to use this idea can do so with no complaints from me.

I'm writing a fantasy book series. It will be a while yet, but this will eventually see play. There's a location where any oath voluntarily spoken becomes physically impossible to break voluntarily. So if you set yourself a goal and say that you will do whatever is necessary to make it true, that would do it.

It can be (ab)used for other things too, but in terms of the Infinite Willpower thing, the third to last book will see the main character breaking into the location to give himself exactly this, and then things start to escalate about as quickly as you would expect when both sides are incapable of surrendering or changing goals.

Also I feel like such people have something to motivate themselves into completing their difficult goals. I'm interested in a power that allows you to set an arbitrarily difficult goal with none of the self-discipline one typically learns to develop such a strong willpower.

I'm kinda visualizing the hero as someone who can put themselves into the most grueling situations possible and have absolutely no ill-mental effects whatsoever. The hero would appear very odd to others and be like Batman who built himself up to be capable of matching super-heroes.

***** A lot of amphetamines, such as Adderall, do more or less this. Some of the horror stories from taking too much tend to be an obsessive desire to do the one thing you want to do, and nothing else. There have been instances where people will work on something for 12 hours straight, never thinking about eating or sleeping, only to collapse in exhaustion when the effects start to wear off. Considering your description of an OCD like drawback, this sounds pretty close to a real life version of that "power".

*********** Sure. In this context, it means that I think making hard-stimulant usage normal in intellectual or professional settings eventually makes it /required/ in such settings: cognitively unenhanced people simply won't be able to compete. Meanwhile, people who never particularly wanted to enhance themselves will be stuck taking amphetamines just to keep up, and /everyone/ will have to deal with the unpleasant side-effects. And then the habitual users start developing /tolerances/, so they're not even getting as much of a performance boost from the drug as they once did.

So it's better just to not normalize it in the first place: the end result is just "unpleasant side-effects and addictions for everyone".

It doesn't even really make you more productive, per se, in the long run: just better at monomaniacally focusing on tedious, menial brain-labor. In my experience and that of others, you mostly can't come up with creative or original ideas when on Adderall, and it's very easy to get distracted (there's a meme, "I sat down to write a paper and wound up color-coding my sock drawer... twice").

I've heard this meme before and, although I find it /prima facie/ plausible, it doesn't seem as though the world works like that. These drugs exist and are used, yet not everyone in academia / business is popping amphetamines / Adderal / etc. Where do you think the disconnect happens?

#+end_quote

All I can find is [[http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/17/health/adderall-college-students/][this bloody news article]] right now, but suffice to say, 1/4 to 1/3 of university students /are/ taking these drugs as performance enhancers, and they /do/ see, at least in the short-term before they develop a tolerance, improvements in their cognitive and academic performance. The distributions are, to my knowledge, bimodal: weak students and elite students are more likely to take the drugs. I don't have numbers of any kind on full-time white-collar employees.

But what I can say about the negative effect is: endemic drug-taking to pursue /studies/ (we can argue philosophically about real work and the job market) [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law][destroys the value]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law][of our performance measurements]] while also dumping the unpleasant side-effects of drug use and addiction (amphetamines /are/ dopamine-affecting stimulants, after all) into the population.

So effectively, amphetamines are just not the kind of /all-around, general, safe, non-side-effecting/ cognitive enhancement drug that I can support from a "transhumanist" point of view.

I think the disconnect is: most of the people taking the drugs do so for menial intellectual work, writing class papers and that sort of thing. Eventually, menial work comes to its end, and the drugs won't actually help with the cognitive heavy-lifting that comes after it. You can't attentionally and motivationally enhance your way into greater actual intelligence or creativity, in the end.

/Problem is/, much of the labor that even real cognitive workers do /is/ menial, and much of the cultural and economic emphasis is precisely on the menial labor (which is one of the great deficits of our current social system: very little ambition to produce a tomorrow substantially different from today).

So, thanks to a skewed emphasis among people, we end up with nasty incentives to take the drugs, even though they won't actually make you /overall smarter/ than someone who doesn't.

(Personally, I /was/ diagnosed with ADHD, although as a child, and over the long term, I've found that having been on the drugs when younger made me /worse/ at self-organizing and self-motivating when I got older. I've had to learn those skills late, as I generally refuse to rely on drugs because of their side-effects. However, now that I /have/ learned those skills, I am finding that I can be /very/ productive without any need for amphetamines. It may be a case of the drug being a short-cut where proper training and lifestyle would require more effort but yield better results.)

** The range of superpowers is /really, really/ broad. My best advice would be to go pick up a copy of /Mutants & Masterminds/ and go look through their powers section (or just find a PDF online, which is less ethical but far cheaper), or the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowers]["Stock Superpowers"]] trope page. You need to answer a few questions:

- How much are the powers balanced against each other? Do some people have strictly better powers than other people, like someone who can create portals but only in doorways, and someone else who can create portals without the doorway?
- Do some people just get the shaft with their power, like the Jokers from /Wild Cards/ or the Case 34s from /Worm/?
- Do you have anything like the Manton effect preventing radical offensive maneuvers? (/ex. Creating a portal inside someone's head, using telekinesis to squeeze someone's heart, etc./)
- Are powers "unique"? Are there dozens of people with the same flight power, or are all the ways of flying different from each other?
- How many (if any) drawbacks do these powers have?

Anyway, there are a lot of questions that you need to answer /before/ you start thinking about what kinds of powers are appropriate to dish out. Here are my personal favorite powers:

- Multiplication. The ability to make independent copies of yourself that can go out and live their own lives before being reabsorbed, but with no other special powers. Like Multiple Man from Marvel or Dupli-Kate and Multi-Paul from Invincible.
- Teleportation. Usually with limits, because otherwise it's overpowered - either a refactory period, a distance limitation, or something else. Maybe you can't teleport clothing/glasses/teethfillings with you.
- Precognition. Either a static future, or a future that shifts around a lot and represents a "best guess" made by the power.

- Distance limited: the power only works up to an hour (or two hours, or three minutes, or whatever) in the future - the precog can't see beyond that.
- Access limited: the power can only be used for a limited amount of time per day, or with some amount of accumulated strain.

The controllers superpower is Coils superpower except that he can make arbitrarily many timelines, and all the timelines may only differ in whether he put things in his backpack. Since the controller has to specify what timelines to collapse away when the backpack or the things that might have been put in it are observed, the controller has as a corrolary the power of knowing whether WHM is observed, since the controller figuratively keeps getting asked to specify whether WHM is putting the dirt on the floor into his backpack in that case.

He loads it theoretically but being unobserved in a location that has stuff, and can pull out anything that he /could/ have put in it. So, if he is unobserved in a hardware store he can pull out anything that a typical hardware store sells as long as it would fit in a backpack.

Not made clear in the story.

It's moving with the same momentum as Leviathan, ie if L stops the water splashes into it from behind, but does no damage because L is a great big monster with super durability.

Any movement at all (relative to Earth, but probably ignoring the movement of tectonic plates, etc). Blinking would set it off. Leviathan is constantly wet.

*** I'm starting to work on a novel, with three different cultures all based around using one of the states of water for related magical effects. I was thinking about having that as one of the things the water people can do, except that the force from it appearing affects them, pushing them forward. And since if you're going faster, you have to have more water coming out in order to occupy the space you've been, you could use it to accelerate, and basically fly.

I think I would probably also add the ability to choose where the water comes out from, though the total amount of pressure you have to work with would be based on how fast you're going, so for instance you could choose to channel the pressure out of your hands, or feet. This would also allow you to make short range laser beams, if going fast enough, by say pushing it out the very tip of your finger and making a hydraulic cutter, though the recoil might fuck you up.

The main problem with using it is that I'm not really sure what do with all the excess water that it would create. Worm got around it by having it be an infrequent thing, but if there was a whole society that could do it, you would run into meteorological problems pretty quickly. Maybe make the water disappear after a bit? Also might be a bit op, though I think that if I made it so you could only start it at a certain minimum speed would help balance it.

***** Oh yes. I think I'll have two things each culture can do, with perhaps enhanced senses based on the amount of water in the air for the additional water thing. I think you would have to be going pretty fast for it to turn on, like top level human sprinting, and also have water somewhere in contact with your body. All their warriors would have to be really good sprinters, or at least have somewhere high to jump off from

For ice, the two abilities would be personal stasis and being able to turn ice chunks into memory storage and combat simulaters. The stasis would be straightforward, touch a piece of ice, and make parts or all of you utterly immovable, except by gravity. The consumed ice would turn into water vapor, with longer periods of stasis requiring bigger pieces of ice.

The iceputers would be a bit more complicated, but basically, when one them touched a piece of ice, they could load a memory into it, turning it all silvery and making it incapable of changing temperature. A bigger piece of ice would require a longer memory, and you can't pull memories back out. Once activated, the user can send their mind inside it and view any memories. Once inside, time doesn't pass outside, giving you time to think, find any relevant information, and also look outside through the block to plan what you're going to do. When you spend time inside it, the ice slowly subliminates, giving you a limit on how much time you can spend there, as well as making it so memories have to be relearned if you want to transfer them to a new piece of ice. So, in the middle of a fight, if someone was punching you, you could go into a piece of ice that's touching your skin somewhere, figure out the best way to block the punch, and then go back into real time and continue.

I wanted to try to make it a rationalesque story, so the protagonist would be ice, since the powers seem the weakest but have a lot of potential for cleverness.

**** Tinkers never made sense to me, though. Like, I know Wildbow was working backwards from the premise, "Okay, here's a typical superhero setting; now how do I justify it?", and stuff like Iron Man was probably the basis for the existence of the Tinker classification, but...

Augh, no, no, a thousand times no! /Science doesn't compartmentalize like that/; if you can build super-destructive lasers, you can use those same principles to power cities; the principles behind anti-gravity devices can be used in so many different ways I'm having trouble naming them all, and... yeah. I'm okay with the Tinkers existing, but the limitation to a single field is just completely at odds with the way technology actually works. The universe doesn't care if you use one of its laws to build time-slowing bombs or to build super-fast computers operating in a sped-up reference frame; it's the same principle either way, so if you can do one, you should be able to do the other.

This is, of course, operating on the assumption that Tinker science is "real" science as opposed to shard-based "magic", but given the Wildbow explicitly states that Tinkers have an "advanced grasp of science" to thank for their abilities, and that they can apparently distribute their technology to be used by non-Tinkers and even unpowered people, I think that's a pretty safe assumption. Pity it just also happened to nuke my suspension of disbelief.

Another thing to consider is that the powers actively help the Tinker work through the limitations of the available materials and tools. So maybe the power tells them just how to build a tool they need just to assemble one thing right with the materials they have to work with. This also factors into the tinker tech requires active maintenance by tinkers. If the tinker isn't consciously aware of all the steps there power has made them take to get everything just right, they can't write a manual on maintenance that non-tinkers will have any hope of following.

Another common assumption is that the powers also grant low level striker abilities to help the Tinker assemble everything precisely.

***** If you have a fairly decent understanding of science it would be possible to write tinkers like that. I mean, the real-world scientist typically /does/ specialize, and different specializations /do/ require different skill sets - it's just a matter of the author realizing how a specific skill might generalize.

(Also, I think it's worth breaking down "advanced grasp of science" into what /exactly/ the magic is doing in their brain. I think one could conceptualize it as magically having the processing power for certain things. For example, someone might have the ability to instantly search the solution space of a given problem with very specific constraints for an optimal solution, and there might be a specific set of engineering fields where that comes in handy. Although, if you use mathematicians to hack at this enough you might find that you can map one set of problems to another and end up with something OP - but i guess you'd have to be a quite math oriented to even understand that sort of story.)

All lanterns have a corps but the green and orange corps are incredibly different.

**** Redirection would also allow for the following corollary powers:

Temperature control: Take the jiggling of temperature inside an object you touch and align all the little arrows into the same direction. Cools the object (or air!) you target to approximately 0 Kelvin and accelerates it to a velocity approximately proportional to its former temperature. Alternatively, takes an incoming sniper round and shoots back a (slightly?) slowed molten-lead sniper round.

Flight: Take the gravity acting on you and point it in another direction. The manueverability of this would be Asteroids-esque, except that there's friction. (Reducible by turning incoming resistance air away from you?) Interestingly, you can achieve space flight with this by slapping on a radiation-proof space suit and falling upwards. It might look somewhat like Hancock when you hit the ground, since the sudden stop at the end of the fall doesn't affect you and instead affects the ground doubly.

There might be a problem here with the identifiability of your global reference frame - here assumed to be Earth - which assumption, if dropped, could lead to things like instead redirecting your attraction to the sun or the center of the galaxy, or whatever other massive objects might be out there.

Fuelless spaceship propulsion can also be achieved simply by playing ping-pong against an inner wall of your choosing; each reflection against your hand increases the momentum of your ship, while all other physical processes preserve it.

** One element of Worm I will draw to your attention is how all the Thinker powers are unique. There isn't just one generic super-genius power and one generic pre-cog power, each Thinker has specializations. Tattletale is good at intuiting and extrapolating information from small clues, Accord has a planning ability that gets stronger as the plan is more complex, Taylor can multitask on numerous things, Dinah see the future as probability in response to single questions, Number Man can see math to go with everything.

Even though the each have one specialization, they use it in creative ways. Tattletale uses cold reading and pretends to be telepathic, Accord uses his ability to plan complicated traps just before combat starts, Number Man can both fight really well by predicting his opponent and make long term extrapolations by analyzing probability and trends.

  another will have superspeed.
#+end_quote

Think about the exact variety of super speed you want. Velocity in worm get super speed with no friction or inertia problems, but his ability to effect the rest of the world is reduced at super speed. Battery get superspeed with the limitation of having to charge and use her power in bursts. Assault requires an initial boost of existing kinetic energy to build up speed ((he synergizes with Battery very well). Ask yourself how your superspeed deals with friction and inertia, how their reaction times scale, how long it takes to build up, ect.

*** Number Man wasn't really a Thinker though. He was just the spear expy of Contessa / a God Mode Sue justified as "oh, well, I see math everywhere." Seriously, why would seeing math make you an awesome hand-to-hand fighter? Even if it did somehow allow you to anticipate your opponent (which I find debateable), why would it also allow you to move your body appropriately to take advantage of that knowledge?

**** He had a pretty BS tier power, but it made sense how it worked

From [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/interlude-21-donation-bonus-1/][interlude 21]]

#+begin_quote
  The notation billowed around it, and through it, he could see the movement of the pen, the plotted trajectory, the velocity and rotation of it. The numbers clicked into place with a speed that made the rest of him, his very perceptions, seem like slow motion.
#+end_quote

His power is actively plotting events in realtime faster than his own perceptions work.

#+begin_quote
  He chanced one glance backwards. The attack had left a hole in the wall, the shape matching the impression that one might have made with an outstretched hand, fingers grasping, except it was fifty-two point seven six times the man's handspan.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  More notation, more numbers to work with. He could extrapolate, get an estimation of his opponent's weapon. He'd need a point of reference...
#+end_quote

His power is automatically taking in sensory information and extrapolating based on it. He barely has to exert any effort to do this.

#+begin_quote
  Now the Number Man was free to evade even before the attacks occurred. As a tennis player might move to cover the open court as the opponent's racket was drawn back in anticipation of a strike, he was bolting for the safe zone, the area where incoming attacks weren't as likely to fall, where his opponent would have to take time to adjust his orientation to effectively strike.
#+end_quote

His power can also project probabilities for events.

So his power not only does all the math for him, it work nearly automatically and handles the sensory data and does this nearly instantly for both immediate events and events in the future. It is OP compared to most Thinker powers,

#+begin_quote
  Seriously, why would seeing math make you an awesome hand-to-hand fighter?
#+end_quote

Looking at his POV chapter, it is providing the appropriate information with perfect timing, faster than he can perceive the events. So his power is effectively giving him enhanced reflexes as a side effect.

#+begin_quote
  why would it also allow you to move your body appropriately to take advantage of that knowledge?
#+end_quote

He has either trained his body to move precisely in order to get more out of his power, or his power also takes care of that also.

He is BS compared to other Thinkers. We never see him indicate that he gets thinker headaches and his power has a wider range than other Thinkers).

******* Other Thinkers have contextual limitations (Accord requires complexity for his planning ability) or have really bad thinker headaches (Tattletale, Dinah) or have very narrow applications (Dinah can only give probabilities in response to questions, even though her power can look at the futures in general). We are never given any indication that Number Man has any Thinker headaches and Number Man can apply his power both in realtime combat scenarios and in long term usages like manipulating financial transactions. It is possible there is some unexplained justification for his OPness. Number Man has been a very active cape for a while, [[#s][]] or maybe he rations his power usage very well and thus never has his headaches on screen. But given what we know, he is comparatively OP, he has several absolute advantage that regular Thinkers don't.

Contessa is a special case that we can't compare Number Man to. [[#s][]].

** I'm a fan of overly-specific versions of stock powers. The example that's stuck in my head is a telekinetic that can only work on hammers. Run of the mill, mass-produced, normal-sized claw hammers only, no cheating - there's even a specific brand that works the best.

The thing I enjoy about this is that your overly-specific telekinetic is actually only at a small disadvantage compared to the usual general-purpose one, once you've worked out all the exploits.

** Oh, here's a character for you:

Julian Hubberman (hero name: Tiresias) was an undergraduate classics major when his powers activated. Overnight, he developed a new sense: the ability to see and fully comprehend all of the worldlines that will be spawned in the next 8.3 seconds. What did he do? He put on a costume and started fighting crime. What was the obvious name to choose? Well, if you're an undergraduate classics major, obviously it would have to be 'Tiresias'...pity no one else knows the reference, or is able to spell it. Still, too late now, he's already publicized the name.

At any given time, Julian either sees with his eyes (normal vision) or with his Sight. The Sight shows him all the new Everett branches that could be spawned in the next 8.3 seconds. He can fully comprehend all of these worlds, and they are all real to him. By taking the appropriate actions to spawn a desired branch, he can force events to occur in whatever way he desires.

There's a couple drawbacks on this power:

- All of the potential branches are completely real to him. Every time he uses his Sight to force a particular branch, he has to deal with the fact that he is closing off all of the other potential branches that could have existed at that moment, and is thereby killing uncountable numbers of sentient beings.
- Whenever he activates his Sight, he can see the outcomes of his actions. This causes a problem with agency -- he knows (e.g.) exactly what words to say to convince someone. Doesn't this mean that he is taking away that person's free will? For that matter, his Sight makes it clear to him which branch will lead to the best possible outcome in any given situation (as measured by his own values and goals at the time). If he takes that branch, is he really showing agency? And if he /doesn't/ take that branch, isn't he just being a petulant child ignoring the best choice just to show that he's in control?

** Esprit the Hyper-Escalier. Thanks to an unfortunate encounter with alien criminals and then a followup encounter with an alien justice system in which entities with a very strong grasp of justice and an entirely absent grasp of human nature tried to compensate you for the suffering incurred in the first encounter using the only currency held to have universal value - your brain has been Moravec uploaded into an equivalently sized chunk of computronium running an emulation of said brain.

This entails the following effects: Because the simulation doesn't include obvious malfunctions, at all times your thinking is as good as it was when you were previously in peak condition. Subjectively, you are always well rested, sober and at optimal bloodsugar.\\
More importantly, the chunk of computronium can execute the emulation at very high speed. At will, your clocktime, as compared to human base can be varied from 1 to x872 (In theory, if you learn enough to make your mind more complex, the maximal speedup factor will drop. This is unlikely to matter much)

What this isn't: Super speed. Your body is flesh wired into the content's of your skull with entirely normal neurons. It can not keep up with even modest speedups. At maximal mental velocity, you might as well be a lock-in case. What it is: All the time in the world to think. About anything, limited by your ability to tolerate standing or sitting perfectly still in a world frozen in time.

** Super Strength + Invulnerability with no flight, enhanced momentum, touch range telekinesis, or anything else. For example, if you try to stop a car by standing it front of it, you would just get hit and bounce off (or get run over). If you try to lift it by the bumper, it would rip off. If you tried punching through a brick wall, you would push yourself away from it instead.

A power like the one from SUPERHOT: you get super speed that scales inversely with how fast you are traveling. If you are standing still, you are accelerated 100x. If you are walking slowly, you are accelerated 10x. If you are running your super speed is disabled. It would scale so that an outside observer would always see you traveling at a constant 20 km/h, no matter what your actions are.

Absolute invisibility and undetectability to everything, but also creates hallucinations that perfectly matches yourself. In other words, you can't be detected by anything /except/ unaided human vision. Glasses, mirrors, binoculars (etc.) don't pick you up, so you are absent in mirrors, tiny or absent in binoculars (depending on how they're built) and out of focus to someone who needs glasses.

Alternate emergency precog. You get a clear view five minutes into a future where an emergency happened roughly an hour ago, from your own perspective (it resets to a new scenario every hour or three). Your power is disabled in emergency situations. If you train yourself to ignore emergencies (and check the stock market, for example) to feed your realworld self information, you risk /being/ the actual real world version of yourself and ignoring a disaster for no benefit (and probably significant harm).

1/5000 of a groundhog day every day: you live through each day exactly twice. On Jan 1^{st} (a), you wake up with no special knowledge, and go through the day, and then fall asleep. You then wake up on Jan 1^{st} (b) along with a full set of memories, go through the day, and then fall asleep, waking up on Jan 2^{nd} (a).
