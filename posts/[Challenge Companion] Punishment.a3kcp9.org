*tl;dr: this is the companion thread for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a3kagk/biweekly_challenge_punishment/?][the weekly challenge]], post ideas, recommendations, chit-chat, etc., here.*

When I think of "punishment", my mind typically goes to Hell. Two recommendations in that vein are [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] by Scott Alexander and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Detail][Surface Detail]] by Iain M. Banks.

The alternate take (for me) would be a societal justice system, where "rehabilitation", "punishment", and "deterrence" are all typically considerations that work at odds with each other (and get explored in /Black Mirror/ in at least some detail through a number of different episodes).


** I wish I could remember the name of the book, but there is a science fiction story in which many crimes are punishable with decapitation. Which you survive after having your personality and memories and essential regulatory functions downloaded into a digital device that is implanted into your pelvic ganglion. You are expected to spend your own money on sensory replacements.

It's like an extremely drastic version of punitive branding.
