** I have loved this sub for years now. It was how I found things like HPTMOR, Darker Shade of White, the rational takes on Superman, Terminator, etc.

I had an idea to do a rational take on Marvel Comics for almost as long as I was aware of the genre. I finally did it.

A friend and I have launched a podcast where we are radio personalities in the early 1960s. We assume that everything happening in Marvel Comics at the time is really happening, and we comment on the implications based on what we can observe from the outside (ie we don't know that SpiderMan is Peter Parker, but we do know that he just appeared on all the late night TV shows and he is funny and witty)

We ask questions like: - Will there be a super powered arms race with the Soviets? - How do we replicate the creation of super powered individuals? - Is ironman a good use of StartCorp shareholder capital?

We have recorded 35 episodes so far. We just dropped the first four this morning. I linked to the newsletter, but it is also available on all the regular podcast players.

Would love thoughts from this community. We might even be able to incorporate your ideas as we move through the 1960s.

(We are currently recording February 1963 - almost to the introduction of IRONMAN. But Dr Strange, Avengers, X-men etc are far into the future recording schedule...)

*** Agreed. It's not the excerpt, it's the audio commentary on the events that is rational as we try and piece together a rational explanation.

*** It's the audio, not the summary.

The show takes the old Marvel Comics, but then asks, what would a rational outside observer think of the stuff that is happening?

The second episode is maybe a better introduction for this crowd:

[[https://www.superserious616.com/p/episode-2-the-press-conference-fantastic]]

It explore the ramification to an otherwise normal world of the introduction of super powered individuals. What does it mean for the space race? Can we mass produce super powers? What will the Soviets do? Will they commercialize unstable molecules? Is Ironman a good use of shareholder capital? Etc...

**** Given that you're presenting this from an in-universe perspective, there's an inherent difference from the source material, in that people are allowed to think about consequences still. Given that, how quickly do you expect to deviate from the source material, or if not, do you have an in-universe explanation for why the superheroes all seem to ignore normal thought processes and the feedback of the general public?

***** The premise is that we do not have full information. We don't know the stuff happening “behind closed doors” and the stuff we see and/or hear about we filter through skepticism.

So when Thor says he is “Thor” our questions are around: Is he someone who got powers through experimentation like the FF and picked up a hammer and is calling himself “Thor” or is he really the Norse god of thunder? Evidence suggests it is the former (at least initially). We talk about what that means and why he would lie that way.

Then as more facts come out (like a battle in NY with his brother Loki) we debate whether our first assumption was correct. Maybe he really is the Norse god? If so, what does THAT mean in terms of our understanding of history. We're the Norwegians the only culture that “got it right”? Why didn't the Norse gods go to other countries? Why isn't Thor based in Norway now? Are the other ancient myths also true? Or have elements of truth (Thor the superhero has a bunch of differences from Thor the ancient god - we talk about those differences including things like “hair color and a beard” and “the ability to fly”)

When the Baxter Building gets taken into space and then brought back to earth and “returned” we talk about structural integrity of the building and how what we saw was possible. We end up hypothesizing that it was built with similar materials to the new uniforms. And then ask how it will change construction going forward around the world.

And so on....

Because we are not privy to most of what happens so far we have been able to make our questioning work. It may grow thin once we get to the 1970s (“can we talk about how Franklin Richards does not seem to be aging?”) but so far we have only recorded a little over a “year” of content so the fact that unstable molecules have not changed the world of firefighting has not been a big issue yet.....

****** I guess my question was more around the concept of in-universe people asking... any questions at all? The core "irrationality" of a lot of comic books and comic book stories is an intentional disregard for the concept of "this has implications beyond first-order effects" (because the stories would quickly stop being in any way recognizable as "our world but with superpowers" which a lot of people are less interested in).

I'm not saying that's a problem, but one of the conceits of rational fiction is "people behaving in a way that makes sense" and so if you have characters who see and can predict things like "oh this is going to change materials science forever" and then... it doesn't, for day to day lives, then either the premise quickly turns into a weird fourth wall breaking "what is this world controlling conspiracy that is controlling everything to seem more like a story than people trying to make sense" or you've just given your characters the ability to make observations without retaining a working memory.

Not saying it couldn't work, but it does feel like the premise of "observe universe and comment as though you're a real person" would be very difficult for anything long-running. (See the HPMOR continuation fic Significant Digits to see where the logical "second book" of essentially that premise in the HP universe could plausibly go - it's good, but exceedingly /weird/)

******* Totally fair.

I think the longer it runs the bigger this problem is.

We point out the logical issues with what we are seeing, but then we attempt to explain WHY those logical inconsistencies might be happening (usually guessing wrong, as the "real" answers are not logical at all). We come up with explanations for what is happening that seem satisfying (again, even though they are wrong).

Sometimes our theories are proven wrong by the public stuff that happens next. It happens in the first two episodes. The first episode tries to explain why two monsters (Thing and Torch) attack the city, and how the military responded so quickly. The next episode happens after Reed Richards explains everything - and we clearly got it wrong. But that just opens up a bunch of new questions (and leaves some unanswered - like why does Johnny Storm appear so similar to an android from WWII? And if Reed was a military contractor, why did the military attack the torch? What is being kept from us?)

​

Eventually all our theorizing may come crashing down, but we are 40 episodes in and it hasn't happened yet... I expect it will, but it may be a while...
