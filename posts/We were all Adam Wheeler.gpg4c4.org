*** Yeah, I don't think it's so much that [[/u/sam512]] divined the future as much as his Antimemetics writings tap into a real-life source of horror and anxiety: two people in the same room given the same facts witnessing the same events can then recite two entirely different interpretations of those events, to the point that it seems that questions of object fact are in dispute. The man who wasn't there, the thing that didn't happen, the milk you KNOW you bought, the political candidate who it seems like ANYONE should be able to see is an actual inhuman monster.

I'll echo [[/u/valenciansun]] that the rise of 21st-century fascism is pretty squarely at the center of all these threads-- the war on truth, the disenfranchisement of science and scientists-- but one level deeper, here's what I see going on.

The printing press was at the center of a diaspora of diasporas. Writing permeated and influenced all subjects of inquiry, and looking at writing from the Macluhanian perspective, books are write-once-read-many-times, nearly entirely non-interactive, they require bulky physical objects to exist, and thereby their censorship always looks extremely cumbersome (book-burnings are hard to hide.)

When the internet and the world wide web first started to find their way out to the world, the read-and-write-often, interactive, non-physical nature of the medium made it difficult to censor, much to the excitement of hacker-libertarian-anarchist types, who envisioned a cyber future where everyone would have access to all the information they needed and the world would benefit in a nonlinear way from this educational, informational, transformational resource.

And for a while that's kind of what happened online, if you squinted a bit. The dot-com bubble burst was a blow, but it maybe helped the period continue a while longer where the internet was mainly for people who liked computers a little bit too much, and there was Wikipedia (which everyone's teachers and parents scolded wasn't a /trusted/ information source, so /be careful!/) and video games and a lot of blossoming creativity.

Then, Facebook and the iPhone happened. This got everyone online, which was a good thing as far as the hacker-libertarian-anarchists were concerned, but it also meant that the Internet went from this Wild West island of misfit boys to a propaganda platform for nation-states, and Vladimir Putin is the world leader who fully recognized and exploited the implications of this. Where Obama used the internet and cell phones to organize his supporters, Putin paid trolls to flood cyberspace with misinformation, and this is the failure mode the 80s guys weren't thinking about. Nobody was filling libraries with fake news because books are write-once, read-many-times artifacts with bulky physical presence. Misinformation online has no such limitations.

And that's how truth is crumbling out from under us, to the point we feel the physical sensation of horror when we realize our perceptions are fundamentally different from those around us. That's what Antimemetics draws on imho. The idea that a totally normal, familiar person sitting next to you could comment on how the BLTs are delicious today one moment and the next, casually, say gosh the clouds today sure are gootl for this part of the fleth but they're not sure about time, and stab you in the neck. Are they crazy? Or are we surrounded by things we just can't see? What else is invisible? What else do our minds throw away because they wouldn't be /minds/ if they didn't?

So President Racist Twitter says, there is no virus, it's all a hoax, and it strikes that same chord of horror, because they come from the same place-- the corruption of the internet over the course of the last ten years by an infusion of money to turn it from an informational platform into a propaganda platform.

**** Hey, this is a really insightful angle to look at it from! Disinformation and the philosophical shock of realizing that human beings in your own ostensible culture are capable of holding these unrecognizable, alien, anti-human beliefs, and the paralyzing fear that this isn't a war anymore - look at our president. The propaganda war is long over, this is just a mop-up operation.

***** Hard disagree from me, in regards to insight. Consider how easily you (seem to have) jumped to calling a large group of people, 'unrecognizable, alien, anti-human' But this is standard propaganda, hell standard psychology even. People have been saying such things about eachother since forever. I would suggest that having insight into such phenomena should allow you to avoid this pitfall.

And if course make you aware of a deeper existential horror. The fact that the same thing has almost certainly happened to you. You are human after all, and if you believe it's possible to trick humans into believing in such anti-human beliefs then you admit the possibility that it can happen to you. And considering the number of sources of such propaganda, what are the odds that you've avoided them all?

**** I'm super skeptical of the idea that the internet is a force for super-propaganda in a way the printing press isn't. States can use vast resources to push propaganda campaigns through social networks, but a century ago they could use vast resources to push propaganda campaigns through newspapers, and people had a lot less opportunity to find alternate sources of information even if they wanted to.

Donald Trump is, shockingly enough, not the first incompetent narcissistic dishonest president of the United States.

I'm not saying the feeling you describe doesn't exist, mind you, just that it's not in any way specific to modern life.

I think this perspective misses a few elements of modern communication that make it especially suited to "what you're seeing and what you're hearing aren't what's happening" levels of propaganda. The advent of social media marked the point where the same authority figures who so carefully warned about the dangers of Wikipedia began wholeheartedly embracing misinformation because its source no longer seemed to be a third party but /their own friends and family,/ a night and day difference neurologically speaking. Word of mouth existed before; A/B tested modern misinformation campaigns can update the message on the fly to specifically craft the lies to be more virulent. You don't have to check in at the end of the week anymore to see how the word of mouth is spreading; you measure it as it happens with Google Analytics. And it's /cheap./ He can do with 200 people what the KGB couldn't with 20,000 people.

But he is the first to this degree on the incompetence, narcissism and dishonesty fronts, and he's the first backed up by a Putin-funded social media machine.

**** Is there any reason it can't be a melding of both horrifyingly outside-context X-risk and horrifyingly incomprehensible human evil - two things that don't go together in real life?

The reason 3125 is worse than real life viruses or real life evil antihuman ideologies is because it combines the relentless, undying inhuman aspect of viruses and other threats with the active evil and malice and desire to inflict suffering as an end goal, valuable in itself, of Fasicsm. So really it is a bit of both.

  Moreno staggers, vertigo swelling up and briefly getting the better of her. "Hundreds of millions of people died and we just forgot? Is that what you wanted to show me? You want me to write that down?"

  "Yes," Wheeler says. "Yes. Write this down. It's the first thing you're learning today. Humans can forget anything. It's okay to forget some things, because we are mortal and finite. But some things we have to remember. It's important that we remember. Write to yourself something which will make you remember."

**** Kinda funny that you would choose to end you comment by referencing the time Trump called the Coronavirus a hoax, [[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-coronavirus-rally-remark/][because that didn't actually happen]]
