** To be accountable for something, you must have had the ability to stop it. And while the Foundation might like to pretend that it could have stopped SCP-3125, the reality is that there would be little more sense in holding the Foundation responsible than there would be a child. They fought, to the best of their ability, intelligently and ceaselessly, and they lost anyway. How could they have not?

But I'm still glad to see an O-5 at least thinking about the question of how to do better.

*** I mean, this epilogue is an obvious reference to the current pandemic situation. I think O-5's sense of guilt aside, its more about the presence of accountability than the question of being "held to account" (with an implication of punishment or consequence).

****** None of these point to Covid with any sort of specificity. They are quite generic post disaster observations that could apply to every disaster, and so can't really point to any of them specifically.

Well, except the 100 years thing. That is an awfully optimistic timeline for the O5 to have about most sorts of disasters. As for epidemics specifically, Ebola was a thing 4 years ago, H1N1 was only 10 years ago.

To put it another way, do you think a reader 20 years from now would read this epilogue and immediately jump to "2020 Covid" or would something more recent come more readily to mind?

******* 100 years would be a reference to the Spanish Flu pandemic in the COVID-19 context. I agree the rest is broadly applicable, but I take that more as general commentary on disaster response with a nod to current events thrown in (that, yes, readers in the future may well simply miss)

******** 100 years gets you back to Spanish flu sure, or it might just be a nice round number. It would also be very ironic if it were a deliberate reference to pandemic in that sense, since you skip over a few epidemics to get there. Consider, "Are we going to have to do this again in 100 years?" "Nah, this sort of thing happens every 10 years or so... you forgot about a few of those didn't you?"

As for future readers missing things; the thing about references, or at least obvious references, is that they tend to be hard to miss and date the work they appear in.

******* Coming in from 2 months later - the 100 years one I'd say is the smoking gun. We had this scenario 100 years ago. All we needed to learn from it, adequately, was 'Wear cloth masks when a new dangerous disease is out there until infection vectors are fully understood, and then adopt societal precautions accordingly', with a slight economic damper due to maintaining a stockpile of cloth masks that has to be occasionally thrown out with age and renewed (Though there are massive efficiency gains possible here).

Had we done that, and as soon as it was clear international transmission had happened, simply societally masked up, instituted social distancing, and went about our business, we'd look like Taiwan or Vietnam right now instead of, well, America.

** So, questions never answered:

How did Michael Li get compromised? The *The Fuller Memorandum* approach doesn't make sense here.

How did he get a gun into the Vegas Room?

What was up with Grey, Clay, Red, etc.? How were they connected to 3125?

Ditto for the spiders?

*** Red: he was a useful pawn for 3125. He thought he was "in control" and letting the thing in. He was not; he was a figurehead, a mascot, who pretended that he was more.

Clay, Grey: they're antimemetic anomalies. As far as I can tell they aren't directly connected to 3125 except in the sense that they're all antimemes; you could make the case that the reason all these antimemetic anomalies are cropping up is because they're all "facets" of 3125 in a form, or 3125 is making it easier for antimemes to appear, or something.

No idea on how or why Li got compromised.

Getting a gun into the vegas room - probably less important than understanding how he got compromised, I'm personally ok with handwaving that as "yeah, it's possible to break the security if you're an insider".

No idea on the spiders. O5-8 even asks about them in wild light.

**** I couldn't find them/him named, but the humanoids riding the spiders in /Unforgettable/ and /Immemorial/ are very similar to Gray and Clay, so they're connected to 3125 in a stronger sense than that. I believe there was a third __ay name but I couldn't find it. Given that they're also 3125 vectors, it would be very unusual for there to be two types of humanoid, embodied, deliberate 3125 vectors which weren't the same type, if not quite the same 'breed'.

***** I'm pretty sure the human who rides the spiders is Red, the cult leader from [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ojai][Ojai]]. I believe he was wounded by Marion's gunshots in [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are][Unforgettable, That's What You Are]]. This is alluded to in [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/immemorial][Immemorial]]. Red also appeared briefly at the end of [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unthreaded][Unthreaded]]. That body was killed by Adam Wheeler at the end of [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/blood-brain][Blood-Brain]].

****** Re-reading the end of Blood-Brain, I'm mostly convinced. The first two appearances seem much more similar to Gray/Clay than to Red, but the Blood-Brain description makes it very clear he's been the same entity all three times and identifies with humanity much more than Gray/Clay did.

***** 4 days late (trying to understand the entire canon post-epilogue here), but the third humanoid antimeme is Elizabeth Day in the SCP-SCP-033 tale. In the comments, she is described as "de-aging people so that, from their perspective, certain memories never even formed." What's interesting, though, is that Liz actually defected over to the Foundation.

*** Part of this depends on how you measure the order of magnitude of the failure. SCP-2000 indicates previous extinction level events that it was then used to fix. It would have been powerless to help against 3125 however, even assuming it wasn't compromised when the SCP manifested fully any clone army it tried to make to fight back would have been the moment they left. An argument could be made that this means 3125 is worse than the threats that 2000 has already helped correct.

**** We have zero data about what sort of threats led to necessary recovery with SCP-2000, only an idea of the scope of the damage that needed to be recovered from; these unknown threats left a seemingly-life-sustaining world once resolved with, and so did SCP-3125. These unknown threats left an almost-extinct humanity, which SCP-3125 didn't. With no information to judge whether the threats were better (e.g. temporary extinction events only) or worse (similarly potentially permanent extinction events which were dealt with somehow), I would argue that the only scale we have for ranking 'failure' is the actual outcome in terms of damage, for which the scale (effectively) saturates at SCP-2000 necessity and is anthropically undefined for humanity-wiped-out-forever because there's no one there to assess the damage. (Where 'humanity' is presumably defined as 'a self-aware mind which identifies with the previous humanity'--it's interesting to imagine a future in which only certain SCPs roam the Earth or surrounding universe, some of them thinking of themselves as human.)
