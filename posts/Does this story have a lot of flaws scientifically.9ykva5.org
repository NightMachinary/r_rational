** So the human body consists of more than 60% H2O so ... Yeah, if being allergic to water in the bloodstream was a thing, then insta-death. There however is a poorly understood skin condition that some people have causing just their skin to have issues upon contact with water.

Honestly it's a bit of an odd choice for a book and feels like it falls into an "uncanny valley" of plot, it is neither something realistic enough to take seriously, nor sufficiently obviously false as to become readable as fantasy/SciFi, from the sound of it there is no world building to explain this, the same emotional effect could likely have been made in a more realistic way.

Honestly it sounds like the kind of trashy SI badly written woe is me fanfic that I drop 5 paragraphs in

**** Ok, I've had a look at your account and you seem to be trying to discredit this person in the strangest way possible, not sure if you are a troll or just don't get Reddit, you obviously know the answer to your own question and this isn't the right place to bring your protest nor is sceptics nor are the other subreddits that you are posting to, write an opinion piece and post it somewhere if you want attention

****** Yeah sure try to brigade some random idiot by posting lies to people who don't really care, most people here have never heard about this book or person, but looking at your post history it sounds like you support them just so you can turn around to discredit your own claim, this isn't about rational fiction it is just you trying to get attention, your actions are effecting a handful of people who don't care so stop being annoying and if you actually care then take it somewhere else like the papers that run the ads, send them an email or something useful

*** Yup, more of that. Removed, banned, and reported to the admins for ban evasion. If you see anything in this vein in the future, reporting it is helpful to us.

** Yes. Milk is mostly water, blood is mostly water, your entire body is mostly water.

Things like salt dissolve in water, without them in liquid form you can't get them into your body, even designing an alien species which is allergic to water has lots of difficulties to remain vaguely plausible
