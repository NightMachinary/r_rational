** Like one comment says in the last video. I started it thinking "No way I am going to watch 3 hours of scrolling text".

Well I did (at 2x speed though). And I regret nothing. [[#s][I think the way it ends]] But it was delightful.

Yeah, it might better to watch it when not pressed for time. The author seemed to aiming for an immersion effect which might get broken if just rushed through.

**** No, it's a joke. This isn't even a kinetic novel. This lies totally outside the Japanese medium of VNs/KNs. I'm playing on the odd translation of the Japanese medium names; visual novels have a modicum of game, while kinetic novels are entirely visual.

********* From what you describe, it sounds like an obsessive or obsessive-compulsive disorder, pretty literally. I'm not sure whether compulsion fits as I don't know whether the compulsion was strong enough to actually produce behaviors, or even if it needs to be strong enough to fit. I'm also not sure if it is a disorder per se. Does it interfere with successfully living a life you desire, or is it just directly undesirable?

I am not a doctor, don't take my advice. The OCD sounds pretty cut and dried, but I don't know anything about how OCD normally expresses itself and I don't know what the actual doctors heard or thought.

*********** Have you recently taken any drug, herb, or had any brain trauma? Any recollection of this occurring when young?

I can think of two approaches that might help. The first is to shut down when trigger, meaning to relax you body with something covering your eyes to simulate darkess, breathe deeply, and do mindfulness meditation. Since it doesn't occur concurrently, I don't know how long you'd need to do this; you would also do the meditation when or if the response also manifests.

The second is to think of positive qualia, and try to trigger the response. If that proves impossible, you might try to twist your negative qualia to its postive counterpart, e.g. sex for revulsion. I also offer no estimates on the feasibility of this approach; indeed, it could even be quite dangerous.

I thought it was a joke, but skipping through shows this is indeed a video of just text. If I'm just going to have to sit there skipping the video ahead all the time and finding my place again, I think I'd just like it in text format, I have no idea why you would make it a video.

*** I think the author intended for this to be an immersion experience. Trying to convey the feeling of having a conversation through the chat, to show the intensity as Nando reacts pausing or fires off questions. The space ambient adds nicely to the story too - Stellardrone's amazing.

It would have been nice though if the author had provided text logs as well, I like to archive interesting things.

Hope this doesn't dissuade you from watching, this really was good - one of the better rational stories, imo. It might be better to just watch it later when there's nothing pressing to do at hand.

Maybe we can request the author for a text version, he seems to be on reddit. [[/u/danielrpa][u/danielrpa]] I'd love to have answers on few questions about the series. And ask if there were plans for a sequel or if he has any other writing.. What do you guys think? He'd fit in great with the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd :P

**** Hello brightwing!

I actually didn't realize there was a thread about my story, quite surprised! :)

I plan to release a text-only/ebook version of Outsider - lots of people asked for that and certainly on the plans. The reason I haven't done it yet is because I wanted it to be professionally reviewed. Folks probably spotted some errors (grammar, typos etc) and I wanted to get rid of those first :).

I appreciate your feedback!

**** It's kind of like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs][watching]] Big Bang Theory without a laugh track. I realize the pauses are there for a reason, but that wouldn't make it any less annoying to watch for three hours, which would completely overshadow the point.

I actually can't do it. I start doing that thing where I'm reading the text but I'm not processing it after a few lines. I was reminded that youtube had a fast forward feature, so I might try that a little later.

***** Hello literal-hitler,

I'm sorry you didn't like the approach I used. I tried to simulate a chat and added delays in order to simulate the other party thinking about what had just being said. I can see that fast readers would find it boring. I really think that this aspect adds value on top of a self-paced "text read", however obviously not everybody will like it.

One day I might release this as an app so you can select "reaction pauses on/off" and "global read speed |---slider---|". This would allow the piece to adapt to particular tastes while still maintaining some of the multimedia value.

****** Thanks for responding.

I thought that might be what you were trying to do, but it doesn't make sense in the first place because the story isn't told from Nando's point of view, it's told by his friend who's reading the chat logs.

I did also read the story at some point and I like it. Thanks for writing it. When I watched it at 1.5x speed it was too slow and at 2x it was too fast, but to be honest even at 1.5x speed it seemed to lose most of the multimedia value, to me at least. Just data to keep in mind on incrementing speed and whatnot if you undertake your idea.

******* I respect what you are saying. Not as a defense, but as a clarification, in the beginning of the story the friend states that he wanted to provide an experience as close as possible to what Nando experienced. From my perspective, I wanted you to 'be there'. The intro says "...and faithful to what my friend experienced during his chat sessions"

**** Mostly it's a problem of telling instead of showing. In the story we're told the aliens are super advanced and really smart, Abel talks a lot about this, but it never shows in his messages, he's neither persuasive nor seems to properly understand Fernando's motivations. It's like a writer telling about how funny a character is, how great the jokes are, but failing to show anything truly funny and showing just mediocre comedy instead.

***** I can see that, thank you for the feedback. The hard part about simulating super human intelligence is that I'm a human :) In Abel's case, I also wanted to stress the angle that his ego got in way of his thinking. Abel does NOT have the same level of intelligence as Mara. He doesn't possess all the intellectual tools that Mara does. I wanted to convey, like I said, that maybe he wouldn't be able to grasp Nando's malice, but also that his ego got in the way of his reasoning.

For some time I considered having Abel performing some feats to prove his intelligence (your point about "showing") like Mara did. But I thought that it wouldn't be necessary because a) Abel had no motivation to prove his intelligence (he would get the device anyway) and b) it could be repetitive to the reader. I did offer a glimpse of his intellect by having him solving the riddles very quickly.

****** I don't know where to put this, but this is what I think after watching the first episode:

1. Even providing the information that FTL or a facsimile of it is possible is about as influencing as confirming or denying the Riemann hypothesis.

2. About the sharing of technology point: It's impossible to keep something secret once there's a sufficient number of people in on it. Why am I saying this? Because unless some socio mathematical law guarantees that it won't happen, or other civilizations violently suppress it, there will be some actors of some kind that share information openly (other civilizations, splinter groups, individuals). As long as those exist, trying to keep ideas a secret is quite frankly not a viable strategy in the long term. And to be honest, a civilization that uses violence to prevent sharing of ideas is sufficiently against my values that I would consider it an enemy, not an ally. After all, they will chaperone me too when I try to share my ideas, and for their strategy to be effective they need to ensure I remain at a level where I cannot seriously challenge them.

So in conclusion, a civilization that will not share technology and ideas freely whose application is mostly limited to non-military matters must be either hostile, or stupid.
