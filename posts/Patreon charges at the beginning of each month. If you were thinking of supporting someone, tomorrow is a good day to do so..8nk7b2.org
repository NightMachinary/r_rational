Not naming names. But just saying.

 

"If you build it they will come"*†

 

 

*Where "it" is defined as a thriving ecosystem of reader supported writers producing original works and distributing them for free on the Internet.

 

†And where "they" is defined as being talented new voices that would otherwise be afraid to take up the pen, or not be incentivized to do so (including but not limited to potential authors in economically disadvantaged areas of the world where writing would enable them to rise out of poverty [but also maybe not---it's writing after all not powerball]).


** The beginning of the month means two things to me:

- My rent is due.
- A new chapter of Pokemon: The Origin of Species comes out.

** Do you mind sharing what the new changes are? I don't see anything online about what will be different for June compared to May or April.

*** I read it as 'changes' as well the first two times I read the title. But all he's saying is they charge at the beginning of every month.

***** Meh. I more intended it as a method to remind those of us who said we would let a particular author allow us to pay him some money that we were going to do that (but just didn't want to be charged twice in such short proximity that we were going to do so) But the shoe fits...

Though I wish there were some better tax deductible way to give. To bad more online authors are not in Canada. Because I could work to hook them up with something. Right now Patreon is the best thing we got.

Wildbow (author of Worm) is Canadian, afaik. Have you offered him your suggestion yet?

******* Hmm. Interesting.

No, I have not reached out to him. I think in the back of my mind I knew he didn't want to get mixed up with the other John McRae (In Flanders Fields), but it did not click in my head that he was Canadian.

Hmm. Interesting.
