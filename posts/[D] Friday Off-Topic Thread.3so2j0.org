Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** 1. That can be a hard thing to do in D&D unless you have roleplaying buy-in from all the players. The problem is that while you can say that a /character/ doesn't know something, the /player/ is still going to know. I've tried it before and it's difficult. (Having amnesiac characters trying to uncover the past is easier, because the player starts from the same position of ignorance.) Tread carefully.

2. Dread is good if you want it lightweight.

3. I tend to sketch out really quick maps if there's going to be travel involved. I spent a few years running a game set in a D&D version of Europe and found it helpful to mark important locations. Maps also help to give you a sense of place, and if you give the map to the players, it adds production values.

   For planning out encounters ... it depends. I have enough improv experience to spin up an adventure from a standing start (where the only notice that I'll be running a game is the regular GM not showing up), but it's again an issue of production values. If you rely too heavily on improv, you can improv yourself into a corner. I tend to write out some dialogue beforehand to cover most of my bases and get stats for all the monsters that I'll be using. If it's your first time as GM, I would highly recommend doing that so you don't lose your way.

4. I don't think there's anything wrong with just starting off with your own stuff. The perk of doing that is that you'll know the scenario backward and forward and have a deeper understanding of it than you'd have of something created by someone else. The big worry is in trying something that goes against either the conventions of your rule system or the conventions of RPGs generally, especially if you don't have buy-in from the players. Like, I wouldn't make my /first game/ of D&D have a party of all wizards, because that requires some adjustments that I might not be able to figure out without experience.

#+end_quote

Players tolerate this a lot more if you use a system in which knowledge/memories have game-mechanical crunch. For any aspect of a game without rules, players think of themselves as the character; when rules come in, the character does things they wouldn't, and that's okay and expected.

For example, imagine a fantasy detective game: everyone keeps a list of clues they are aware of, must /present/ clues /from/ their list to solve the mystery, and must /make a check on/ a clue they possess in order to get a suspicion about a person/place.

Now imagine the mystery's villain has an amnesia spell. When they use it, a random clue gets erased from your list. It's now obvious to the player that something has been taken away /from the character/. /The player/ still knows that there /was/ a clue, but, like an item being stolen, the character no longer "has" the clue, so they can't use game verbs (present evidence; investigate) to /act upon/ the clue.

**** Sorry, I should clarify that I didn't necessarily mean D&D- I've still never played it, somehow. That's exactly the sort of approach I was hoping to avoid, personally I don't think pretending not to know would work out at all. That's why I'm wondering about mechanisms that would avoid that- I feel like it would have to involve skipping steps to give the illusion of having lost memory. So like the stabbing example- instead of saying, "you got stabbed," the GM would just say, suddenly, "hey, you're bleeding" and have them try to react. Obviously the GM would have to do some pre-planning to give them options to survive. Or have them take an action and if it would involve them encountering the monster, effect a time skip of what you extrapolate would happen and tell them the results ("You open the door and... Huh, now you find yourself standing the middle of a courtyard, holding some blue pills" / let them find notes that give clues, something to that effect.

*** On a similar note, I've been considering a Quest (i.e. MSPA/RubyQuest-style Interactive Fiction game) that is a mash-up of /Mother of Learning/ with (a reversed perspective on a genocide run of) the game /Undertale/.

The userbase would play as someone who is aware that there is a serial killer loose in their closed community, and must stop them... only the serial killer is a looper, and the user-avatar is *not*. This means that the serial killer can reset the loop at any time of their own volition, and a reset will also be triggered upon their death.

The user-avatar gets one piece of information: the number of loops that have passed. The userbase must then try to infer and discard every solution they /would have thought to have tried/ in all previous loops, because the looper will have already seen and accounted for (i.e. gained reflexes against, as a speedrunner does with a predictable sequence in a game) all of those strategies.

To make this not just a bunch of debate on a forum, though, anyone can request, as a command, to /imagine/ the results of an action, the output of which will always be perfectly true and simulated equivalently to the story's own physics... given the set of facts that the user-avatar is aware of. Knowledge would be inventory in this game.

In other words, I basically see this as an escape-the-room game, where "the room" is you being tortured for a million years by a malicious AI. Or you can look at it as an AI-box experiment, which might immediately suggest solutions to some of you. Either way, the "true" solution would probably involve at least some timeless-decision-theoretic reasoning.

#+begin_quote

Does this number change over the course of the story, or is the audience told at the beginning "this is loop #24, you've succeeded every time so far, good luck"? If it changes, does that mean the audience has memories from past loops?

It sounds pretty great. I'd love to know if you ever get this off the ground.

*** Yes, we are. I don't know if everyone gets this, but... have you ever felt down "for no real reason", or cancelled a social engagement because you "just didn't feel like going out"? Most likely there's some cause for those that no amount of introspection will bring to mind. Considering your past reactions and the evidence of your actions rather than your thoughts is the only way to get past that barrier.

It might turn out that (to use an example from my own experience) walking to work in the morning makes you more likely to hang out with friends in the evening, even if you didn't consciously know that was the reason for your decision.

*** Consider the stages of skill mastery ....(the Dreyfus model). Typically the master is not even conscious of the steps. A black belt doesn't have to think, they have 'muscle memory.' They may think at a higher level. Your brain has lots (hundreds, thousands) of modules. You don't think to walk (unless you are 18mos old). We are, in some ways, a collection of conscious parts, which sometimes interact.

For a rather chilling (and rationalist) take on the topic, I recommend Peter Watt's Blindsight.

  Are humans only partly self-aware?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  I do try to be as self-aware as possible, and I'm aware of Alicorn's luminosity guide, but a lot of this is based on inference, working out why I feel a certain way and figuring out my thought processes by considering my past reactions, upbringing, etc., as opposed to just knowing why I feel that way.
#+end_quote

This seems to be a varying trait. One of my confusions about other people has been that I seem to have more access to my "subconscious" than many people around me.

This means that, for instance, I don't have /subconscious/ ulterior motives, I'm just repressing ulterior motives I'm straightforwardly aware of.

#+begin_quote
  If you developed an AI that had full access to its own code, wouldn't it be more self-aware than a human?

Yes. Enhanced self-awareness would also be an enhancement you could perform on humans if you understood neuroscience fully.

- Rationally Speaking: Julia Galef (CFAR President) has conversations with people about their ideas.

- Econtalk: Conversations between Russ Roberts and various economists/people in related fields. Not fun to listen to if you dislike libertarian ideas.

- Worm Audiobook and HPMOR Podcast (Two podcasts): Enjoy great stories while doing other things!

- Dear Hank and John: Kind of embarrassing to admit, but I like this, even though I stopped watching Vlogbrothers videos a long time ago.

- The Weeds: Conversations between journalists about policy issues, rather than politics. Just put out a good episode about Basic Income Guarantees.

- StartUp: Short episodes about the business of being a Start Up. Very well produced.

- About Race: Occasionally frustrating exercise in overcoming anti-SJW sentiments through exposure therapy / conversations between mostly reasonable sounding people about why race is still a big deal and we should care a lot.

- Waking Up with Sam Harris: Smarter and less crazy than you'd think if you've moved away from "New Atheism". Haven't listened to many episodes, but I've enjoyed those I have.

General Podcast Tips:

- Think of something you like. Now google that thing + "podcast" or just search for that term in itunes or your podcast app.

- Slowly increase your listening speed. I listen at 3X speed, and it's great.

It is extremely fascinating and interesting. Rules are simple but very deep, and playing is satisfying and engaging at any skill level. You can start having fun within 20 minutes after learning the rules, and it will stay fun 10 years in.

I am sure that people on this sub will enjoy it a lot, so if you haven't tried it - you should.

There's a great website [[https://online-go.com][OGS]] - it is very well done, and you can play against real people over there.

I have also bought myself "SmartGo Kifu" app for my iPad, and it is perfect(but expensive). It has a lot lf exercises, very smart AI, and all kinds of useful options, it's really great. I've been playing for hours in the past few days, can't stop.

There's also a great [[https://www.youtube.com/user/sundaygolessons][youtube channel]] to learn theory, I highly recommend it.

Because there are different board sizes, game can last anywhere between 10 minutes and several hours, your choice. And exercises work like very fun puzzles, which you can solve under a minute, and it is very enjoyable.

*** All of the following games have several things in common:

- they are multiplayer (except for /Captain Forever/);
- they are free-to-play, with restrictions posed upon them by their monetization scheme not affecting the gameplay too drastically for those who decide to not pay;
- generally, they do not require investing large amounts of time to gain in-game unlockable advantage over other players (e.g. levelling up a character, unlocking skills, etc);
- You can perform well in them with only gaining sufficient knowledge and skills regarding the game's mechanics.

--------------

- [[http://www.astroflux.net/][/Astroflux/]] ([[http://www.kongregate.com/games/fulafiskenab/astroflux][K]]) --- A space simulator, which I'd say has some similarities with Mass Effect series. You can visit different planetary systems, land on planets to collect resources and complete quests, attack other players and steal from them, etc.

  - (+) the game's design allows your imagination to work and fill in the blanks on its own.
  - (-) unlocking more powerful ships requires in-game currency, which can be bought with real money. It is possible to “win” against other players without doing so, however, if you develop a smart gameplay style.
  - (-) Once you investigate all the currently-developed planetary systems, the gameplay will likely become repetitive.

- [[http://www.captainforever.com/captainforever.php][/Captain Forever/]] --- You attack and destroy other ships, and then upgrade your own using the remaining debris.
- [[https://gameofbombs.com/][/GameOfBombs/]] --- Multiplayer version of the classic Bomberman, basically. Having a good reaction will give a significant advantage.

  - (-) the later versions have become needlessly overcomplicated with lootable power-boosting items, IMO.

- [[http://www.kdice.com/][/KDice/]] --- [[http://imgur.com/KHAZhfA][Multiplayer version]] of [[http://www.kongregate.com/games/trucbidule/dice-wars][Dice Wars]].

  - (+) Players can negotiate to cooperate with each other in short-term, can betray each other later.
  - (-) Don't remember any, though admittedly I haven't played it for a while and things might've changed.

- [[http://mitos.is/][/Mitos.is/]] ([[http://store.steampowered.com/app/389570/][S]]) --- Here you control a cell, which can get bigger by grazing or hunting smaller cells, split up to 8 smaller cells, feed allies or ambush bigger cells to steal matter from them.

  - (+) Players can negotiate to cooperate with each other.
  - (-) The current game mechanics makes cooperation in the Free-for-all mode overpowered.
  - (-) Higher level cells\players have some unfair advantages over lower level ones.
  - (-) Currently world-maps are too small, in my opinion (e.g. compared to GameOfBombs).

This is a [[http://i.imgur.com/rvKPr7a.gif][[bullet hell]]] game, in which the player gets rewarded for correctly deciphering/anticipating enemies' shooting patterns and the general movement of dangerous elements on the entire screen. It is possible to kill many bosses without any “top”-level equipment at all (though they help) if one stays concentrated and has the know-how.

  - (+) Once a character dies, all the gained levels and items disappear with him. This removes many advantages that older players would otherwise have over newcomers.
  - (-) Storage capacity is severely limited to indulge players in investing real money.
  - (-) One lag that's out of your control can kill your character and waste hours of time that was spent developing it.

That said, I don't trust my judgment on this particularly much, and also don't really have many options for less publicly-requested betas, so... anyone willing to beta? What it was supposed to be is not important, since what it turned into spent way too much time talking about simulations. It's also unfinished (there are only 7 complete chapters and the beginnings of an eighth, for a total of 12050 words). I can't promise that it's any good in general, only that I reread it a couple times and didn't hate it as much as I expected.

I'm talking of course about the shootings in france and how Hollande has said 'We are going to lead a war which will be pitiless'. I think it is time for another cycle of war. It feels like it did before. The rage is there, and the pain. If you go into the news threads you'll see all kinds of people saying the strangest things. Using this to 'prove' that all muslims are bad people, that funding mosques should become illegal, that it was the immigrant's fault or that we should invade the Saudi.

The politicians are competing to see who can be most outraged, there are no real moderating influences. You go into a thread about Muslims condemning terrorism and expressing solidarity and all the comments are about how Muslims are being insufficiently contrite, as if all atheists should have to apologise for Stalin or similar. You enter these discussions and you can't be the moderating influence either. Any call for reason, or mention of how this is but a small number compared to the many deaths in x or y area and suddenly you are one of /them/.

Looks like it's about that time. There are enough armed forces members sitting idle, and there is a clear target. It is going to happen again and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. It saddens me.

Are they? Exactly how is Hollande planning to retaliate? Because the attack was claimed by Da3sh, so I can infer two things from that.

1. Da3sh is not going to leave the world alone. They'll continue attacking as long as they're able.
2. France and other victims are going to retaliate. There is not an exhaustible supply of 'conflict particles' that just disappear when they are used up.

Besides which, Da3esh is a great way to keep common citizens scared.

/It is not a question of what is effective./ America's efforts after 9/11 effectively birthed the influx of young defectors. The racism and ingroup thinking that the attacks inspire worsen relations with all of Islam, and pushes fence-sitters towards reaction themselves, particularly in areas affected by the war. America invades for no discernible reason and spends over a decade sitting there and ruining the region? I'd want to fight back too.

But isn't that exactly the same regarding whatever war you imagine will happen as a result of that?

If I remember correctly about 1.6 million people die every year around the world, on wikipedia it says that over the 4 years or so of the iraq war and occupation anything between 150k to 1m people died. so all in all anything between 2.3% to 15% for about 4 years.

**** Depending on how you look at it, the death from the wars could be considered vastly higher. The opportunity cost of the war could be said to claim far more lives than war casualties. Assuming the resources were instead spent effectively preventing deaths, that the wars cost some factor of a trillion USD and the amount of money spent (efficiently) preventing death is some factor of ten to a hundred thousand USD/life, then that's some factor of 10-100 million lives that could have been saved. On the other hand, ~55 million people die every year (not 1.6 million) so the ratio still isn't too different than what you said. Also, its not like spending money on effectively saving lives is something that's actually done on that scale. Still its hard to look at that and not be saddened, especially when you consider that the reaction is based on something so tiny. And also its the reaction that's exactly what the terrorists want in the first place.

***** You are indeed correct about the mortality rate, I believe was thinking of vehicle related deaths(and upon further looking its actually more like 1.3m). Regarding the number of deaths, just the same as war funds could have been used to save X more lives than just avoiding said war by being directed to Y cause the outraged people could say the same about the resources the terrorists used.

You call that event "tiny", but in the end a war is also "tiny". its all about scale, and it seems fairly arbitrary for me to say one is more correct than the other.

Sure that is reason enough to be saddened if you feel that way about death, but as we mentioned the relevant scales you should only really be a little bit more saddened by that than by the deaths that occur without it.

Why can't we feel this way about all the death we can really do something about? Why do we see reports of thousands of children dieing every few days from malaria, a disease we can treat /efficiently/, and turn a blind apathetic eye towards it? Why do see a terrorist attack and proceed to give up the opportunity to save tens, if not hundreds, of millions of lives? Its as if we have a fire hose, we're staring at our home being burnt down, and we decide to throw petrol on someone's lighter.
