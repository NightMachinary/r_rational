** Oh man, when Tetsuo said "A phychic /pokémon/ attack" I really felt the stakes rise. Yuutas trial was a while ago now, especially for readers, but the harshness of it still carries.

Exiting to finally have Sabrina back. If I'm interpreting her hints correctly, she's about to give some big reveals to her students. The whole "can a psychic lie" business must have been inspired by Mewtwo, which means this might be the moment when the storylines begin to properly merge.

** Red: Aha, now I understand! My fear of sharing Rei's secret comes from my trauma over Aiko's death, where I “betrayed” her, resulting in her death and one of my best friends dropping me! Now that I can see this connection and how irrational it is, I can tell Tetsuo safely!\\
Tetsuo: Thank you for telling me this, Red. Rei I'm gonna try and get you fucking executed\\
Red: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1o3koTLWM][wait]]

ughhhh such a fascinating chapter. Red's figures out how to make a tulpa, and so his story gets closer and closer to Mewtwo's. Was the irony of Red, the worst liar in the whole story, becoming the first (human) perfect liar intentional? If so that's some god tier irony and story planning.

** That was /awesome./ I love the progress Red is making with his partition and the intrigue around Saffron gym, though I was a bit slow to warm up to that. By the way the scene a few chapters ago where Red encounters some Ghost-types was fantastic.

I could just feel my stomach drop when the implication of a Renegade accusation came into things, mostly because I remember the discussion on (to paraphrase) "Better for 10 innocents to die than a Renegade go free". That /really/ hammered home how seriously that kind of thing is taken and how she must've felt when she realised how much trouble she could well be in.

On an unrelated note: I'm late to the party on this fic so I didn't get to comment on the original thread for it, but I wanted to say how much I enjoyed an early chapters depiction of pop culture/cartoons in this world. Crobatman and Supermon, that was brilliant. Did the former lose his parents to a renegade by any chance?

** Question of the day:

Is Rei guilty of attempting to execute an executable offense against a gym executive using an executee's exeggcute?

Yup :)

Cyr probably can't believe how lucky he got, that instead of detaining him for having provided "Tetsuo" with the memory seed, he was sent out, because it was an "internal matter".

Since that's a lethally criminal plan, he's probably one of Giovanni's hired executees.

The whole pretense of trust between Sabrina, Mewto and Giovanni will crumble rapidly and I somehow doubt, they can hug it out. Question is now, who'll strike first?

Hold on. I'm having trouble understanding your comment. You mean that Tetsuo had the memory seed, so the seed would remember what Tetsuo knew about Sabrina? And then Giovanni would know (because Cyr would tell him) that Sabrina told her students to investigate whether a "psychic can lie", which counts as telling them about Mewtwo, which is disloyal to Giovanni?

**** No, Giovanni would already know that, if he's behind the attempt, since Rei would have told him that they're trying to figure out that question. It's not that big a secret. The question is why Sabrina thinks that Mewto can lie perfectly in the first place.

Giovanni is strongly considering to kill Mewto, since he can't trust him and he's an existential risk much worse than the Stormbringers.Giovani can't monitor Sabrina's and Mewto's conversations either, since they're psychically communicating.

Sabrina loves Mewto as a friend, and she doesn't know about the artificial disease (unless she's already a perfect liar, but that's really stupid). She (rightly) thinks he's holding something back and wants to know if that's possible.She probably has picked up on Giovani's attitude enough to know that she thinks she must protect Mewto from him, even (or especially) if she's right.

Tetsuo is her second and probably knows all what Sabrina is up to. She prizes loyalty and so would trust him with that info; also he needs to excuse a lot of her absences, so it's not like she can feed him some bs for years on end, and psychics can't easily hide things from one another, so he probably knows a lot, if not everything.

If you spend a lot of time with a dark, inscrutable, rationalist puppetmaster and a telekinetic, highly intelligent, dangerous kangaroo, you'd want a loyal friend, too. Tetsuo being confided in isn't a breach of loyalty. They're both gym leaders, she's very powerful in her own right and doesn't owe him any loyalty. They're more like partners, I figure.

I just think that Giovanni found out about Sabrina's not-so-secret project and would like to know her very-secret reasons.

** Great chapter! I love the power of planning as evidenced here - Red has had some form of the partitions since the opening chapters, and Mewtwo has had a need to hide his true intentions since pretty much the beginning as well. That some twelve year old kid would happen to be the one to uncover the seed of Mewtwo's answer to his dilemma of the tulpamancy trick would be a tall order if you wrote it down from the outside, but its an extremely organic development within the story itself - we have all been waiting for it for months at this point after all. Definitely an object lesson in the value of outlining critical story beats at the outset, a lesson a lot of popular media these days seems to have forgotten...

Unless our author didn't actually plan this all out ahead of time, in which case props for the major improv skills!

(I would agree with some who implied below that Rei's plan seemed pretty reckless, unless Red did something concrete to make sure the finger was pointed at her. But Rei is not that important of a character in the end, people make mistakes and minor characters don't get the screen time to fully spec out the causes of those mistakes. Thus is the way of narrative.)

​

Edit: Also just wanted to note that the Worth The Candle & P:OoS timelines have converged a little more with the official introduction of multithreading for our protagonist here. Where should Red allocate those skill points from his obvious level up??

**** I agree fully she did not expect the renegade accusation. I just think the odds that she was going to be identified as the source of the "Sabrina" thought appeared to be very high (or at least unknown to her) particularly with Red in the room, and the reward would be probably quite low - this technique would get impressions, hints, not full breakdowns.

This gambit wasnt going to give someone a detailed answer, just thoughts like "admiration, suspicion" etc as we saw, maybe some image flashes. She would need follow-up, while the price of being discovered would surely be eviction from the gym, renegade or no. I just don't think the risk reward is aligned here.

So was Rei expecting to get away with the merger (or at least have plausible deniability) and Red's powers managed to unexpectedly identify her, or was she going in expecting to get revealed?

** Hey everyone, doing an unusual PSA: For those that haven't been paying much attention to the coronavirus, I think it's worth mentally preparing for a chance that you or someone in your friends/family will get badly sick sometime in the next couple months, and physically preparing for society to slow down for a bit. If even 15% of people are too sick to leave the house at the same time, that's entering Great Depression levels of unemployment. Many aspects of "normal life" will be disrupted even for those who are not sick.

That doesn't mean panic, or prepare for an apocalypse. I still plan on going about my normal life in that time, assuming things don't take a sudden turn for the worst.

But at the very least, if you can afford to buy some extra necessities up front, I think it's worth doing. Get an extra month's supply of non-perishable food, toilet paper, laundry detergent, various basic medications, etc. Don't take any PTO for the next few weeks in case you need to take it later while sick or to help a sick family member. Make a habit of regular, thorough hand-washing while in public and before meals.

I don't tend to be alarmist, in general. Living in the hurricane capital of the US means I have a practice balancing on the tightrope of preparing for potential disasters that often end up being no big deal, and what I've learned is that being reasonably prepared is often worth more than just the peace of mind it provides.

Hope you all enjoy the chapter, and many more to come.

**** At this point I would be surprised if it manages to get contained; I think it's going to spread to most of the US. Not everyone will get it, but enough will that I expect it to cause some notable civil disruption (people not showing up to work, maybe supply chain disruptions).

On top of that, while it seems like most people will be fine after getting it, anyone above 60 is at a fairly serious risk, particularly men, people with heart conditions, and/or smokers. That is a large chunk of the country that are likely to need hospitalization, and the mortality rate for them may go even higher if our hospitals get overwhelmed.

Like I said, I don't think it's time to panic yet (if there's ever a right time to "panic.") But I definitely worry about what April and March will look like, and particularly worry about my dad, who's over 65, male, heart condition, /and/ smokes.

There's more I can say on this, but the basic gist is that I think people should be prepared. Maybe it'll blow over without serious consequences, but at this point it is worth a few hundred dollars of food and medical supplies that you'll end up using anyway if you can afford it, just in case you or a loved one get sick while there's a run on grocery stores and pharmacies.
