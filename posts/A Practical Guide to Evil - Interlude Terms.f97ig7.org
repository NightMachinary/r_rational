** Masego's PoV is hilarious. He really has no attention span at all for anything unimportant to him.

** I think the ending of the chapter is setting up for an exploration of the negative sides of the Truce and Terms. So far the Villains involved have been either of Cat's pragmatic antivillain style or relatively harmless ones. Now we have a case where the it protects someone who seems to be a mass murderer and rapist from the justified anger of one he harmed. Makes the moral calculus a bit harder to swallow.

Reminds me a little of the Amnesty in Ward. Similarly there you have villains who have done pretty unambiguosly awful things given a second chance, and good conditions, while the normal people are living in tent cities, and the heros have to put up with it for the greater good.

*** To be fair, I never got why that happened in Ward. They weren't exactly volunteering, so why reward them?

**** The purpose of the reward is to convince them to cooperate; a carrot to reduce the use and damage of the stick.

***** After Scion, society is in no shape to keep a lid on the bad capes, so they quit making the effort. The truly nasty ones just get put down when possible.

****** Teacher wasn't. They didn't send Valkyrie to eat Sleeper, the bio tinker and kinetic walk the streets free from consequences of their crimes

******* I only read up to arc 8 or so in Ward but from my understanding they were actively trying with Teacher but he was keeping a low profile, while Sleeper remained entirely beyond Valkyrie (Or anyone else's) power to easily defeat so they just left him alone on Earth Zayin as long as he wasn't moving. Teacher was basically a power unto himself at that point, and the only capes capable of handling him on the side of the heroes would be the Dragon/Defiant duo, and Valkyrie, who were all busy dealing with the actual existential threats like the machine army, tinkers building anti-planet skyguns, and the reality breaking broken trigger events. Most of the actual hero teams in the Metropolis were pretty pathetic by old world protectorate standards.

******** ^ This. No argument about Teacher being one of the nasties - there just wasn't anyone in a position to do anything about him.

******** You're still neglecting Bonesaw, who would have gone quietly most likely, and Amy, who wouldn't but Dragon could prepare around her.

They did some pretty shitty things, Bonesaw especially, but they're covered under the amnesty.

********* They are covered, because they went out of their way to make themselves useful to the amnesty. Persons of lesser character , with similar evils in their past would repeat them and be taken down. The point was giving humanity the chance to accept those who wanted to change. I'm not sure what they suffered for it, but getting Bonesaw and AMY, probably was cheating evil blind.

** Nice ending, couldn't happen soon enough, and Zeze-Indrani interactions are lovely as ever. But I wonder if that means now Red Sonja w./ Axe is excluded from the protection of the Terms ?
