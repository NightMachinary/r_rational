** Good work everybody, I am glad to see our little corner of Reddit and the Internet as a whole continuing to grow each and everyday.

You are the people who make the over 750 posts of compelling articles, stories, comments, and discussions possible.

I would especially like to thank major contributors such as [[http://www.reddit.com/user/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]], [[http://www.reddit.com/user/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]], and [[http://www.reddit.com/user/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] as well as our two wonderful moderators [[http://www.reddit.com/user/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]] and [[http://www.reddit.com/user/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]].

From a single work that attracted many of us [[/r/rational][r/rational]] has branched out to new works and recognize the world with greater clarity and (hopefully) fewer delusions as our various members set out to attain our various goals, big and small, in this new year.

Here's looking forward to another great year where a mixing of the absurd, impractical, and inevitable come together in the name of community entertainment, discussion, and munchkinry all around.
