** As expected the Mirror Knight's trial posed a lot more trouble than the Hunted Magician's, leaving everyone feeling a bit unsatisfied. I fear for the Red Axe's trial next chapter.

On another note, it's nice to see that Cat and Yannu are getting along, and are managing to pressure Cordelia into having at least /some/ measure of oversight on the whole "superweapon that might blow up the entire continent". I'm also liking Yannu a lot more now than when he was first introduced, he's grown on me a lot these past two chapters with both his dedication to his principles and his pragmatism when it comes to politics.

**** Yeah, in general this story has SO MANY different countries and cultures and provinces, and yet each feels very fleshed out and real, and I never really feel like it gets old learning about them.

** Hmmmmmmmm. I wonder why Cordelia's willing to talk weapons inspectors /now/, after the big show of turning Procer into a cornered animal Best Korea style.

If Cordelia's earlier inflexibility really was based on whisperings from the Augur, I wonder if this was always intended to improve diplomatic relations between Callow and Levant, or if some future consequence of Catherine and Yannu's newfound friendly working relationship might have been the Augur's goal.

** Next up: having been put totally on edge and her hackles being viciously up, Cordelia snaps at the Red Axe's trial?

*** I would expect so too.

Cordelia has been pushed hard, and I don't think she will want to give any more concessions.

**** Perhaps so, but Hanno told all his heroes that he would kill Red Axe. She wants Proceran Law to come out ahead of course, but would that really be enough to set her off?
