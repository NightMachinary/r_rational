** This was remarkably hard to read.

Not in a bad way, to be clear-- these chapters were well-written, and defined more than one new character remarkably quickly. But that first chapter just... hurt to read, really. I felt ashamed on Joon's behalf just going through it, to the point that I had to skim some parts just to keep going.

The mark of good writing is that it can make you feel something, I guess.

** Chapter 121 reminded me of some of Wildbow's interludes in how one emotional gut punch of a chapter can leave you with this really strong connection to someone who was previously an unremarkable background character. The whole chapter was great but I thought the conversation via Messenger, where we see Joon's shitty headspace lead him on a series of poor decisions, was especially well done. I think Joon (the post-earth version in particular) is often judged too harshly but if he had of hit enter on that message..

*** I think part of why both EE and WB are so effetive in this is the focus on really mundane (in the literal sense) emotional issues. If there's a chapter from the perspective of someone slaughtering a dozen people it oddly has less impact, because so few readers know, or are, mass murderers, but with something like this so much more focused on personal relationships, and the particular kinds of harm people can do through them, it resonates much more because of the familiarity. A lot more people can subconsciously see themselves in that position

It's flatly impossible to kill him, by any means, not even in theory.”

** I know I begged for an end to the Amaryllis-centric arcs and more of a focus on Joon since it felt like the story was kind of idling for a while there. But man, it is hard to read through chapter after chapter of super-accurate portrayal of a depressed teenager who made tons of shitty decisions and is now haunted by a game world that seems designed to put each one of them back in his face.

Other than the negative overall emotional angle lately, my one real complaint re: characterization is that I don't really feel like Joon's early story character matches the character he is now portrayed as having, before coming to Aerb. Time and again we get flashes of a guy who was withdrawn, selfish, suicidally depressed, kind of a user and a mastermind. His natural reaction to trauma was to be a big piece of shit to everyone. That doesn't /really/ jibe with my memories of the early chapters of this story, where he was a much more generic video game self-insert protag. I'm not saying the two can't be reconciled, or that I would have /enjoyed/ reading 100 chapters of Thomas Covenant, Jr. But I do feel like his emotional growth in this story started from a place that was much better than the one being described in the recent flashbacks. I don't know that the guy who'd sleep with an emotionally handicapped 15 year old, knowing it was wrong, is the kind of person who becomes the more mature, "Trying" Joon who we have seen recently. Especially not in the span of what... a year and a half? Of constant emotional trauma?

I really want a reason to root for Joon. I've spent most of my life struggling with depression, and god knows I've made stupid, stupid relationship mistakes. Originally I was on his side because his loyalty to his friend was kind of redeeming, and I appreciated the creativity and insight of his world building, and boy it'd be nice to think that we can grow beyond our past self. But then it turned out that his friend was kind of a misogynist shit heel and Joon had never noticed, and the relationship and subsequent shittyness to Tiff was revealed, and then the whole Fenn relationship fuck up happened, and more and more the game seems to be turning into "Eternal Fantasy Past-Sin Punishment Land" where every time he experiences a moment of growth we're introduced to some still uncoped-with awful thing that he'd done. It's retroactively making him very difficult to cheer for. I'm kind of expecting him to overcome this Raven/Maddie stuff only to learn in the next chapter that he committed securities fraud, or something.

*** In my mind, the (cheap) answer is stats. He's upping his mental and social a bit and those matter, in much the same way that upping his physical stats has changed his appearance and made him more capable in those spheres.

Also, the first fourteen chapters or so (book one, the "tutorial") he was literally falling from life-or-death crisis to life-or-death crisis. Depression is an affliction that saps time and energy for its dark purposes, so it's genuinely hard to just be depressed when you don't have either. Once he survives the early trials and things slow down enough to allow time for reflection (a few /dozen/ chapters later) he really does start asking questions and sounding more like the conflicted, immature young man he is.

*** I'm a fan of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]], not because I think it's explicitly accurate but because I believe there is a priority to what a person is. And my pet theory is that you can't really express yourself as the same person on each level.

- Self-Actualization (Last, Top) "I am what I can be and I am content with what I am"

- Self-Expression / Self-Reflection Loop "What I want to be vs. What I can be"

- Survival (First, Bottom) "I won't have the luxury of expressing myself if I'm a corpse!"

When we met Joon, he was being dropped from a plane into Zombie-land. That's the base of the pyramid, a person whose goal is survival. He wasn't selfless, he didn't save the woman who dropped near him. He wasn't virtuous, he killed his enemies. He wasn't evil, he cooperated and acted fairly towards people who were not openly hostile. At his core, Joon is not an objectively bad person.

Then, as Joon gains companions and makes a home for himself, we move up the pyramid and start to see Joon express his ideal self, at least up until the Masters incident. He was rational, logical, ruthless but not too ruthless, moral, and as good of a friend as he thought he could be. There was no self-reflection beyond Joon remarking on himself being shitty in his old world; he was a broken person and oblivious about it. Then when Fenn broke up with him, he found out that his ideal self doesn't mesh with the greater world, and his self-image cracks to better match who he actually is.

So we end up here, at chapter 118 ~ 121, with Joon reflecting on who he is. Turns out the foreshadowing was right, he was a pretty shitty person. But that doesn't mean that he can't be more. He has to reconcile that with himself, not ignore it.

So tl;dr I'm not rooting for Joon either, he's a shitty dude. I'm rooting for who he could be. A person can be something greater than they are. Or not. Because at the tippy-top of that pyramid is self-transcendence, but you have to reach for it.

Everything we've seen with Joon's character development in these past few chapters has been heavily foreshadowed since the first arc's end.

And since Joon's primary main objective in the first arc was survival, I'm ok with his character development and pace.

I expect more of these sorts of chapters when Joon inevitably meets other player-based characters (Reimer, Arthur, maybe another Tiff if we're doubling up.) Not that I /want/ it, just that I expect it.

Also, its interesting that Raven apparently didn't know who they were when she arrived, but was working in her own capacity for the Library. Could lead to awkward/interesting conversations when they tell her what happened with her father, and the fight with the others. Unless of course, that was another layer of ruse, or some sort of test of how much they knew and their abilities.

Also, Random thought that occurred to me when rereading the early parts of the book recently: Does Solace count as Amarylis's daughter for the purposes of the various inherited entads?

I wouldn't be surprised if Anglecyn already has a way to deal with this, otherwise someone would have thought to kidnap a royal bastard and keep them in stasis for a few centuries (entads with this effect were mentioned to exist, they are necessary for the creation of revision mages) in order to steal a sizeable chunk of Anglecyn's entads.

In a previous thread someone wondered whether Amaryllis is Dahlia who has been repeatedly wound back to a very young age. This seems plausible since it both explains why Anglecyn still has the primary claim to Uther's entads, Amaryllis looks like Dahlia and the Anglecyn princes still show a strong family resemblance after 500 years (They keep marrying Dahlia to 'refresh' their lines inheritance status to avoid losing magic to bastards)

** Oof. The first chapter was a bit of a gut punch thanks to personal experiences. I felt embarrassed for Joon by way of my constant, low-level background embarrassment for my past self.

The second chapter felt fairly short, but that could just be my insatiable desire for more of this story. It's starting to feel like our heroes won't actually go to the Library, just get the full picture secondhand from Raven. Which is unfortunate because magic libraries are my absolute favorite part of the fantasy genre and I was deeply excited for CRJ/AW's take on the trope.

** I think Firefly was the last time any piece of fiction had characters that genuinely felt like real people shaped by their prior experiences to me.

Weirdly, that means it's almost hard for me to connect the Joon of the current day with the flashback around Maddie since Joon today is the de facto moral center of the group and driven almost compulsively to try and support the other group members through their emotional difficulties. It also means it genuinely hurts to uncover this part of his backstory.

I think it's somewhat easier to swallow the idea that Joon was left terribly wounded and vulnerable after Arthur's death, and that he lashed out and pushed away everyone else who wasn't as strongly affected by it. When we find out that he turned to taking advantage of another, younger, perhaps more vulnerable person to try and buoy himself, and that he probably left her worse off for having been with him... that's just a gut punch.

Also, I'm super apprehensive about Fel Seed since my hype levels have built up to the point where we're looking at Lovecraftian levels of "the party is fucked", and yet somehow I get the feeling it's gonna be somehow /worse/ than that.

Maybe it's more that he instinctively feels offended or upset when the "NPCs" dare to act in a way he finds objectionable, and uses his leverage as a proto-God to force them to justify themselves to him, but he does also allow himself to be held accountable to them (though also to a lesser degree, now that I'm reflecting on it).

Actually, going through them one by one, Amaryllis basically just puts up with Joon on the premise that he'll be a useful proto-God shortly, Grak hovers between contempt and pity of Joon's immaturity, Solace has basically zero regard for Joon's viewpoint, and even Valencia only cares about Joon's opinion in a very utilitarian, "please don't hate me and abandon me" way. Bethal... well, Bethal is Bethal.

Fenn is the only one who tried to respond to Joon's viewpoint and only in the natural way people do in a relationship.

Maybe moral center wasn't the right word, as much as it is that Joon's moral compass seems most aligned with my own, so he's the only one I really give moral credence to, wheras when the others have an opinion on the morality of a situation, I reflexively mark that as "not-my-values" so it doesn't register as moral information.

It's definitely Arthur with the /City of a Thousand Brides/ thing. And the whole theme of lashing out even knowing that it's not rational.

Exciting! I wonder what the deal is with the throne of living flesh (brides? Bonesaw-esque?) and that Fel Seed is worse than the top 4000 hells (that's worse than almost half of hell).

It's flatly impossible to kill him, by any means, not even in theory.”

That said, the other point of this story is a new rational take on fantasy tabletop/rpg world building. In this case, it would make a lot of sense for Fel Seed to be the throne of flesh.

The weakness could be something with Arthur, especially considering that this is the game that happened right after he died, so there could be a lot of symbolism that's attached to him. I wouldn't be surprised if an Arthur got stuck in Fel Seed/the phenomena of Fel Seed in a similar way that Joon's players did during the original game, in a fit of dramatic irony.

The Fel Seed mentions in the story did reference a king of the place. There's a good possibility that it might actually be both: grey goo and Uther suborning each other, creating a new monstrosity pushing the worst bits of Arthur into the world. (Maybe a bit like Angra Mainyu in Fate.)

Speaking or writing the Cannibal's name summons him, but I bet Joon could write a set of descriptors that someone else from Earth could recognize without using the name itself. Send in a disposable minion (not necessarily a sapient one. Heck, an arrow with a letter tied to it would work) with instructions to speak the name the note calls to mind.

Arthur is either tired of being Fel Seed and speaks it willingly, doesn't know about the Cannibal and does so out of curiosity, or is sufficiently confused and does so out of that. Fel Seed dead + Cannibal trapped in a handy, suddenly-empty exclusion zone or Cannibal no longer a threat + Fel Seed remains status quo. Really a win-win scenario and the only reason no one's tried it before is that it relies entirely on Fel Seed having out of context knowledge they shouldn't have.

** I haven't commented in a while, and given how much I've grown to love this story, it's time to rectify this!

I've recently re-read most of the story and pitched it to some of my friends, it's really something else. I immediately loved both the grimdark setting and D&D flashbacks, as well as the incredible shifts in tone, setting and atmosphere. And of course, most of the characters so far have felt real and memorable and I've grown attached to some of them. Especially Fenn.. (Although interestingly I didn't like her and Juniper as a couple too much)

I'll be honest: I actually stopped reading the story for a while around the middle of the Fallahtehr arc. The rampant paranoia and second-guessing was making it a stressful reading experience. After a few months I got back to it and after getting through the essentialism arc, it didn't take long for me to fall back to being in love with the story. I am often appalled at the party's actions and full rationalist murder-hobo mindset, which makes it hard to root for them sometimes, but I guess that's part of the appeal of this setting. There are so many hints of more to come and I have a twisted sense of anticipation to find out about the worse exclusion zones and existential risks that Aerb is facing.

As for today's chapters, I appreciated them for cementing Joon's status as definitely not a gary stu isekai protag! He and Arthur are such interesting characters, although I must say that if I had to choose one to hang out with I'd definitely go for Arthur. Raven wasn't terribly interesting but perhaps that's the point, she has a pretty generic fantasy vibe to her.

Guess that's enough of my disconnected thoughts for now! Thank you so much for writing this and I can't wait for more!

*** Ugh. That was my kneejerk thought as well, but depending on Raven's meaning, the exclusion zone might have predated Uther's last known position. Otherwise, Uther's slow decline into depravity, alienation of lovers, and amicicide uncannily mirrors Joon's real-life deterioration of self and campaign - both culminating in Fel Seed.

I wonder what plot thread Uther saw that led him there. It would be unbelievably sad if he, near the end, became aware that he was living through Aerb's deterioration because Aerb was a parallel, synchronous embodiment of Joon's world and everything was a reflection of Joon suffering from Arthur's death.

**** Holy shit came here just to say this. Like if he noticed things that he knew Joon hadn't created durin the time he was alive, but he saw the telltale signs of Joon's touch but how dark and twisted it had become. Shit, I wonder if he thought that Juniper was the God of the world. I mean on Earth Juniper as the GM was this all powerful entity who moved things behind the scenes for Arthur to defeat and conquer. I wonder if he thought this was the same scenario.

  I'm telling you this because Aerb had features that were stolen from my D&D games, and all the stuff I was most scared of came from the post-Arthur era. Fel Seed, Nightsmoke, the borogoves, the mimsies
#+end_quote

not sure if we've heard of uther encountering any of these, other than the current reveal about fel seed. certainly possible, and also possible that the DM tossed things at uther in a semi-chronological order, which would make the transition pretty obvious as well.

If Fell Seed already existed then Arthur entering the exclusion zone would be the closest thing to suicide he could do in that world, throwing himself against the most dangerous threat possible to test if its possible for him to die in this world/lose the game.

** How does this kind of thing keeps sneaking up on me? Bethel was, from the start, the biggest loose cannon they had. Her introduction was a horror movie and that part on her history with Arthur was visceral as all hell. She has no morals, no loyalty, no duty and has enough power to transform the party into a smear in a second. But noooo. She is a companion so we good! right?

And I was so looking forward to Raven's reaction to Juniper story, so much potential for new info. The way she was reacting to Juniper's lines tells me she is a lot more unguarded with her emotions than her age would suggest.

On the other hand, damn. That first chapter was only second to the Tiff chapter for me on the raw emotion scale. It's interesting how everyone back then was mad at him for lashing out after Arthur died and just kept assuming that was just his way to deal with it. That he would get better once it was out of his system or something, like Craig said. Yet from the outside it's so clear to me just how close to the edge Juniper was.

Juniper could really use some therapy (of the non-Valencia kind).

**** Would she accept it though? She already has her own values and seems to like it that way.

From her perspective: She cares about being a great house and having people live in her and that's all she needs. Why would she accept brainwashing that makes her care about human lives, emotions, fornicating, and that kind of stuff? And would it really be her. She can fake some values when they are important to her guests (e.g. the funeral?) and that has served her just fine for hundreds of years.

** Googling "Fel Seed" produce some notable results:

Warcraft spell

Felwort Seed

Most interesting is "Fel Seeding":

FEL is free electron laser. FEL seeding is initiating FEL with normal laser in resonance process. Now, why it's relevant? It is [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php#challengexfel][speculated that Free Electron Laser could be most destructive weapon of the future space wars]]. It's tunable nature allow using diffraction focusing system produce continuous X-ray beam, with combat range measured in /light days/

PS Most nonsensical Fel Seed (WTC) weakness would be to build X-ray laser in Blue Fields exclusion zone (Nuke-pumped would be more easy then really powerful FEL) and shoot into Fel Seed (WTC) city /straight through earth curvature/.

*** The [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9h1454/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_121122_maddieraven/e69e3p2/][discussion above]] talks about this.

[[/u/Sparkwitch]] had a great justification with the crises and its postponement of his depression (though the stats theory is plausible too). Also, anhedonia was a large part of Joon's depression, mostly because he was stuck in the monotonous debris of his Kansas high school life. Something as dramatic as an isekai relocation into a world literally tailored for him "cures" that, at least in the short term.

I think Joon has always seemed well-adjusted when things were going well, but he's downright dreadful at adjusting when it counts (to trauma and grief). And since that first chapter, we've mostly known Joon the DM-as-player-now dealing with in-game conflicts rather than Joon-the-freshly-grieving coping post-trauma that has started to crop up more.
