I'm in the very early stages of world-building and general R&D for a rationalist fiction book dealing with time-travel adjacent mechanisms. A being that's consciousness exists across a stretch of time like the character in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31812698-fixer][Fixer]] or a version of [[https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Osterman][Dr. Manhattan]] from Watchmen who is moving forward in time with his consciousness covering three days simultaneously rather than a single instant.

Right now I'm collecting media that has explores a few concepts so I can pass the [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/originality][Yudcowsky Originality Standard]]. Can you suggest stories or movies that are iconic, excellent, or talk about:

- Time loops (Like [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]])
- Characters who can see the future
- Mechanisms of time travel

Also, do any of you have:

1. Examples of good (time travel/time loops/prescient characters) in movies or stories?
2. Aspects of (time travel/time loops/prescient characters) that you particularly love or particularly hate?
3. Resources for understanding how to present and manipulate time in a way that is at least adjacent to current science?
4. Any other miscellaneous input that would help me develop the concept?

** 1. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the movie "Next" focuses on someone who can see a short bit into the future, and is loosely based on the short story "The Golden Man". To me, those are iconic in terms of seeing into the future, along with Dr. Manhattan, who you've already mentioned.
2. One of the things that irks me about time loop stories is how much is just assumed to be possible with sufficient skill or attempts, without taking into account the human costs. Resets /aren't free/, they cost time and effort. While it's super cool to show someone using their knowledge of the future and ability to practice forever to completely nail some trick. The way I think about it is basically thinking about Olympic level athletes and how often /they/ can nail their hardest tricks or routines. There are always going to be risks and payoffs, and most people stuck in a time loop are going to be /much/ more conservative than most of these stories show. I also tend to think of it in terms of speedrunning, and how important tricks need consistent setups, and if there's risk involved, even top level speedrunners will sometimes "waste" a second or two making sure everything is going to actually work. A lot of the flashy stuff you see in time loop stories /kills the protagonist/ if done incorrectly, and worse, costs several hours, sometimes /days/ of setup. This gripe, if taken seriously, would lead to a deconstruction of the subgenre, but I'm not sure it should be taken seriously, because it knocks down a cool thing and has nothing neat to replace it with. People /like/ the flashy stuff, even if it often leaves me thinking "okay, how much time did it take to master that, and how much risk goes into attempting it every time". A lot of stories will treat it like there are checkpoints, even when there aren't supposed to be.
3. Nope, got nothing for you.
4. Beware of the ability to go recursive, i.e. to relay information back more than you want by using your ability to look to the future in the future you're looking at. Aside from that, probably best to think about what's easy to get for your protagonist and what's hard to get, at least in terms of information, the most valuable resource. Stories rely on tension and conflict, so some things probably become trivially easy, and others probably not so much. People /like/ seeing the trivially easy stuff, as spectacle, but usually only in small doses. Think about the flashiest stuff the power allows, and be sure to sprinkle it in at appropriate moments, mostly for fun.

#+end_quote

There is no cost beside memory space and possible memory degradation/trauma. Mechanics of new memory merging into t_0 brain usually not shown explicitly, but it's often implied that brain is not damaged in any way. Loop is usually supported by some magic/soul or other supenatural means, so memory extension or trauma healing is not out of order. Effectively zero cost is implied, especially in comparison to the cost/energy of the loop itself.

It doesn't have to be perfect, just enough to work /most/ of times. Because of loop.

Strongly disagree. Courage/recklessness /is/ trainable. There is a lot of people taking insane risks without loops. With loop long enough any person will be like that.

**** One of the primary things that /most/ long-term loopers have to deal with in stories about loopers is tedium. Loops aren't "free", they take the looper's time. The looper has to physically go through the motions of completing a set series of actions that are in no way novel to them.

The problem for me comes from the typical way that time loop stories are told, where someone is shown sucking at something, then sucking at it a bit less, then being competent, then GOD MOD ACTIVACTED. My problem is largely with that last bit, simply because of the tedium involved. If the loops are infinite, and the implication is that the looper has done this so many times that they've begun incorporating flashy tricks into their loop, then sure, maybe I can accept it.

That's usually not the only place it shows up though. GOD MODE ACTIVATED shows up when the protagonist is trying other things, or attempting to accomplish specific goals. Protagonists will walk through a building lazily aiming their gun to get blind headshots, or do a car chase where they miss other cars by millimeters, or ... whatever else. Writers can get caught up in the coolness of GOD MODE without thinking about the psychology of the character and the unpleasantness of dealing with a tedious round of setup. Or there will be a character that has memorized the make and model of every car in the city, along with their license plate, which sure, you could eventually do if you had infinite time, but you would have to make that a priority over other, more pleasurable stuff, and so unless it's explained within the text, it's hard for me to understand how/why this was done by the protagonist instead of the other things they could have been doing. Writers just shortcut to GOD MODE, because it's entertaining, without considering what a psychologically realistic person would actually do.

Sure, /eventually/ you might get to the point where it's all the same to you, and you've trained yourself not to mind tedium, but if you're going to get to that point, why do the 'flashy' stuff at all? Why pursue looking cool or scoring lots of points in an imaginary system the looper's made for himself? If the looper can change his mind sufficiently that there's no tedium in setup, what do they get out of 'achievements'?

***** I really like this. thank you.

If you could go back to your past body, what would you do? And then you ask yourself why you don't do some of those things now in your current body. I.E. 'I would ignore school get an underwater welding certificate and just spend a few weeks reading all the books in my backlog that I say I'll get to tomorrow'. So, why not quit your job now, get the certificate and stop adding stories and books to the backlog.

Even for loopers hyperbolic discounting means they would want to eat good food and mess around more than they would want to do something that is (subjectively) a few months or even a few hours away.

***** IMO, time is meaningless if I loop (without set max loop limit).

I'm not aging, I'm not losing opportunity cost to do something else.

It does depend on what I'm looping for. If it's something that enables me, (ie, I achieve it, options open), then it is certainly worth to do so.

Just looking flashy for flashy sake? Then yes. there is no point.

I totally can imagine that "flowing" though the predetermend sequence of perfect combat actions could be fun, akin to performing kata.

** /Primer/ is an amazing indi movie and one of my favorite time travel stories with a pretty complex timeline.

Greg Egan has written some good stuff, the entire /Orthogonal/ trilogy features a very fascinating take on time travel. Basically the laws of physics in this world are different from ours so that time is another direction of space with nothing special signifying it apart from the fact that particles locally have the largest component of their movement in that direction. So there is no constant speed of light and you can travel at infinite speed /and even faster than that/ using nothing but an ordinary rocket. The second book, /Arrows of Time/ is the most about the implications on causality. Quite a lot of fascinating ideas here.

** Fall of Doc Future meets your criteria but probably is not applicable to your project, since the time travel method (which only sends /information/ backwards in time, in most cases) is of a "erases all direct signs of its existence" type.

** /By His Bootstraps/ features an interesting take on time travel - it starts out with an ordinary 1940s guy, busy writing a thesis on the impossibility of time travel, when he's interrupted by a time traveller turning up from the future. The time traveller is his own future self; he is recruited to complete "one simple task" by someone living in the far future, known only by title as Diktor. It turns out that the "one simple task" is to go back and recruit his own past self. Feeling like he's been played by Diktor, he uses the time machine (which Diktor admits was made by aliens, who had visited Earth and since left) to go back in time about a decade, looking to prevent Diktor's arrival and take his place. And then, eventually, he realises that Diktor was /also/ him; his decade-older self... that is to say, he hauled himself into the future by his bootstraps.

** There's some time loop story that's been posted here before that I can't remember the name of. It's all in a Google Doc, the names of countries are all like Empire, Republic and State, very literal. The protagonists name was Dave. Hopefully someone else remembers the name.

The plot is after a certain point, whenever he dies he's able to completely control the flow of time from an out of body perspective between the beginning and his death, allowing him to reinsert himself into his body at any point. This creates a flexible time loop where he can retry a specific scenario many times and make iterative improvements. The world is always blown up at the end of roughly 24 hours, killing him instantly. This is what he tries to stop and investigate.

** Primer is really confusing, but has entirely consistent time travel rules and intelligent characters. If you don't mind having to watch it more than once and either take notes or read someone else's it's an interesting watch.

One aspect of Dr. Manhattan I don't like is that the way he behaves doesn't fit the way he claims he thinks. He changes his mind at one point, but how can you change your mind if time doesn't apply to you? He also talks about that he can see through the illusion of free will, which is fine if it's just an existential crisis, but people act like that is an explanation for why he does what he does. But regardless of if people can see through it, it's just as much an illusion for everyone else, and he should be able to make decisions to the same extent they do. He certainly is capable of explaining concepts to people, and that's not fundamentally different from saving lives.

** Talking about time loops, this is currently my favorite:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/im-sorry-can-you-repeat-that-worm-quest-oc.554997/][I'm sorry, can you repeat that?]]

It's worm fanfic about a guy with a timeloop power. He can't go actually insane, but has gotten very, /very/ bored. It's played as a quest, where "do weeklong setup to repeat last time's scenario" and "sit there and wait to see what happens when you do nothing" are expensive actions that cost the players, paying sanity/restlessness which later has to be paid down with silly blowoff only-because-I'm-gonna-loop-it shenanigans.

--------------

These two are iconic and excellent time travel sci fi:

[[https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate][Stein's; Gate]]

It's the gold standard of time travel anime and worth a reccomendation in it's own right. You can't write this type of time travel story without having a complete plan, from the start, as to what will happen when. It's the kind of story where precisely what happens during the first episode is extremely relevant later on. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that the tone changes at a certain point and that I only reccomend the complete series. Also, it's ranked #3 on MAL with a combined score over 9/10, because it is just that good. Adapted from a VN which is also pretty good.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Palimpsest-Charles-Stross/dp/1596064218][Palimpsest]] (Charles Stross's one, it's not a unique title.)

Easily the best time travel story I've ever read. Explores what it means, emotionally/interpersonally, for your past to change. Has well-extrapolated worldbuilding and a great model of time travel, seasoned with really cool details of a paratime organization's procedures -- like the initiation where you have to kill your own grandfather. Won a Hugo for Best Novella and totally deserves it.

** 1) Examples of good (time travel/time loops/prescient characters) in movies or stories?

Time Travel like it is done in DC Legends of Tomorrow and The Flash is a prime example of how NOT to do time travel. There's no consistency, there's no way it works like that. If you kill the Greatgreatgreatfather of someone, they never existed, not disappear in a lightshow screaming. Everything they've done is moot. Just saying.

On RoyalRoad there's this new novel about someone that can basically reset time, mostly like Mother of Learning, but there's no one month time limit and he's the one actually time looping out of his own volition. It's called The Perfect Run and it's hilarious. Don't know how much can it help you, but it might give you best insights into what you want to write maybe?

2) Aspects of (time travel/time loops/prescient characters) that you particularly love or particularly hate?

Good aspects of time travel? Consistent time traveling, like in HP (canon), where everything that will happen in the time traveling situation, has already happened. Hard to pull it off, I think. You need to know everything that will happen in advance, basically writing the whole story all at the same time, and not "making things as I go". Which is admittedly a good way to write anyway!

Precognition characters are kind of easy if it's one ONE. With TWO or MORE, it gets complicated. It's like Edward vs Alice in Twilight playing chess. It's one or two moves, and both know who's won the game. Everything will play in their minds, and writing about a character thinking that his enemy knows what he's thinking of doing and he'd do that because his enemy would have done something else is difficult to make interesting. Not impossible, but difficult. It's usually good at the END of the story, because then you can make a character say "I knew you would do that based on the idea I'd do this! So I did this and that instead, I won!" Like in the last chapters of Death Note. A whole story about two precogs though? Tough!

Time looping is the easiest to do. The whole universe gets basically reset, so there's no unconsistencies to speak of. It's basically one character (or more, in some cases) getting future knowledge. It's almost indistinguishable from precognition. Only, with precognition, some of the dangers of time looping are avoided (such as soul and mind magic in Mother of Learning, or ability canceling and brain hijacking in The Perfect Run). In return for those dangers, you get a greater degree of control over what you want to know, simulate what would happen if you did some things (try out all the "what if" scenarios). Plus you have actual time to process this information, as opposed to having visions of the future. Even if you did have a revelation in an instant about what would happen if and if and if, it'd take time to process all of it. Plus you get some major boosts in learning things. Actually studying and practicing things is way better than having a vision. Probably. Also. Time looping and precognitions would work on the same basis, sending back NOT matter, but information. So if one is possible, the other will also be. Precognition guy vs Time Looper guy is actually viable as consistent, and a cool idea now that I think about it :D

​

3) Resources for understanding how to present and manipulate time in a way that is at least adjacent to current science?

Science (current) stand of Time Travel: It's Impossible. You need negative energy in a system to move it through time. That's not saying that once you get this negative energy, time travel is possible. It's like saying "this stick is -3 cm long" or "this thing is -3 kelvin" or "this thing is traveling twice the speed of light" or "this has negative mass". It just cannot be done. Nothing in the universe, as far as we know, can do any of the above. It's possible to make something go Apparently faster than light, but not in reality.

That said, time is bound with space. They're actually the same thing, Spacetime. If there's a magic or tech that can heavily influence one, it can influence the other. They're not two separate concepts in reality, only in our minds. Think about gravity as the effect mass has on spacetime, it "sinks" on itself (this is a lie actually, but it helps visualise gravity better than whatever I could say). So, the more it sinks,the slower time is around the area.

​

Now some bullshit science. Nothing I say is completely true or even partially maybe

​

Time stops effectively inside black holes, probably. No one knows, because current knowledge of physics gives strange and contraddictory results if you apply them in a black hole. If you'd go even more "down" than a black hole, could you rewind time?

​

Traveling fast enough increases mass (actual mass, because matter and energy are the same, speed is energy, thus speed is matter). This is an oversemplification, but not far from the truth. If you can travel faster than the speed of light. you'd likewise travel back in time, like in the black hole, maybe.

​

If you do the inverse of what gravity does, so go "up" in the spacetime fabric, time inside the area should be /faster/ than the outside (so the inverse of a black hole). Hyperbolic Time Chamber from dragon ball! Or, to stay in rational fiction, Black Rooms of Mother of Learning. It checks out, because the more the room is separated from reality, the easier it is to "elevate" the place in spacetime. Hope I made it somewhat clear, but I don't think so :P English is not my language :D

​

There's a theory that, if time travel was possible, the universe itself would be in a quantum state, between the "first" time everything happened, and the "second". Both universes are real, but only the second continues, or maybe both do. So if I go back in time to remove a pebble on the street avoiding my past self from having an accident, it happens like this:

Universe one

1) I have an accident

2) I travel back in time to remove the pebble that causes it (what a brazen use of time travel!!)

3) Universe ends (maybe).

Universe two

-1) Future me arrives

0) Future me removes pebble, disappears because there's no reason for him to have gone back in time anymore, or maybe continues to go on in this universe, or maybe he goes to his alternate reality where things did happen. Who knows

1) I have no accident

2) I don't meet the nice nurse in Hospital with whom I'd have had a good life and many children, pity.

3) I don't go back in time, and the universe continues like normal

End of story.

Basically things would pop in and out of existence at seemingly random occasions, doing strange things, like removing pebbles, throwing buckets of water at seemingly random spots, and the like. Not the universe we live in, and not the universe I'd like to live in either! But hey, it's just a theory. A Timetravel theory!

Btw, this theory solves the grandfather paradox nicely. Kill your grandfather, and you have a looping universe that goes between the two states (grandfather killed/not killed, you being born/not born, you traveling back in time/not traveling back in time). A quantum state of the universe!

​

4) Any other miscellaneous input that would help me develop the concept?

no, sorry!

*** On precognition: I saw a star wars alternate-universe fic once that had an interesting take on portraying it. Jedi have precognitive powers; they do this by simulating many alternate futures at once, and the speed and number of simulation they can run at once scales with power. A low-to-medium level force user (the main character) can fit in ~10 up-to-a-minute before becoming exhausted.

The story also features hacked medikits making party drugs, the formation of the jedi heralding the obsolescence of science, VR hyper-porn, a bunch of stuff.

****** Didn't read that book, but the precog /would/ see them appearing in front of herself /before/ they get in front of her. Otherwise, not much of a precog, aren't we?

Talking about time rewinding/looping vs precog in this scenario. The precog would see the time looping before the time looper gets near the precog.

And the time travelling guy /would/ find the precog /ready/ for them. On the other hand, the precog needs something better than simply killing time looping characters if they rewind time the moment they die. If it's not the moment they die, but a conscious effort on time looping to activate it, then it's not that much of a problem. But then a time looper could simply try many different things from a distance and find if something works. Snipers, bombs, whatever magic that world allows... And the precog would see it coming and avoid it. That's the appeal of a time looping vs precog. One of the two needs to make a silly mistake, or one of the two needs to find a weakness in the other's way of "seeing the future" and tamper it/circumvent they're knowledge.

******* Webcomic, not book.

The thing is, the time traveller went back to that point because, in the /time traveller's history/, he had never appeared at that point in time. Time travel in the Magellan universe follows a "it splits the timeline" model - so the future that the precog saw was the future /without/ the time traveler's involvement. (And a different character began to suspect time travel after a different precog's visions started becoming inaccurate due to the time traveller's actions). Had the time traveller arrived anywhere else and then journeyed to meet the precog, however, then the precog would have see it because the precog would be seeing the future of that /particular/ post-split timeline.

** The movie and novella <!"Paycheck"!> involves time travel (or I guess seeing the future). The spoiler is because the fact it's time travel is itself a spoiler, because the main character can't remember what happened. Worth looking at, although it doesn't involve time travel as much as, say. Next / The Golden Man.

Pathfinder by Orson Scott Card (and especially its sequels) involves some pretty wacky time travel hijinks, and iirc uses 2 or 3 different time travel models depending on which method they employ to travel.

travel. Saying that any of these are the greatest time travel stories (though i enjoyed them), but they are more research material at least. As long as you have a consistent time travel model and your plot isn't just "time travel is cool", I'll probably like it.
