I just recently watched the 2015 film Circle on Netflix (not to be confused with the older Circle, the upcoming "The Circle" or the ton of movies going by the same name). It shows 50 people in two concentric circles, with one being randomly killed every two minutes UNLESS they come to a majority vote as to who should die next. Suicide of prisoners gives the remaining people again two more minutes to think. They appear to be an average sample of the population. There is no apparent escape route. The plot shows the prisoners' selection strategies to stay alive as long as possible, to uphold their values or to deceive the others. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_%282015_film%29]] I feel we could have done slightly better writing this, yet the script is pretty cool as it is. What would you improve on, if you already saw it? What would be your first instinct as to the algorithms people would use in such a situation if you haven't seen it yet? What would be good survival strategies, operating under the assumption that the last one to live gets out? Did anything in the script strike you as too much fiat and too little "logical consequence"?

EDIT: All the rules I still have in my mind:

- 50 light spots in total, in two concentric circles in a dark room, are each assigned somebody. In the middle of the room is a glowing machine.
- Almost nobody remembers how they end up there. Some remember the last moments of their lives before it, like "something in the sky" or whatever.
- The group is probably an average sample of one city's population.
- Every two minutes, random shot kills one living person. Before a shot, there is a countdown sound for the last seconds.
- You leave your position, you get shot immediately. Timer does not reset.
- You touch somebody else, you get shot immediately. Timer does not reset.
- Voting for a person (by pointing at them, intent to preserve that life necessary, pointing can be very discrete) with a majority kills the person, two minute timer resets.
- People can decide not to vote. In a scenario where only two people remaind and you don't vote while one person votes for you, you die.
- You can not vote for yourself or for a dead person. Such votes count as "no vote".
- In a tie, both die unless one volunteers to die.
- Suicide or volunteering to die happens by leaving your position, not by voting for yourself.

I think that's it.


** I really liked this movie, for what it was. It's very much a game theory, character-driven drama, taking place entirely within one room with very little that gets in the way of its simple premise and the somewhat complicated plot that follows from it.

I mostly found the logic to be sound, though there were a few times I was thinking to myself, "Your fate is in their hands, be more sympathetic, people will kill a loudmouth". But I didn't find that to be unrealistic, especially since these people were put into a high-stress situation with no warning.

I also liked the ending, which I think sold the movie for me.

[[#s][Dipping into spoiler territory ...]]

I didn't have any real issues with the script. It spends a good chunk of time with people trying to subvert the mechanism through various means, which was enjoyable. And the fact that all negotiation and game-playing has to take place out in the open was neat as well.

As for your spoiler: Complete agreement from my side. Very Quirrell-ly.

In total, it felt like a very cool actual prisoner's dilemma situation and some dark arts rationality.

*** [[#s][Actually,]]

Edit: I also wonder what type of player ultimately has the best odds of winning going into the scenario. For example, how much playing games that use related skills (I'm thinking specifically tabletop games like [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance][the Resistance]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Werewolf][Werewolf]]) would improve your likelihood of winning, opposed to someone who's studies game theory and is able to adapt their theoretical strategies. Children, who have an innate advantage of being essentially taboo? [[#s][]] Or sociopaths, with experience manipulating social situations and motivated from the beginning.

**** I think there's definitely some ambiguity in regards to motivations. I've been meaning to give the movie another watch to see whether there were tells or foreshadowing.

I think Resistance, Werewolf, Mafia, etc. are all substantially different in that there are hidden roles and actual sides with variable win conditions. This is different, in that all roles are known (because they're the same) and players still have to win, which they can only do with cooperation from the other players. Playing those games might make you better at bluffing, but it's a different sort of game because so much is out in the open.

***** A key skill that might be somewhat translatable from the games is reading the mood of a group of people quickly and convincing them of the merits of following you specifically. But when people aren't playing a game with set win conditions but trying to survive in a stressful situation, they're more chaotic and difficult to predict.

****** There's also an annoying degree of luck to it as well. Based on your average sample, it's unlikely that the winners would be:

- Minorities
- Criminals (or people that looked like criminals)
- Over 40
- Hot headed

Those are just a few of the things I can think of. And hot headed is debatable, as that's something a person can control.

** Haven't seen it. I assume I get stuck in there with no warning, so I won't spend any time thinking about it.

Hmmh. Well, in the very beginning I'd personally probably stay quiet unless for some reason the vote started to turn my way. If that happened, I'd try and turn it around on whoever's pushing the vote (the 'you're next' argument). If it comes to random deaths, which it probably would in the beginning, I'm unlikeliest to die early and gathering attention to myself without knowing roughly what sort of personalities the other people have and how they're going about things is liable to end up in getting me killed.

Two minutes is extremely short. I would first see if we had anyone willing to volunteer to die, in order to maximize the amount of time we have to think. No 'apparent' escape route wouldn't stop me doing my very best to try and find one, and get others to do the same. If and when we have no-one to kill who is willing to take the hit, I would attempt to steer the vote first against anyone who's managed to annoy a majority of the people still alive (specifically violent, threatening violence or dumb enough to say things that other people find distasteful). Once we run out of those, I'd look into figuring out a criterion for choosing the next victim as efficiently as possible. It has to fulfill two primary goals: First, it has to be something that leaves me near the very last people to die (but not last, that'd be too obvious) and second, it has to be acceptable to the majority of the people still alive by my judgment.

If we can't find a way out, we're running out of people and I'm nearing my own turn to be killed according to the criterion, I'd spend time talking to people ahead of me in the line and directly after, choosing based on whom I believe after the time spent observing them thus far to be susceptible, and try to create a voting bloc for us to survive to the end. Then I'd try for a Survivor-style elimination hoping to manipulate people to vote off each other gathering smaller and smaller voting blocs, hoping that when there's just two people left we'd be let out. If there's two people left and the 'game' doesn't end, I make a judgment call on the nature of the other person with me. If possible, I convince them to vote for themselves. If that seems impossible to me, I try to convince them to flip a coin now to see which one we'd vote off. If the coin lands on me, I won't vote for myself.

That's all I can think of to survive as long as I can on short notice.

** - I wake up in this weird environment with either no recollection of what happened prior to that point or with no memories of noticing anything wrong up to the point of losing consciousness;

- There are some unknown technologies in use that are capable of:

  - instantly killing people without any visible projectiles being hurled at them and without any lag (i.e. a person gets killed right when they're about to touch someone else);
  - moving objects (bodies) without touching them;
  - messing with my head without me even noticing it happening --- let alone being able to defend myself against it (implementing a brain-computer interface and augmenting my perception of reality).

- the experimenters are likely to be malevolent (or at least apathetic) towards the subjects;

- Among my top priorities in life are a) getting more positive experiences out of it than negative ones and b) preventing unnecessary suffering.

So I think the best option in this zugzwang would be simply dying. If I were able to think about the whole thing calmly and my self-preservation instinct didn't get in the way, I'd just step out of the circle. If I didn't get randomly killed at the very beginning, maybe I'd try to convey the same idea to others first, but I think the end choice would be the same.

Another interesting thing to note is that when we encounter such situations in fiction (literature, television), our [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][genre savviness]] will more likely help us [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple][make accurate predictions]] than serve as a source of bias. But if something like this were to happen IRL, I think expecting the sole survivor to either get some awesome boon for their troubles or at least to get freedom would be like expecting for a laboratory mouse to get released into its natural habitat after one single testing on it is accomplished by the med interns.

This premise is like that one story in which a bunch of people find themselves in an underground (?) hypermarket with all exists cemented shut.

** /spoilers/ I loved the movie for what it was. But it seemed like it would have been important to check more memories in order to establish that aliens did it. Or that maybe a human did it. Or the various reasons a human, or alien, might have done it. Or why everyone woke up at the same time except two random people. And use more time to figure all that out. Because whatever the end result of the experiment is, it depends on whoever designed it.

If anything, it taught me that we apply our own struggles and worldviews to everything too quickly, without taking the actual facts into account sometimes.

I thought everything else was remarkably well made, rationalfiction-wise.

** Hmm, last one gets to live, eh? This means if you make it to the last 2, you get a 50% chance to live when votes deadlock. Well, I guess more importantly you want to try to break the game before it gets to you. Hope someone next to you dies (or push for it), and see how it happens. Were the poisoned? Shot? What happens to the body? Maybe they can't tell easily who's dead. Maybe they can't easily tell who is voting whom. Is there a vulnerability to the circle or room? A means to escape?

Ultimately, within the bounds of the game, only one person escapes. But if you can break the rules somehow, maybe more can live. Do what you can to reject the cruel framework imposed on you and your fellows! Resist!

**** Ah. Well... I guess I'd probably die right at the start. The most moral response would be trying to break the system, even if it meant my death, especially since the system will kill me anyways. Dying sooner sucks, but the real sucky thing is the whole world where this could happen.

The only legitimate response to this kind of oppressive terrorism must be revolution, even if it means violence, even if it means your own pointless death. Your goal in this kind of scenario is to destroy the system. Battle Royale conveyed this pretty well, I think. Maybe this is entirely motivated by spite, pride, and anger, but sometimes those can be forces for good.

You might even say it's categorically imperative to try to break out of any sort of death game and bring ruin upon the people running the game, in a sort of "The United States does not negotiate with terrorists, so don't bother taking hostages" kind of way.
