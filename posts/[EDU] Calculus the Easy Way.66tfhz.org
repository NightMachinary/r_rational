There is a series of 3 books, /Algebra the Easy Way/, /Trigonometry the Easy Way/, and /Calculus the Easy Way/, that try to teach math in the guise of a story, with a gremlin effectively forcing the characters to invent those fields of math.

I don't know if they would be considered rational, but I feel like they belong in the same genre to /Conned Again, Watson/ (or a similar one)


** This reminds me of Greg Egan's Incandescence, where the alien main characters discover general relativity before their equivalent of the industrial revolution, and his Arrows of Time series, about another alien race trying to survive in a world in which time behaves differently than it does in our universe.

** That's pretty cool. Is there something like those but for higher forms of math? ex: third-dimensional calc

*** I don't know, except avoid other "the Easy Way" books by this publisher, which do NOT take this approach, as I found with Chemistry the Easy Way,

*** There is "The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra"

it's not so much about motivating things as trying to frame everything with simple mangu and animo though

**** That reminds me of /The Cartoon Guide to Statistics/, although that doesn't have all that much plot if I remember correctly, which is now my bad excuse as to why I didn't think of it when [[/u/Calsem]] asked.
