** Mostly great as usual but, as my honest opinion/first impression, I'm not sure Martha's exposition on her husband's experiences sits well. Maybe there's too many different things happening in this one chapter that it feels crammed in.

******* Glad you enjoy it - it's definitely a bit more work, because I write something like "Lois drove" and then spend ten minutes looking up what the laws for women drivers were in the 1930s (prohibiting women from driving was talked about, but never implemented - the biggest impediment was that for a long time cars were started with a manual crank that took a lot of physical exertion, but by the 30s the switch to electric start had mostly been made). But I've always liked the interwar period - it's my second favorite time period, with the other being the early 1700s.

******** Early 1700s! Really? I guess I'm surprised to hear that! A quick survey of what I learned about history in school reveals a particular deficit in those two exact areas -- my US History class skipped right from WWI to WWII (maybe because the professor dallied so much in the Reconstruction era), and ... Where in the world were the interesting events of the early eighteenth century?

********* In the first two decades of the 1700s, you have:

- The calculus controversy between Newton and Leibniz
- The War of Spanish Succession involving many of the major powers in Western Europe
- A Golden Age of Piracy (one of a few - this one was somewhat attributable to the end of the previously mentioned War of Spanish Succession which left thousands of trained sailors without jobs)
- Rise of modern banking in London
- First commercial steam engine (by Thomas Newcomen)

For a couple of years I ran a D&D campaign that was set in 1713 (with magic and dragons, naturally), and every week we'd go on some new adventure in a world as historically accurate as I could make it, but with all sorts of wacky D&D stuff added in. There's a wonderful series by Neal Stephenson (of Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon fame) called "The Baroque Cycle" that will teach you everything you want to know and more about that time period. I think part of the reason that I like it so much is that it's so often ignored.

Edit: Oh, and it's also part of the Edo period of Japan and a time of colonialism in basically everywhere that's not Europe. And Peter the Great! And a bunch of other stuff!

*********** I really liked it, but wouldn't recommend it if you don't like Stephenson. It spans from about 1660 to 1715, and includes loads and loads of historical research. In addition to all of the above, it covers:

- The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_fire_of_london][Great Fire of London]] in 1666
- The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna][Battle of Vienna]]
- The various political happenings of England (including several successions)
- The life and times of Isaac Newton (a primary character, though he never has a viewpoint scene)
- A search for the origins of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel][Damascus steel]]
- Cryptography and spycraft
- Metallurgy
- The creation of phosphorus
- Slavery and emancipation

And much more. If you can handle books that sometimes have multi-page digressions on arcane subjects (which I would guess is probable given the subreddit), then I'd say to give it a go.

I believe you can find the flaw in this plan with minimal thought, without needing a virtuous person, merely a rational one. Hint, it involves me not giving up and you offering increasingly more money.

** Corrections thread:

- You missed the line-breaks between the first two scene changes (Jimmy-Lois, Lois-Luthor).

- Also "not matter the circumstances" should be "*no* matter the circumstances" I think.

- And in your author's notes "Whether this was [x] or [y] is left as an exercise to the reader" should probably be "*Working out* whether this was..." :P

**** One other minor nitpick is that a lot of the scene transitions are similar. It often starts out like this "X character did this." In a way this is good since it makes it clear who the perspective is from right off the bat, but if it's done too often in one chapter it gets noticeable. Otherwise another great chapter. I especially liked Luthor's reasoning on Superman's range of vision and the conversation between Lois and Luthor. You did a good job of showing the two simultaneous layers of conversation.

** All caught up. I love it so far!

Despite Lex's concerns, based on Superman's dialogue and my general understanding of the character, I think he's more likely to give up and leave the planet than become violent or take over the world. Story-logic would suggest otherwise, of course.

** One minor style nitpick: you change point if view characters in the middle of scenes. You show "I" thoughts which indicates a firm third person, but then jump to other character's thoughts and feelings (not the viewpoint's guess/estimation of them) on occasion.

As someone who took creative writing extensively in college, it jumps out at me.

*** I've tried my best to keep a firm third person, jumping between characters only on a horizontal line. In this chapter it's meant to be:

- Jimmy Olsen
- Lois Lane
- Lex Luthor
- Lois Lane
- Lex Luthor
- Joseph Greene
- Hershel Whitman
- Lex Luthor
- Floyd Lawton

There are two violations of viewpoint that happen in this chapter - one when Lex is figuring out whether Superman can see Smallville, and another when Joseph "not his real name" Greene and his wife are introduced. I might go back and change those, but if there are any others, let me know and I'll correct them, since the current violations I at least knew about.
