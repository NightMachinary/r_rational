** The biggest problem of xianxia tropes is that high level cultivators don't need low level cultivators. Any kind of taxes or tributes from low to high don't make sense. That make existence of sects and clans kind of pointless. If it's a pure reproduction instinct for high levels existence of that instinct should be a common knowledge. If it's some kind of divine/karmic law that require high levels to support low levels it also should be a common knowledge.

*** I think that Forty Millenniums of Cultivation makes a decent attempt at addressing this - high level cultivators need resources to maintain their cultivation AND to try to hit even higher levels of cultivation. So this explains their need to set up sects (and companies) to make money to fund their cultivation pursuits. Of course, you *could* seek out such materials yourself, but it would probably be less efficient?

It's the "industrialization" concept - efficiency/progress is created by a large group of the working class

Superman can do a lot, but no amount of flying really fast or lifting heavy things can feasibly produce a million pounds of beef. An industrialized society can do it easily. Replace "beef" with whatever a high-level cultivator might need a lot of to fuel their further advancement, with "refinement" steps in the middle as needed.

At each stage resources needed to maintain higher levels of cultivation become increasingly scarce, but there are generally hundreds of lower level cultivators trying to advance.

Taxes are possibly not necessary, but there to remove resources from the system and diverting them to a friendly power structure, to further winnow competition and ensure those that do thrive have a compatible perspective.

Any society willing to constantly invest in new cultivators is going to on average produce more and better cultivators, and if they do it well those cultivators will be loyal to that society.

Anyway, seeing how most of us don't speak Chinese and don't currently have plans to learn it, isn't it fair that when discussing this genre with the goal of writing derivative work that is more to our taste we discuss the material available to us and ignore the stuff that we can't read or even participate in discussions about?

Do you really get annoyed if a Chinese person says the superhero genre is dumb and trashy? Obviously they are talking about what they have available to consume.

Seems pointless to say to them, oh well, the niche stuff is actually good so you're totally wrong. If a new superhero thing is translated it's gonna be exactly the same, so unless they're going to learn English it seems a meaningless difference

What's the point?

Besides which, you might as well say this in every thread in existence, the quantity of Chinese discussion I will surpass every English forum and will only continue to increase. I can't find simultaneous data but WeChat had 50 billion messages in day in jan 2019 and whatsapp now has 100 billion per day (obviously not all in English)

A reminder that there is more content than they can access has helped how? How is telling the Chinese that of course there is Worm that they can't read anyway going to help them? Don't discuss the superhero genre Chinese friends because it's already been done on reddit!

***** Sure, but what meaningful action can be taken from what you're saying?

When I go into Chinese forums I remind them of how everything they've said has been said already in English forums what should they do? Shut up?

Humility is all very well and good, so is awareness of other cultures. Reminding people that we only get a small subset of content is not a sin in and of itself, but at the end of the day, what else are people meant to talk about? If you want people to preface every message with "in the media available in my language..." then it seems unnecessary. It's obvious that this criticism isn't directed at Chinese authors but at people who will be able to understand it and write Xianxia in English

"Oh well even though everything in English is like this I'm not going to criticise the genre in anyway because it's probably fine in Chinese"

It seems a much more lazy take to not bother criticising or analysing anything because someone has probably done it even if you can't find it never mind understand it which seems to be what you're suggesting

I'd probably go further and say that people can even repeat discussions that've already been said in English too. Sure at Christmas dinner you can pause your abortion argument to google it and say oh look 10000 people already had this argument on a forum, let's silently read that instead but I don't think anyone is claiming originality there

People can learn more by googling more and being more aware but in this instance? (After all you didn't even link an example of a discussion)

** It's already been mentioned in this subreddit a silly number of times, but Will Wight's /Cradle/ series hits so many of these points that I feel it would be irresponsible for me to /not/ mention it.

1) The planet it takes place on is huge, with a wider multiverse outside it.

2) It's a science-fantasy setting, with madra taking the place of electricity and soulsmiths replacing engineers.

3) Putting aside the idea that enormous personal power has dangerous effects on the human mind, there are a number of Paths (especially the stronger ones) which directly influence the mind of the user in negative ways. These Paths are highly restricted. (Blackflame, Hunger Paths)

4) For the most part, it's pointless to fight someone more than two levels above you, so wars are mostly heavy posturing and minor skirmishes until the highest level combatants on each side kill each other, at which point the side which still has high-tier cultivators wins by default.

5) The economy of Cradle is mostly based on coinlike physical manifestations of personal power (Scales), which means that high-tier cultivators are automatically rich. We haven't delved deep enough into the economy yet to see how rational this system actually is, imo.

6) Anything can cultivate. One of the most powerful characters in the setting used to be a tree. Then they died, and became a tree ghost, and /kept cultivating/. Of the two major civilizations on the MC's continent, only one is human.

7) Relative power levels are clear and fairly consistent, although not inviolable.

A Monarch /who hasn't ascended from Cradle/.

All the Monarchs on Cradle are, basically, the equivalent of deadbeats, dead ends, and no-hopers. If you're a Monarch, you either leave the cradle or you stagnate.

If you don't leave, it's because there was something seriously wrong with your Path. You can see evidence of that in pretty much all of the existing Monarchs:

- Northstrider thinks that power is the only Path; that's why he (mistakenly) thought that power was necessary to touch the Way. He at some point realized that knowledge is power, and just started blindly collecting knowledge without /understanding/ it. (that's also why he's so interested in Dross, because Dross is basically a shortcut to understanding)
- Malice doesn't understand that true power needs freedom; that's why she's completely fucked up Mercy's Path.
- Sethehshshs (the dragon Monarch) doesn't understand that power comes from accepting yourself.
- Reigan Shen is the youngest and he had a chance to leave, but he didn't understand that using your power to kick over the sandbox will only drag you down in the end.

Certainly you can make a case that the main characters power levels have jumped significantly faster than expected, but that's been true the entire story for reasons that are fairly well supported in-story.

It dodges and addresses all the issues and tropes that commonly plague the genre, from the dog eat dog world, power scaling across stages AND time periods, level of civilization, inter-cultivator relations, techniques, and so on.

From civilization and government as a whole, the relationships and status of Cultivators at all levels, commentary on aspects like the typical and primitive "dog eat dog" worlds you see in other xianxias, FMoC is pretty damn good. I especially love how the author explains certain things like why two sects are killing each other over a piece of poop, and why that's the only logical course of action.

There's a lot of philosophical talk about civilization and humanity and whatnot, and while it may not be as good as what some people here may prefer, it's much better than virtually every other xianxia.

FMoC really plays to the strengths of the xianxia genre and does some unique things, like an actual advanced society with mechs and space ships, as well as the perpetual journey of going against the universe and the eternal darkness to survive and thrive. All the characters in the novel are also competent, which very few other xianxias have, and the power scaling and leveling is even more grounded than Cradle's.

My explanation isn't that good, the rec for FMoC does the novel justice and really explains how it rationalizes the xianxia genre, definitely worth checking out. I'd dare say it's even more rational and logical than Cradle.

*** It may be less relevant to the discussion, cause it is a xianxia transplanted to warhammer 40k universe.

From what I read, the discussion is about looking at the usual/common tropes we see and trying to see how to sanitize them, to make more sense, to remove senseless exaggeration, etc. To make them more rational.

FMoC could provide some insights how to sanitize xianxia (or to make it better quality, rational, adapted to western tastes), but it has too much western world building to it for this discussion.

The discussion could also be when xianxia stops being xianxia and becomes westxia (or westia, or wesxia).

Face slapping (which is pretty alien idea for people non-familiar with sino culture) would be integral part for country of origins and it is not used (a lot) trope by western authors.

So coming back to FMoC - is it still xianxia? or is it already westia?

** There's lots of ways to smooth the sharp edges of Xianxia but the result would depend on the specifics of the baseline laws of reality you chose. Your specific examples make it seem like you have an idea for a setting in which you'd like to see a rational story. That's cool. However I do think that a lot of the problems you're pointing at are more a result of authors not being smarter-enough-than-you to think of everything you'd think of, rather than being unsolvable problems with tropes in the genre.

To this day I'm pretty certain that the reason I liked HPMOR, (which is fanfiction of a very trope heavy setting/story), so much more than many other fiction books is just down to Yudkowsky being smarter than me by a large enough margin that he came up with cleverer tricks while /also/ taking the time to change the rules to close all loopholes I would have ever thought of and more.

To give a few examples of where I think some problems you list /are/ solvable:

- The only problem with making larger more varied worlds rational, is that you need to build more stuff into the world for them to seem big, and the bigger you build, the more likely you accidentally made an exploitable loophole that the reader will yell at the protagonist for not exploiting. At the other end, smaller worlds can get boring if part of the draw is setting, so going that way can /also/ be bad. Authors just need to find a balance between their ability to find and close plot holes in the world rules, and their desire to include more plot dynamics.

- A lot of the things that people think a rational person would recognize as infinite positive feedback loops and exploit, can be easily made unexploitable with additional mechanics that add limits or diminishing returns. There can be interactions between powers that prevent their combination, or training and upkeep-of-training time investment requirements that make wider training focus a severe handicap. What breaks the enjoyment isn't even that there is infinite scaling so much as that bad fiction doesn't do enough to get the reader to accept the reasons infinite scaling isn't user or more widespread.

- Stories don't even have to be hard scifi or hard fantasy in order to be sane. I love hard magic systems but.. The reader doesn't need to know the rules, nor do the characters, so long as the characters come up with basically everything most readers do, and then act on or explain the infeasibility of those ideas. And good enough descriptions can even allow damaged, less-educated, or less-genius characters to /not/ come up with things the reader would think of, so long as the reader's ideas are acknowledged and dismissed in some other way so that we don't assume the author was just too dumb to see the exploit.

- Massive battles with tons of collateral can be part of rational stories too, they just have to have an appropriately balanced effect on the outcome. That doesn't mean that stories would have to all be dark, but if large populations in a setting continue to exist afterwards, that would need a satisfying explanation (could be done with cloning, resurrections, higher birth rates, having children always raised in time chambers etc.)

** A lot of that sounds like the galaxy in the Culture novels, except replace people with civilizations. About the only thing that a planetbound civilization can create that's actually valuable to an Involved civilization is primitive artworks.

**** I see it, think of it more in terms of how your setting plays with scarcity and social construction to create the setting for the type of stories you want to tell. The way you're constructing this is really similar to the way iain banks constructed the culture.

** If you need sects with elders growing but still caring, you need the sect to have value to the elders, or they will go off to where they can get resources. If you want people keeping secrets of cultivation, there needs to be reasons to not spread information.

Perhaps, if cultivation methods are complex, then sects can serve as distributed R&D for methods to refine the foundations of a method. If different members are started out with different sections, then they will work to polish their own areas, and the best method of each type will show more progress. At low levels, different fragments may be more or less powerful, but if you need them later, you need to push people into them. If fighting someone with similar fragments helps you figure them out, then you want to 'exchange pointers' and it really is fighting to learn.

If knowing the details of a cultivation method deeply lets you more effectively fight someone with it, then you want to keep anyone who learns it under your control, and make sure it is not widely known.
