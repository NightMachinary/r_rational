****** Yes! I am not a huge fan of the parahumans online format to begin with, but the prelude Glow chapters have been pretty much a non-starter for me.

I'm hoping that we move on to more traditional narrative quickly.

****** Do you view Fallout as being "post-apocalyptic"?

Being post-apocalyptic is more about the atmosphere of the setting than its history. Admittedly, the atmosphere of A Hero's War isn't /that/ post-apocalyptic, but it is somewhat post-apocalyptic.

******* It has much stronger vibes of "the forerunner race with great mastery of nature" even if said race did mostly blow itself and the world up. The evidence of that apocalypse is fairly rare and inconsequential to the main plot of the story.

** There's a worm fic called Setanta which might just barely count. Characters are not rationalists, but the setting is pretty well designed and realistic. Side stories go into decent depth about the process of building a town using a "flat-pack" building kit and a chemistry Bible created pre-apocalypse specifically to enable the reconstruction of society.

I certainly don't think that it's a Gary Stu. Yes, Rudi and his friends are certainly potent warriors, but I don't recall them pulling off anything more impressive than, say, Aragorn does. They get injured, they lose friends along the way, they fuck up, and in the end - even Rudi can't live forever. What's Gary Stu-ish about them, really?

The later books definitely aren't rationalfic, but I was thinking mostly of /Dies the Fire/ and the rest of the initial trilogy.

(And: the Mackenzies go heavy Wiccan, but they're only one nation, aren't they? The Protectorate is definitely more Christian than not, and there's the Mormons, Mount Angel, the Dunedain, Corvallis, Boise...)

******* Rudi's personal feats aren't too Stu-ish, but how quickly all the other characters fall in line is. Realistically, I don't see how he would've [[#s][]] so quickly - at least, not without a whole lot more politicking and internal opposition that Stirling doesn't even hint at.

(And: sure, I'll believe the Mackenzies going Wiccan; I'll even accept Pastor Whatshisname's convenient death as permissible coincidence. But how'd it spread so quickly among the Bearkillers? And how'd it get to be such a coordinated underground in the PPA? And for that matter, how are the Mackenzies so good at the longbow so quickly, when the medieval English required years of practice from youth on to train up their archers?)

** Localroger has covered this a few times. If you'll forgive spoilers, the much-panned end of the novella Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect is a very "close up" view of this (an Adam and Eve sort of thing), while the entire series of (very) short stories /Passages in the Void/ details that from a "wide angle" view (robots seeding humanity on a new planet).

Both are good reads but I highly recommend /Passages in the Void/.
