Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I've been trying to plot out a book with the WIP-probably-not-actual title "Isekai Everywhere", which posits a world where "summon protagonist from another world" is pretty damned cheap and getting used for a lot of things that are trivial, not quite approaching Meseeks level, but at least a little bit close.

What I think interests me most is something like /World War Z/, where there are a bunch of stories linked together by a frame story, each of which touches on a different issue or theme, but which taken as a whole are an exploration of the world and its history, especially the moral/ethical issues with summoning someone from another world, the impacts to society, the winners and losers in the scenario, and the unexpected aspects.

So ... for a long time, I've been wanting to write a fantasy travelogue, kind of a slice-of-life thing that involves visiting different places. The structure of it seems pretty obvious: you just have the protagonist learn and grow along the way through his experiences, all of which are fairly mild, you start at the beginning and end with him returning home having changed, maybe making a decision or two along the way. That's the natural shape of that kind of story, at least to me.

But for a story composed of stories like Isekai Everywhere, I'm less confident that I know what it looks like from a structural perspective, even if each story is saying its own thing about something, or building on a meta theme. My natural instinct is that I'd start from a place of stability, have the stories set in unstable times with character/theme/plot links between them, and end with a different kind of stability when everything has settled into some kind of new normal. But I'm not sure about it, and I'm hesitant to do outlining for all the stories if they're going to be stops on the road and I don't know what the road is going to look like.

Advice/thoughts would be appreciated.

*** You could play with Magic the Gathering's idea of "Sparks."

The difference is that, instead of being able to change planes on their own, these Sparks are people who are susceptible to being summoned.

The result is that you've got a lot of summoners calling people, but they tend to draw from the same general pool of people.

So, your travelog can be the MC going from a newly awakened world-traveler, to an experienced old hand. Or just talking to other Sparks in the bar where they all hang out between missions.

A "same people, summoned many times" thing also explains why random summoning are better than just picking some guy off the street. Sure, the first time a spark is summoned, they're just some guy. But after the 1000th summon, they're probably pretty competent just by virtue of experience

*** Could play with the idea of a reverse summoner. Like, your MC is part of a special family that reverse summons themselves in times of stress and learns a relavant moral lesson with each summon. Or MC is part of a group humans that are sent to our world as babies to gather energy/technology/knowledge and then are periodically summoned back.

*** Your MC objects to Isekai Summoning on ethical grounds, and leaves every place where a Summoning happens. They see Summoning as a form of slavery; they seek a fabled land where no one Summons and where all the necessities for life are produced free of the taint of Summoning.

Every place the MC goes, they discover new ways Summoned people are being used.

A major character development point could be their turn from someone who runs from Summons to someone who banishes Summons, to someone who asks Summoned people what they would prefer.

Similar in feel to the anime Mushi-shi.

*** One thing you could do is have the summoned be from the same family. (Or families.) You start out with someone, maybe they're a hero, and they're great, which is how the story of summoning (and it's initial popularity) gets going. And then they have kids, and they get summoned, and it's the story of this family. One reason for this could be - people try and summon people who'd have a lot of magical power, and magic tends to run in families.

** Golem world: Golems are an ancient technique that never saw very much use, because in order to animate one, you needed a soul which was not going to any afterlife. A hero too righteous to go to any of the hells, who had somehow offended the gods, a heretical philosopher, or certain kinds of mad(wo)men. For thousands of years, golems were the personal bodyguard slaves of the very rich or powerful, maintained with excruciating care and built to be nigh indestructible.

Then the Academy of Night breached the veil and started hovering up the souls of earths dead. With no True Religions, earth is trailed by a cloud of souls counting many billions. Most summoned by the academy of night are promptly judged and sent onto afterlives that are, uhm, very unexpected, to them, but quite a high faction is claimed by no gods.

Hence the Golem Revolution. The Academy of Night gets very rich and makes many high minded speeches about how their sales of golem power and cognition crystals is just funding their philanthropic endeavor to rescue alien souls from limbo. Also the silk sheets in the student dorms.

MC keels over dead from a stroke at age 98 at a protest rally, and comes to in a student side project with some pretty obvious flaws in the control logic.

Does this sound like a story I should pour some time into fleshing out?

*** It sounds like something I would enjoy reading, especially if the MC is using otherworldly knowledge gathered along such a long lifetime to further his goals.

I'm assuming the MC would be going on a quest to patch the veil, once s/he learns what is happening? Or perhaps he becomes *The Golem God of Science* filling the vacancy in the pantheon of Gods so that the poor souls with No True Religion (such as he once was, as many from Earth are) have representation and judgement and can finally RIP?

** I'm working on a D&D setting for a campaign I'm planning. The basic premise is that it's set after a cult successfully triggered the apocalypse; the world has cracked into fragments and fallen into Hell. The remaining survivors are on fleets of magical airships (which conveniently happened to exist in large numbers already, because they were used for trading and war), using a variety of magics to prevent starvation.

One of the setting-specific changes is that there's an easy to learn cantrip that produces a tiny amount of the magical fuel that is used by airships, so nearly anyone can convert their time into value at a (fairly low) base rate. All PCs are allowed to know this cantrip for free.

Some fragments of the old world were caught in the apocalyptic storm that destroyed it, and those swirling fragments make up the new sky. Occasionally, a chunk of land will fall from the storm, slowly descending into Hell as the magic keeping it aloft fails and triggering a desperate expedition to scavenge resources from it.

What interesting consequences might there be here? How might people organise themselves? What problems are likely to be an issue for ships and fleets, assuming they've got food mostly handled via divine or nature magic?

Is there any kind of economy, or can everyone produce their own food and water? Do individual ships have unique resources? What hobbies can people engage in? Sports? Can one study and be a more productive member of society or is there no impetus in that direction? What impact does Hell have on their day-to-day lives? How are the suicide rates - is there a goal for making the world whole again or getting off the ships? Are there any surviving animals or pets? Mutated monsters or the like attacking the ships? Have people changed due to the altitude or die younger? If they have everything they need. What resources are they scaveging from the fallen chunks of land?

Can people make new ships?*

There could be ships, there could be fleets. They could organize themselves into self-sufficient units, or specialize. Imagine a world where everyone lives in mobile homes, and possibly runs a business out of.

Aside from possibly crime/factions, do they have nutrition and (clean) water handled? Hygiene? (How do they handle education? Law?) Do they grow plants for sustenance?* How? (Everyone in their own homes, or specialized ships or fleets? Aquaculture? Hydroponics? How much sunlight is there in Hell?) Are there seasons/days and night, is everything the same temperature? Is there weather? Do people have trouble staying warm, or cold? (Is Hell hot, or freezing? Or both, desert in the middle of a continent style?)

  divine... magic

Is anyone turning to lower deities? What do the Gods below have to offer? Is hell inhabited? By the souls of the damned? (Or just people who worship fire/ice?)

** I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas /about the magic/ not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world.

Nature Magic. Nature magic is about using the conceptual attributes (that the object is notable for) of a natural object into effects and enchantments (which like all enchantments are subject to universal limits). Anything within the realm of nature can be used to power these effects, which covers a wide variety of things from stars to rocks (gems, metals, and so on), gusts of wind to animals, blades of grass to mountains; notably if these things have been worked by human hands, either domesticated animals, tended gardens, or worked stone, they loose most of their potency (depending on how wild they are). Once an object has had an effect pulled from it, it is unusable for a time (by any nature mage) until it recharges (which varies based on the object).

Examples:

- Stoneskin: By pulling the hardness quality of stone, one's skin can be made to have similar hardness characteristics. Metals or gems also work here.
- Godray: A common offensive spell that pulls from the sun (which recharges extremely quickly as to be effectively un-exhaustable) of concentrated light and heat, the sun must be "up" though.
- Animate Object: By pulling the characteristics of an animal, exaggerated versions of those characteristics can be applied to an inanimate object (until the animal recharges), with slight commands embedded. A pack of wolves could be pulled into a pack of stones to make a pack of vicious hunting rocks. Or migratory bird (or fish) known for it's precision at distance pulled into a message could deliver it. A raccoon pulled into a bag could search someone's trash for interesting things and put it into itself.
- Astrology: Pulling the visible signs in the stars (like most celestial objects, they recharge quickly) can be used to create minor blessings and enchantments that last a day based off of what they signify.
- Gem Magic: A specialized magic, that's effectively it's own discipline focused on the variety of characteristics ascribed to varying gems.

*** The ocean tides can be used to increase or decrease the size of something, generally in a cycle that fades after a while. Interestingly, the Moon /can't/ be used in the same manner, despite the fact that it can be seen visibly waxing and waning in the sky; Nature mages disagree as to why. Some claim that the Moon, despite appearances, is /not/ actually changing size at all, while others maintain that the Moon is in fact changing size, but is in some way domesticated or otherwise "despoiled by the hand of man". Exactly /how/ the had of man could have despoiled the moon, or what a wild moon even looks like, are open questions; though same say that the Moon once used to be a second Sun, before it was tamed by some ancient hero of legend...
