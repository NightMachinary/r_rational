** I adore TWI, enough to support the author on patreon, but don't think it fits here at all.

Great serial, updates twice a week, with chapters that are regularly in the 15-20k words range because the author has an /insane/ work ethic.

But lets not sell it as something it's not.

*** agree. it's exceptionally good writing, but it isn't rational. in fact i'd call it a great example of how rational elements aren't necessary to make a good story.

****** When exactly does it get better? I tried getting through, but two main characters as of end of the city battle arc were so annoying to read, especially Ryoka, that I could barely keep my interest and eventually dropped it without much of a thought, year ago or so.

I enjoyed MoL and to lesser degree WTC and Worm, but this...

******* i'm not really sure what part you're referring to with those spoilers, sorry! i can think of at least three events that i would call "the city battle," and i may have forgotten at least one. it's been a while since i first read the story and i've yet to do a reread (its an intimidating prospect, this sucker is a real doorstopper! and most of the first book is not my thing at all) but as far as i can remember by book 2 i was getting invested and by book 3 i was long since hooked. i think the first time i was really getting hyped was when the skinner arc was in full swing, or maybe the start of winter, and ryoka's interactions with the sprites. Hopefully those spoilers are vague enough, if you haven't reached those parts yet. also, Ryoka and Erin are some of my favourite protagonists in general, so it's possible that this is just a matter of taste.

******** My apologies, I meant the first one, after monsters pour out of dungeon, which was possibly the Skinner one. That doesn't change the fact that I find Ryoka and Erin, especially Ryoka, so pointlessly antagonizing everything, operating on such petty behaviour, that I just didn't want to bother with it anymore. I might just try and grab an epub/mobi version from somewhere and try reading it on kindle, less distractions and options to jump out once the story gets annoying.

********* I had some huge gripes with the writing as well, especially because I can't stand the narrator 'signposting' (as my professors would've called it) intentions and explanations, but the writing does get better. I still dislike many side characters and I hate how the author has shifted his focus away from what I loved recently but as a slice of life kind of story it is really soothing.

Writing the every day life of some of these characters mundane life and making it a blast is definitely pirates strongest suit. On the other hand I have frequently skipped paragraphs and more during high action chapters just because I feel there is no real flow and urgency during battles. Partly the fault lies in the world and not the writer here though, just because the concept of skills makes combat so outlandish with its video gamesque names that I find it hard to stay immersed in the action.

** I have to agree with others here, I'm a fan of this story and have recommended it before on [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]], but I really don't think it belongs to this sub.

/Maaybe/ some Ryoka chapters, and some United Nations lately.

But not the main meat of the story.

** I see overwhelming favor for the work, but my personal experience says otherwise. People can assign different taste for differing opinion, and nobody should fault that, but my dislike goes deeper than that. Here's my observation with my personal opinion followed:

1. High word count makes the work lack polish. You can scroll without reading much of the text and not missing any. After some chapters (my case is after two books), you'll feel that author's skill on writing does not improve as she still need tremendous number of words to deliver idea.
2. Melodrama. You'll see similar sense repeated in multiple sentences without increasing impact. I assign it as melodrama as following sentence doesn't hit harder than earlier sentence. Just repetition. I think the author want to appeal to readers' emotion intensely, but she's lacking skill to invoke it.
3. Idiot balls (many characters's guilty of this), forgetting priority (idem), disregarding the value of communication (mostly the ant-like colony under Liscor). Stubbornness seemingly the defining trait for many characters in Wandering Inn. Some rooted in lofty ideals, which is nice. Many forget the practicality of it, which is par course and quite nice if they can learn from mistake. Sadly, learning from mistake is not equal stubbornness in this work. I have intense hate of it. Especially when some ideals are quite fatalistic. I think the author plunged to deep into the rule of drama.
4. Multi POV. You can dismiss this because it's entirely my taste: I hate multi-POV. Developing characters so that readers care for them takes time. Double the amount of time needed if they're idiots. I can only stomach multi-POV if the POV characters is highly competent AND offered a new perspective to conflict happening in the work. Given that my earlier experience that multiple characters in Wandering Inn are idiot, stubborn, (and I forgot that some of them are immensely egoist), multi-POV is really a bad thing here.

So there you go, a differing opinion on work that many seems to like it so much.

**** Hmm, I read Wondering Inn until winter spirit that attached to Ryoka died. Which book was that? Fourth? I actually like the work at early chapters. Author was trying to establish characters and world around them. Problems were simple then. From then on, the scope seems to keep expanding (as it should for fiction of this kind). And in my opinion, narrating higher stake demand higher writing skill. It also demand higher creativity. Author's skill at that time just doesn't cut it. So, if her current skill pleases you, I'm happy for you. However, I can't justify reading mountain of words just to see whether your opinion that 'later Wondering Inn chapters exceed the Mother of Learning in term of prose' also rings true to me.

This is an aside, but it might provide clarity to where I stand: I think when Ryoka being bitchy behind her Batman iPhone chat handle is the highest point of this fiction. She's approach new thing with caution. It went downhill since.

***** Erin transported into a new world. She found an abandoned Inn in the woods and decided to be an inkeeper. She deals with problem arise, from stray Goblins, Crab/Oyster-like monster, vagrant, and (friendly) authority of city nearby. She has sunny disposition and her approach to problems is amusing. Her tendency is to serve, so she sometimes fail to look after herself.

Ryoka transported into the same new world. Ryoka and Erin unrelated. They spawn on different place too. Unlike Erin, Ryoka is more educated, more cautious. But like Erin, what's true on Earth they seems to believe is also true in this new world. Ryoka's has a bit of bitch personality.

Magic and hilarity ensues.

I honestly think the early chapters is well written. Not well in sense of suck you in, made you forget time because you're so enamored with its beauty. Author is not Ursula LeGuinn after all. But things make sense, and drama is well directed. I just have problem when the scope get expanded and all new characters feel the same old stubborn and egoistic and frustrating. Author skills doesn't seems to keep up to make things stays interesting.

I'm not recommending it, but it seems you're already intrigued.

** 6.27 M is a perfect example of how very not-rational the work is. The assassins are inexplicably terrible at their jobs, like really fucking bad, so bad it's comical, in a way that makes no sense but is very convenient for the plot, so that you can get a sense of a threat without the good side losing anything.

And how is there enough work to support a guild of thousands of assassins? We're even told that traditionally the nobles of Izril don't fight each other using open bloodshed like this, so how do thousands of assassins make a living each year?
