** I thought the beginning of threadbare was a fun idea, executed...adequately. Gave up about half through as it tried to broaden its scope and cast. Anyway, I bought the first book of the Dire series and am 30% of the way through the first novel. It's mediocre so far. The main character is intriguing but the rest are fairly bland, very little has happened plot wise and I'm currently enduring some cliche â€˜let's guard our prisoners with zero competence and forethought' nonsense.

*** I couldn't really get in to threadbare. I was frequently bothered in the first few chapters by what I saw as difficulty in execution in regards to a character that was just born. The protagonist would frequently make conclusions or act on knowledge that it should not have been able to reasonably attain from a blank slate.

I kept thinking to myself "But, how could it have known that?" or "That's not a realistic assumption to make without outside knowledge."

It would not have been as bad if the problem was more consistent. At time the author did what I'd consider a good job, showing that they thought things through. Other times it appeared more hasty as if the author didn't pause to think whether or not what was written actually made any sense.

That said, I might pick it back up sometime because I was enjoying the series despite this issue. I just couldn't get past it at the time I first tried reading the story.

*** Nah, it still is. I'm pretty sure he wrote this while working on Threadbare and he's also currently writing Bunkercore. Andrew Seiple puts out a lot of stuff.

*** The Dire series is currently one of my all time favorite super hero series. It features a protagonist that is usually rational, in that she always acts in what she believes to be a manner that furthers her interests. Whether those interests are achieving long-term goals of world optimization or appearing to be a laughably maniacal supervillain who CRUSHES ALL WHO DARE STAND BEFORE DIRE, she's consistent.

Granted, there are some flaws, some intentional blind spots, etc, but over all...it's just such. A fun. Read.

I haven't read Hell, yet, but I am super excited to do so, and highly, /highly/ recommend the series.

In direct comparison with Threadbare: I enjoyed the Dire series faaaar more.

EDIT: I enjoyed Threadbare as well, but not as much. Threadbare has some flavor inconsistencies that bothered me.

**** How does it stand out versus other superhero stories? Worm, Legion of Nothing, With this Ring, and Life Ore Death, are the only ones I've had experience with up to this point.

****** In case it wasn't clear from this, Doctor Dire's "superpower" is most similar to Worm's Tinkers. She's a supergenius.

****** Seconding the Dire Worm recommendation, it's a fun read.
