Actually, the one that really gets me is that I had one person tell me "aw man i wantd [sic] anko/naruto but it looks like more naruhina shite"

I responded with something that was as polite as I could be when saying "no well in holy hell is that ever happening."

On its own I would have ignored it, but THE NEXT DAY I got a message from someone (who actually had good grammar) saying "I hope this isn't going to be Anko / Naruto" I wrote back with a "Hell no, what even made you say that??!"

The juxtaposition of the two was weird.

EDIT: Possible reasons Orochimaru is so invested into Naruto: 1) he wants the power of the Kyuubi and he cannot extract it to a better container/himself so he is trying to turn him

2) he cannot afford the Kyuubi to reform for whatever reason; maybe he still has ties to Akatsuki and having to wait for it to reform would ruin their plans; in fact, if he had NO ties to them, wouldn't it make sense to kill the hosts preemptively to screw with them?

3) he has a thing for little boys (i.e. see the Sasuke Thing from canon) and he hasn't developed Edo Tensei far enough

I think everyone mostly expects to see callous disregard for human life in rational naruto settings by now.

That said, it'd sure be nice if there were some repercussions Hinata actually cared about. As it looks right now, nothing of value to Hinata was lost in the incident and even her relationship with Naruto improved. I'm not sure if it's the urge to see Hinata pay for the deaths of all those people, or just the desire to see some consequence-induced character growth, but, for me, a childish tantrum leading to such a favourable outcome for the child at the expense of everyone else feels really unsatisfying.

***** Causation is an interesting thing. One could make the following arguments:

1. This is all Anko's fault, because she didn't address the issue of Hinata's abuse earlier, in a safe environment.
2. This is all Orochimaru's fault, because he kidnapped the team and forced them to come to Sound.
3. This is all Shino's fault because he tactlessly brought out the fact of Hinata's abuse.
4. This is all Hinata's fault because she went out to vent her rage running instead of staying in and fighting with her teammate. (Or, alternatively: This is all Hinata's fault because she had a childish temper tantrum and went stomping out.)
5. This is all Naruto's fault because he didn't stop when the Sound ninja told him to.
6. This is all the Sound ninjas' fault, because they had Naruto trapped and they went for the kill instead of the capture.
7. This is all Hinata's fault, because she refused to allow her teammate / friend / role model / crush to be killed.

****** Without a doubt there were many points at which this incident could have been averted.

But as far as responsibility goes, I'd say Anko is the one who's most to blame for the fiasco. Even disregarding the fact that she took a recruit with that kind of volatile emotional baggage on a mission in a foreign territory, she could have easily stopped Hinata herself instead of sending Naruto running into a hostile village. Scolding Shino was not something that absolutely had to be done immediately. So, definitely poor judgement on her part there. Not to mention the fact that she is a commanding officer and that pretty much makes everything her subordinates do her responsibility by default.

As for Hinata, I would not say it's her fault exactly. Inability to control her actions in such a situation is understandable. The lack of maturity has to be acknowledged nonetheless. Usually I would start wondering what kind of military organisation would allow recruits to start active service without any kind of psych aptitude evaluation (especially since there is no immediate need for fresh cannon fodder on the front lines of some war), but given the political power of her father, it's no surprise she slipped through.

**** The pedophilia thing wasn't meant seriously anyway. It's just that I like to read Naruto parodies every now and then and this is a common topic for Orochimaru. :P

But yeah, just imagine living in a village like this until someone who you trusted or depended on knocks on your door and tells you to report to the hospital. You are not being told why but Orochimaru took in your family when it needed help the most so you go (Orochimaru strikes me as the guy who tries to have good PR; it costs him little and the gains are pretty big). Then without warning you get paralyzed by one of the nurses (because in my head canon you have to be concious for the procedure because <reasons>) and get moved into the same room with that blond guy you don't know. All you know is that you are replacing the corpse that was in your place before you. And you can do nothing about but wait until your life is slowly being extinguished.

And FWIW, what Hinata did is a pretty calculated move but not unexpected. She values Naruto more than a bunch of strangers, especially strangers she can just rationalize to belonging to an enemy faction. I imagine you will explore her feelings about this and Naruto's guilt later on (why not just add that he is creating life when he casts Kage Bunshin so he is already a murderer anyway so we can be sure his spirit is fully broken? :P).

From the clone's and Naruto's point of view, a short life that contributes to his goals may well be preferable to no life at all. If the clones are not scared of their imminent demise, then they may actually be grateful for the chance to contribute.

**** Was there really a reason for that? I mean, unless they were running on dregs in term of people to move through the process, I feel like draining another person from 100% to 1% is better than draining 99 people from 1% to 0%.

Especially considering that chakra naturally recovers over time. If the process went on for several hours, you could even get MORE chakra out of people if you draned to 1%, then a few hours later when they are back up to ~25% or so, drain them again to 1%.

It's just really inefficient, even from a sociopathic perspective.

It's like destroying your power generators and getting new ones rather than running them out of gas and then going to refill them, even if you get a small amount more power by running it on fumes until it breaks.

The only justification I can think of is that they were worried about not have enough people even overall to provide enough to reach the absolute borderline for Naruto's natural regen. But that decision would have had to be made early, when they couldn't possibly have known, and obviously wasn't true, and again it /still/ is a dumb plan if the whole process lasts long enough for any of the first donators to recover appreciably.

***** I had wondered about that myself and the theory I came up with is that replacing these people is cheaper than nurturing them back to health. Using your numbers, even at 1% chakra left, there should be side effects to the procedure, such as being unconcious or organs not working properly until you have above y% chakra. Then the question becomes: Why not stop at safer levels like mild exhaustion? I have no working theory about that since essential information is missing (like duration of a single chakra drain). Maybe Naruto just drains the chakra so fast that you couldn't fine tune it and the procedure takes 10 secs per person at most?
