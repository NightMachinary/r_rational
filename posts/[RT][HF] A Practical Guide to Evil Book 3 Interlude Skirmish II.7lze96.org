**** Plans within plans? If the trap hadn't been sprung, they would have won. Waiting for whatever they sprung on her and using Take or Rise is a perfect Foundling non-plan plan: Wait until the enemy uses dirty tricks to pull a reversal, and then kill them with it.

** Catherine's plan was pretty good on general principles: since she expected the Praesi to open with a ritual, she gave them a decoy so they wouldn't account for her beating their ritual.

** Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Cat already use up Rise? I though she only had three tries and that afterwards she lost the ability. If so, it makes me think that she can learn how an aspect works via Take and then replicate its effects using her Winter power.

I'm very glad we got to see this battle from an outside perspective. It doesn't strike me as particularly important so letting us see other point of views makes it more interesting than just another standard battle.

*** Yeah I was confused because in the church she said she could only use it thrice, then she gave it up to *Take* flight from Princess Sulia (I think).

**** She gave it up to Take that wind thing from a summer duchess, but was only able to hold it for a short moment. The wings came later. (And I think that it was thrice per day, since she used it way more than three times total).

Regardless, this seems to be just general necromancy (boosted by the power of a fae title, seemingly), not an actual aspect.

Yeah this is what's bothering me, since I'm sure when she first *took* it, it got weaker each time and she didn't think it would work after a third. But that gets retconned, and I wouldn't mind that if there were some explanation offered, but there wasn't.

****** The Rise aspect she took from the Lone Swordsman could only be used three times a day, and she had problems because she didn't know (the Swordsman wasn't about to explain the details of the power to her). It doesn't apply to Take itself or any aspect she takes unless it already did.
