I started on Pith and was bothered by how irregular the pronoun usage is. As characters in Pith swap bodies, sometimes pronouns appear to change as they swap bodies, and other times they appear consistent despite body swaps. It's unclear to me if the author is making this choice deliberately, because of their own beliefs regarding gender and identity, or has crafted a society that uses pronouns differently than our own. If anyone can tell me if either is the case I'd appreciate it.

Within the context of Pith, I feel like it would make most sense for language to develop signifiers (and maybe even expression) that stay consistent across bodies (pronouns or other signifiers, perhaps based on the Pith color or Vocation), since you'd think that what really matters in a society with body swapping magic psychics is what stays consistent between bodies. Maybe I'm reading too deep into this and the author has chosen for Pith's views on sex and gender to mirror regressive western society much like it's nobility, architecture, and fashion.

I'm reminded, however, of With This Ring, which got pretty heavily into gender essentialism in one chapter to the point that the author was banned from a forum and had to rehost on QQ.

You'd think that a tendency towards trans humanism and ultimate freedom in bodily expression (and a focus on confronting preconceptions, bad science that gets copied forward culturally, and scientific dishonesty) in this community would cause a trend against gender essentialism.

Has anyone else seen this? Or trends towards similar harmful social biases (racism, sexism, ect.) which don't logically have a place in rat fic but end up there anyway? Of course I'm willing to evaluate my priors here.


** Locking this thread as it seems to have run its course. As clarification, this post /is/ on-topic, and most of the discussion was good, but it's the kind of thing we'd shut down quickly if it turned into a flame war, and we don't want a bunch of posts like this.

** I read Piths use of pronouns as 100% intentional

Can you give an example of a time the pronouns swapped which is throwing you off?

I think Anna pretty consistently doesn't swap, unless it is people referring to her undercover/ don't know. Hira has two bodies, and seems to consistently have right Hira be called he and left be she. Wes has pronouns that swaps throughout depending on people talking about them, but Wes's gender identity is also in flux through the story, which is resolved/ reflected on in his final chapter in volume 1, where he wants to identify as Wes, and doesn't like the fem body he is in.

Given that homophobia was a major plot/ worldbuilding point in one of the interludes (admiral Ebbridge and Florence) I think the gender and sexual norms in pith's recent past are supposed to mirror those in our own recent past.

*** The pronoun usage in the beginning made perfect sense given the situation, it was this sequence that confused me:

Spoilers for 2-C:

I smiled at the thought of my team missing me. Even if they were practicing without me, it was nice to know I hadn't just disappeared without a trace. “And your newest member?”

Samuel closed his eyes. “There is so much to think about. So much to talk about. Are you sure it's the best idea to -- “

“No. But I don't much care. What is he like? Is he shy, loud, cruel? Does he prance around in my dresses like a ballerina? Did he tell you his strategy for filleting me last week?”

And

Stop hedging. What is he like?”

Samuel took in a deep breath. “She's...enthusiastic. Excited about getting a free ride to Paragon and all your family's resources, but awkward. Me and the rest of the squad refused to speak to her at all, but she took it all in stride. Very demure, very apologetic. It's still too fresh and too personal for us to acknowledge her, and...she kind of gets that.”

Both refer to the same person in the same body, but maybe there's a social difference as a result of the usurping process where taking someone's position includes taking their pronouns when talking about group dynamics?

Like I said above not sure if this was a result of the society's approach to gender, this particular situation, or these characters in the moment.

**** Oh yeah, I remember that scene.

I read it as Weston being rude and misgendering Tasia, while Samuel uses her correct pronouns. I don't think we are supposed to like Weston in this scene. I think the societal expectation is that the person who ousts is supposed to take their name and pronouns /Tasia wants to be gendered with she/her and Samuel respects that.

I'll repeat what some other commentators said that Epistocrats are regressive, and artificial bodies are relatively new. [[/u/NoYouTryAnother]] expresses this, and a general perspective on the world and author better than I could, and I'm glad you'll continue to give the story a shot!

** Without providing examples, it's kinda hard to know what specifically you're referring to. You seem to be saying all characters should act a certain way, without considering that there are a ton of divisions going on with the characters in terms of age, gender, politics, class, ethnicity, parenting, and education that differentiate how they think/act.

#+end_quote

The character in Queen Sulphur, for instance, come from all across the world, from societies that teach body-swapping is a sin to ones that view it as putting on a new pair of shoes. The story doesn't have a single, monolithic society/culture, but multiple ones crammed together, pushing up against another.

As someone mentioned in another comment that the body-swapping is still relatively new in society, so it could just be that society has not caught up with technology and people don't know how to react to it.

It could also be because some characters can afford to choose which sex they body-swap into and some can't, and this affects how they, and others, treat gender.

*** I got the feeling that it's a matter of respect, as well. Right at the start, when the female MC is working in the bar/tavern, all the guests refer to her as him because the discount body she's in is male. If I'm a wealthy guy of higher social class, what do I care what gender the mind in that body over there thinks it is/originally was? I'm not going to spend mental effort to remember such things or take them into account; it would denigrate my social standing among my equally cruel and vindictive peers, same as taking the effort to remember this random servant's name would. You're here to serve me, maggot, not vice-versa. What do I pay you for? You want me to call you 'she', get a body with some feminine wiles.

**** I think this is probably where I run up against my own lines and veils when engaging with fiction/fantasy: I'm comfortable engaging with fiction where there is bigotry and injustice directed towards fantasy minority groups, which allows authors to explore the concept (and response by injured parties and allies), but fiction which depicts bigotry or socially motivated disrespect that's focused on underrepresented group aspects (treating women badly if they're of a lower social class, sexual violence against disadvantaged populations or the vulnerable, ect.) of real underrepresented populations gets uncomfortable for me, in part because I worry about what the author is saying/normalizing (again, like With This Ring, or Joss Whedon depicting sexual violence on DollHouse while crossing lines behind the scenes with coworkers).

I'm explicitly not making on judgment on Pith regarding this, this is my own comfort.

***** That's your deal. Briefly on Pith- do you consider Pith to be a case of showing bigotry towards underrepresented populations? Because I don't- we don't have body-swappers in real life, so from my point of view, mistreatment shown in Pith is the same as mistreatment shown in, I don't know, X-men. It's allegorical, not 'fictional black people getting whipped'. Again, this is just where our personal intuitions differ, I suppose.

** Far as I can tell, the author of Pith is very much aware of issues of trans rights, as well as gender non-conforming, body dysmorphia, and others that are natural to consider in the setting and explores these through the characters. But the /society/, one which has only openly had knowledge of Projection for a decade, is not.

Some of the characters have clear self-identification as one gender or another. Some of the characters are struggling to figure out who they are after having taken it for granted. One of the characters is simultaneously a guy and a girl in two bodies at once. The most recent chapters have outright addressed one of the character's discomfort with the gender and body they'd originally never questioned, but they haven't figured things out yet (potentially non-binary? we don't know). I am not sure what you're looking for in Pith, but I think you should give the author the benefit of the doubt here.

*** This makes sense to me, and I appreciate the insight.

It still bothers me a little that projectors from families of projectors which explicitly were apart (until recently) from general society would have the same attitudes towards gender as someone who was part of the Humdrum society (despite having had untold amounts of time to develop their own insular culture and approach to gender fluidity).

But this recommendation is enough for me to keep with it and give the author the benefit that they're exploring the topic and not attempting to voice their views through the character (like the WTR author explicitly was).

** What you're seeing is probably the collision of:

1. an author who did not grow up in a society with body swapping magic psychics,
2. keeping clear in their own mind exactly which characters they're describing in any given scene,
3. trying to describe those events in a way their audience will find comprehensible,
4. trying to write in a literarily satisfying way, ie, not repeating the characters' names too many times in a paragraph or (God forbit) twice in the same sentence,
5. and all while using words to simulate a specific timeframe in a specific culture on a specific planet.

Each author has to deal with these issues in their own way. Some are skillful and top-notch, and hit all five points during the entire story. Some are kind-hearted but clumsy at hitting each of the five points at different parts of the story because they haven't had the practice you've come to expect from the top-notch fiction-writers. Some are deliberate trolls, transphobes, or haters. Some disagree with gender identity ideas without any animus, and refuse to change how they write. Some find the easiest way (or the "funniest") to solve that Gordian knot is to just cut it and say "Character F /is really/ a man, even if he's turned by magic into a physical female [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5gvnfkOF9U][every day but Wednesday]]." (That example is species-essentialist too.)

Also consider how /fast/ society has had to shift to accommodate gender identity as a civil right instead of a pathology. Even just six years ago, in real-world 2015, it was considered a whimsical and farfetched idea that [[https://np.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3wegtd/back_to_the_future_part_ii_marlene_mcfly_is_marty/][Marty and Jennifer's daughter in Back to the Future II's 2015, Marlene McFly, might have been Marty Jr.'s transgender identical twin]]. For youngsters in high school, that was /two schools ago,/ but for workaday people in their 30's and 40's, they might still be at the same job with the same co-workers and doing the same hobbies on the weekend as six years prior. Heck, there are TV shows on my DVR recorded that long ago!

Personally, it often calls on experiences that are foreign to me without providing a framework to understand it. I can get /something/ from reading works written from different baseline experiences and for a different audience, but not as much as other people do.

For me, the difference isn't political vs. nonpolitical, or even political-I-agree-with vs. political-I-disagree-with, it's focus vs. background. Any work with LGBT themes /by definition/ has some focus on the topics of romance, sex, gender identity, etc. (specifically, it has a focus on the subset of those topics where the experiences of LGBT people differ from others'), and...I'm just not that interested or engaged by it. Including a gay romance in a story isn't any worse than a straight one, but that's not a very high bar.

Combine the added difficulty relating to the characters with the necessary focus on topics I don't care about, and you've pretty got my stance.

*** As others have said, it's a matter of focus, as well as representation. Why do gay people want to read stories with gay people in them? Why do people of x race say they want to read more stories with people in them that look like them? Humans like to read stories featuring characters they can identify with, characters similar to themselves. Trying to identify with a character significantly different from yourself has a particular 'taste', which is acquired; it's interesting and nice, but you wouldn't have it for every meal unless you're some kind of fancy connoisseur, and readers of sci-fi/fantasy trash are generally not connoisseurs.

Basically- all people are the same, they want to read stories with main characters that look/are like them unless they're specifically looking for a change or a mind-bender.

For personal anecdata, I remember that when I first looked at /Ra/, I was mildly turned off by all the focal characters being women, but Laura Ferno's mindset was familiar enough in an endearing sort of way I kept with it. You could say that's a stupid reaction to have, that it's sexist to be less inclined to continue reading a story because the main character has a different sex to myself, and maybe it is! Just like it is when gay people or people of x race judge stories based on the identities of the main characters ;)

** I can't recall concrete examples off the top of my head but of course rat fic has a bigotry problem. Just like any other genre really. People absorb their culture through osmosis and said culture has bigoted roots.

I'd argue that rat fic is more "woke" in some issues (depending on the author), but I've also noticed a definitive blind spot in some "softer" fields like sociology or psychology.

If I had to pick some concrete examples I disliked, it would be Hermione's treatment in HPMOR and (minor spoiler) the gay jokes in Mother of Learning. I've yet to find a rat fic written by a queer author. It feels like hunting a rainbow coloured unicorn on the 29th February.

I don't recall any homophobia in MoL, but it's been awhile since I read it.

That said, you really should provide context here if you're going to make that claim. Discussing something is not the same a being a proponent of it. It really depends on the context. An author can put bigoted jokes/slurs in their work without promoting bigotry or being a bigot themselves, but the highlight that bigotry exists even in subtle forms and why it is harmful/wrong.

**** HUGE SPOILERS Zorian is asked multiple times if Zach is his boyfriend, for example by his brother Damien. In the final battle versus Silverlake, she asks him, if he is gay in a condescending way and whether that is the reason that Zorian is so hard pressed on saving Zach from almost certain doom.

I gotta say I'm a little disappointed that there is zero lgbt representation in the story, considering it's one of my all time favourite stories. (A story where people turn into spiders and eagles doesn't at least mention that people use said magic to swap their gender? Come on, it's so easy to add a throwaway line. Like making Lukav and Alanic ex-boyfriends. Considering that Zorian is a literal mind reader, I find it suspect, that he never stumbled over any closeted gay people.)

Like I could live with the story skipping romantic themes all together as well. But Zorian, and Zach especially, are written as straight playboys. Zach literally dates two people at the same time, early in the time loop. Benisek and Zach constantly want to talk about girls, Benisek gives especially detailed descriptions about Taiven's hourglass figure.

I'm also not the huuuuugest fan of ZZ showing romantic interest in their teenage class mates, considering they are much much older than them mentally and the power balance is insanely in their favour. Like, I just wished the story would have discussed or at least addressed the pseudo-pedophilia or whatever you would call it. The author did address reproductive themes several times, specifically when talking about grey hunter shifter genetics.

So it's not like they are completely ignoring sexual themes, just lgbt themes. The only "representation" are the gay jokes directed at ZZ. I've been reading some of the author's world building posts (not all of them) and they haven't even breathed in the direction of lgbt themes, while talking about literally everything else under the sun. I'm just a little disappointed in that regard. If I missed anything, please correct me.

And of course Silverhand would say something like that. She's trying to rile Zorian up; she's caustic, that was part of her character from the start. Is it really so far-fetched that a fantasy world might have attitudes towards homosexuality that the west had... in the 90s?

Maybe I'm being uncharitable, but it seems like you're more disappointed that the author didn't make a show of allegiance to your social tranche.

EDIT: Actually, I saw another one of your comments, and you were just hoping the main characters would end up banging. Hey, I can respect the hope for lewd.

As always, the answer is algorithmically-generated alternate versions of the same story, one for straights, one for gays, one for lezzos, one for gender-nonconforming body-snatchers, plus alternate versions for each race/skin tone. You put your personal details in the website, it fills in blanks in the text/swaps character genders in appropriate ways.

*** Not exactly a rat fic, but I first saw always human being recommended here , and it still gets recommended pretty regularly [[https://m.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/list?title_no=557&page=1&webtoon-platform-redirect=true]]

The murder bot diaries is also recommended pretty frequently. It has genders and sex norms very different from ones that currently exist, although that isn't the focus. (Having read the first 2 books)

**** I agree with your point. I'm not saying that you shouldn't write about bigotry ever. I'm merely stating how the story and further world build posts (that I read), are written.

I really love MoL, but there's no lgbt representation besides gay jokes. Can I rationally deduce from that, that the author is a hardcore witch hunting homophobe? Probably not. I didn't claim the author to be one in my original post either.

But if I'm being honest, they really could have done better as well. That's what I meant with rat fic having blind spots.

(I posted some context in reply to my original comment.)

***** I can see what you mean to some extent, I don't remember that part with Silverlake but it comes across as her being a sore loser and childish more than anything else.

#+begin_quote
  Zorian is asked multiple times if Zach is his boyfriend, for example by his brother Damien.
#+end_quote

Is it possible that maybe Zorian is in the closet himself, and the author is hinting at that? I don't think he has any other serious relationships besides Zach, there was this buildup with a girl who was clearly interested in him but he never acted on that. In fact, I don't remember him having pursuing anything more than a casual relationship with another female character, despite have several opportunities to do so. He is always just been with Zach

****** The story really blueballed me honestly, so I've been reading ZxZ fanfiction on ao3. So yeah, some people also heacanon Zorian as closet gay, but it's niche as heck.

Zorian did go on a date with Taiven, who was his original crush and love confession. I personally liked that nothing came of it. The author did well describing the power imbalance between them through Taiven's insecurities.

What do I know? Maybe the author will address Zorian's sexuality in the sequel, whenever they write that one. Whether he is straight, bi or ace, I'm open for surprises.
