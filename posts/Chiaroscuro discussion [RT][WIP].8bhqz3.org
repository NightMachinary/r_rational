During hpmor EY discovered that the creation of subreddit where to discuss ideas sped up the discovery of mysteries of the novel much faster then the single persons posting on FF.

So I want to discuss the mysteries of that fanfiction and bring forth issues that must be discussed.

For people unfamiliar with it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro][Chiaroscuro]] is a Naruto fanfcition with the best troll Kakashi I have ever seen.

*Issues*

- Black Zetsu. Was it created by a Nara ancestor? What happened to the Shikamary shadows during training? Did his father destroy them or did they escape? How did his shadow kill white Zetsus?

- Does Shika father know about Black Zetsu?

- What was the situation with Kakashi chakra? Isn't it time for it to come back?

- How old are the kids now?

- True mist ninja (AO) mentioned that one of his subordinates got killed during Kakashi teleportation. I don't remember that happening.

- Is Orochimaru dead?

- I wanna see Temari again. What character *you* hope to see?

- What the fuck is Itachi plan? Spy on Akatsuki?


** I think it's pretty obvious that there is an N+1 player on the field. Maybe even multiple. As I consider myself as intelligent as Naruto in this story, I find myself unable to even begin to discern what everyone's true goals are.

Hell, Im having a hard time figuring on what's going on between Danzo, Shikaku, and the Third.

What I really love about the story is how Mist got led to believe someyhing completely false, but came to it in a totally rational way. Often times I'll read a bunch of rationalistic fiction and everyone in it come to true observations always. It's so nice to see someone come to a false conclusion, be able to trace how they got there, and be unable to argue against it.

  Shikaku

He says he got to fight Danzo. It means they had an all out battle but everyone keeps it under wraps?

Can't wait the upcoming Mist ninja vs Hokage Kakashi interactions.

#+end_quote

No it wasn't, it was created by Kaguya using a jutsu. Shikamaru's dad just reinvented it based on their own clan techniques. He shadow during training realized that it was possible to do this, but it was incredibly stressful/damaging, I messaged the author and he said it was essentially like staying up all night, you /can/ do it, but it's not something you'd want to do, and Shika represses the memory because reintegrating two divergent minds is really fucking crazy.

#+begin_quote
  How did his shadow kill white Zetsus?
#+end_quote

Errr, the same way that black zetsu can control white zetsus black shikamaru (not racist) told them to kill themselves, I think.

#+begin_quote
  Does Shika father know about Black Zetsu?
#+end_quote

Not explitcitly, but he knows that someone created that jutsu before and Shikamaru had to fight it (Shikamaru mentioned this to his dad after the battle.)

#+begin_quote
  What was the situation with Kakashi chakra? Isn't it time for it to come back?
#+end_quote

The time for the chakra blocks to come off is almost here, but we still don't know how complete the damage was, or how much it can recover now.

#+begin_quote
  How old are the kids now?
#+end_quote

....Fuck, I want to say thirteen?

#+begin_quote
  True mist ninja (AO) mentioned that one of his subordinates got killed during Kakashi teleportation. I don't remember that happening.
#+end_quote

...... Yeah, neither do I, that's pretty crazy, can you quote the line/chapter?

#+begin_quote
  Is Orochimaru dead?
#+end_quote

Yes, permanently, and after what the guardian of hell said, he's probably getting tortured for shits and giggles by the shinigami for messing around with life and death.

#+begin_quote
  I wanna see Temari again. What character you hope to see?
#+end_quote

MAITO-GUY, HERO OF THE LEAF! KILLER OF MADARA UCHIHA! SAVIOR OF KONOHA!

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yep, for Konoho, that and get Sasuke to kill him to awaken his mangykyo, then have Sasuke take /his/ eyes to awaken the eternal mangykyo

This was fun, there aren't enough discussions around this.

**** Caught me at the perfect time. I just logged on.

- Yes, Shikamaru's dad rediscovered the Will Manifestation technique.

- Canonically White Zetsus die when take enough damage (what Kakashi and Ino did) or get told to abort by Kaguya-as-Black-Zetsu (what Shikamaru did).

- Kakashi's arms are still screwed up, but keep in mind, Tsunade has Hinata helping her now. Plus, unlike canon, Hidan wasn't buried in an explosion pit, which means Konoha Medical Research has his magically healing corpse.

- They're just about end of 13, close to 14.

- I'm not sure exactly what you're asking here? Keep in mind Ao has a Byakugan so he can stalk anyone from kilometers away without getting caught. He observed the fight against Hidan and Kakuzu. Unless you mean the Wave mission, where Ao tricked Orochimaru's subordinates into being his subordinates.

- Yep, he's gone. The Shinigami has him now.

- Temari and the other Kage will be making an appearance soon.

- Itachi is not the same as canon; he's his own side. His interests currently align with Konoha because of Sasuke and the eye plan thing. Which isn't really working because Sasuke's having way more fun partying with Jiraiya.

Can I just say that and your "explanation" of his canon behavior was perhaps the funniest thing you've ever written?
