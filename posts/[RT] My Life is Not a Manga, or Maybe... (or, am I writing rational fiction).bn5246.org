I've been quietly trying to write a story about a rational character trapped in an irrational situation over in my little corner of the internet, and today I discovered this subreddit which is making me very happy!

I'd be very interested in hearing if you folks think that Not A Manga is, in fact, rational (or any constructive criticism, really; so far most of my readers have not been particularly critical). I'm not at all familiar with rationalist fiction outside of HPMOR (yet), but hopefully I've been doing some things right regardless.

If you're interested, you can find it at *[[https://notamanga.com][NotAManga.com]]* (also on [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23126/my-life-is-not-a-manga-or-maybe][Royal Road]], if that's your jam).

Thanks in advance to anyone who tries it out and decides to leave feedback!

--------------

*Synopsis:* Xavier had a happy, humdrum life: normal friendships, a normal girlfriend, a somewhat oddball family. Until, that is, he literally stumbled through the fourth wall and discovered he was the protagonist of a manga.

Now he's scrambling to maintain any semblance of control over his own life in the face of something he never imagined he would need to contend with: the power of the Genre.


** Really enjoyed this so far. Reminds me of The Simulacrum but with better writing and moving in a different direction.

I like that how the MC evaluates his scenario and his realistic reactions to his reality being based on a manga. I'm also a big fan of the parents lending assistance and super curious about the death game his Mom was involved in.

So far this is definitely looks like a work I would keep up with.

*** I discovered The Simulacrum shortly after I started posting Not A Manga, and it's definitely a completely different take on the "trapped in a manga" thing. Didn't make it very far through, though, TBH. Something about the MC just didn't do it for me.

I can't really do much to assuage your curiosity at this point, unfortunately. Specifics about the death game are not likely to come up much in Xavier's story, because his mom doesn't like talking about it for obvious reasons (maybe I'll do a prequel at some point, but no promises). I can say that it was called the Labyrinth Obscura (Xavier's dad revealed this in Chapter 21), it was primarily a zero-sum game with prisoner's dilemma elements thrown in for giggles, and Xavier's mother is older than her birth year would indicate thanks to time dilation (more time passed within the Labyrinth Obscura than out of it, and she was in and out several times). I thought about writing that arc before I started on Xavier's story, but I'm honestly kind of scared of it. Unlike Xavier, she goes in without any genre awareness or external support network; the results are not pretty.

** I like the premise a lot more than what's actually on the page, to be totally honest. Much like The Simulacrum, the story sets us up with a protagonist that is nominally aware of the reality they live in, but who decides early on to not rock the boat. The protagonist gets sucked up in replaying the stations of the genre, instead of interacting with those in a more assertive, conflict-generating way.

Xavier's internal struggle is not enough to create a unique plot, and now that he has surrendered his agency even further to a reliance on his parents' planning skills it feels like there's no room for him to show that he can act differently from the archetype he's trying to avoid embodying.

The premise of the story implies a much more involved protagonist. I'd argue Xavier could currently be replaced with a simpler genre savvy protagonist while leaving all plotpoints except for his parents' backstory intact. I'd also argue that that's not a good thing, but clearly other people find the story up to their standards.

The first misstep is likely that Xavier never seriously considers sharing what he has learned with anybody other than the girlfriend that gets put on the bus before he can get a word in. Because only secondary characters know about his secret, it plays out like the usual romance comedy: His interactions with the female cast are not allowed to be premise-aware. This is a problem that gets lampshaded early on, but hanging a lampshade on the problem doesn't mean it's solved and, personally speaking, a story in which Xavier gets over his initial failure to address the premise sounds better.

This is a good point. It's actually an intentional character flaw (Xavier has a weird block even sharing he /likes/ manga, much less being willing to try and convince someone that he's in one), but it does impact the narrative pretty heavily. I'll give it some thought when it comes time to revise. I'm honestly not sure whether I'll change it or not; there is a point to it, but that point isn't going to matter for another volume or two (assuming my plans proceed...erm, as planned) and it might not be worth playing the long game if the first volume is putting people off.

*** Yeah, Xavier is not driven enough, and nobody else is exhibiting meaningful agency at all. His parents are remarkably content to let him make uninformed decisions. They should be drilling the heck out of him, drawing up different plans and contingencies.

Too slow paced.

** Ok this has a very *very* interesting premise, but as of chapter 16, the protagonist being aware of the situation has not had an effect on the plot. I understand that you want Xavier to look like a normal teenager, but that drags the early part of the story quite a bit. It just plays out like a normal Harem Romcom with the only differences being that the setting is not in Japan and the protagonist is meta-aware.

The plot will only be interesting if awareness of being in a story will allow the protagonist to change his predicament.

As of chapter 19, consider me intrigued.

Caught up now, hoping for something interesting to happen soon. All we've seen so far is Xavier triggering flags left and right with only his own increasing horror for company, and 26 chapters of just that setup is no different from an actual Harem romcom plot.

*** Thanks for the criticism! I honestly kind of drove myself into a corner before I wrote the first word. My thought process ran from the inspiration that I wanted to write about a character trapped in a manga and aware of the genre to the desire for a character who was relatable and realistic (which means no magic or similar, at least initially). I quickly ended up with a harem, because that's the genre that I'm simultaneously decently well-versed in, but one that I have a lot of issues with. So great! I started writing.

And quickly realized that Xavier had a serious issue, because harems are almost wholly driven by coincidences and/or dense-as-brick protagonists! The premise completely fails if he's the latter, and the former makes it very difficult for him to gain any level of control over his own life. There's additionally the narrative tension of needing him to be proactive, but not wanting everything to completely go his way (because someone making a plan and having it go off without a hitch every time is super boring).

I'll keep this in mind when it comes time to try and revise the story, since the complaint that Xavier is too reactive for too long is one that others have had, as well.

On the other hand, hearing that it reads like an actual harem romcom plot is kind of encouraging; one of my main goals for this was to try and achieve a similar balance to Yomi Hirasaki's A Sister's All You Need (he's WAY better, and I'm nowhere near there yet, but that sort of simultaneous send-up of a genre while writing a great example of that genre is where I'd ideally like this story to end up). We'll see if that ends up working long-term.

**** Interesting to hear about the thought process behind it. And yeah, understandably the balance between the Gary Stu rationalist and normal teenage boy is very hard to pull off.

I think the reason it feels like a regular romcom is that Xavier is a pretty decent kid, and always chooses the "nice guy" dialogue choice when faced with situations with the girls, which is the same thing a normal manga protagonist does (Huh, maybe that's why he was chosen to be a protagonist, he has that overly self-sacrificial personality that is very hard to find IRL). Maybe give him a few dialogues where he tries the opposite or maybe show him struggling a little more when he has to make the choice between losing agency in his life vs hurting one of the girls, might help.

** Nice! Reminded me of Sleeping with the Girls, a Self-Insert crossover fic where the protagonist suddenly starts waking up next to a different anime female character each time he goes to sleep...

Vol. 1 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality]]

Vol. 2 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6052381/1/Sleeping-With-The-Girls-Vol-II-Chaos-Theory]]

Although that one seems to be abandoned, I found it very entertaining while it lasted.

EDIT - The author's preamble in the first volume says it all:

#+begin_quote
  Pre-Story notes:

  As a fanfiction writer, I'm sure one has always had fantasies they wished to write about concerning some of their favorite stories/settings/character. And along with these, sets of what-ifs. Fanfiction, in a way, has always been about what-ifs by most authors. It allows them to express their own thoughts and insights into the characters and settings of a story. Or if you're feeling particularly unforgiving at this time... It's just blatant teenage hormones going off... Hit and Miss y'know.

  The scenario presented is something along the lines of a twisted what-if. What if, you took a fanfiction author's fantasy scenario, and twisted it? Corrupted it. Made one of the most basic desires of the amateur fanfic writer go COMPLETELY... 'NOT AS PLANNED!'

  The following story will be such an experiment. Things won't be going according to the scenario. This is not part of the master plan... In fact, Gendo has been banned from all further meetings.

  So without further ado: We begin our story.

*** I've changed my mind; thanks /for nothing!/ (*´▽`*) I barely got any work done on Not A Manga this weekend because I was obsessively reading Sleeping with the Girls (haven't quite finished the second volume at this point, but I desperately need sleep). Really fascinating and well-written story, to the point that I didn't even care about the weird recurring typos and bad comma usage (it's "nigh" not "neigh", dammit!).

It's also super interesting because it's basically the same premise, but approached from a completely different angle. Both are about everymen inserted into manga whose end goal is a return to normality, but with totally different stakes and capabilities (mostly perfect plot knowledge vs. imperfect genre knowledge; desperately trying to survive vs. trying not to irrevocably destroy his everyday life; inserted into manga vs. having manga logic imposed on his world; etc.).

** Actually surprisingly great. I really had fun reading this one. The first couple chapters didn't grab me all that much nor did they scare me away, but by about chapter five I was hooked.

I'd go as far as to say that this is the first Harem Manga I've enjoyed in a few years, heh. I have pretty much the same issues as Xavier does with the genre, but somehow the entire thing being couched in this weird story makes it palatable again.

And, of course, the entire premise being the protagonist vs the rules of the world fits right in with rational stories and is really satisfying in general.

** I've been reading until chapter 19 and this far it hasn't really drawn me in. I enjoy the premise of a self aware harem character however this far he hasn't done anything that impresses me. His motivation seems to be that he doesn't want a girlfriend right now with having recently been dropped and that he resents the idea of being controlled by an author. Plausible enough.

This far though he hasn't done anything to avoid it. No emotionally mature talks about how he isn't interested in any girlfriend right now, no talks to the tsundere about how it's obvious that she likes him but that he can't stand the repeating deflections and will ask her to stop doing that or distance herself, no talk to the sexy senior about how her behaviour makes him uncomfortable and if she doesn't stop he'll ask her not to contact him, not trying to hook up his harem with friends. No trying to engineer situations that allowed him to achieve +world dominans+ his goals by using predictable tropes.

Is Xavier taking more initiative in later chapters or does it continue like this?

*** You're right on the cusp of him starting to try and take control of his situation. Chapters 20-21 are Xaviertalking to his parents (not really a spoiler if you've read the end of chapter 19), and he'll start trying to deal with Samantha in chapter 22. His approach with Samantha is still a bit roundabout; he's still invested in playing the nice guy at this point, but that's likely to start changing soon because there's no way it will work with Paula.

Thanks for your feedback! The complaint that Xavier is too reactive for too long is a pretty common complaint, so I'm planning to revisit the pacing when it comes time to revise.
