Its dead Jim.

But in all seriousness, it has great detail in combat startup programs and environment detection, i like it. The word replacement is bit hard to read, both due to having to learn new words and the difference in time standards, dont know whats the point.

Learning how to translate was also good, if a bit lucky the both sides had similar programming to transmit with.

*** Given the way it ended, I think that the author just forgot to mark it as Completed.

**** Hmm, I had assumed it was abandoned due to low chapter count and lack of "completed" mark, but your comment made me go back and finish it.

Looks like it is over, and finely explained too. Though why the Machines would reveal the truth in such a roundabout and blunt way is still a mystery

***** It leaves some things unexplained, though. Why build additional cybertronians, instead of just the Template? How come the autobots are so much more advanced than the machines, in terms of sensors, processors, armor, and weaponry?

It's a neat little Philip K. Dick switcharoo, but not a watertight package as far as I can tell. Did I miss something?

** I'm a bit confused; are the Transformers in the Matrix as well?
