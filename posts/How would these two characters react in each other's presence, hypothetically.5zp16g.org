** Surely their interactions would vastly vary depending on the context for the interaction? Is this a social call? Are they making small talk? Are they fighting? Do they both want something only one of them can get?

*** I agree, the context of their interaction is necessary to determine how they would interact. The question is essentially pointless to ask without that information. Especially because this is not the information that these characters have, they both absolutely /know/ their induvidual goals and motivations. While they also both have their own personal perspective of whatever situation they are in.

OP seems to be asking the question under the assumption that there exists a "perfect" or singular rational way in which these characters are able to act regardless of outside factors. Either that or he's asking how the audience would expect the characters to act in any situation which is a similalry useless question because in that case any answer is both right and wrong because not everyone will agree.

** A lot of how people interact is a function of goal alignment, but assuming they're broadly pursuing the same things, the snark knight will probably be frustrated with the paladin pretty quickly, on account of giving him nothing to work with.

** Do they have to tolerate each other's presence for some time? Work together? Against each other?

I'm assuming either 1 or 2; in which case A occasionally would be grunting non-commitally to B's witticisms, B would be trying to ask some deliberately inane questions trying to make the routine more bearable. If faced with a problem, A would first wait to see how'd B go about solving it, and then silently solve it himself if B fails for some reason. If faced with unknown people, A would try to prevent B from accidentally stepping on someone's ego to prevent potential conflicts. If given enough time together, A would get somewhat used to B's not-as-clever-as-he-thinks remarks and rarely even add his own tries at jokes.

I think adding situational context info would help you get more\better answers.

** Sounds like a setup for a socratic dialogue (with person B being the author avatar, subverting person A which represents the audience's expectations)... with occasional reversal when the obvious and intuitive and conservative answer is actually the true one and the contrarian is wrong.

This could potentially be a pretty good [[/r/writingprompts]] post, I suggest reposting it there?

**** In a crime ridden city, two men with very different personalities must work together to capture the city's worst drug dealers

#+begin_quote
  Person A being a calm, determined man, in his late 20s. Person A's motivations are unclear, but one could guess he is not immoral. He is stolid. His describing trait is his ability to stay calm in tense situations, though he has little to say. Person A has solutions to problems and is usually always serious. Weather or not person A is a fighter, is unknown.

  Person B although similar to person A, is not entirely stoic nor incapable or uninterested in emotional outlet. He has a mocking sense of humor and often finds entertainment through sarcasm. One of person B's traits is to point out obvious answers to obvious questions, poking fun at the asker. Person B is a man also in his late 20s. Although person B mocks his enemies, he is not a violent person. He won't actively seek violence, but will fight if given no other option. Person B laughs at common misconceptions of society by softly announcing in a low tone;

I imagine reddit will have person B argue for legalization / be the one who points out that dealers are people trying to get by etc

** When you say, "weather[sic] or not person A is a fighter, is unknown," do you mean it's unknown to you, the author? This seems like an inexplicable oversight.

These guys seem pretty typical for "buddy movies," especially cop or road trip type, although they veer a little towards the "3 edgy 5 me" stereotypes common in a teenagers' first fanfic.

I mean that it probably depends on the circumstances; even /he/ doesn't know weather he's a fighter. Regardless, I also wanted to highlight your second paragraph. I have /never/ heard of anyone who matches person B. Can you name anyone who matches him verbatim?

**** If you mean "matches him verbatim" as in "has been literally described word-for-word the same way, including the exact catchphrase," then no. If you mean "sarcastic, has noble intentions which outside of fiction would be sabotaged by his own apathy, and is paired with a more stoic, rule-bound type," roughly 50% of the people on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuddyCopShow][this page]].

I feel like we don't have enough information and the info you've given us seems to be oddly nuanced considering lack of context, even if I accountethe hypothetical scenario you gave us.

** I think the common thread in a lot of commenters' reactions here is: /why?/ Why do you want to know how this subreddit thinks characters A and B would interact? Supposing you received an answer that you deemed satisfactory, for what purpose would you use that information? More to the point, /what makes you believe any of the people on this subreddit are more capable of answering this question than you are/? You presumably know more about these characters than we do, meaning you have more information than we do, meaning you should be in a better position to answer your own question than anyone here is. Honestly, right now it seems like you're just trying to get us to do your homework or something. (Emphasis on /seems/.) Maybe I'm completely misreading you, but if that's the case, so are a lot of other commenters--and you know the best way to avoid such misunderstandings? /Provide more information./

*** Flair checks out. Nice job Descartes. Regardless, homework? I'll tell you the same thing I told the other guy. Do not assume things. What I wanted to do was /see your opinions/. No homework, no judging, no /Oh your statement sucks/, no. None of that.

All I wanted to do was get your interpretation of my characters! This isn't some trick-question /gotcha!/ bullshit. There isn't a wrong answer.

Place them in any scenario you want. Imagine, if I thought of the character's personalities, why would be lazy and /not/ want to put them into a plot?
