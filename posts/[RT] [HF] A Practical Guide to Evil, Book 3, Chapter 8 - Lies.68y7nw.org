** Hmm, I feel like Cat is forming her own Calamities.

Black | Cat

Warlock | Apprentice

Captain | Adjutant

Assassin | Iunno, Robber maybe? He seems to be enough of a legend amongst Goblins to get a name.

Ranger | Here I have no clue. Maybe Archer takes a liking to her?

Edit: Hell, she even has her own Grem One-Eye in the form of Juniper.

*** Yep, that seems to have been building up for a while. I like your idea that Archer might take Ranger's place. Additionally, for your consideration, I give you: Scribe | Ratface

There's still such a huge power gap between the old team and the new.

**** Just thinking about parallels - if Scribe is Ratface (which fits!), then Aisha might be the Empress equivalent?

It appears that the "groups" would work in odd numbers, i.e. 3 | 5 | 7 and the history mirrors the present.

For example, in Appellant, there was a core group of three calamities attacking the heroes: Black, Warlock, Captain. There was a hidden fourth (not part of the main action): Assassin.

In Chapter 7 (Elaboration), there was a core group of three: Cat, Apprentice, Adjutant. The hidden fourth was Archer.

For the calamities in general, it seems to have a core of 7 Named:

1. Empress (behind the scenes)
2. Black
3. Warlock
4. Captain
5. Assassin (?)
6. Ranger (retired)
7. Scribe (affiliated)

For the mirroring effect, I guess Cat would end up with 7 Named too.

***** Major problem with Aisha being the Empress here is that Cat isn't going to compromise like Black did in his personal rebellion. I suspect she's going to end up Queen or Tyrant of both countries.

I can't imagine her hearing the song means anything different.

***** You're making a lot of sense there. It's going to take a long time for the new team to gather enough power to take over from the old if they use traditional methods. I think Cat may find a way to break the game and shortcut her route to power.

*** As much as I'd love to be able to write this cleverly, I am not the author. I just post new chapters here so more people get to enjoy one of my very favourite web fics. I don't think the author uses reddit much (if at all).
