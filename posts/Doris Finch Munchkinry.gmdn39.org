In the web serial Worth The Candle, a character named Doris Finch has the ability to magically make perfect duplicates of herself. Her equipment is duplicated, too, but one copy disappears after 24 hours.

I have discovered a simple and easy way to generate +gigantic explosions+ mass extinction events with this power.

*Materials:* +Some lye or potash +Some epsom salt +At least two cups +Some water +A funnel and coffee filter

*Step 1:* Prepare a lye solution in one of the cups. *Step 2:* Make and kill a clone. *Step 3:* Dump the disappearing copy of the epsom salt into the lye solution. If you don't know which copy is permanent, then just dump both in and use an excess of the permanent lye. *Step 4:* The substances should react to form magnesium hydroxide (which will precipitate) and potassium sulphate (which will remain dissolved). *Step 5:* Filter the solution into the other cup. Collect the magnesium hydroxide. *Step 6:* Deposit the salt and the solution some distance apart in the area you want blown up. *Step 7:* Wait a day. For safety reasons, one is advised to use this time moving +away from the site.+ to another plane.

After a day, the copied magnesium and sulphate ions should disappear. This means that the magnesium hydroxide salt is suddenly just a bunch of magnesium ions crammed really close to each other. It is clear that the ions will repel each other with incredible force, dumping lots of energy into the environment. The question is, how much?

(Apologies if I screw up my terminology.)

Imagine the case in which Doris's magnesium hydroxide pile is a sphere two centimeters in radius. Newton's Shell Theorem tells us that we can calculate the electrostatic forces of the ion sphere on any given charge by modeling the entire sphere as a single point charge at its center. We can then find the work done on any given ion as it moves from its initial point in the sphere to, uh, let's say five meters away by line integrating the electric field over its path and multiplying by charge. We can find the total amount of work done on the particles in the ion sphere as they all reach out five meters by integrating the previous integral over the sphere. So we get something like:

(APOLOGIES; I DO NOT KNOW LATEX. THEREFORE I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WRITE THIS OUT IN WORDS)

The integral from r=0 to r=0.02 meters of (four times pi times r^{2} times the integral from x=r to x= five meters of( (Avogadro's Number times the density of magnesium hydroxide/the molar mass of magnesium hydroxide) times two times the elementary charge times ((Avogadro's Number times the density of magnesium hydroxide/the molar mass of magnesium hydroxide) times two times the elementary charge times four times pi times 0.000008 cubic meters / three) times Coulomb's constant / x^{2))}

This appears to be about 4.5 times ten to the twenty-second joules. This is a lot of energy! It exceeds that released by the K-T impact by two orders of magnitude.

Something for the Harold cultists to consider, I guess.


** You're assuming chemistry still works. The electrons that disappear after 24 hours are different from the ones that don't, so they're not covered by the Pauli exclusion principle. This means that if a normal electron and a disappearing electron are in the same atom, it won't have the same number of valence electrons as normal and will behave like another element. This will make it hard to last long enough to build that bomb.

*** Yeah, the issue with an assumption like this is that if chemistry were just working, something of the sort will be happening observably already. The world rarely just kindly takes to violations of conservation without some kind of patchwork behind the scenes.

(I will note that Bethel has a trivial way of forcing Doris to make at least a quadrillion of her.)

** I think the rules for duplication magic are a bit fuzzier than that. Either the magnesium hydroxide salt will all stop counting as subject to duplication magic and thus persist or more likely (because it is less exploitable), it will all start counting as duplicate magic stuff and all of the magnesium hydroxide salt, including the magnesium ions, will disappear. Splitting the difference, the duplication magic is broken partway through the reaction in a messy but not especially destructive way.

The Dorises are pretty smart, so they might have tried exploiting the magic in chemistry and run into limits already.

*** If so then you can take something that you don't duplicate instead and add it in.

Either remains behind returned to the way it was, it disappears along with everything else, or it explodes.

All results are exploitable. Eliminating matter is the least so since they can do that to generate energy anyway

** I'm fairly certain this is not how Doris equipment works.

Think about HPEV's first lessons in transfiguration, and then realize that whatever seemingly strict warnings McGonagall issued, they were not strict enough. You so much as /smell/ Doris gear, you've already chemically reacted with it. Say hello to your new friend cancer. Chemistry happens all the time. If the gear removal traced matter down to the electron levels, Dorises would've died out long ago from cancers, especially considering the violent nature of their... republic.

Still it is important to note that exclusions don't stop the first use of something, they just contain it to that area. So Dorris could still use this to wipe out herself and a sizeable region around her exclusion.

******* I think exclusions /do/ actually stop things that are too powerful from even happening the first time, as experienced by the denizens of Aerb and related realms by means of the anthropic principal: in cases where the world would either be destroyed or mutilated in such a way that Juniper wouldn't be able to have his little adventures, the DM uses a heavy hand to revert things and alter them so the would-be exclusion didn't even happen, so we end up only seeing the resulting world consisting of normal exclusions.

******** What kind of event would a partial exclusion not be sufficient for?\\
An exponential effect can just be excluded to not be exponential at a certain boundary.\\
Any explosion/etc powerful enough to destroy all of Aerb can similarly be excluded and prevented from crossing an exclusion boundary.\\
I can't imagine a single thing that couldn't simply be excluded, seeing as exclusions are essentially 'lol nope' acts of God.

** There's huge problems with the "disappears after 24 hours" rule. What happens if you eat duplicated food? does part of your body vanish? What happens to duplicated air? When you combine with other materials, does it slice it up at the molecular level, atomic level, quantum level? so much is just hand waved in this that could go horribly wrong and cause fission/unknown physical reactions on a regular basis.

*** Good point, this can't be how things disappear after 24 hours or no Doris would consume anything they haven't held onto for 24 hours for fear of poisoning. There's no other way to know if someone is giving you duplicated food or water, which if they just vanished after 24 hours would wreck your biology. I'm assuming magic prevents disappearing chemistry bombs and disappearing poisoning.

** I don't think WtC Universe operates like that. It seems to be simulated only on very rough level with some kind of intent-based option to change it into some other level (see for example Juniper's fight with Onion, where he evaded attacks he could not have knowledge about, because /he had skill for that/).

When you have some stuff and want to do chemistry to it, the system checks whether it is permissible and if so, the reaction happens. Otherwise, the elements just don't do anything interesting. Normal people don't usually need chemistry on daily basis - they need to eat not to replenish supply of chemical elements of their bodies, but because they are hungry (they just have a stat called /hunger/; when it is empty, their stat /health/ starts to decrease). When you eat non-permanent food of duplicated Doris, after a day part of your body probably /would not/ disappear - you hunger would just suddenly increase as if you hadn't eaten anything.

In your case, I would expect that after you react non-permanent magnesium with permanent oxygen and hydrogen, some part of the resulting substance (but not the components of the substance) will disappear - I would go with conservation of mass, but only DM knows for sure. So, if you started with 1 kg of Mg(OH)2 (molar mass 58,3), and your magnesium (molar mass 24,3) would cease to exist, you would end up with (1 - 24,3 / 58,3) * 1kg = *0,58 kg of Mg(OH)2* and no explosion.
