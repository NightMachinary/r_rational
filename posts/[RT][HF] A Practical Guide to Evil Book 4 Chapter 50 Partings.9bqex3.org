** So that was an entertaining round of Fae politics. Is there a term for that? Murderolitics? Insanocracy?

Also: “Be careful not to provoke anyone you are not capable of killing,” he instructed me gently.

AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

edit: Well, time to update the TVTropes quote page with this gem "Gods, did she intend to gossip with Akua Sahelian? This was surreal even by my standards, and I'd turned into fucking mist this week."

edit 2: Goddamn can we just name this best chapter already? I mean, Jesus!

  I rarely drank. Enough to prove I'd obtained the correct antidote, but it was never my sin of choice.
#+end_quote

Akua in a single sentence. Doing a ton of shit she didn't care about just to keep up with social expectations. I would bet that even her fling with Fasili was merely a way to keep him happy at the moment he was most useful. No wonder she wanted to end the world and watch it burn.

Also, Indrani didn't repeat herself once when calling her names. That's some GSGT Hartman shit right there.

  Hakram, that gossipy bitch.
#+end_quote

Scott Pilgrim reference? Even if it isn't, it made me laugh!

Judging by the comments I keep reading, I feel like I'm one of the few not shipping Cat with Vivienne (or gunning for some odd threesome or foursome among the girls). Wasn't it established that she's straight? I honestly would like Cat best with Hakram... They already love each other, Cat is bisexual, Hakram's amorous, and physiological differences between species aren't really a problem when your body is a concept. Hell, Cat could probably glamour up some tusks to get Hakram's motor running if her flat cow teeth turn him off too much!

Anyway, good chapter, nice cliff, and a plus that EE dispelled the confusion about "dark elves." I wonder why the term stuck if drow aren't elves and don't really look like them?

** Cat pursuing Viv blindsided me, I must be exceptionally oblivious.

Or maybe she's just been more subtle about it than with Kilian, because /that/ was telegraphed almost the moment they met.

Edit: Of course, come to think of it, that was as much Kilian's work as Cat's.

*** Some of that may be self denial. From Book 4 Chapter 4: Warpath, during Thief's informal debriefing before Procer crossed the Stairway:

#+begin_quote
  “I'd kiss you, if you weren't so painfully indifferent to women,” I replied with a smirk.

  She coughed awkwardly. I had no intentions there whatsoever, but seeing her get jittery at the lightest of suggestions was always good for a laugh.

*** It's especially validating to see other characters (e.g. Cat and Archer) acknowledging it as Masego's intrinsic orientation, rather than treating it as an obstacle to be overcome.

'Course, I'll be happiest when I start seeing more ace characters with varied personality types--including warm, socially adept, emotionally expressive aces--rather than hyper-focused ultranerd research dudes every time. But ace Masego is worlds better than no ace, and Masego is a really fun character regardless.

***** I guess I sort of wish it didn't follow from his character as much--I don't want to feel like he's ace /because/ he's not very social and prioritizes his research above human contact and physical urges, since of course in reality any personality type can coincide with an ace orientation, and he'd still be ace if he abandoned magic tomorrow. That said, I don't have any inherent problem with ace characters who are like Masego, I'm just looking forward to a future where that's only one of a wide variety of ace personalities represented in fiction.
