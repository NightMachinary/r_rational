** Something that I noticed is that many of these ideas are only good if the Evil Overlord exists in a universe that is recognized as operating according to specific genre conventions.

I believe that it would be very interesting to see an Evil Overlord list for a more realistic universe where the genre conventions are not quite as blatant or overpowering. Does anyone have some ideas for this?

One interesting example of this is found in HPMOR when Quirrel discusses how he learned to turn into a snake following the guidelines of his own list which dictated that he should become an animagus. I found this to be amusing as it makes a lot of sense within the setting but runs into complete conflict with Rule 34 of the Evil Overlord List

*** The other thing I liked about HPMOR's take was when Quirrell pointed out that it's not actually enough to just have a bunch of snappy rules. In real life there are tradeoffs to various approaches.

#+begin_quote
  It is only by harsh experience that we learn which principles take priority over which other principles; as mere words they all sound equally persuasive. In retrospect it would have been better if I had sent Bellatrix to the Potters' home in my place; but I had a Rule telling me that for such matters I must go myself and not try sending a trusted lieutenant. Yes, I considered the Killing Curse; but I wondered if casting the Killing Curse at an infant would somehow cause the curse to bounce off and hit me, thus fulfilling the prophecy. How was I to know?

**** It doesn't mention trade offs - just that you have to learn from experience/experiment, because when all you have is the uniform distribution as a prior, that's all you can do - and if you don't have the information you need when/before you need it, then you're doomed. 'Test the rules to find out which ones are most important, and always be prepared to learn.'

>! It's not clear whether he could have learned those things in advance or couldn't have. In those cases, the lesson seems to be, respectively!<

'figure stuff out before you need it' (by doing stuff, testing, empiricism, etc.)

or

'you can only learn big lessons by doing big things. Failure is your teacher, and if you don't give it your all, eventually your illusion of control/superiority (via holding back, not risking failure, not being honest with yourself about what you're doing) will be shattered and you will fail, when a bunch of lessons you didn't learn come crashing down on you all at once (as soon as the context switches). If you're not failing and changing things and learning as fast as you can, then your enemies may grow to defeat you in your comfortable equilibrium. If you stop growing, then you're half dead.[1]'

>! [2]In a way, the story as a whole can be taken as, 'your blind spots will kill you.' !<

** Fuck, the “files padded to 1.45 MB” really dates this list. These days, there isn't even a practical way to do that; it's a solution to a problem that kinda can't exist anymore with how storage technology evolved.

**** A floppy disk is 1.44 MB of storage space. Padding files out means that no one can “download your secret plans” onto a floppy.

***** 1.44MB? 1.44MB?! Ha!

You were one of those high-tech evil overlords, with all your namby-pamby, super-advanced 3.5" floppies, weren't you? Had everything so easy. Back when /I/ was conquering my first tribe of orcs our floppies were 5.25" and 512k! And we /liked/ it!

*** You could run all your equipment on proven reliable 40 year old hardware. The heroes probably won't have compatible hardware to download your dastardly deeds or even interface with it properly. Their gadgeteer genius could probably haxxors their way into all the latest and greatest things but get stymied by such archaic equipment.
