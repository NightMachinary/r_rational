** This is a look into the philosophy and methodology of the Center for Applied Rationality. This video is about the fact that rationality tools and techniques exist, and why it is important to use them, and how CFAR attempts to spread them.

This video is not a vehicle to display rationality tools and techniques. I'd assumed it was from the title, and I was disappointed. But if you know what to expect, it's interesting enough.

** Does he mention math? I tend to find the best "rationality technique" for any domain is to actually learn the damn maths.
