** Is this Count Zatkel's first appearance in the story? If so, that was an /excellent/ introduction. Yay intelligent opponents!

Does anyone remember Ami's capabilities in wraith form? I really do not recall the mechanics exposition from the early story. Either way, presumably her warlocks can teleport her in help when they notice her situation.

Regardless, good to see that the ridiculously foolhardy plan did not work out flawlessly. Up till this point everything was seeming far too easy

** I wonder how the prisoner mechanic works on objects, does wrapping ones "shadow" around a ward make it yours?
