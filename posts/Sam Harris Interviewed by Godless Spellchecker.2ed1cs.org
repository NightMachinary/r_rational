**** Seems pretty self-explanatory.

"Muslims are all vicious and evil psychopaths who should be killed! Liberals need to act more like evangelical conservatives in their treatment of Muslims! Muslims need to be warred with because they're not peaceful like us!"

Because drone strikes on six different Muslim countries, supporting the Sharia Law of Saudi Arabia for 60 years, destroying Iran's democracy, and the pointless war in Iraq all aren't grievances enough.

***** As a matter of fact, geopolitics and antiracist politics contain large inferential distances. "This sounds Islamophobic, therefore it's most likely wrong" requires explanation, especially given how Islam is wrong and most people don't know our saying about reversed stupidity.

Also, there's all the other shit he says about science and philosophy, much of which is /sophisticatedly/ wrong.

****** I've only read two of Harris' blog posts, and the youtube video seems to have been removed, so could you elaborate a little on his insanity/sophisticated incorrectness or provide links? From what little I've seen he makes many points similar to things one might see on LessWrong.

****** It's simple, what he says is pointblank falsifications about why Islam is supposedly still in some draconian era.

The middle class of Afghanistan was doing fine in the 1950s, then the U.S. funded the Mujaheddin in the 1970s, used UNICEF to teach Afghan children a puritanical and barbaric version of Islam that was heavily encouraged and approved by Congress and the U.S. military, and it's highly suspected that the U.S. gave them intelligence cables too (which is how they evaded U.S. intelligence and committed 9/11 in the first place) because the U.S. sealed the records of how much intelligence was given to them.

Now, the Afghans still live in a third-world country and it's all the U.S.'s fault. Al Qaeda's entire religious philosophy was invented by the U.S. military.

Now we have this dumbass Atheist extremist who just happens to be espousing military rhetoric in the guise of atheism. Even if you think religion is stupid, how the fuck can anyone /rationally/ believe that warring with religious people who war all the time is the *right* answer?
