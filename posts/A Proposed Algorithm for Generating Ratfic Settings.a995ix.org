1. Walk into/browse to an occult/"new age"/"magickal" bookseller/subreddit of your choice.
2. With as little regard to title, author, or subject as possible, pick up the first book that catches your eye.
3. Open to a random page, and read the approximately 300 words immediately following your initial focus as you open the book.
4. [optional] Keep reading until some combination of rage, boredom, amusement, disdain, or inability-to-even reach an arbitrarily chosen critical threshold.
5. Your new ratfic setting is a world where the phenomenon you've just read about is empirically verifiable and documented in multiple reputably-peer-reviewed journals, has observable upstream causes in the laws of physics, and supports downstream phenomena (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_electromagnetism][electromagnetism results from special relativity]]), all also empirically verified. Incoherent phenomena (oh yes you will find internally inconsistent in the space of 300 words phenomena doing this) are still in-bounds--an incoherent territory just produces an incoherent map, and sad positivists.
6. EDIT: for hard mode, the phenomena is _theoretically_ verifiable, but hasn't been, yet, and/or exhibits experimental weirdness such as strong anthropic effects or nonlocal interactions that are difficult to control for.

Content warning: compared to most of this stuff, canon Harry Potter is already a ratfic.

This isn't a troll post, I promise. Ha Ha Only Serious--I'm actually very curious what this method would produce.

*** If the skull maintains a mostly consistent thickness as it wraps around the brain, its bumps on the outside correspond to small pockets of additional space on the inside - space which the growing infant brain expands to use. In this way, the causal arrow goes from minor variations in skull formation to brain capability and personality, not the other way around. The first experiments done to prove this involved intentionally adding volume by deforming young childrens' soft skulls, specializing their future brain development. Increasingly capable phrenologist surgeons can create hyperspecialized infants or apply desired personality modifications to entire groups. Some mental traits (those that correspond to regions not on the easily guided exterior of the brain) have remained impossible to manipulate for most of recorded history, but new surgical techniques allow for early brain growth to be guided to give more or less room to specific internal regions. Other new surgical techniques may have found a way to trick the brain into expanding to fill an artificially constructed cavity four or five times its original volume. The hope is that such an augmented brain will be able to create techniques to create a further augmented brain, and so on, and this will definitely go very well and nothing will go catastrophically wrong.

The starting point was reached when the Flathead tribe of Native Americans was encountered by European explorers. Though genetically identical to surrounding tribes, and no less similar to the European explorers, their society exhibited a unification unseen in the rest of the world. European scientists immediately began exploring the concept in new directions and Phrenology was born.

But the tradition of using a headboard to control the growth of the forehead produced a people whose capacity and propensity for certain thought patterns was shockingly uniform. Though they'd not experienced the inventive upheaval of the European enlightenment that was leading to accelerating rates of technological discovery, their unity allowed them to conquer their continent, and successfully repel the settlers from across the Atlantic. While European technologists were creating new generations of specialized people to fit the new industrial revolution concept of a division of labor, the Flatheads had created a society so dedicated to the same mindset that they saw similar gains in productivity and societal power through their induced harmony. Keeping up in technology often by stealing the inventions of the artificially more inventive Europeans, they remained a formidable world power.

Naturally this massive divide in philosophy between two sides of the world led to a world conflict. Those who were unified valued their unity and demanded others unite with them. Those who were specialized valued their specialization and demanded that others specialize. Both saw the other as a disgusting affront to morality. How could you force children to all become the same person? How could you force children to all be alien to each other?

The twist came as both sides petitioned the Asian countries to ally with them, and to everyone's surprise this created a third side in the conflict. How, they replied, can you force children to be anything they aren't already? Conformity and specialization are both abhorrent. They're both a moral affront to personhood. And so the conflict became truly global as each of three idealists failed to accept the value of the others.

*** Actual homeopathic practices care about the intent and mindset of the person mixing the water, which means the universe where homeopathy works doesn't actually diverge from the universe we live in until minds exist.

It also breaks reductionism, hard: there are physical laws that specifically care about human minds and seem to act on human terms. But it's still a well-defined universe; it's not immediately self-contradictory, just absurdly unlikely.

So: water, specifically, has an extra property of memory^{*}, which is a weighted reference to a specific chemical structure. Diluting a substance in water produces a tiny amount of memory-weight for that substance. Diluting water in more water normally averages out the memory, (so natural water has basically no memory,) but when this happens it checks the chain of causality backwards for somewhere between five and thirty minutes (this has been surprisingly hard to experimentally nail down), and if it was caused by human intention, it instead spreads the intended compound's weight to the other water with /higher/ weight, up to 10x the volume and 10x the weight. Returns drop off dramatically if you try to dilute more than 10x, so of course chemists do this in multiple stages.

I'd like to point out that, since I haven't actually introduced a way to interact with memory-weight yet, we could be living in the universe I just described and there's no way you can disprove it. The next line will change that.

Water inside a human body, specifically, acts as a reverse-catalyst of any chemical it remembers, but only if that person knows what the chemical is. That is, chemical reactions that would be triggered by the remembered chemical but not use atoms from it will happen in reverse at a rate proportionate to the memory-weight.

When this was first discovered, people naturally tried chain-diluting various toxic substances. Some of these worked, notably most antivenoms, though until the correct dilution ratios were discovered, homeopathic antivenoms were frequently more dangerous than the venoms they treated. Many but by no means all medicines work on homeopathic principles, and these days few of them still work on "like cures like" even though this is still taught in grade school level texts. One notable drug is the miracle diet-drug homeopathic amylase, which can (but shouldn't) be mixed in your home using spit, and will let you eat sugary foods without gaining weight, but which also has dangerous side effects when administered in the wrong dose. There have also been terrorist attacks using homeopathic poisons (just about any homeopathic substance can be brewed to a lethal dose), but their effectiveness has been limited by the 10x volume rule and the need to inform would-be victims of what the poison is.

(Now feel free to find amusing ways to break this.)

***** Not sure. All my knowledge about Homeopathy came from Wikipedia and was filtered through my own expectation that it's probably not actually as stupid as it sounds, but also probably doesn't work to any intellectually honest degree.

So roleplaying as a believer a bit: The reason "like cures like" is that your body has existing adaptive defences against poison and disease, but they don't work if your first encounter with a threat kills you as they need time to learn. So controlled exposure to something dangerous lets your defenses adapt without putting you at serious risk. That the mixture's potency increases with dilution is a misconception, the reality is that a more potent agent must be diluted more to bring it into the proper range to train your defenses without harming you.

Beneficial substances usually don't provoke the same defensive responce, so you won't be in danger from limited exposure, though over use of beneficial substances (like most "mainstream" medicine) can cause your defences against what the medicine cures to atrophy leading to dependence. But that won't happen with homeopathic concentrations of even beneficial substances.

But that's the essence of homeopathy. There are legitimate things that work the way you described - vaccines, to begin with, and "mithridatism", aka poison immunity acquired through small doses of the same poisons. Homeopathy instead relies on two ideas:

- looking at symptoms, not root causes: so to cure e.g. a cold you'll take a toxin, /any/ toxin, that would cause the same effects as the cold. It doesn't matter if it's the thing that actually causes it.

- dilution increases potency: this is the really wacky part. Modern practitioners try to justify this with some mumbo-jumbo about quantum mechanics and water memory, which is the idea that I brought up above. If you removed this, you'd have a relatively legitimate medical principle, and then there would be no magic at all to munchkin.

(as a matter of fact, yes, it absolutely /is/ as stupid as it sounds. More, in fact. The original inventor of homeopathy recommended practices such as shaking the mixtures on top of a Bible. And one of the most popular homeopathic 'remedies', Oscillococcinum, is literally an extreme dilution of a bacterium that doesn't exist: its inventor only thought he had discovered a micro-organism when all he was seeing was bubbles in his microscope)

******* To clarify, I doubt you will find any actual seller of homeopathic remedies, or believer in homeopathy who is willing to defend the claim that diluting a substance makes it stronger in the general sense. Quackery tends to either appeal to common sense or encourage repeat business. Diluting things making them stronger doesn't do either.

I'd expect them to have an explanation for why the effectiveness of the remedy is separate from the potency in the conventional sense. And that THAT is the whole thing behind the "water memory" woo. Rather than an explanation of why some easily observable fact is wrong.

It's the difference between:

I put a drop of beer in this keg of water thereby making a keg of the strongest beer ever!

and

I took a drop of beer, then diluted it according the the proper practices thereby making a remedy (no longer containing any alcohol) which will cure your whisky hangover. I can also mix a stronger version that will also work for migraines but that costs extra.

I wouldn't be so sure. I don't hang out with quacks very often, but see for yourself what the website of Boiron, the main company in the field, has to say on the matter:

[[https://www.boironusa.com/education-training/faq/]]

********* Reading that FAQ I'd say it supports my point regarding people not actually believing the dilution=stronger thing. Or at least, in the seller not being willing to make said claim.

In several questions they state that any undesirable properties of the original substance are absent from a diluted mixture. They also claim the dilution process is transforming the solution into a medecine, and they are (I suspect deliberlty) vague about what actual change in properties facilitates different levels of dilution being suitable for different symptoms. It would be posible for example to read that explanation an interpret the dilution process as a way to selectively remove undesirable properties from the solution by somehow protecting the desirable properties from the normal weakening caused by diluting them. In which case each dilution makes the remedy "purer" not "stronger".

They did take a different approach to explaining why the dilution is important than I did in my RP. Theirs is probably a bit more resilient in that somone who knows math could call mine out by proving the concentrations recommended can't have any active ingredient and my explanation required there to be some active ingredient. Theirs makes fewer falsifiable claims which makes it better woo.

Your idea of it being interpreted as a purification certainly makes sense, but while it does avoid saying outright that "more diluted = more powerful", probably because of how counter-intuitive and stupid that sounds, it does imply it.

Anyway, I guess to make some world-building out of this you would have to tweak a bit the rules. When the way it works is by definition "it only has positive effects, no negatives" that's basically cheating.

However you're assuming that Homeopathy harms the pathogen. Homeopathy is suppsoed to actually act on symptoms. If you remove all the negative symptoms that pathogen causes, you also remove the need to get rid of it. Humans have a number of benign microfauna living inside them normally what's one more?

Anyway you're also assuming that the remedy directly harms the pathogen rather than via a second or higher order consequence. When in a competitive environment things need not be so direct.

For example consider two colonies of microbes (call them A and B). They compete for food and have evolved symmetrical but distinct chemical agents such that each colony can tolerate its own toxin but can't tolerate the other colony's toxin.

Now, We introduce a homeopathic remedy to inoculate microbes against colony A's toxin. Both colonies (considered independently) get a purely beneficial effect with no side effects. However the consequences of making colony B immune to Colony A's toxin without also making Colony A immune to Colony B's is likely the extinction of Colony A as Colony B can now invade Colony A's territory and push Colony A out.
