*** Ugh, Uriel is clearly such a bad software engineer. 'ruby for rails for /the databases/'? He's been clearly just following the latest fads at the time, ActiveModel is decent but surely not worth the maintenance price pulling in such a huge dependency. Next thing he'll say is he's running it using MongoDB 'because of the scale'.

I'm not surprised the entire thing is falling apart.

+The image appears to have 11 nodes. Also, I count 9 green connections, 3 blue connections, 6 yellow connections, 3 purple connections, 4 rose connections, which tallies to 25 total connections in the image used? Some letters appear repeated for no reason? Maybe the connection runs under the central nodes and and counts as one connection somehow, and the diagonal pink connections count as one also, in which case the count could be as low as 21 connections? I don't don't kabbalah, though, so I don't know if there is some sense in which some of those connections 'should' be counted as the 'same'? Maybe the joke here is that Uriel's many problems include the fact that he makes many errors, including basic arithmetic errors?+

This seems like a different understanding of Astronomy than one that was based on crystal spheres? Also, I guess they defined away Pluto earlier than the 2006 that we did - that, or maybe a planet (perhaps Pluto) was taken over by the Comet King and rammed into Hell or something or otherwise destroyed?

** I'd like to bring up the use of the word machine. I'm not sure it was intentional but using that phrasing reminded me of a conversation I had with a CS professor the other day. He was arguing for that math in our current form may not be universally useful. I think he was mostly talking about our postulates which I can definitely agree with though I disagree on the larger argument, but regardless, he brought up computational machines as a possible explanation for how the laws of physics might differ. essentially there are various math mathematically perfect machines used to help understand computation. There are certain classes of problems that can only be solved by certain machines, for example finite-state machines while perfectly capable of answer questions like the validity of a string regarding some sets of roles can't solve any problems that require counting (at least counting beyond a predefined value). He argued that you could have a universe simulated on a computational machine which makes it impossible to solve certain problems which would obviously impact the usefulness of math. I wonder if this is what Uriel is talking about when he describes the machine. What ever he was simulating on top of it then would be a more limited machine which makes me wonder what, if any, new problems can now be solved with the programming starting to break down.

*** Sounds like your professor was describing super-turing computation. If he doesn't know that's what he's describing, you might want to point him in that direction.

Generally you can imagine super-turing as a regular turing machine with one or more computation oracles. For example, something that solves the halting problem.

**** I think he's probably aware, he has a bit of a language issue I believe though because he's not a native English speaker (German) so he may not be using exactly the right phrasing. I think he was mostly thinking about sub Turing machines if that is the right word, though that may have been to help me understand better as I really don't see any way you could have a creature capable of doing math simulated on a machine that can't be used to simulate a Turing machine.

******** Fair. I'd be happy with a citation (even a non-mathy one), though.

I'm suspicious of your claim because there seem to be computability classes that include an uncomputable function =f(x)= but not compositions of it, like =f(x) + f(x')=. A oracle machine that can computer =f(x)= (whether by =f= being an oracle of not), seems to necessarily also be able to compute =f(x) + f(x')=.

************ Consider a super-Turing machine defined to be a normal Turing machine augmented with this extra one-cycle computation:

- Read the tape as the description for a program in some encoding. Replace the tape with 1 if the program described halts and 0 otherwise. Then halt.

Call the computability class of this machine H.

Consider also the /weakest/ possible oracle machine who's computability class includes H. Call this H+.

It seems to me that a decision problem:

#+begin_quote
  Does the given input describe a Turing machine that does /not/ halt?
#+end_quote

Is not computable in H but is computable in H+. Proving the former claim seems nontrivial, but proving the later consists only of taking the oracle machine for the inverse problem (aka. the halting problem) and replacing its halt state with one that first inverses the output.
