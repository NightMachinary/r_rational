Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** So... is there anyone else here with depression? It would be nice to discuss experiences and coping strategies with folks that like to think things through.

*** Not currently, but depression and I have a long history that goes way back. For me, it was mostly a two-pronged strategy.

The first prong was not getting depressed in the first place; the strategies for that were exercise, eating right, avoiding stressful situations to the extent that was feasible, keeping my immediate surroundings clean, and doing my best to cut off any downward spirals. You probably have your own triggers for depression, or conditions which make you more likely to become depressed, so watch for those and try to avoid them.

The second prong was coping with depression once it arrived. That's the more difficult of the two, because you have such a limited amount of finite willpower with which to get /anything/ done. For me, doing small things that I actually have the willpower to accomplish helps. Like, maybe that pit of apathy is going to prevent me from going out with friends. Maybe I just don't have the brain chemicals necessary to get my laundry done either. But there's got to be /something/ small that I can do in-between episodes of my fourteen hour TV-watching marathon. This is basically "strategic use of willpower". If you can use whatever scraps you find more effectively, you can start digging out of a hole that you're in, or at least accomplish enough that you can get to the next day without your life falling apart in the meantime. (This largely depends on how bad your depression is and what's causing it; I was in a mental hospital for a while and I know there were people there who would probably could never get out of their depression spiral no matter what coping strategies they employed.)

Oh, and it probably goes without saying that seeing a therapist/psychiatrist should be on the list of things to do.

**** I think I recall you mentioning that you're soon to become a father. After reading that post, I feel inclined to warn you about the possibility of postpartum depression on your part. From what I remember reading on the topic a few years back, if it hits, it tends to last for years, clearing up around when the firstborn hits 4 or 5. That was my own experience as well. I've never had a problem with depression before or since, but I spent an infuriating number of hours during those first few years dealing with relentlessly nihilistic depression that seemed /obviously/ "outside influence". I've just realized that my best friend is dealing with it too. His daughter is 3, so hopefully it'll clear up for him soon. But I really don't know how it would impact someone with a history with depression.

Just something that might be worth looking into, for the sake of preparedness.

I know my 18 month have helped a lot.

Next you have to find your individual triggers:

for me its not eating well- so spend money on snacks/fast food/eating out.

External stressors: eg. bills I am unable to open will accumulate huge stress, so if it gets too bad I mail my psychosocial service here in town and they will open them for me.

Another thing I do is withdrawal from people; after about 4-5 days of not talking to anyone I'll start to get a bit loony as well.

My constant-chip-on-his-fucking-shoulder is actually my way of coping with my bipolarity-type issues. You see, when I get manic, which is almost never, I can pour it into DRILL TO THE HEAVENS, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM, and when I get depressed, which is reasonably often, I can pour it into NO MATTER WHAT'S IN MY WAY, I WON'T STOP, AND ONCE I'VE DUG THROUGH, IT MEANS THAT I'VE WON.

Because yes, [[http://mindingourway.com/see-the-dark-world/][I can see all the fucking problems]], but I am NOT going to fucking break down instead of FUCKING DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

My girlfriend is currently suffering a crying/panic/asthma attack over how her abusive job that makes her work way too fucking much and makes her feel inadequate and stressed-out all the time. She seems to have gone to sleep now, though. In the morning she will have to get up and go work in the lab. And on Sunday.

*** In my case, it's anxiety as much as depression. I'm actually doing much better right now than I was a month ago, thanks to therapy, loving and supportive parents, and 75mg of venlafaxine daily. Time will tell if my happy mood keeps up once the treatment's over.

Eating a balanced diet, sleeping on time, and exercising at least 3 times a week is more important than it seems. Depression is a chemical problem as much as anything else.

I tend to procrastinate wildly because I'm too stressed to work, and then stress out because I haven't done any work. The vicious circle is obvious. So focus on doing things as soon as you can, to avoid starting the downward spiral. As yourself "What is the benefit of doing this work later instead of now?" Usually there is no benefit, so get started. You'll slip up sometimes, and when that happens you shouldn't be afraid to get a helping hand with things you don't have the willpower to do alone.

"Thinking things through" can be a bad thing. Perfectionism and overthinking are a major source of anxiety. Your work doesn't have to be perfect on the first draft. Don't be afraid to say yes, don't be afraid to screw up, don't be afraid to apologise. Depression makes you pessimistic; understand that bias and counterbalance it by being deliberately naïve and optimistic.

Friends like to help. Do not think you are doing them a favour by keeping quiet about your condition or avoiding contact. They will worry about you anyway, and they might imagine something terrible has happened to you. *Talk to people.* If you do nothing else in this comment, talk to an old friend or family member (even if it's someone you haven't spoken to in years), tell them about your difficulties, and then take their advice. Do not be afraid of looking silly. That is a small price to pay in any circumstance.

Socially, in casual conversation people will ignore or forget 90% of what you say anyway. You can say the first coherent thing that comes into your head and it'll help move the conversation along. Don't think you're a boring person, because you're not.

Any particular questions?

So I'll just say this: I'm a scientist. Do you know what that means? It means I believe in what works. If crystals healed people I would want them in every hospital curing cancer with amethysts. If reiki hands could cure people there would be scientists at the front lines figuring out how best to maximise energy flow. If rotating your chakras while feeling relaxed let you commune with nature in a measurable way then I would be reading papers as scientists argued about the best direction to spin them and categorising the most soothing types of herbal tea.

Demonstrate that you're more than a crackpot convinced of an incorrect theory, and I'll believe you. Till then, there are 20 dozen other people out there with just as much proof as you have from where I'm sitting, so you get just as much belief as they get.

Show me something that crystal healers can't.

******** Oh my god, every time with the preaching and the misunderstanding science and the not so subtle insults and the misdirection and the high handed mannerisms like you're holding some kind of high ground where you're clearly right and everyone else is plebs for doubting your glorious word even though you just can't be bothered to actually point to whatever nebulous things will back up your claims.

I said show me something the crystal healers /can't/. Anyone can make a documentary. I can show you documentaries that make it look like mermaids are real and I can show you documentaries that 'prove' that we're all getting chemtrailed. It is not a good standard of proof.

So, since you clearly don't understand what scientific proof is in this context let me explain it to you. I'll walk you through the whole deal. What you do, is you give however many people hypnotherapy and you give a similar number nothing and a third group some other random treatment from a convincing seeming guy and you give the rest some other thing and see who comes out best. Then if you end up with 10 cases of spontaneous remission or whatever it is you're trying to achieve and they all end up with 5 then you win. Pretty fucking simple if your deal isn't bullshit.

And then everyone's like 'oh look at this guy, he has an interesting result. We should try to see if we can reproduce it.' And then they do. And then a few years later you have a huge pile of evidence on your side and you get recognised as a branch of medicine and it's all hunky dory. But you apparently don't, because that video is from 2006 and by now you should have at least 10 years worth of evidence sitting in a nice pretty pile, but you don't. Or at least, you refuse to point to your pile of evidence which is essentially the same thing from where I'm sitting.

It's really not that hard. Normal therapy vs your therapy: a dude just rings up all your ex patients and also a bunch of conventional ex-patients and a bunch of ex-patients from something we know is bullshit and quizzes them about how they feel before and after therapy. Then if you do better than normal therapy everyone will sing your praises and if you don't, they won't.

Quit saying science doesn't understand because neurology is hard when what's happening is you don't understand that neurology is not the relevant field for proving your claims.

Imagine two worlds: one where the thing works and one where the thing doesn't. In both worlds I would expect to see convinced therapists. In both worlds I can expect to see documentaries. In both worlds I could see a singular study in favour. In only one world do I see a plurality of studies showing that the thing works, and that is the world that the thing works in.

Being able to ask about things you've seen posted may make awkward conversations with family, or sort-of-friends you'd like to upgrade somewhat easier. And it's a fairly easy way to contact someone without needing to keep up to date on a phone number, or email address.

But if you're concerned about what facebook sells, avoid putting it on your phone altogether, and forget messenger. The list of required permissions is just deranged. There's no legitimate need for the app to use a quarter of it.

** OK, I feel like I should do some proselytizing for my other hobby.

Chess has an image as an intellectual game, but the most /rational/ game of note is *Bridge.* So if you are looking for an interesting game and willing to devote the necessary time, look no further.

1) It deals with incomplete information. Nobody can see all of the cards, but each player can see 1/4 (or 1/2, after the auction). So you have communication, but on a channel where the enemy is listening. (By the laws of bridge, your communication cannot be encrypted).

1a) There is luck. Good play is usually, but not always rewarded. This makes for a much more interesting game, IMO. I have played in (short) matches against Nat'l and world champions and while I usually lose, I don't always. (I'd be unlikely to win a full day match, obviously). And as someone who has read lots of bridge and chess, bridge has much more interesting stories.

2) Of all of the traditional games I know, it's the only one where Bayes' law comes up routinely. See the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice][wikipedia article on Restricted Choice]]. In fact, the card play is highly rational, but also has the cut and thrust because the defenders use their cards to signal, but must decide (independently) when to signal correctly, randomly, or lie, and each side must consider the potential layout of the cards he needs, and if they are consistent with the bidding.

As a downside, it does take considerable experience to become comfortable, much less competent, with the game.

  The problem is simple prejudice. There is nothing particularly epistemologically heinous about cryonics.

These ideas include much of what constitutes religion, philosophy, ethics, history, and art, as well as much of what goes into ordinary planning for the future. A person who had never entertained an idea that was not immediately testable (i.e., scientific) would be in a sad way indeed.

I am far more concerned about the organizations sticking around, the process actually preserving information, and preventing failures long term. I don't have a good, precise estimates, but I do think that's where most of the "cryonics is a wasted effort" probability mass lies.

Neither seems to be clearly superior to the other. Alcor is more expensive, but if you are paying via life insurance, it is mostly inconsequential. I do not have a good reason for choosing CI, and I do not believe one exists, unless maybe you live close to the facilities of one or the other. I think I might have actually flipped a coin.

If I had chosen Alcor and you asked me the same question, I'd give the same answer. It is easy to invent reasons post hoc based on positive affect, rationalizing it as something more substantial. I try to make it a habit not to do that.

Also; I believe there is a strong tendency among intellectual types to over-analyze options, and forget that not deciding is also a decision with consequences. A majority of those I have met in the rationalist community are "considering" signing up for cryonics, snd have been doing so for /years/ at this point.

As a general heuristic, I have found that it is usually far better to make /any/ decision under consideration than to procrastinate, waiting for more information or a better alternative. Absolute worst case, you should be able to spend an hour or two researching details, maybe sleep on it, maybe seek council from trusted others who have been in similar situations. Then go with your system 1's judgement, and don't look back. If you take a positive EV gamble and lose, do not be upset at yourself for making a winning decision.

Hence, making either choice is better than making neither.

** Is there an actually effective way to improve attention span and/or working memory?

I can pay attention to tasks for a very short period of time and I never reach 'full' concentration like some people do; at the same time I'm a bad multitasker because it's hard to me to pay attention to every thing I have to think about/hold in my working memory. Also, I've noticed that I often intuitively figure out a a problem/make an observation, but I can't concentrate on the observation enough to further analyze it.

The only thing that has somewhat helped me were SSREs I'm alleviating my depression/aboulia with, but it's still serious enough to interfere with my functioning, and no generic exercises have helped me at all.

*** Although I don't have any suggestions, I do have the same, or similar, troubles and it's mostly ADHD related for me. However, I'm unsure whether the difficulties with analysis of intuitive observations are related to ADHD, though I do experience the same. Beyond not knowing every symptom of ADHD offhand, it's difficult for me to know whether that one is not instead a symptom of something else, or simply the way I would function anyway. Aside from ADHD, for which I have been diagnosed and medicated properly, it's likely that I suffer from mild Aspergers and mild depression -- neither of which I've sought diagnosis for. The former due to my twin being diagnosed and a small number of specific symptoms I've noticed in myself. Depression isn't something I can say with certainty I've experienced and it's probably not worth going into here.

Other than the similarities of your troubles and mine, specifically with concentration, I also experience hyperfocus, where I concentrate fully on one thing and don't absorb external stimuli well. This usually only occurs when I'm very interested in the task (reading, gaming, sometimes programming). Distractions from hyperfocus make it difficult, often frustrating, to return to the task.

***** Stress, hardship and a lack of options basically. I don't have any particular strategies that I use or any deep analysis that might help. My main advantage was having someone else devote their time to help me and getting used to / feeling trapped in a 9-5 job. I'm in a situation where I'm aware of my past failures and find the prospect of repeating them so unbearable that most of the time I don't have any choice but to keep on track. I probably should identify better strategies to use for various aspects of life, but I'm doing well enough (top of my class and the candidate for employers seeking students for employment) that it's not a priority for the moment.

My main driving factors: About 6 or 7 years ago I left the same level of programming course I'm doing now for reasons including: the relevant undiagnosed ADHD reasons, security of a privileged childhood, my prior lack of having to study to pass subjects and all my other bad habits and flaws. Worked four years in a job I didn't mind for my father who I (much of the time) hated. I now have the amazing support of my partner, who helped me recognize my ADHD symptoms as such, get medication and then supervised me to keep me attentive while I studied my ass off three nights or more a week for four months to re-learn everything I'd known about programming and more. I don't need supervision anymore. I moved with my partner away from my family, my remaining (non-problematic) friends and everything else to get myself and my partner out of bad living situations, to enter my course, to afford life in a cheaper city, etc. I kept the newfound, near complete absence of a social life to avoid distraction, but wow I miss weekly tabletop gaming. The move cost me all of my savings (gradually), most of my partner's savings and finding a job hasn't worked with the course load (which is above what is typical for this level course). Both of us are on minimum welfare support, less payment of debt left in my partner's name by family. The only good options if I fail include moving in with family, the most appropriate of which lives far outside an isolated rural town. My partner, for various reasons, is actually closer to miserable now than before. Getting through my course and getting a secure job feels like the only / best thing I can do to help, and all that does is free up time and money so I can use them to learn how to better support them.

So, yeah. Not an ideal way to manage symptoms.

I have mild Aspergers as well. Since your experience seems /very/ similar to mine, I'd guess I'm going to have to get evaluated for ADD/ADHD again (I was diagnosed with it as a child, and it was basically a handwave to explain my somewhat atypical development; when i was slightly older i was told I don't have it).

I think my attention issues may stem at least partially from persistent stress and anxiety, since it had gotten a little tiny bit better near the end of spring break, and returning to school made it worse again, but I don't see why I couldn't have ADHD as well, especially since it's often comorbid with autism spectrum disorders.

** The actions we take are dictated by a number of factors. Most of us can agree that we are not rational all of the time. There are times when we act or feel in an irrational manner, despite the fact that we may /consciously/ realize we are being irrational.

Prime Example. Fear. Personally, I know that fear isn't very useful to me. Caution, sure. But the feeling of fear, of ice in your stomach and nervous butterflies, sweaty hands, etc. is mostly useless. I know this rationally. But that doesn't help me in scary situations. And I don't mean viscerally scary situations, like being confronted by an angry bear, or being trapped in a burning building. I mean situations like going into a job interview, or confronting a friend about something they do that I dislike. Logically, I know that there's nothing to be afraid of and, often enough, when I'm in said situation, I perform well. My fear fades, and I can deal with the situation. But the apprehension is a killer and no matter how much I try to rationalize it away, it doesn't leave.

So. Here's my discussion point. What's the best way(s) to utilize our conscious, rational conclusions and understanding to directly influence our feelings?

You can however, choose to ignore those feelings. Understand that they're the result of a chemical soup your brain is steeped in, take a deep breath, and put them aside. Its not easy, but not much in life is particularly easy.

Or you can always try and change the chemical balance via brute force methods, taking certain drugs, maybe using that new headset thing that supposedly changes your moods via electrical stimulation of your brain, things like that.

**** There's feedback between the brain and the body, though -- for example, fear makes you breathe shallow and fast, which reinforces the feeling of fear. If you can break that loop by making yourself breathe deeply and slowly, it will reduce (although not eliminate) the sensation of fear. It's not a silver bullet, but it helps a lot. Ditto for muscle tension -- being angry makes you tense your muscles, so forcing yourself to physically relax will help reduce anger.

*** Mostly from my pursuit of them.

A lot of people tend to just become friends with people they are most similar to or people that they spend most of their time together with (ever notice how often a guy's best friend was also his college roommate?).

I noticed this trend at a relatively young age, early junior high school, and started going out of my way to spend time with other people who were deliberately from very different social groups. I didn't want to be labeled a geek.

By the time I reached high school, I went from a major introvert to a slightly unsocial, but more extroverted person. By college, I considered myself to be an extrovert.

I mostly do this by being active in several wildly different clubs (although I'm stopping with this, this semester, to focus more on academics). While I've rarely stayed in any club for more than a semester, I've developed connections with at least a few people from each club and over time, it built up.

In addition, I'm self-confident enough that I'm willing to just walk up to a random person in my college's dining hall and start a conversation with them. I mostly do this in the beginning of a semester when people are more open to talking to strangers.

I'm the only person I know who is fairly well-connected on campus and doesn't use any online social network such as FaceBook.

For an example of the diversity in my friends, there's a lot of variation in sexual orientations, ethnicities, sport teams, and some are transgender, deaf, or in the military.

Of course all of this is a lot easier in college than when out of college, so I hope I will still find it easy to make friends later in life.

So, the number of friends I've gained in pursuit is like thirty times larger than the number of friends who've pursued me.

I wonder if this is why I'm so optimistic and positive so much of the time.

I think this actually gets worse with time, because I become increasingly aware that I can't just hijack conversations with irrelevant Pinky and the Brain-esque babblings and expect anything good to come of it. My enthusiasm for everything rapidly decreases with respect to time. I wouldn't be surprised if the lack of non-annoying human contact has a lot to do with many of my most distressing problems, but even if I somehow found a way to get to some local tabletop group (I'm not even sure there are any, but who knows?), I'd still just sit there and observe. Maybe some brave person in the group would find some way to get me to talk about something, but not only would I not count on it, I wouldn't expect it to be the sort of thing friendships grow on. None of the people I ever counted as friends were friends because we displayed mutual interest in each other's interests, but because we could stand each other's company long enough for fun things to sometimes happen. mutual interest kinda happened once or twice, I guess. But most of the time, I cannot interact meaningfully with people, and seeking them out for mutual interest does not work.

Mutually satisfying activities tend to outdo conversation, in practice. These rarely happen, because <list of reasons no one wants to read badly enough for me to write>.
