** Loved it. It's hard to try to convey the sense of optimism and excitement that comes from refusing to accept reality as it is. And yeah, I also recognized some walls of my own in there. Is this your personal blog?

**** 1. Capitalism
2. (much more insidious, and also harder for me to fight) - The World is Mad and People Are Crazy, and that's the way it'll always be.

***** What's really going to bake your noodle later is: would you want to live in a world that was un-mad by default?

******** But I didn't mean it in the entire physical sense, only in the social... Wait, I think I see what you're saying. Yes, ok, I see. Well, I guess I should clarify that I would prefer to live in the world after we've already optimized ourselves for greater general sanity (as opposed to now). :) However if the choices are for the universe to seem sane by default, before we've put in the effort, then yes, that would be potentially terrible/terrifying. I tip my hat to you for the insight.

I watched /Kill la Kill/ with an overly active brain.

** I can't tell if they/he/she think that LW is about rational and common sense and therefore against perceivably impossible things like immortality, or that they/he/she agree with LW stances of some things. Other than that a short ,almost lackluster summary of why some things should be done differently, the whole perception of reality and truth. Good cut of jib.

*** I'm new at this, and have my own, very /very/ messed-up worldview. Lackluster, eh? That sounds like encouragement to practice.

Which sort of chaos? The Joker, various trickster gods, or the Chaos Gods of the Warp?
