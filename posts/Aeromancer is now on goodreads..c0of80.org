******* Nothing at all, but idea that someone rational must be someone who uses literally all their "free time" doing things that have the *maximum* ethical impact isn't just unrealistic but I think a harmful norm to propagate, insofar as it make people feel guilty for being human enough to want time for things like, say, writing/reading fiction. Self care is an important part of doing good.

******** ...Yes? That's why if someone has the utility of "doing things that have maximum ethical impact" (which doesn't have to be the case, BTW) then attempting to maximize/optimize it by spending all of one's time on ethical activity is irrational, because one would get burned out and therefore do less ethical activity overall than they would have done if they had inserted periods of self-care.

I think you've confused utility maximization/optimization, with, I dunno, having an obsessive, single-minded focus on something. These two are obviously different things and the latter obviously harms the former in many cases.

********** Sure. You seem to believe that utility maximization is defined by doing things in as short a time period as possible.

To me, it's pretty clear that that doesn't maximize that goal unless someone has completely incurable terminal cancer or a bomb strapped to themselves or something. People with more time get better outcomes with rest, hence better maximization.

************ Oh I see, so you were saying utility maximization in and of itself is fine, it's just that people's perception of it is sometimes as an irrational, sub optimal path to pursue a target goal. So the real utility maximization is ok, it's just that people have a fake, unrealistic vision of what it means.

I would stand behind that guy's statement that someone who might consider themselves a rationalist finding Jesus is ironic, because religion is, like, one of the basic first tests of rational epistemics (don't believe in things based on faith, don't believe in things just because they're what you were raised to believe, don't believe in things just because they make you feel good, don't ignore contrary evidence offered by competing truth-claims about reality, don't presume beliefs in the face of uncertainty... on and on and on).

But that said, someone who writes or reads rationalist fiction has no obligation or requirement to be rational or consider themselves a rationalist. Maybe they just like munchkinry or clever protagonists or consistent worldbuilding/magic systems. And in any case, writers should feel free to stop writing at any time if they feel their time would be better spent doing something else.

#+begin_quote
  Sorry about that.

S'all good :)

**************** I agree with your basic points about religion, but when I try to model this person I come up with very different conclusions. He said that when he was at a religious camp he rediscovered his faith in Jesus, and as one does in that environment he decided to stop writing rational fantasy. I don't think that someone who doesn't hold a fervent religious belief ends up at a religious retreat by accident, I think that a lot of pressure is enacted on that person to get them there.

Maybe, if you tally up all the positives and negatives, a religious fervor is generally bad for an individual, though I think there is a lot of room for debate there. However, for someone who is probably submersed in a highly religious community, it would be incentivized to find faith and probably be the optimal path forward. I suspect that there would be a lot of rewards for compliance and faith, and a lot of negative incentives if one rejected the faith, rejected the community, rejected one's family, probably leading to ostracization and a host of other negative consequences.

So, for this author, I strongly suspect that embracing the faith was the rational move. All of the other potential paths I envision (stuff like rejecting his community and probably rejecting his family, moving out without support to pursue a 'more rational' lifestyle) would be really unlikely to turn out well, and probably wouldn't lead to as stable and healthy a lifestyle as staying with the faith.

***************** Where I'm defining rational as the most efficient path towards a wholesome existence.

Edit 1: This is a lot of supposition and not particularly well written, but I just wanted to get the gist of my thought out there. Personally I've met a lot of happy religious people, and all the old Quakers I've met have come across as very intelligent and pretty rational, so I personally believe that there is definitely room for well adjusted religious people. I think that a lot of criticism of religion comes from the hypocrisy inherent to most devout religious people, but hypocrisy is part of life and pretty unavoidable. Part of intelligence and I suspect rationality is the ability to interact with hypocrisy, and being able to do that without 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater.'

Edit 2: and I'm placing religion in the same space in which I think you've placed writing rational fiction, it doesn't have to contribute to an otherwise rational life to be worth indulging in, IMO religion doesn't have to piss into the well of truth, it can be an enjoyable past time with quality of life benefits, social benefits, etc etc.

Edit 3: Case in point, both the theory of evolution and the big bang theory were attempts by religious men to reconcile scientific endeavor with their religious beliefs. I am under the impression that prior to the big bang theory scientists generally held the universe to be eternal in both space and time, and that Darwin was attempting to illustrate the mechanism by which God shaped life. I am not personally religious, but I do wonder about simulation theory, there is some reason behind it, and if scientists are going to indulge in the idea that the universe is a simulation then I feel it's in bad form to excoriate people for religious beliefs.

Neal Stephenson is a very flawed writer in my opinion, but there's a great passage about hypocrisy in "The Diamond Age" that I took to heart.

****************** No I think it was well written, thanks for expanding on the perspective you took :) I do counseling for a lot of kids going through suicidal crisis, and often tell the non-religious ones to do whatever they need to survive, including pretending to be religious until they're able to safely be independent. So I get why the rational thing to do in certain circumstances is to embrace a religious lifestyle.

The main argument is that actually believing in that thing sufficiently to decide to stop doing something he (presumably) enjoyed is itself irrational. Not in the sense of valuing the happiness he got from writing less than the happiness he gets from Jesus + Family + Community etc, which I hope is the case (or else it's not even instrumentally rational) but rather that prioritization of Happiness > Truth as terminal values.

Insofar as anything like that is a "choice," it's definitely not one that fits epistemic rationality. Instrumental is up for argument, of course; if all someone wants in life is to be happy, that's their prerogative.

*************** And to be totally upfront in case someone cares enough to dig through reddit, I made nearly if not the exact same joke when the author first announced the cessation of his fiction, and near immediately regretted it, which I would probably peg as the root of my irritation.

***** I don't see why we would expect that. There are lots of sets of values such that writing fiction for this subreddit would be an excellent way to fulfill them; a writer might enjoy the writing process and then want to spread the product around in case other people enjoy reading it, or they might enjoy accumulating a fanbase and find this subreddit to be a good place to do so, or they might have some Ideological Point they want to make and find writing fiction-of-interest-to-this-subreddit to be a good way to do so (/cough/ HPMOR /cough/), or many other things. Am I missing something regarding why we wouldn't expect those reasons to apply to people who write things which end up posted here?

***** I don't get why sacrificing oneself for the good of humanity is some kind of mega-rational move that everyone rational must immediately take upon awakening.

If this is ruled out then self-gratification becomes inherently permissible, in which case I dunno why writing wouldn't count as part of that.

*** By GR you mean goodreads?I don't know whether this is post-worthy, but goodreads is for some people (me included) the place of their to-read list, and also a way to (roughly) check what others think about a story before starting to read it.

E.g., if it gets a crazy average of 4.7 from 500 people, then maybe more people would be more inclined to give it a try..

​

Also, I now see someone has already marked it as "to-read"! (I believe they are probably going to enjoy it, so I count it as a good thing)
