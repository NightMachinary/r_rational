** Would it be too much to ask for you to also put this on fanfiction.net? It would lower the barrier of entry enough for me to start reading it, since I can check for updates to it alongside every other story I'm reading on fanfiction.net at the moment in the press of a single button.

Fimfic doesn't have an [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spicymango.fanfictionreader][Android app]], so reading on their website is like switching from silk to burlap, comparatively speaking.

I do agree the website theme is very Magical, but my main issue is reading ~20 WIPs at once and wanting to have them all downloaded for offline reading for my weekly visits to the boonies where I don't have internet.

****** [[/twioohshiny][]] I've read all five chapters and I've really enjoyed it. Right off the bat: kinda tickled by the EY name drop.

The characterization is very slightly AU, of particular note: Spike. But I feel you're treating him a bit better than in the show, and it feels like his emotional age has been upped a bit from Canon, even with the main emotions displayed being fear/worry.

That kinda tangents into my next point, but I'm not sure how to formalize it from feeling, so I'll hit it in a roundabout sort of way. In the show Twilight is showcased as being extremely intelligent^{[1]} by being extremely loquacious in a manner occasionally unintelligible by observers (e.g., S1E1: "Precipice"/"Threshold"/"Brink" of disaster). You have stepped up the vocabulary level of both shown show-characters (and even managed Celestia's tone decently in her letter). Spike and Twilight's bumps are reasonable, and Spike's has been explained (reading more hard sci-fi). This pulls at the question of others knowledge(-> reactions) when they encounter Meta.

[[/lunacomehere][]] Ooh, also, now I'm wondering about the one ("One", capitalized?) who sent her Out and if they have any contact with anyone/anything local to Equestria. Inb4 Nightmare Moon cultists. :p

If you want editing help re: spelling/grammar, I can point out a few things. Regarding tags on Fanfiction.net, I'm not sure how their editor works, and while leaving the tags in helps with understanding intent, it's not quite the same as the actual effect desired and will probably take some finagling.

******* Elizer Yudkowsky, while I've had some public disagreements with him, HAS been a major influence in my understanding of philosophy and rationality, meaning I can reference him, and I find it perfectly believable that others would too. This is just as much as other people, like Plato, Crowley, LaVey, and Nietzsche: I referenced all of them because I can see them all as being just as relevent to Meta as they were to me. I didn't reference the work of W. Edwards Demming, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Keynes, Hayek & Mises, John Rawls, John Nash, or several other of my influencers and contemporaries in the Occult and Economics communities because they weren't relevant to Meta, despite the fact that their work had a profound effect on my life.

I'm glad you're liking the way I wrote Spike and Twilight: it's hard to tow this line between writing them in character and writing them smart enough to be major characters in a rationalfic. You are correct that this is slightly AU, though not enough for the tag: I keep forgetting to mention things like Spike being 14 because he WOULD be 14 in the show, and it hasn't come up that they don't have access to the Mirror portal because I didn't want to deal with that in the story. I'm going to give my own explanation at some point as to why we could have a show based on this real place, and why the actual place is different from the show. Fun stuff, Chapter 6 has a scene in which [[#s][tag]] Other than that though, Spike is a pretty reasonable character normally, and is usually the one to ground Twilight, and I'm trying to write him that way.

Her Displacer shows up and gives a vague explanation of why this is happening by Chapter 8. This is where Meta reveals that she's something of a LaVeyan Satanist / Atheist, which leads to some really cool dialogue. I'll tell you that [[#s][tag]]

I need to go back and fix the formatting on FF.net, but I'm primarily using FiMFiction, and am focusing on getting Chapter 5 out for now, so it's in the backlog.

****** Thank you!

I don't mind formatting snags like the tags still being in there, I'm kinda desensitized to it by now.

Fimfic lets you download pdf/mobi of stories, but that's each story individually, and if you want to update it, you have to redownload each story. With an app like the one I linked upthread, you download every story's updates with the single press of a button.

(Also, for some reason [[http://i.imgur.com/wwJdFwt.png][Fimfic doesn't even record every chapter I read]], so their setup is unreliable as a bookmark.)

** So. I'm not sure that it's possible for two individuals, rational or not, to have identical enough priors to make that argument meaningful.

Really... I think you should have faked out the AI in the box solution. I'm not sure it's something that it's possible for ordinary human or pony level intelligences to depict.

Something like "I still can't believe I talked her into letting me go, and I'm not sure how I did it, but sometime in that long night's discussion I realized that I was free."

**** Good points, all around, but in reality, it's not REALLY an AI in a box, it's an alien spellcaster trapped in a jail cell trying to convince her captor that she has the right to be allowed out. I just felt it was a good way to demonstrate the AI in a Box scenario in brief, and to have a solution involving several types of argument by name. If I'd time-lapsed through it, it wouldn't really be a good rationalfic...

***** +1 to keeping the "let me out" dialogue in...

Would hate it if you artificially mistify the ai/box thing by timelapsing it, and it makes for an important caracter defining decision moment for Twilight.

Just my 2 cent.

** You're being a bit heavy handed with the yud bloggosphere references, but i liked the story so far despite that.

Pacing was spot on, good writting (as far as i can tell but not native speaker), and i love that you don't make the whole story about "escaping the box", that's been done allready enough... I also like it when non-main-caractere still choose reason over emotion.

Please don't abandon this, i'll read it.

Also, not very important but curious: why " fimfiction" instead of more well known website?
