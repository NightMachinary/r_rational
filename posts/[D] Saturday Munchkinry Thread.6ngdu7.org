Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have a tablet similar to what was shown in the first Night at the Museum movie with some additional more clearly defined rules.

- Radius of effect is 100 m, forming a sphere centered on the tablet location. Tablet is only operational during the night (when the mass of the earth sufficiently blocks some inhibiting influence of the sun). When exiting the area of effect during the evening and when the effect ends during the day, animated objects simply return to their unanimated state.

- In the area of effect, objects are animated based on the intentional/unintentional thoughts and knowledge of their creator. For example, a wax model of Einstein will act as the artist imagines Einstein would act and would only as intelligent and knowledgeable as the artist. Animated objects retain memory from previous animations. Subsequent animation behavior is influenced by this memory and any decisions made. (i.e. personal growth/learning is possible). Objects created without any sort of intent for representation, like a table, will not animate. A motor would not animate, but a complete system like a robot might.

- Objects that were previously alive are also influenced by their previous sense of self. For example, an animated unmodified dead person will act like and have the memories of the person right before they died. However, dead components that have been made part of a larger creation (say, a dinosaur skeleton display composed of real and cast fossils) will be influenced by their previous experiences and the artist/constructor to greater or lesser amounts.

- Deceased organic tissue will return to its living state under the effect. Any additional mass gained is taken from an unanimated mass within the area of effect. Regeneration is limited and whole missing tissue will not reappear. No regrown limbs, organs, etc.

- Animated objects are limited to internal force generation for their motion. No floating rocks and the like. Capability to sense light/sound/force etc. is possible if intended. Object strength is limited to their constituent components. Overall power and energy is not unlimited and is capped at some value each evening (collected/stored/generated by tablet over time).

What interesting ways might you take advantage of this tablet?

- Interview murder/assassination victims.

- Limited utility, but it allows for secure magical message encryption. Since it can react to epiphenomena like the artist's intent and nothing physical can, you can receive uninterceptable messages. Bonus points if sending a file to a 3D printer counts as "being the artist" for the purposes of behavior.

- Is there a size limit? Can animated nanobots build /real/ nanobots?

*** Ok so your first goal should be to accrue resources for the later steps in this world domination plan. Do this by adding some googly eyes to computers and imagining that they are maximally intelligent and loyal servants, who have access to their own source code, think at incredible speed, and are extremely motivated, basically just max out every attribute you can apply to them. If the access to source code thing works then they should be able to figure out how to improve themselves into a FAI pretty quickly given subjective time letting you win in hours or days.\\
Otherwise have your many googly eyed laptops/smartphones take many online jobs each getting you more money which with to buy more laptops to googly eye, basically you'll be making a sort of intelligent server farm. Having hundreds of these diligent servants working on getting you resources they should be able to make you a millionaire (at least) within a year using a massive variety of techniques from the basic online work specified earlier to exploiting their high thinking speed to do high frequency trading, using social engineering to do scams or hire people do various real world tasks, etc.\\
Then you should get bases far into the arctic and antarctic to exploit the months long nights.

Now earlier your servants would have been finding geniuses to hire online (through looking at social media or perhaps by creating an online IQ test that's actually valid and using it to find geniuses). The purpose of this is to come up with some excuse to get them to create something (could be a sculpture, a googly eyed computer or anything really) that they imagine to be totally loyal to their employer and possessing of all the other qualities mentioned previously. You only need to get one genius to complete this weird task then you can ship your creation to you and animate it, and if it has the attributes you asked for then it can create more of itself getting you more servants this time limited to the smartest genius your servants can find. Obviously you can create many thousands of servants like this animating whatever the smallest functional interface you can get for your purposes is.

At this point you are probably starting to realize why I said this is a world domination scheme. Since you can have your army of world class genius servants (you should be able to find one supergenius to do your weird task or who you can bring on board with your plans, motivations not an issue since the only limiting factor on mental attributes is your own intelligence). Now simply have your super fast geniuses work on science and technology and not only can you make more money through shell companies but you should be able to solve problems like safe GAI that would take decades or more otherwise.

** There is a glyph you can draw on a surface which, once the central circle is complete, will begin emitting red light. The red light exerts force on matter inside it, pushing those objects away from the glyph. This force is not reactionless, and the energy to do this (plus a little to account for distance) is stolen from the nearest star.

The force emitted by the glyph scales with the size of the glyph and the accuracy with which it is drawn. A small glyph rapidly sketched out in the sand will emit less than a pound of force and probably be obliterated by the reaction force. A huge glyph professionally inlaid in a reinforced steel plate can exert tons of force. The distance that this effect travels scales with its strength, a weak glyph will only extend a few feet as it is attenuated by pushing air, a huge one can go miles. The light cannot penetrate matter which is opaque to light, and it can be reflected.

What are good uses of this power? Assume a Victorian understanding of mechanics and that electricity has not been harnessed.

2. For offense: These obviously could be used for weapons. Additionally, large mobile glyphs could be used to knock down large swathes of enemies

3. For unlimited free energy: Since this is the victorian time period, they probably wouldn't use it for electricity. However, they could definitely create something similar to a waterwheel or a steam engine using a glyph that take itself apart and puts itself back together again.

4. Hovercrafts/ hover-boots: A glyph that can provide constant force could be used to provide levitation and by angling them correctly, you could change your direction. This could provide free transportation. A sufficiently big enough one could be used as a rocket.

5. As a bomb: put two incomplete glyphs near each other and complete them and you've got yourself something that explodes violently in two pieces.

With creative thinking, the uses of such a glyph are endless. This sort of magic would change the economy and potentially jump-start the industrial revolution.

*** Power is renewable and cheap. Windmills are useless, because glyphmills are smaller, cheaper, and more reliable. Similarly, plows are fitted with glyphs instead of animals.

Trade is much simpler, cheaper, and faster. Almost every vehicle would become a hovercraft (glyphs sound cheaper than wheels and oxen), and global trade networks would flourish.

Jetpacks!

You said it can be reflected by mirrors, can it be focused by lenses? If so, long range death-lasers are the new weapon of war.

Rockets! (but not ones that can go out of the atmosphere?)

In short, it would skip straight past animal power, the steam engine, internal combustion, and the electric motor for power sources, kickstart global trade with better transportation, and revolutionize war in many different ways.

This could be either for major freight routes, or else everywhere. Setup would be expensive, but wear and erosion should be very slow, as nothing actually touches the surface.

Alternatively, just have "Hoverways" that provide no thrust but can go in either direction without friction.

****** I haven't worked out exact numbers yet, but you'd need something like a three inch diameter glyph to exert enough force to cut tougher materials, and at that size the glyph is more bludgeoning the material rather than cutting it. Increasing the curve of a parabolic array is considered even greater inaccuracy, so that doesn't work either.

You could create a massive array of small glyphs arranged parabolically, but that again presents the problem of size and amount of labor required to set up the system. Available space isn't infinite in this world.

It might be possible to use glyphs to set up some kind of heat engine hot enough to use as a welding torch, though.

If the glyph is the right size (that it causes the average human to float about ten centimetres above the ground at rest) then can I safely jump into the pit and reach the bottom uninjured?

If I have a pit without a glyph, then, can I throw down a glyph (say, on a metal plate), double-check that the light is there, and then jump down?

Or safely jump into a deep pit while wearing my hoverboots?

Mind you, getting out again is a different problem. Actually, that means that this might be how they handle prisons - drop the prisoner onto the glyph, drop food down on occasion, and /maybe/ let a rope down if there's reason to let someone out.

A jetpack designed to produce enough lift that the reaction force on the air is enough to keep you up would work, but those have the problem of being extremely hard to fly. No computers means no electronic stabilization. Also you have to reduce lift as you get close to the ground because you just bounce off otherwise.

You would probably need multiple drop shafts in your prison because humans and food have different terminal velocities. Also, the amount of lift you experience is proportional to the surface area you expose to the light, so that might do strange things to your hover height in the glyph as well.

The glyph drop idea is interesting, but the hole you're jumping into would have to be just the right width that you wouldn't risk falling uncontrolled out of the light column. A parachute or a rope is a better idea.

So you freefall down the shaft until you're a hundred feet from the ground. If your resulting deceleration is over a long enough period, you can still use hoverboots to survive a terminal-velocity fall.

3. Doesn't work for two reasons. One, even if that screen did exist, it's hardly an MMO-- there's no multiplayer gameplay whatsoever. Two, if there are no in-game mechanics to affect those stats, they don't actually do anything. Maxing out INT or WIS in an MMO doesn't actually make your avatar smarter or wiser, for example, it just makes it easier to pass some skill checks and increases their mana pool.

***** Well a text-based game where a 'massive' amount of players can play and interact is something that could be done in a few days if you contract a few coders. I think it is then technically an MMO.

And having stats that have to affect the game in a certain way is really hard to translate into real life I think. I get your point but since this is munchinkry I have to point that out. I could just make one slider on make game's character creation that goes from "Horrible" to "Everything is Awesome" and have to game be really easy and 'awesome' if that is maxed.

About INT and WIS in mmo's. Those are simulating real life intelligence or wisdom. You don't have real life skill checks. So stats would be useless I guess if they don't translate into what we perceive as intelligence, wisdom, strength, health or luck (...).

Probably. But as I said, I meant for the idea to be that you pick an existing IP. It's certaintly an interesting munchkin I didn't think of, but allowing it bypasses the "mmo" part of my prompt, which is the only thing that really distinguishes it from any other arbitrary wish-giving munchkin.

They wouldn't be useless, however-- the mechanics would be copied from the game to real life. So, for example, you'd have a mana pool defined to be some integer, and be able to cast spells using it. Have you read any LitRPGs before, or watched log horizon? That's the basic idea. Now, in some games, having a high INT or WIS actually makes your character smarter, but usually your character is exactly as intelligent as you are.

Second Life. Infinite inventory with symlinks, you can change shape, gender, species at will. You can fly and teleport. Programmers are demigods who can create magical items at the drop of a script. Physical damage just doesn't happen unless you forget to fly in a damage-enabled zone, or get hit by a properly scripted bullet (normal impacts don't do anything, you have to fall miles)... and even there the worst that can ever happen to you is teleporting home. It's not respawning, it's just a normal teleport.

** You have a 5 foot staff which allows you to teleport. There are five stipulations. First, you can only teleport such that the staff's destination position at least partly overlaps with its origin location. Second, you must be touching the staff to teleport, and the staff always comes with you. Third, you can take up to 100 pounds with you, so long as you're touching them too. Fourth, you cannot destroy or alter the staff. Fifth, you, the staff, and equipment cannot rotate relative to the staff during teleportation.

Assume that you have access to more efficient forms of energy than the staff can provide, because I find hooking up magic items to generators to be really boring.

*Clarifying Edits*: Teleporting swaps you with whatever is at your destination. If the density of any possible cubic centimeter of space at your destination is greater than 2 kg/m3 then no teleportation will occur. (In other words, you swap with air but not with water or people.)

Cooldown time is .01 seconds.

Touching ... is a horribly abstract concept. Let's say 1 cubic centimeter of your flesh must be within 1 centimeter of 1 cubic centimeter of the object in question, and your flesh must be touching the rest of your flesh (so no cutting off your finger and setting it down next to a pile of gold, but you could flense yourself and teleport things your flesh whips are touching).

If you're touching multiple things, then you decide what to bring. If you're touching too many things, then you decide that you're bringing fewer things or just don't teleport.

You and the staff can rotate relative to other things.

I am not going to define "object" but a general rule would be that you can't teleport things that you would need much force to remove from other things, so simply gluing things down would stop you from teleporting them, but simple friction would not. Alternately, use [[/u/eaglejarl]]'s "shrink-wrap" rule, i.e. an object is an object if you could completely surround it with shrink wrap. But "what's an object" is too big a question.

If you can cycle the staff at about a billion Hz, you could reach Mars at its closest approach in a little over 30 seconds.

Landing would be a little tricky. You'd need to cancel differences in relative velocity which would mean you'd need to find the side you're moving away from and then get close to it while still outside the atmosphere, and keep bringing yourself close to it as you slow down. Once you're in the right ballpark, you'd need to use a handheld long-range doppler radar to measure your relative speed and go the surface right as your speed matches the planet's surface. Obviously, adjustment for surface rotation would also need to be considered. It might be easier to start with a polar landing and then gradually work your way towards the equator over the span of a few minutes.

The 0.1s cool-down makes this less effective, but you could probably still get to orbit.

Larry Niven goes into some of the issues with this in /Theory and Practice of Teleportation/. He calls it the "end teleport drive". At least one of the problems (sweeping up hydrogen gas) is solved by the particle swap trick, and at 0.1s cool-down you won't have to worry about your eyes not working because you're moving too fast for the light focused by the lens to reach the retina.

This implies that I can teleport - rotating me-plus-staff-plus-srting-plus-object - such that the object instantly travels several kilometres, as long as there is an unobstructed path from me to the destination for the string?

No. You teleport instantaneously, then wait for a hundredth of a second for the cooldown (falling in the meantime), then teleport again. Thus, although you can climb a total of 500 ft. per second, you will also fall for a total of one second per second. Once your altitude exceeds about 12,000 m, your terminal velocity will just about match your climb speed and you'll fall about as fast as you can climb.

*** So it's basically a 5 foot teleport that can't go through solid objects (unless there's a convenient staff-shaped hole), tied to an artifact that would be difficult to conceal?

The only munchkinry I can see at a glance depends heavily on the rules.

How does it determine what constitutes an object (and what it means to touch it)? If I'm touching a house, can I teleport 100 pounds of bricks with me? Could I take part of a person's body, or some water from a pool, or a portion of a pile of ball bearings?

Depending on the answers there, it might make that aspect of the power borderline useless (e.g. you might not even be able to carry a backpack, because you're not touching the contents and they're not one object).

What is the priority for trying to teleport while touching multiple things with a total weight of over 100 pounds? E.g. if I bring a 99 pound object with me, might I end up naked? If I'm standing barefoot on a table, might it teleport with me instead of something else I wanted? Again, you might run into problems using this ability if the priority isn't easily controlled (though it seems likely to be mental somehow, as otherwise controlling the power /at all/ would be difficult).

Worst case scenario it teleports you without any medical implants (e.g. fillings, hip/knee replacements, pacemaker, sutures), which would be quite bad for your ability to use it.

The last rule says that you can't rotate relative to the staff. Does that mean you and the staff can rotate relative to other things as long as the staff overlap requirement is met?

Finally, is there a cooldown to this ability? If you can use it extremely quickly to more or less fly forward (or even literally fly), that'd be very useful. But if you need to wait even a few seconds before using it again it basically becomes "walking v2".

***** Any causality violation, no matter how brief, is associated with a closed timelike curve and thus - in my understanding - infinite energy density or something odd like exotic matter and 'negative energy'. At the very least I should have an advantage in high speed trading :)

*** u/General_Urist:
#+begin_quote
  If the density of any possible cubic centimeter of space at your destination is greater than 2 kg/m3 then no teleportation will occur.
#+end_quote

This is pretty low actually, means that pressurizing to just 1.7 atmospheres creates a no-teleport environment.

What counts towards the 100 pound limit? your body? clothes? implants? backpacks?

** You're aware that there's an "omniscient" person somewhere on the planet, but you don't know where they are, nor do you know any identifying details like height, gender, race, age, etc. They don't actually know everything; what they actually have is a power roughly equivalent to an invisible, intangible surveillance camera, a "viewpoint", which they can move freely at will, as well as teleporting it to given coordinates or a place it's been before. They can hear as well as see through their viewpoint.

This person knows who you are and they are presumably looking at you much of the time, because their goal in this "game" is to kill you as quickly as possible. How do you protect yourself and ultimately identify and disable/kill your "omniscient" opponent? First assume that you don't know how rational they are and have to deduce it from their actions, and then assume that they're as rational as you are.

*** If their power is a camera, then the solution is straightforward: turn off the lights.

Hire a bunch of people to dress up in identical full body gear that covers every part of their body. Wear the same equipment, and all of you walk into a completely dark room. Then walk out in some random order. The people you hire thus become your body doubles, since the "omniscient" person is unable to tell who is who as long as everyone keeps wearing their identical full body gear.

Now if the "omniscient" person tries to attack, odds are high that a body double is attacked, and now you can attempt to trace the attack back to the source in order to reveal the "omniscient" person.

*** Well, what can the person actually /do/? Like, are they just a normal human being with a nifty farsight ability? Because if they're actually trying to integrate into society and search /efficiently/, the ability is practically useless without unusual multitasking abilities, and don't have any apparent uses for gaining power other than easy spying for blackmail. And information brokering. Hmm, actually that could be pretty useful.

It's literally impossible to look at 6 billion people's faces in under a decade - there's ~300 million /seconds/ in a year, so they're fucked on their own, and that's assuming you don't go make yourself a hermit in the middle of nowhere.

Aaaand this is getting boring. They build up power, you look for people to build up power.

Actually, scrap that. You get plastic surgery and a reliable fake identity and you're set for life.

...wait, did you say they already know who you are and already looking at you (i.e. know /where/ you are)? Because if so, you're more-or-less fucked if they have any brains.

*** I wouldn't worry about being found. If it takes them 1 day of surveillance to determine whether or not a person knows about the omniscience, then it would /only/ take 20 million years to check everyone. If you can reduce it to 1 second instead of 1 day, it's just over 200 years instead.

I'm not seeing a solution other than "Nuke the parts of the planet where you aren't".
