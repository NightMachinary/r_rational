** Some of these have been posted here before, but I found some that I hadn't read before so I thought I would share it.

This has been suggested before, but shouldn't we also be having these sorts of discussions? A single link with a collection of the fiction that was well received in this community that could serve as an introduction to the genre would probably make it easier for people to get started on rationalist fiction.

We tried to make a TVTropes page once. I should go check what happened to that.

**** Just checked it out, seems to contain some good stuff.

Sidenote: I'm not too familiar with TVTropes, but should Rational Fic be linked to Porn Without a Plot? Also RageFic? I can see how you might end up taking endless jabs at canon characters for not being rational or making the story more rationality lecture than plot, but that really doesn't seem like you could even call it rationalfic anymore (Also assuming that PWP in this context doesn't imply actual explicit content but rather just in general making the story something other than a FanFic). I'm not sure how the site works, but maybe we should change that if possible.

***** That's just indexing. It lists tropes in alphabetical order.
