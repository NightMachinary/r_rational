  I might have been with only women for the last few years, but I still knew what men liked -- you know, shady military alliances that would be discarded at the earliest convenience in favour of wanton betrayal.

Apparently, Black considers Risk a proper family entertainment.

** This conversation encapsulated every great thing about this story so well. The Tyrant of Helike would be a terrible character written by a terrible writer in any other story. Blatant scheming like that should never go unpunished in any well-constructed universe.

Except, of course, this one. The Tyrant is as genre savvy as Catherine, and rather than trying to be a stabilizing force, he's decided to use stories to his advantage to act the raving madman he always wanted to be. They're both fulfilling their deepest desires, and they only get to do that because they've transcended the game and understand who the real players are. In the Tyrant's case, he knows that becoming an end boss is his best path to an amusing and fulfilling life. He also knows that narrative causality won't allow his illness to kill him so long as he is a central figure in so many stories. He's set things up so being the cackling villain is /healthcare./

He certainly knows he's doomed for failure eventually, but he also knows it will be the stuff of legends. And, somewhere, Catherine knows this too. Her best way forward will be to somehow harness the narratives Kairos is spinning and twist them against him, as she has so many times before. I'm excited to see where that takes us.

  "If someone conquers an empire and rules it with an iron fist for thirty long years, and then some paladin breaks into his throne room and kills him, what do you think he's going to remember as he lays dying?"

  "...That good triumphed over evil?"

  "No, that he got to live like a god for three decades! Sure the last ten minutes sucked, but you can't have everything.

  Somewhere between 'villain of the week' and 'good triumphs over evil,' there's a sweet spot where guys like me get to rule the roost for years. As long as I go into this accepting the price I may eventually pay, then I *win*---no matter what actually happens."

** Kairos' comment on Lake Artoise seems to be a point up to it being a Hell Egg that Cordelia's planning on using.

*** Cordelia's perspective, from the Prologue:

#+begin_quote
  She was damned, just as the hard-eyed warlord in Callow had warned she would be. /Let me be damned, then/, she thought.
#+end_quote

Up to no good, establishing that much.

#+begin_quote
  /Dredge it out/, she wrote. /Prepare it. Fire against fire./ The Augur had found a path through, narrow as it was, and it began with a corpse that was not a corpse beneath the waters of the lake at the heart of Procer.
#+end_quote

There's the thing being raised (dredged) - a "corpse that was not a corpse". Interesting. Seems to refer to some kind of undead thing - doubly so, considering the nature of the Dead King (fire against fire).

**** I'm getting shades of a short story by Charles Stross called [[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/colderwar.htm][/A Colder War/]], which also features things buried in lakes that are better left there.

** Catherine is playing 3D monopoly against the Tyrant's 5D poker hand. Meanwhile, everyone else is looking at the two of them messing with a table full of M&Ms wondering what the fudge is going on. Beautiful.

Any chance the bard is spying on this meeting?

> Neshamah strode forward, enjoying the pressure of a word he could not simply shape as he wished. There was resistance here. A will more paramount than his own.

> “Were you watching?” he teased.

> A little jest, just between the two of them. She was always watching.

​

i think the bard is aware of any plot significant meeting that happens, especially between Named.

this ambiguity about what she know or don't know is part of why she is so damn terrifying.

and i like to think that she is laughing at what a clusterfuck the tyrant and Catherine are doing.
