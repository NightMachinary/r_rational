The latest page of OOTS made me want to open a discussion here about how that comic handles characters who are both intelligent and good (or "Good").

I'm always impressed with stories where Good characters win not just because they deserve to or had a last-minute revelation or powerup, but because they planned in advance to arrange a victory with the limited resources available to them. I especially enjoyed this page and the slow build leading up to it because it's a take on the "redeeming the villain" arc that I rarely see. I've seen many redemption arcs where the villain is won over by the kindness of the heroes, the betrayal of the real Big Bad, camaraderie against a common foe, etc. And those are all fine! But I rarely find one where a Good character /plans out/ a redemption tailored to their opponent. In this case we got to see Durkon observe how the vampire reacted to the memories it accessed, reason that it couldn't grasp the meaning behind emotionally significant memories without the experiences leading up to them, carefully manage his interactions with it to ensure it would be vulnerable to his planned attack, and finally maneuver it into an emotional state where it would consent to the overwhelming flood of memories that overwrote its identity. The thought and preparation that went into the events of this page made them feel truly earned.

I particularly like how this arc doesn't fall into the "feelings are a pointless distraction from Logic(TM), unworthy of consideration" trope that I often see in portrayals of intelligent characters. Durkon's strategy is successful because he understands how powerfully emotions can affect people and, more to the point, how they've affected /him./ He has the wisdom and introspection to recognize how he felt about Sigdi's sacrifice, model how he /would have/ felt about it without the experiences that had prepared him to manage and contextualize it, and leverage that into a strategic play to overwrite the vampire's utility function with his own. A character who hadn't developed their emotional intelligence the way Durkon has could not have pulled this off.

I'd like to hear others' thoughts. What did you think of this page? What moments do you remember that set the stage for it? What were some other times in this comic, or in other stories, where a Good character (for any value of Good, though I'm mainly thinking in terms of selflessness/compassion) succeeded at their goal by intelligently applying their knowledge, wisdom, and resources? What about times when they didn't?


** This reminds me of the Paladin Ochul's successful breakout. He planned for weeks and endured much suffering for an eventual victory that came both from his careful planning, and from acts of friendship and kindness (befriending the creature of darkness) that he had carried out along the way, not necessarily as part of his master plan but simply because that's who he is.

Especially considering the vampire's earlier claims that Durkon could never pull anything over on him because the vampire had a higher INT score - the vampire couldn't possibly have expected /this/ because if he'd even known it was an option, it would need to have already worked.

I don't think that's a thing in D&D RAW, but we know the author is willing to bend the rules for the sake of story. Once he's up, he seems to activate his barbarian rage, which gives him temp HP.

As for the story, I mostly agree with your analysis though the twist did catch me off guard. Combined with the tpk timing that makes it almost feels like a DeM but maybe it would make more sense on a second reading.

I'm more wondering about the setup going on with Belkar. Either he happened to stab the vampire at the same moment and helped kill it, or Durkon's recovery is about to be very short lived.

*** I'm thinking of rereading the whole arc so I can fully appreciate it without the long wait times. I bet I'll notice a lot more foreshadowing that I didn't pick up the first time. But I did remember enough about [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0963.html][this key page]] to find it again. This is the page that shows us "A. what Durkon observed to give him his new understanding of the vampire's psychology, B. that he deliberately avoided cluing the vampire in to what he'd figured out, and C. that he intended to use this information to his advantage in the future.

The scene where the vampire gives its "you are who you are on your worst day" speech is also pretty important, since it sets up Durkon's rebuttal (which is my favorite part about this page, even though I didn't address it in the OP).

In addition, we've seen at least a couple of times where Durkon attempts--either successfully or not--to selectively show memories that will influence the vampire. For example, he tries to drag out a memory (page 948) to make the vampire hesitate and tip off the OOTS. Later, he volunteers a memory that gives the vampire useful information (page 1088), in order to steer it into doing its evil plans somewhere where it wouldn't have to immediately kill anyone in the process So that set the stage for him to use memories as the vector for his final attack.

In fact, he even leverages that second memory into preparing his attack! When the vampire demands that he explain why he volunteered the information, he agrees to tell it the truth in exchange for showing it another memory (page 1089). That other memory just happened to emphasize the extent of Sigdi's poverty, which drove home the magnitude of her sacrifice and helped ensure the vampire would have the desired emotional reaction when it found out.

Edit: Found another one! Page 983, Durkon, without being asked, shows the vampire a memory whose central point is that Sigdi didn't have the money to fix her arm. I believe that all of the memories about Sigdi's suffering--more to the point, about Durkon witnessing his beloved mother's suffering--were intended to prime the vampire to be baffled and horrified when it found out that she willingly gave up the chance to avoid all of it.

***** Oh man, that is /clever!/ It establishes how vampire spirits' personalities work, and how this one's thoughts are related to Durkon's. This sets the stage for the slow build-up, which I didn't really appreciate at the time -- but now, at the end, everything makes perfect sense. (Eeeeee! This is great and I'm envious because nothing I've ever written has come close to this level of foreshadowing.)

** It's an interesting plot point I guess. But it /isn't/ remotely based on 3e mechanics, and it's something like three levels of nested digression away from the plot. The ways in which it is good are not conductive to fixing the problems OotS has, so I find I do not care about it much.

*** I guess whether it resonates depends on what aspects of OOTS are most important to you. I'm not particularly interested in how closely the story hews to 3E mechanics (and the author has said that he isn't either), and I see the individual character arcs as at least equally important as the main Xykon plotline (in part because I expect each character's growth to be critical to the group's eventual victory). This page is a massive character development payoff for Durkon in addition to being a portrayal of an intelligent Good character, so I'm enthusiastic about it.

I'm not sure what you mean by "The ways in which it is good are not conductive to fixing the problems OotS has," though. Do you mean the comic itself, or the in-universe Order of the Stick? If the latter, I'd counter that it fixes pretty much all of their immediate problems and will help tremendously with the main Xykon problem.

**** I mean the problems with the comic. The nominal big bad (Xyklon) hasn't shown up in more than 200 strips last I checked, and hasn't interacted with the heroes in longer than that. Plot points almost never get resolved by the abilities the characters have -- which is particularly bad because we can know and reason about those abilities since it's based on a published game. When characters /do/ try to use their abilities, their success or failure is dependent on the author's vision for the plot, not the effect of those abilities (which we, again, know). Basically, it's stalled out, and given up the things that made it unique in favor of being a generic fantasy story that is simply less good than other fantasy stories I could read instead.

***** It seems like you have a different vision of the comic than the author does, or I do. I get the impression that you see it as a failed "munchkin fic," whereas I see it as a different kind of story entirely.

When I say munchkin fic, I'm referring to stories where the characters are aware of a set of "game mechanics," and the plot is driven/conflicts are resolved by their exploitation of those mechanics. I've read and enjoyed a few of these stories. Conversely, in OOTS it's more common for conflicts to be resolved (or to arise) through interaction between characters in which they persuade, manipulate, support, or outwit one another (e.g. Belkar snapping Roy out of his funk after Durkon's death; Haley redirecting golem!Crystal to attack Bozzok instead of her, then tricking her into the waste disposal pit; the current page; countless other examples), or through independent epiphanies they have in reaction to their experiences (this happens to V a lot, usually helped along by another character's insights). In addition, the author has outright said that he'll bend or break D&D RAW if it makes for a better story. This doesn't preclude characters acting rationally, it just means they're playing a different game than a player at an actual D&D table might.

Basically, as much as I like munchkin fics, I don't think OOTS is bad or generic because it isn't one. It's likely just not your preferred style of fiction--which is totally fine, I'm not trying to argue that you "should" enjoy it.

(The above doesn't address your criticism about Xykon not showing up for so long, but I think it's less of an issue in an archival reading, which is how the majority of readers will experience the comic in the long run. It seems like forever since he's appeared because we have to wait days, weeks, or months for a new strip, but it hasn't really been that long from the perspective of someone reading straight through.)

ETA: Just recalled a page that I think is a great illustration of what kind of story OOTS is and isn't. [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0618.html][Here]], Bozzok seems to have the advantage because he can attack Haley every round by having a disposable minion flank her, forcing her to kill them to prevent a Sneak Attack while he continues to hit her. Nothing in the rules prevents him from continuing to attack uncontested until he runs out of minions. However, because this is primarily a story about /people/ rather than game mechanics, Bozzok can only pull this off a few times before the remaining minions choose not to "die for his fleeting tactical advantage."

"Actually this version of the strip was canceled years ago, so this is probably your last appearance ever.") Though maybe the framing story for the Stick Tales stories is part of regular canon. Sadly that book isn't available as a PDF so I don't have it handy.

The "Invaders from the Fourth Edition" story does a pretty good job of showing the different focuses of the two systems and their respective pros and cons, while still being an entertaining story (IMHO, of course). I was kinda hoping he'd do something similar for 5e in the new book, but I'm sure not going to complain about a bunch of new canonical stories. 😁
