Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I don't know if you know the story Savage divinity On royal road.

But in the story there are "martial weapons" which cannot be destroyed (according to cannon as I understand it). and this is ripe for abuse. Therefore: What is the best OP weapons that can be created? (For example,I think that a very thin and sharp wire will be OP)

Additional information if yoy didn't read Savage divinity: 1) A weapon is only indestructible after being connected to a person's soul (the terminology is different in the story) and can only be used by that person afterwards. 2)a person is limited in the amount weapons he can connect to. 3) energy which closely resemble chi exist in the story universe, with it a person (after a lot of training ) can do things like make the weapon sharper, lighter, hit stronger, add reverberating for internal damege, and more. 4) there are no gunpowder! or other explosives allowed (for cannon reasons ) 5) cannot be overly mechanically complicated (think middle/dark ages blacksmith but an extremely talented one)

P.S I would very much recommend Savage divinity.( I don't think that the story is rational, although there are parts that are).

*** Other than a suit of armor...

How about a giant cast net? People may laugh at you for bringing fishing gear to the battlefield, but being encased in indestructible wires would counter many other weapons--a sword is useless if you're too tangled up to swing it. You can kill people with a sharp stick as your side weapon.

Also, you'd be able to retrieve delicious fish.

**** As I remember, each weapon must be a solid seamless piece, one piece. So unless you have liquid metal, a functional armour set would contains like 100 pieces.

*** Create a "weapon" that's basically a suit of armor so you have indestructible armor?

I mean, I read Savage Divinity and one of the MC's weapon is a shield+sword, so why not an armor+sword? It wouldn't make you completely invincible, since you can still be burned alive in your suit of armor, or thrown about until you die from internal injuries, or just tied up and kidnapped, but it would still be an awesome indestructible armor that renders you virtually immune to piercing attacks like spears and daggers and arrows.

*** What happens if someone else tries to use your weapon? What precisely counts as "using" a weapon?

**** In Savage Divinity, warriors basically buff up their weapons whenever they fight. They make it lighter so they can swing it faster, or make it hit harder, or make it vibrate to cause worse injuries, or make it home in on a target, etc. All of those techniques are performed by injecting your Chi into the weapon.

But if you inject your Chi into a weapon that is bound to someone else, you die (though I don't think it was ever explained exactly what causes you to die). So you can touch someone else's weapon, and even move it around or snatch it out of an enemy's hands, but you can't buff it up without killing yourself. Effectively, a weapon bound to someone else is more useless to you than a random stick, since you can at least buff up the stick.

*** Taking from what other people have said, a suit of armour has too many pieces to bind to, but consider that unlike a weapon, it does not need to be injected with chi to be effective. If a group of people bind to armour parts then one person could assemble the set and use it as indestructible armour; and still have weapon slots free.

Another thing that comes to mind is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urglg3WimHA][aluminium foil]]. I can't think of much applicaiton off the top of my head, but it's an indestructible sheet that is lightweight and lots of it can be stored in a roll. Good for storing sandwiches.
