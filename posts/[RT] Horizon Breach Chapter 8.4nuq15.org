** Very interesting chapter, but the end was really weird. Considering the scale of the situation and the increase in physical and mental stats of the adventurers, pushing for school seems ... pointless, both because of its utility and because the intelligence of high-level adventurers should be way more than high enough to trivialize even the highest-level human education.

EDIT: in addition, while the standard submissive reaction to parents might have been understandable while he was much younger, at the current age and with the experience he had with surviving in a different world as a team leader, it's just feels ... off.

Also, what's with the immediate obsession of all parents of returned adventurers pushing for school? I understand that asian parents are obsessed with it, but this is way beyond even that.

****** People of the land get the same perks as adventurers, but with one quarter the xp gain and no respawns, making it extremely risky to grind XP. People on earth are treated basically the same, but they don't even have the luxury of easily available monsters.

So most people on earth won't choose to get kickass magic skills for the same reason most Landers don't-- it's inconvenient, risky, and painful.

******* Okay. I still have some thoughts on the subject of Elder Tale that you may want to consider, but in Elder Tale one of the issues was the increase in monster spawn rates and their invasions of LH's home city, right?

I'm wondering, with the introduction of mana, etc, if monsters wouldn't begin spawning like they did in ET, or if local fauna and wildlife would begin to be treated like in ET. This could eventually lead to things like consistent raids from (dire) wolves which take out hunters/ranchers. You mentioned a Genius jumping the portal, but I can't help but think that Monsters would actually become a recurring thing.

Anyway, I think I'm going to write a chapter for my own story and see how that goes one of these days.

Though really, every adventurer is a reactionless drive, so overpopulating earth isn't really a concern.

  increase in physical and mental stats

To clarify, adventurers get better reflexes/processing speed, but aren't actually any smarter than before. Martial artists think quickly, but that doesn't necessarily make them good, for example, particle physisists.

That being said, I think you make a good point as far as both minori's and shoryu's parent's pushing for school. For shoryu's mom as I'm charachterizing her, it's in charachter, but not so much for Minori's parents, so I think I'll go back and edit Minori's conversation.

Are you referring to real life martial artists? If yes, then no, they don't technically think faster. It's just that with practice most of the processing (for any activity) becomes hardwired as the neural connections adapt, which makes them much more efficient and require less mental capacity.

But, if the transformation to adventurer has made EVERYTHING more efficient, then effectively every single adventurer can manage a lot more data at the same time, and efficiently analyze a huge amount of information. Which does make them smarter, just for the fact that every kind of thought and analysis they are capable of has become way more efficient. Efficient.

Interesting, I'll check it up again afterwards then. But, dunno, even if his parents are so obsessed with school, it's really weird that they'd push for it within hours of meeting their son that has been missing for years and was thought dead...

And again, as said above, it's weird that he'd just go with it so easily, considering how independent he had to become to be successful in LH.

That's true, but you seem to be overestimating the degree to which adventurers get a boost.

The absolute fastest feat in the anime that requires some measure of thinking is Nyanta and Shiroe making a combo with .01 second precision.

That sounds incredibly impressive, but consider this: At 120 beats per minute, sixteenth notes are .125 seconds apiece. Your average Jazz musician playing swing notes is going to play sub-.1 second notes chained to each other. If there's more than .05 seconds of variation, they're going to sound out of time.

So your average Jazz musician can consistently act within .05 seconds, for minutes at a time, either reading sheet music or improvising. And that's at 120 BPM.

Your virtuoso concert pianist is going to lay down 36th notes at much higher tempos

Shiroe and Nyanta pulled it off /once,/ and Nyanta is a very high level specimen of one of the fastest classes in the game. And it's not like they just suddenly gained that ability-- they played together for years, practicing their timing.

The fastest feat in my fic is Minori blinking her spell off and on within (about) .07 seconds. I can turn an electronic stopwatch off and on in about .14 seconds. Minori obviously is faster than a regular human, especially since this is her first time trying this, but even she doesn't get the timing perfectly.

So I'd estimate that, in the anime (don't know about the LN) the maximum speedup adventurers get is about 2x, when they're really really focused, and even then only for brief periods of time.

There's obviously some speedup involved for adventurers to move as quickly as they do (even though abilities work a little on autopilot), but I doubt their regular experience of time is that much more than 1 to 1.

You know, you have a point. How does moving back the last part to the end of the next chapter sound? Content won't be changed much (except to acknowledge it happens later) but I think it would seem more believable.

**** Yeah, be careful- if i was in the LH universe and my kid returned from LH, i wouldnt even mention school for at least a few days.

And, as an adventurer, if i returned to the human world with all of my powers intact, work/school wouldn't even be a thing for me any more. I'd fight with my parents and even blow them off-what are they gonna do?
