Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I am writing a story in which the frequency of which an idea is thought of(as well as it's internal coherency) determines how strong it is. I am wondering what 'magics' that people in our world think about enough for it to be strong.

Wand magic seems to be a stable for as long as Harry Potter have been out.

New age crystal magic seem to be gaining traction as crystals are believed to have healing properties(and are also physical objects that you think about when you see them)

Necromancy seem to be a stable in a lot of fantasy things.

Shapechanging is an old stable and there's a few new werewolf movies/shows happening.

Vampire and zombies are hit.

Staff based magic are present in people's mind due to LoTR.

Some kind of divine blessing.

Technomancy?

A lot of shows/stories features pact magic.

There's a bunch of discliplines under mentalism(clairvoyance/divination/mediumship/mindreading/telekinesis) but I don't know if they are prominent enough in public consciousness to really have mojo.

Alchemy had it's thing but is dead now.

I don't really think that enough people really think about mana based casting for it to be a thing and there's a lot of different ideas about what it should be able to do which damages the internal coherency.

There is a bunch of different superhero movies that features heavily in public consciousness but their abilities are so different that I don't know if they individually would gain enough traction.

Various 'magicians' does a lot of tricks but again I don't know if there's enough coherency between tricks. Spacial magic for sawing people in half?

*** I think that, unless this is a /very/ recent change to the world, viable magics would very quickly change as they would quickly become positive feedback loops and push out other forms of magic in public thought. Once some kind of magic with a low cost to entry (like magic circles, chants, etc) and a visible, benign effect becomes known, people are going to show it off, make it well known, get more people doing it, so on and so forth.

Consider also that urban legends and creepypasta could quickly become memetic massacres if central authorities don't realize they need to create information control measures for them.

If there was certifiable evidence that, say, lead could be turned into gold by a certain reaction, wouldn't that prevent alchemy from dying out since people would place more faith in its methods, and it would gradually grow to be a science just like any other?

** I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas /about the magic/ not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world.

Flesh Magic. Flesh magic is about using the conceptual framework of the transformation of flesh over time (AKA biological processes) to create magical effects. The cost for this is the consumption of the flesh in the concept. Here flesh can mean living, fresh, or decaying flesh of plants or animals (anything alive; or technically anything with complex self sustaining chemical processes). The fresh (in minutes) or living flesh of a person (including the mage themself), animal, or plant can be used for most effects, but decaying or cooked flesh has a lot fewer uses. For example:

- Consume muscle mass to pull something (it can be any direction though), not more than the muscle mass consumed could have, and the amount of mass sacrificed determines how long the enchantment can pull for (though it can be kept and controlled for quite awhile; based on some universal limits).
- A plant that causes drowsiness can be consumed to put someone to sleep (plant flesh tends to last longer).
- Consuming edible flesh (e.g. one would have to be able to eat it in the first place) - the less processed and cooked the better - to gain energy and nutrition, which can be further focused into accelerated healing or muscle growth (or fat growth) by conceptualizing the bodies own processes (though this can be tricky to do all at once).
- Consuming fresh (or living) eyeballs to see like those eyes could, either on yourself directly (lasting longer), or far away (there are universal limits on how remote viewing works).
- Consuming the regenerating limb of an animal to regenerate that limb (at mass for mass conversion). Natural healing is easy, regenerating limbs is hard (it's about conceptual transformation; an arm cannot grow itself, and a tail that can regenerate cannot regenerate an arm).
- Blood is a popular choice of flesh that has it's own specialty magic (and hence gained additional related powers over time).

*** Just to be clear, when you say consume do you mean ingest or is the flesh being consumed by some magical process? If the former, how long does it take for the effects to manifest? Does the flesh have to be digested?

-Could you consume a (or multiple) seahorse/s in the process of changing sex to cause a similar effect in yourself? Or for that matter, produce asexual from eating enough animals in the process of doing the same.

-I forget which animal (might've been a jellyfish) but there's an animal that can sort of reverse aging. Could you do something significant with that?

-electric eels, venomous animals/plants, flying animals, gilled animals?

-I wonder if, in regard to the first bullet point, people might have an incentive to breed animals (or, more likely, a specific animal) towards having better muscle density to get more out of less muscle consumed.

-I'm curious what exactly counts as alive? There's a pretty obvious incentive for people to maintain an organ's freshness. Perhaps with cooling, artificial stimulation, nutrient solutions, etc.

- Breeding Salamanders to get them as large as possible to improve the regeneration process. Also, the axolotl can regenerate basically anything including parts of the brain, which could potentially help with neurodegenerative diseases or in a healthy person it might have enhancive properties.

Sort of like muscle you get an enchantment of some temporary brain power, filtered through their brain patterns, activate-able on demand till it runs out (against universal limits of how many enchantments one can have). For animals this may give you animalisitic instincts, for people this might give you temporary thought patterns similar to theirs, maybe even with memories.

​

Interesting, the magic would have been a lot less powerful if you had to force feed yourself.

​

So does bullet point one apply to sacrifice flying animals for flight? Like does consuming a bird allow you to generate a lifting force equivalent to that bird's capabilities? If so, you'd have to sacrifice [quite a few]([[https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2bn90q/how_many_birds_would_it_take_to_lift_and_fly_a/]]) to lift a human unless you've got pony-sized non-earth birds? Now that I think about it, the number might be greatly reduced since the magically generated lift doesn't have to factor in the weight of the bird, it would still take quite a few birds I imagine. Also, if this is the case it implies stacking, does that hold true for other consumables (multiple eyes for better and better vision, or more and more viewpoints)?

​

>Neurodegenerative diseases and vital brain damage shouldn't be protected by flesh magic was my plan.

​

This is something I've been struggling with in my own magic system, it ain't easy to prevent these types of biological/fleshy magics from effecting brains. So for the whole regeneration thing, say you've got a regenerating animal whose currently in the process of regrowing an arm. Do you have to consume it while it's regenerating its shoulder in order to get regrowth on a human's shoulder, and consume one when it regenerating its forearm to get regrowth on a human's forearm, etc? This could circumvent the brain regeneration thing since the animal would have to be regrowing the exact part of its brain that the human needed to heal, limb regrowth would end up being super tedious, though.

​

​

Let's say you consume a live bird, do you get its ability to generate lift, its eyesight, its cognitive predilections, and whatever else it has to offer?

#+end_quote

Yes, though you have to follow a conceptual version of the birds kinematic model to an extent. For an example you can't fly higher than the bird can, or accelerate faster.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes it does stack but there are universal limits to how many enchantments a mage can hold, but they are kinda minor in the short term (e.g. a mage can apply a significant amount of lifting force, like on the order of magnitude of a plane, before getting close to those limits). And each individual one stacks as it's own enchantment. This has some other minor consequences (re: counter spelling).

Also, stacking generally applies only in one dimension. If you want to lift twice as much twice as fast you need 4 birds (or technically their wings, feathers, and tail) if you also want to double max speed you need 8.

#+begin_quote
  This could circumvent the brain regeneration thing since the animal would have to be regrowing the exact part of its brain that the human needed to heal, limb regrowth would end up being super tedious, though.
#+end_quote

Theoretically, if the arm can regrow then mass for mass you can use it's arm to regrow your arm. If it's whole body can regrow, you can use it's whole body as mass to regrow anything it could.

But for example, the axolotl will only regenerate brain stems. Even then neurodegenerative diseases aren't about regeneration, the brain is there, it's just failing to work properly. For this to be healed one would need something that has a biological process specifically for reversing neurodegenerative diseases. One could use human brains and consume them to make your own work correctly, for example, this would work with many neurdegenerative diseases as a mitigation, but not a cure for them. It's a conceptual magic system, but the concepts have to be true at some point (where the numbers come from; at least for this magic system - others have slightly different rules).

#+begin_quote
  Let's say you consume a live bird, do you get its ability to generate lift, its eyesight, its cognitive predilections, and whatever else it has to offer?
#+end_quote

Yes, however again, universal limits on enchantments means that's not generally useful to keep all of that around (and while taking it all at once contributes less to the limit, the extra stuff does still contribute). And some things may be needed for more than one enchantment, for example the muscles in it's wings are used for the lift enchantment, and hence can't be used for a telekinetic one. Additionally the mage has to conceptualize all of these enchantments at the same time (which is a master level kind of thing).

But if one was going to make an airplane using flesh magic (which is a bad idea because there are better magics for that, with lower economic cost, even without getting into the animal cruelty stuff - fly cruelty free air - but for an ability a flesh mage can pull out of their pocket...) the bird brains might be useful for maneuvering during flight, the eyes to see where one is going (one can never have enough eyes), the hearts to pump hydraulics, the bones to reinforce structure, the flesh for air tight seals (that all depends on what one is trying to make fly, like maybe just a couple of wooden chairs strapped together), and wings, feather, and tails for flight... one would need a lot of birds though, and the mage wouldn't be able to do much else for that whole trip (even if they could use the bird brains as a form of auto pilot).

Athletic yes as a cheat to get there, but it would be expensive to pay for the maintenance on that for all but the uber wealthy. Mages are relatively rare, so think cosmetic surgery, you can't go in every few weeks for an expensive procedure, but going in once and then maintaining that is reasonable.

I don't think beauty is a biological process per-se, neither is permanently increasing in beauty. Though perhaps if one stole it from a young human growing up (but that would be very criminal - it would probably kill them), stealing maturing characteristics of physical beauty from an animal would probably go poorly. A temporary enchantment perhaps one could use an animal for that.

*** As with most things that allow magical healing, this would seem to allow soft immortality - you can still be killed, but slower stuff like diseases would be able to be mitigated by healing with flesh magic. On a societal scale, this (depending on how widespread the magic is) could lead to anything from immortal god-kings to hundreds of years old masters in various fields. This could easily lead to a stronger status quo, societally, as the classical process of new scientific ideas gaining widespread adoption by the old guard dying out might no longer happen.
