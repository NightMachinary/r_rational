  But the magnitude of the mistake that Card makes in deciding that Mormonism is likely true because he can't imagine that someone could write the Book of Mormon, structurally and stylistically and in richness of content, as a hoax... is so irrational I would call it hostile to rationality. 
#+end_quote

The hilarious part to me is that he does this in several of his works, most recently (that I've read) in the Pathfinder trilogy where the world is /literally artificiality constructed and guided./ And the goal of the main characters is to find the truth, break out, and be free. I'd almost call it a 'cry for help' a la "closeted gays are the staunchest anti-gays" if I believed that sort of thing. It certainly is frustrating the mental roadblocks people can have.

** Question: what rhetorical effect do you think it would have on your essay if you timestamped your OSC quotes? For example:

#+begin_quote
  *In 1990*, Card also said that gay sex is sinful and that not just gay marriage but sex should remain illegal
#+end_quote

This doesn't strike me as all that weird. Go back to 1990 and poll people; you'll find that a supermajority of Americans believed the same thing. It's hard to find a politician (democrat or republican) who /wasn't/ anti-gay marriage in 1990. I guess the most radical part of this statement is that he said "I think the laws that are currently in effect should remain in effect, status quo = good"?

You did timestamp one of his remarks as being "as recently as 2008":

#+begin_quote
  as recently as 2008 after judges began ruling gay marriage bans unconstitutional
#+end_quote

As an alternative to talking about what some judges were doing at the time, here's another way you could contextualized 2008:

#+begin_quote
  back in 2008, *when California (the most liberal state in the union by most measures, perhaps tied with New York) passed a ballot proposition by popular vote defining marriage as being between a man and a woman*
#+end_quote

Following 2008, we also had 5 years of presidency under an Obama that did not openly support gay marriage. So in this case, Card was indeed guilty of harboring anti-gay sentiment at around the same time that California voters affirmed "no gay marriage" and democrats nominated a presidential candidate who didn't openly support gay marriage (and then 4 years later we elected him again).

#+begin_quote
  He has pushed the frame that homosexuality is more environmental than genetic
#+end_quote

My recollection is that this wasn't a rare view within the scientific community in the 00's, and this wasn't even strictly speaking a partisan thing; there were plenty of gay advocates (and gay individuals) who in the past ascribed to the belief in environmental factors over genetic. The position I recall being the standard when I was in university at the time was, "It may be genetic, it may be environmental; to me the question is largely academic and irrelevant to the question of whether or not gay people deserve civil rights."

#+begin_quote
  I do not use that word lightly: it is one thing to say that you disagree with gay marriage, it is another to publicly state your position, and then it is yet another entirely to go to the lengths Card has gone to crusade against it.
#+end_quote

Do you think that Card has done more or less to harm gay people than, say, the democrats who controlled congress when Don't Ask Don't Tell passed under president Clinton?

I feel like the main thing that separates Orson Scott Card from these sorts of people (pick a Clinton or a democratic congressman) is that they all shifted views by 2013, whereas Orson Scott Card still believes the same things today that he (and essentially everyone within mainstream discourse) believed back in the 00's. And as I stated at the top of this post, I'm pretty sure that this is because the Mormon church has yet to update their beliefs.

The impression I have of most Mormons (of which you will find many other within science fiction and fantasy, see Brandon Sanderson and Stephanie Meyer for prominent examples) is that most of them are on board with what the church believes, and right now, that means believing that marriage is between a man and a woman (and if you're someone like Brandon Sanderson or Stephenie Meyer, doing everything you can to avoid talking about it in public). These people's stance "I am Mormon, and my position on gay marriage matches that of the Mormon church" would remain if the church's view changed tomorrow (which is to say, they would all be okay with gay marriage if the church was.

I'm sure you can mount a defense of democrat politicians not supporting gay marriage publicly because it was the politically expedient thing to do, even if these politicians did go as far as saying, for example, "Marriage has historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman." Maybe when Hillary Clinton said those words, she secretly believed in her heart believed that gay marriage was okay, and then she publicly changed her stance in 2013 after it was clear that supporting gay marriage wouldn't damage her politically, so really she was actually pro-gay all along, and it was okay for her to pretend to be anti-gay marriage because that's what it took to get elected.

To me, this idea of politicians who change views when the pollsters them gay marriage is okay seem analogous to the idea of a religious person who suddenly changes stance when the church tells them it's okay. I'm curious as to how you think "I said what I had to in order to get elected" ethically compares to "I said what I had to in order to be on board with the slate of beliefs that is supposed to get me into heaven."

Two possibilities:

- Card agrees with whatever the church's position is, and would support gay marriage if the church did. But right now, church says gay = sin, so Card believes gay = sin because that is part of the slate of beliefs he has signed up for.
- Card is anti-gay marriage, and if the church changed its mind, he would go against the church and continue to advocate against gay marriage. Under this model, his religious objections are merely a convenient cover for his more deeply-held belief that gay = bad; if the church changed its views, he would be exposed as not really being a true Mormon.

You seem to argue for the latter...while also claiming that Card's problem is that he considers Mormonism important above all else (including an honest pursuit of the truth)? I am deeply confused by this. Is Card's main loyalty to Mormonism, or hating gay marriage?

My impression from at least Brandon Sanderson is that, yes, he stands by the church's view of homosexuality, but he is a lot more nuanced about it than Card is. Compare [[https://brandonsanderson.com/euology-dumbledores-homosexuality/][this]] to some of the stuff Card wrote.

Note that this is from 2007 (with a preface/disclaimer added in 2011), so 2 to 5 years before the moment you're saying the majority started shifting views in America. As you mentioned he has since stopped talking about it in public (wisely, I think), so we don't really know how much his view has shifted over the last 8 years.

*** You raise a good point about the year stamps, and I linked to each article so that people can follow the timeline themselves, but when someone continues to hold a belief into the present day I don't think it's all that important, to be honest. If OSC came out for gay marriage and I wrote a piece saying he's not a REAL ally to gay people because he said X and Y and Z and I didn't include how long ago that was, I think that would be misleading. But since he still basically believes all that, I don't really care when he thought it unless he's written about how he has meaningfully changed his mind since. If you have any examples of that, please do share it.

But "he was anti-gay marriage at a time most people were" doesn't really excuse it, to me, because I hold him to a higher standard. To be frank, most people are pretty dumb, politicians included. OSC demonstrated that he could think. His valuing his faith over his reason feels like a moral failing in a way that [insert Democratic Politician] not being particularly more intelligent than their constituents, or pretending not to be, doesn't.

#+begin_quote

DADT was a compromise between those who wanted to allow openly gay members to serve and those who wanted to find and remove gays from the military, iirc. Are you referring to the democrats who voted against Clinton? Obviously they did more than OSC, but I don't know if that's about power or intention. You just made me realize I didn't read a single thing about his views of gays in the military, and I just searched specifically for it and couldn't find anything. Maybe I'm just being optimistic, but I actually wouldn't be surprised if he was okay with it.

If Card's concept of Mormonism is shaped by his personal views and faith rather than what the church ultimately decides Mormonism is, that would resolve the confusion I think. I don't know for sure if that would be his reaction to it obviously, and it's a large reason why I wish he'd written something about black Mormons before or after the policies changed.

Ultimately I think his faith is meaningful, but just blaming his faith isn't enough simply because there are people who are raised Mormon who either leave the church or stay and accept homosexuality. It's an explanation, not an excuse.

And that justification would not necessarily have /anything whatsoever/ to do with a secret deep-seated bigotry (though a secret deep-seated bigotry would certainly be /sufficient,/ it's also far from /necessary)./

This is kind of a funny statement as there are quite a few historic examples of major view changes. E.g., polygamy, black people being allowed into heavy, etc. Most recently they enacted a policy of not allowing children of gay parents to be baptized a few years ago and then reversed it this year.

My anecdotal observation is that most people defended the prior bad position but then switched views with the church and were happy when the church got rid of bad positions (esp. black people and baptizing children of gay people)

****** It is different within the framework of Mormonism, tho. Even when blacks were disallowed the priesthood (~lay clergy) there was a corpus of doctrine that stated this was a temporary measure--from the perspective of eternity, I suppose. It was supposed to be in force so long as the world existed, and then be lifted in the afterlife (so much for that), so merely "moving the timeline" on that is at least doctrinally /compatible/, if obviously not socially until the time it happened. How much of this is a post-hoc cover up is left as an exercise to the reader.

On the other hand I'm not sure what Watsonian justification would be used to permit for homosexual marriages, since so much of the lore insists that marriage and having children is something that continues into the afterlife and thus requires both sexes. It seems to me this is something the church will stand on, as they don't (doctrinally) have any other choice.

Not absolutely, of course; they might just think the reasoning in one hand is sufficient while the other isn't, or felt the latter was a step too far and would have acted the same if the order of them was reversed, or if some other major belief was changed.

There's a lot more historical precedent for "sexuality is regulated by God/society" than color-based racism though. Maybe not in Mormonism, which was racist from the get-go, but even the earliest Mormons still came from a Judeo/Christian social background.

The whole "black people can't be priests because they were cowardly souls in the spirit realm" stuff was invented and then disavowed in a 150 year span. Religious and societal regulation of sexuality, including forbidding homosexuality, has been around a really long time.

Not that it would make SENSE to trust in the Mormon church on one but not the other, because it wouldn't, either the current President is a real prophet or not, that's pretty foundation to the religion. I'm just saying the two issues aren't exactly equivalent.

** Is it so hard to believe that bigots can write good literature?

Ender's Game is brilliant, but it did not surprise me at all when Card turned out to be a bigot. His beliefs about traditional gender rules are pretty evident in his work, including in Ender's game. Look at Valentine. Look at Petra, very clearly painted as an exception. I can't remember the exact quote but the text even explicitly makes statements to the effect of even though battle school is co ed in practice girls just don't make it into the program, can't fight millions of years of evolution. If your eyes are open to it you can see the sexism right there on the page.

If you were surprised when Scott turned out to be this way, it only means that at whatever age you read Ender's game the things he wrote did not stand out as objectionable to you yet (this is pretty understandable). For those who are still surprised, i recommend re-reading the stories, with an adult, modern eye.

Same with CS Lewis, who is mentioned here, his work is explicitly religious obviously but it's easy to see racism in the depiction of the Calormen if you're open to seeing it. There was an entire passage on washing off blackface that they used to disguise themselves and being "white Narnians" again.

Edit: I have located the exact quote

#+begin_quote
  "A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them. None of them will be like Valentine, anyway. But there'll be brothers there, Ender."
#+end_quote

This, in no way undermines that he wrote an amazing story. It's possible to be both sexist and a good writer. It's possible that /work you like/ contains sexism and racism or was written by someone like that. To be...not just surprised, but shocked...I get it, I don't mean to deny the feeling of betrayal

(I guess I'm a bit bitter about people who feel betrayed only /now/ as adults, because /I/ was betrayed right then, as a child, reading those words on the page /stung/ right then and there, to realize that the evil calormen were meant to depict /my people/, the people who were to weak for battle school were /women/, and I'm not a woman but... it still jumped out, in part because I wasn't necessarily mature enough to dismiss it as just bigotry, part of me was worried it might in fact be the /horrible truth/ of the matter)

...but it says more about our denial about how pervasive racism and sexism are, as if they are the property of some dark corner of our culture rather than /the overwhelming default/. I think it's safe to say /the majority/ of the work one personally enjoys and draws inspiration from contains some problematic stuff, because the majority of work in general contains it.

It's hard to /not/ see it as racist, but perhaps it was Fair For Its Day as tvtropes would say.

The Horse and His Boy has a black girl as one of the two main characters and ends with an "interracial" marriage (Aravis is a Calormene and therefore black, Shasta is a white Archenlander).

In The Last Battle (IMO, a pretty awful book) one of the Calormenes is lauded as a good person and true servant of Aslan even though he had worshiped Tash in his life. The idea that because he had a good heart and did good deeds, he was saved even though he worshiped the "wrong" god.

Unfortunately I'm pretty sure those are the only positive portrayals of Calormenes in the series. Aravis has a friend who is an airhead but not a bad sort, but that doesn't count for much. Hmm, Susan was actually considering marrying the black Calormene prince until he turned out to be a dickwad - if it'd been a movie instead of a book, I bet it'd've been protested because of the depiction of a white woman being courted by a black man.

** Thanks for posting, was an interesting read. I've thought about this before in the past as well, Orson Scott Card is an amazing author and the extended Enders Game series is one of my favorite series of all time, but some of thing things he says at times outside of his books seem unnecessarily fanatical.

It's complicated because for me Orson Scott Card is in a weird limbo where he's not quite hurtful enough with the things he says to fit neatly in the category of hateful bigot but also not quite innocent enough to perceive him as a merely misguided but otherwise pious and loving man. Most people I know about seem to lean more heavily towards these extremes but Card seems to have found some sort of awkward middle ground. At the end of the day I've had to accept that while I believe his ideas are harmful, I've ever read from him can reasonably be construed as hate speech so he has as much right as anyone else to free speech. And as you say, you can always appreciate his books independently from the flaws of the author.

Watch video of him talking and he doesn't come across as straight... which isn't definitive, some straight men do have a camp affect, but still.

Now read the plot summary of his book Songmaster: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songmaster]]

It's about a sexy young boy who is given drugs to delay his puberty and preserve his beautiful voice (a kind of castrato that in the world of the book is called a Songbird). He gets lots of sexual attention from older men, including a guard who is punished for groping him.

Here's how the book ends:

#+begin_quote
  Ansset eventually offers himself to the young man, saying, "I know what you want, and I'm willing". Josif lovingly brings the boy to his first climax. As Ansset experiences his first ever orgasm, he experiences enormous pain. The Songhouse drugs have almost killed him and he is forever impotent.
#+end_quote

Orson Scott Card is always writing about pubescent boys, lots of naked wrestling in Ender's Game. He even makes up a sci-fi reason why the boy in Songbird stays pubescent but is technically over age.

Songbird is full of homoeroticism, but anyone who actually does any kind of gay stuff gets punished. Notice also how the enemy aliens in Ender's Game are called “Buggers”.

It's pretty clear that he's sublimating his own desires in his writing. He wants nothing more than to lovingly bring a young twink to climax, but that's so sinful for him to admit that, even when exploring his desires in fiction, he has to invent a contrived pretext where cumming from gay sex would cause terrible pain and suffering - which of course makes no sense; why would a drug that delays puberty make it hurt to have an orgasm?

No straight man would write a book like this, about the temptations of gay sex, because straight men aren't tempted to have gay sex. Only closeted gay men who have been forced to spend their entire life denying to themselves that they're gay.

I feel sorry for OSC. If he hadn't been born into such a conservative environment, he'd probably be a happy daddy bear with a husband half his age. Instead, he's had to force himself to father 5 children. The reason he's so against gay marriage and the idea that gay people are born that way is that he's spent his whole life fighting his own desires. If being gay is OK, if gay marriage is allowed, then it means all his battles mean nothing; he could have had companionship and intimacy with someone who he was actually attracted to, and his honeymoon wouldn't have been a grim charade of trying to hide his distaste for vagina.

Both are relatively meaningless these days, and are most often used to express loathing; therefore, while the loathing may be sincere, the words become less than helpful in serious discussion. .. Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of homosexuals that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose homophobia could be regarded as the technical word for that. The overwhelming majority of the cases where I've seen homophobia used, however, it was used not to describe the pathological condition, but rather as an ugly word to fling at anyone who does not go along with the political agenda or self-story of various activist wings of the American homosexual community. If you don't accept the full politically-correct line .. then you are a homophobe in the view of these people. Frankly, I find that this quickly turns into a delicious hypocrisy: Those whose agenda is "tolerance" and who insist that ugly words like faggot not be used against them have found an exactly analogous word to use as a weapon in their virulent intolerance of those who disapprove of either their behavior or their political agenda.

    They use the word to silence opposition, to subvert legitimate discussion. Those who use the word this way are so convinced of the righteousness of their cause that they are willing to deny the right of others to disagree with them. Thus, in the name of tolerance of diversity, they seek to force others into a perfect uniformity of thought. The fascism of the left is no more attractive than the fascism of the right.

**** Sure. I was criticising not the “analogous” in your interpretation, but the “exactly”. Compare: 1) “A and B are exactly the same.” 2) “In some cases, A and B are exactly the same.” The first implies that the two "functions" “match” (or correspond to each other) all the time, while the second only implies that they match only in some of their sections. So there's a significant difference in Card's statement compared to your interpretation of it.

Card was saying that “faggot” and “homophobe” are analogous when those who use them are so convinced of the righteousness of their cause that they are willing to deny the right of others to disagree with them. That they use these words:

- as ad hominem attacks without any real meaning behind them;
- not as valid arguments in a serious discussion, but as a weapon to derogate the opponent when they don't go along with the user's political agenda;
- to silence opposition, to subvert legitimate discussion;
- to force others into a perfect uniformity of thought.

So when these conditions are met, the sets of usage for these two words intersect, making their usage analogous to each other. The “homophobe's” set still has areas outside of this intersection, which Card either doesn't address at all or hesitantly accepts to be an accurate usage for the term “homophobe” (Ctrl+F to "Likewise).

What your interpretation of Card is saying, on the other hand, is that “faggot” and “homophobe” are exactly analogous, and that's pretty much it.

Your interpretation of Card trivialises Card as someone using the word homophobe in the abovementioned manner would be trivialising a target who is presenting complex arguments that the user of the word doesn't want to understand or agree to.

Is such a spineless and grudging admission of the existence (but not prevalence) of homophobia that honestly I find it a minor point of evidence toward him actually being homophobic.

Imagine reading this:

#+end_quote

You "suppose," OSC? How good of you. Just the "technical word," of course, which brings to mind "technically, but not actually."

Maybe I'm not being charitable, so I'll be extra clear about why I think he's wrong in this:

Faggot is a derogatory slur that has no meaning other than to degrade a sexual orientation. Other than cigarettes or bundles of sticks, it has literally no other use.

Homophobe is a label for a type of bigotry, no different than "racist" or "sexist." It has use as more than an insult; there is no other word to describe someone who yells "I'm going to kill you faggots!" at gay people.

Card can disagree with the use of homophobe against him, and there are definitely those who use homophobe too loosely in the way he describes. But by calling the two analogous, even by specifying that he just means as a political weapon, he's showing his ignorance of the actual dynamics of what life for homosexual is like.

People started calling people faggots because they hated that they were gay. Not because it reflects on anything they believe or said.

People started calling people homophobes because those people hated/feared gay people. And yes, sometimes because they hate those people for hating/fearing gay people, or just appearing to.

OSC is trying to equivocate the two because it serves him politically to do so. It protects himself, it protects his allies, it furthers his cause of disenfranchising homosexuals. It even resolves dissonance when people use the word to describe him to just dismiss them as trying to "shut down debate" or "censor disagreement."

It's neither of those things: it's just the word that arose for people who argue against equal rights for gay people. If it shuts down a discussion he's been in, it's because that discussion was deemed unproductive and harmful by someone else, and if he disagrees with that, well, he's not really the one who gets to make that judgement.

His attempt to equate them in any way is no different from any other attempt to discredit attacks on intolerance by equivocating it with intolerance. It's a semantic shellgame, and pretty empty of substance in most circumstances, I've found.

I think by replacing homophobia with racism you are cutting out the very reason for the hesitant tone of his admission. As some context / examples, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia#Criticism_of_meaning_and_purpose][here's Wikipedia's current take on the problems with the word “homophobia”,]] and here's [[https://www.conservapedia.com/Homophobia#Term_of_Insult_or_Manipulation][Conservapedia's,]] for the perspective.

#+begin_quote
  Faggot is a derogatory slur that has no meaning other than to degrade a sexual orientation. Other than cigarettes or bundles of sticks, it has literally no other use.
#+end_quote

That's incorrect but beside the point. Whether or not it has other uses is irrelevant, because the analogy he's talking about isn't about the background of the used words and about the manner and purpose of their usage. And “faggot” as a derogatory word can and is often used for the purposes highlighted in my previous comment.

#+begin_quote
  Homophobe is a label for a type of bigotry, no different than "racist" or "sexist." It has use as more than an insult; there is no other word to describe someone who yells "I'm going to kill you faggots!" at gay people.
#+end_quote

Which is again beside the point, since the genuine use of that word, one that isn't an ad hominem with washed out meaning, was not what he was talking about when he was drawing the analogy. You are missing the point, but I'm not sure how to rephrase my previous comment to better convey what I'm trying to say. Perhaps someone else will manage to articulate the thought better.

#+begin_quote
  If it shuts down a discussion he's been in, it's because that discussion was deemed unproductive and harmful by someone else, and if he disagrees with that, well, he's not really the one who gets to make that judgement.

And now you're making baseless assumptions and trying to strip him of his agency without addressing his arguments themselves.

Let's go back to conflict theory vs mistake theory. I think Card is in Conflict Theory mode. I do not think he is seeking Truth, I do not think Truth on this topic concerns him: I think he has deep seated sacred beliefs (literally) that he is defending at all costs from those he believes will destroy something good and precious, and that attitude shifts his approach from one of clear sight to one of defensiveness and dismissiveness of anything that challenges his beliefs.

Without going into specifics of what exactly those beliefs are yet, do you agree with that much?

I disagree on №1 (in a 3-valued logic, with the value being "unknown", rather than "false"). I agree on №2 (though I'm not completely sure, but it at least looks like it). And I agree on №3, but probably draw different conclusions from it than you. The conclusions being that just because he's being defensive doesn't mean you can automatically judge him being in CTm and dismiss his argument, and have to instead still properly dismantle his arguments to criticise his opinions and his position.

Some further elaborations follow.

--------------

I admit that the conflict theory is very valuable in understanding the motivations of other people, predicting political developments, etc. Further than that, however, I think we'll be facing some disagreements:

- I don't think conflict theory should be considered an acceptable direct argument or counter-argument for several reasons:

  - 1) during the argument itself it's essentially nothing more than a subtype of an ad hominem attack --- your opponent presents you argument X, and instead of addressing that argument itself, you just accuse him of operating in CT mode and simply dismiss his argument. Whether or not his argument itself had any merits, remains undetermined after this;
  - 2) for most of the cases, you won't be able to accurately determine under which mode your opponent is operating without having some mind-reading capabilities, complex psychological profiling software / expertise, etc;
  - 3) if accusation of CTm became a generally acceptable first-level strategy to use, everyone would start using it, and arguments would devolve into meaningless rounds of mutual accusations;
  - 4) entities operating in bad faith by default (e.g. Russia's propaganda school) would be benefiting from such a status quo the most.

- Perhaps it would be ok to rise to a meta-level and involve CT/MT as an argument, but only after your opponent started demonstrating being unreasonable or inconsistent with the nature of their argumentation. Examples of unreasonable attitude would be deliberate use of underhanded techniques (e.g. fallacies, firehose of falsehood, etc), examples of inconsistency would be sticking to the same dismantled opinions without at least addressing the criticism against them, making self-contradictory statements, etc.
- Regarding Card himself, I don't think there was enough information in the context of the current discussion (your article, and his) to determine beyond reasonable doubt that he's acting in bad faith / in CT mode.

  - he explains rather clearly why he thinks homosexuality should not be legalised --- among other things he thinks it will cripple the institutions of marriage and family, destroy his community, and so on. All these are arguments / opinions that can be targeted for criticism directly, with no need to assume bad faith or to resort to CTm against him yourself.
  - besides, wouldn't being in CT mode require for him to hide his true objectives and present false arguments for his audience? In the article he's being pretty straight-forward about his worldview that includes a god, the concept of sin, etc. So there isn't even any need to use CT as a meta-level argument against him, since all you have to do is criticise his worldview (religion, sin, etc).

Not at all. Conflict Theory is not about acting in bad faith: it is about a set of values or beliefs about a situation that simply dismiss as irrelevant certain types of information or arguments.

As an example, someone who believes that Capitalism as a system concentrates power in the hands of the mega-wealthy, who then use that power to serve their own interests at the expense of others, does not care about data or facts that might convince the rich that what they're doing is wrong, because they believe the rich are not "mistaken," but simply waging economic warfare against the poor. The goal is not finding more Truth, it's to acquire enough Power by trying to mobilize the poor that they can fight back. That does not mean they necessarily must act in bad faith, just that their goals and methods are different from someone operating in MTm.

I'm not basing my idea that he's in CTm by just the one article, but by his attitude over the space of decades, not just on homosexuality but on other topics too. I think Card is bad at evaluating truth and arguments that might undermine his sacred values because he's not actually looking for Truth; he's defending Marriage and Families and so on. I think that comes from his CTm.

Does that make sense so far? Sorry I know you wrote a big thing and I just responded to one portion of it, but I want to try to focus in on one crux at a time, and this feels like an important point to establish first. We can address the rest as necessary soon if needed.

******** Rereading some CT/MT-related articles, I admit that I was probably misinterpreting conflict theorists as a group in my previous comment. And probably you were doing so too. Or more accurately, the concept's broad and vague enough by now for both of us to be using different flavours of that concept and creating unintended misunderstanding because we're getting out of sync.

How about this: you give me your own, self-sufficient^{1} definitions / explanations for: 1) [a person operating in conflict theory mode], and 2) seeking Truth (just to be sure); and I'll answer your earlier question of whether or not I think Card operates in CTm.

********* So my understanding of Conflict Theory vs Mistake Theory off the top of my head goes something like this:

Mistake Theory assumes people who disagree with you on major issues that cause harm are just "mistaken." That they lack the right information, and just being properly educated will change their mind. The failure mode is in thinking Truth matters to others more than it often does, reserving judgement on those whose motives will not change over civil conversation; see literally hundreds of famous examples of people throughout history, even just US history, who cover up the truth to serve their own interests, from tobacco and oil companies burying research to US presidents explicitly targeting minorities through the drug war.

Conflict Theory assumes people who disagree with you on major issues that cause harm are just following incentives/values. They know they're doing harm, or they don't care enough about harm to let it stop them, and are just trying to amass or have enough Power to enact their preferences. The failure mode is not just assuming that others' intentions are bad, but that the proper response becomes to care as much about Power as them, which leads to the risk of losing sight of Truth that undermines your perspective or proper solutions; see all those who fall too far along a political ideology and into extremes, and start attacking whole categories of people ("millionaires," or "the media" or "socialists" or "Christians" or whatever) rather than evaluating if their own presumptions are true.

So to me, someone operating in Conflict Theory mode is not trying to find the Truth of their own beliefs or their opponent's arguments. Maybe they know them both thoroughly already, maybe they don't; either way, their mind is Made Up (as far as they believe) and they are much more concerned with gaining power or preventing their opponents from getting power than they are with sitting down with them and trying to hash out who's actually "Correct," because they want something that can only be gotten through power or there's something valuable they think is under attack by those amassing power.

Someone seeking Truth is doing their honest best to falsify their own beliefs until they have enough evidence to withstand strong criticism of it, and is willing to say "I don't know" and not make strong statements or acts until they do, unless they have to. This may be unfair, but anyone sticking with a religion kind of automatically fails at this, unless they are actively seeking out other religions and trying them too, or in the process of digging into every base assumption their religion teaches them.

The /overwhelming majority/, OSC? In 1990? Get the fuck out of here.

Look, I know the world probably looks very different to me and OSC in this regard. My experience of when people get called homophobe is that they said something homophobic. His is that HE or his friends/allies said something people thought was homophobic. I'm sure that makes him dislike the word and think it's just being tossed around as an insult.

Hell, I got frustrated at the word "Islamophobic" for a similar reason when I was younger. It gets used a lot to describe someone who criticizes Islam, but doesn't hate Muslims, as if they just hated Muslims.

But I understood that the reason for that is there were a shit-ton-fuck more people who hated Muslims around than those that just criticized Islam, and they often say many of the same things. Recognizing that moderated my language.

So yes, I find his language insufficient to denote a clear understanding of the world. If someone said something like that in person I would call them on that shit in a heartbeat. I find it mealymouthed and sly, a concession of the least possible kind that somewhere, out there, occasionally, there might be people who legitimately hate or are disgusted by gays, but that the MAJORITY of people called homophobic are mislabeled.

I'm actually a little confused by your skepticism of this claim.

I'm curious what exactly you think the 70s and 80's were like for gay people? Shows like Will and Grace, which are often cited as turning points for common perception of gay people, didn't come out until 1998.

It's something like "insensitive to the breadth and scope of the problem." His response fits my model of someone motivated to not believe homophobia was as big a problem as it was, and his approach to other issues like ACC and Mormonism make me doubt his ability to see the world clearly, which can easily birth or feed into prejudice.

To draw this to my own life again, I genuinely think that people who want to criticize Islam but are unaware of how widespread Islamophobia actually is are failing on a number of levels, and one of those levels may be prejudice. I feel sympathetic to Card in this respect, but my sympathy does not make me judge him less for his response. I didn't stop criticizing Islam when I got frustrated by accusations of Islamophobia, but my whole attitude and rhetoric on it changed. That his response (to me) diminishes the prevalence of actual homophobia and identified homophobia, and paints those pointing to those things in such a negative light, is a point against him.

I don't expect Card to have been hooked into news of all the hatecrimes around the country, hell even with the early-days internet it would have been very difficult for one person to be aware of it all, but the Stonewall Massacre, the assassination of Harvey Milk, the AIDS hysteria... these were hard things to miss, and his language does not convince me that he had a solid grasp of the scope of the problem. /shrugs/ It's a pretty common blind spot, to be honest: most people are not historians or wide consumers of contemporary affairs that don't concern them.

Incidentally, I managed to speak with a few older coworkers about their experiences of the time period. There's a lot of interesting (and often off-topic stuff), and I even recorded a few if you want to listen to them. General consensus was that they rarely heard the word used back then unless applied to someone who was talking about disgust/hatred rather than just protecting marriage, since that was most people's position.

One of them who's gay actually pointed out that, in the New York gay community at least, you'd practically never hear the word "homophobe" used in the 70s or 80s because it was taken for granted that most people outside of liberal cities were, and the most outspoken against gay marriage or culture were more likely to just be called "backwards rednecks, since homophobia was just part of that package." His recollection is that the word gained more popularity after AIDS hysteria blew up, and that while he thinks that was more about fear of disease than homosexuals themselves, at the time most people called that stood out in some way beyond the "run of the mill" nonacceptance, which he said just came from being misinformed, not actual hatred or fear.

He agreed it's overused today, particularly among the gay community talking about "internalized homophobia" (he was against gay marriage and finds effeminate gay men unattractive, so he heard/hears that a lot apparently), but to the hypothetical "If someone in 1990 said that most accusations of homophobia were just being used shut down discussion, do you think it was accurate back then?" he said no.

Obviously his life informs his own view, like OSC's, but yeah, it seems trivially true to me that in the 70s and 80s that Card lived through before he wrote that piece in 1990, "homophobe" was not tossed around carelessly and inaccurately, because fear of gay people, either on an individual or societal-health level, was far more prevalent. Whether or not it's justified to call someone like Card homophobic, then or now, is a different question, of course, but I find Card's attitude at the time unconvincing in a particular way that makes me count it against him.

I refute this point on the ground that both kinds of intolerance are not equivalent.

Reasoning. comming from the premise that gender is something you are not something you choose, then intolerance against people on the base of gender is inescapable. To avoid it you either have to hide what you are, leave or die.

Intolerance against homophobia instead is aimed at something people believe, not something they are. Being homophobe is also is mostly ok in the same vein that being a pedophile is ok, so long you dont act upon it. If you act upon your the homophobia you are acting on someone that cannot feasibly avoid the persecusion. To avoid being attacked for being an homophobe though? That is easy, all you need to do is avoid acting on the homophobia and the attacks should stop or atleast relent. There are others homophobes to persecute.

That is why both kinds of intolerance are not equivalent. One has an easy exit and the other doesnt. And the whole extra pressure of being persecuted for something you have very little control about is also very non equal.

Intolerance against those who are themselves intolerant seem to me as a moral imperative to defend those who cannot escape the persecution

Here's another:

​

" (fun fact: Card studied archaeology before he gave it up for being “hard work”)"

​

Full stop, what is this? Like, why is dude being bad at archaeology going to help anyone learn anything from your post? What's fun about this fact? It seems like you are arguing that this disqualifies him from having an opinion about the Book of Mormon being true, but unless you are about to confess that you are writing this in between digs it seems like you maybe don't actually think only architects get to talk.

​

On an overall level, this is just a meandering take on labels, right?

​

Like, we know on the object level what Card does and will do. He makes it pretty clear. Being a writer, he isn't super bashful about saying stuff.

​

There's an old LW post about how it isn't worth it to beat yourself up about what labels are on stuff, if you agree on the underlying level. Like, 'tree falls in the forest with no one there makes no sound', both the sound guy and the no sound guy agree on all possible predictions, the whole debate is on the definition of 'no one there'.

​

So, like, Card's words tell us what to expect from him, and his actions back that up. Why are you tying yourself in knots trying to figure out if 'bigot', or 'holds bigoted beliefs', or 'has aligned himself with bigots' describes him? What describes him is what he says and does, and that is clear no matter what label it ends up stuck with.

​

A good trick to avoid doing this kind of stuff is to mentally put the person you are talking with/about on the praiseworthy side of a debate. Say it is the past, and OSC is obsessed with stopping people from smoking before that was cool.

​

You wouldn't write this about him then, right? You'd put his priors in place and work out where his beliefs came from, and what they implied, without all this random dunking on dude. You are mad smart, you'd do great at it.

To me understanding the root of something is intrinsic to being able to prevent or stop it.

So, like, the basic failure of empathy is saying you are taking on the other side's priors and then continuing to operate using your own. Like if I'm trying to grok Dan who talks backwards I can't keep thinking that backwards talking is silly and then try to figure out why he loves silliness, what it is about silliness that attracts him, etc. In his mind, this isn't silly, this is reasonable and serious behavior.

​

Similarly, if you are going to step into OSC's mind and talk about the Book of Mormon, you can't say that he needs to be an architect to believe in it but you don't need to be one to scoff at it, because the judgement on which experts are credible is something you took along from your own brain.

Categories are useful because they help us predict behaviors. "Bob is a bigot, black people don't knock on his door if your car breaks down."

Saying I've excluded 4 from the solution space is... kind of insulting, to be honest. It's like you think I'm just so stupid I can't possibly imagine that maybe OSC really is just what he says.

Because I just wanted to bash the poor old man? Because 4 was just /inconceivable/ to me?

Obviously I think it's possible that his stated motivations are his real ones. But my assessment of his words and behavior do not lead me to think that is the most probable state of reality. In all the different possible realities, the ones where his motivations are what he states look /very different/ to me. Being someone who lives in the world and pays attention to history, I've noticed a hell of a lot of people insisting they're not prejudiced who do or say prejudiced things. Do you want me to just throw out those observations? Sounds like you're the one excluding possible answers from solution space.

As I said elsewhere, we can't know what's in other people's hearts. But after a certain point we do have to say we have "enough" justification to at least tentatively believe in one explanation, while holding ourselves open to other explanations that might gather evidence. Maybe you just have a higher threshold for this than I do, and that's fine: sometimes I'll be too quick to judge, and sometimes you'll be too slow too. But I don't think OSC deserves to be let off the hook as simply as 2+2=4 simply because he states that he's not prejudiced.

/shrugs/ Idunnoman. Life and people are more complicated than that; worst part is some people legitimately don't know or realize they're prejudiced, and so are being 100% honest and sincere when they insist they're not. And then they still say gay people shouldn't adopt kids because it's bad for the kids/the fabric of society, despite all the evidence against that, and then falling back on "my particular interpretation of God said so" when they have nothing left.

** Good post, always nice to see some sane political discussion that doesn't immediately devolve into shouting.

With regards to religious views versus emotional bigotry, I'm not really sure about Orson Scott Card, but I think this is much more obvious with people like Ben Shapiro. When Ben says that he unfortunately cannot attend Dave Rubin's gay wedding because of his religion, I don't believe for a second that he is secretly disgusted by Dave. I am willing to take him at his word there. But when he talks about Palestine versus Israel, there's a degree of vitriol and irrationality that enters his speech that you simply do not see when he talks about gay people. So I think this is a clear example of these two separate kinds of bigotry, and in the same person to boot.

Of course all the examples you name in your post are w.r.t. right wing views, but I actually think that the refusal to acknowledge different kinds of bigotry is itself a form of left-wing bigotry. I have been told in the past by left-wing people when they found out that I liked Ender's Game that "this tells me everything I need to know about you". If that's not bigotry, what is? And when it comes to not caring about the truth... I have literally had people tell me that they view socialism as an /axiom/; that they literally view it as an end in and of itself. When I pressed them on their logical grounds for this, they happily stated that they do not believe logical consistency to be worth pursuing.

In other words, I suspect that those who decry Orson Scott Card as 'just another right-wing bigot' are, themselves, bigots who do not much care to find out what their political opponents actually believe. A lack of understanding makes it so much easier to hate.

The reason I'm calling it the same phenomenon is because that kind of lazy thinking is the exact what's causing so much needless pain and misery in the world right now.

Let me ask you a question: Do you really believe that this person I quoted does not also have prejudices about minorities? That they do not call right-wing black people Uncle Toms, maybe? That they do not talk about needing to protect our fragile women, or call right-wingers virgins and closet homosexuals as an insult? How on earth are we supposed to get people to become wiser, if some kinds of prejudice are considered 'not that bad' or 'not really bigotry' just because it's coming from people on our side? And yet wherever I go, those kinds of comments get excused by intelligent, thoughtful left-wing people, purely out of partisanship.

Ironically enough, it was the New Atheists who were originally accused of that kind of thinking, of worshipping blind utilitarianism and replacing one kind of faith with another. But in reality it was the Social Justice types who rejected the New Atheists that ended up making that mistake - perhaps precisely because the New Atheists had been warned about it so many times. I certainly respect people like Sam Harris, or even Jordan Peterson who you mention, a lot more than those folks.

Mormonism actually has precedent for God revealing things that the church wasn't ready for, the biggest example being the Law of Consecration, which was essentially communistic. Basically each family would regularly sit down with the bishop, determine how many of their assets were necessary for their need, and the excess would be allocated into the bishop's storehouse, to be redistributed to those without and/or to be used by the church itself.

Following the catastrophic failure of the system, God shrugged and said the people weren't ready, and instituted the "lesser law" of tithing as had been done anciently, which is still in force today.

Apologists claim the same deal would apply with the black priesthood ban, that had it been lifted before the US was on the same page it would have gone poorly. This isn't as totally out of left field as it sounds, considering that Utah was nearly invaded due to the polygamy practice, and that was only lifted when the US government basically threatened to sieze all places of worship held by the church, including the temples which are so central to Mormonism. It's easy to see how reactionary this would make the leadership.

Mormonism squares this circle by claiming that Jesus is the same as Jehovah, which is to say if it's not consistent with the mortal teachings of the man in the New Testament, it's at /least/ par for the course for the Old. It's also claimed that his mortal ministry was supposed to exemplify mortal conduct, while the actions taken in a godly office are supposed to often be tough choices of letting the world go stagnant vs pruning the population to select for believers.

Also remember that the absolute negative utility of death is not nearly so absolute within a framework where literally everyone is going to be resurrected and granted an immortal body at the end of time. Under such a framework and with Mormonism's perspective of life being a brief 60 year stretch between two gulfs of millions-plus-years existences, the worst injustices and sufferings of mortality are supposed to be somewhat less severe than they seem; a cost for the whole system to function, waste heat produced while elevating mortals.

Which is scant comfort if they've flubbed some of the fundamentals, there.

Under Mormon doctrine they do have the same interchangeability of morality as you mention, but you're correct about the rejection of the trinity. The father, son, and holy spirit are considered separate individuals. It's easiest to consider those three as titles or offices; Mormons treat the father's given name as Elohim, and the son's given name as Jehovah, with the rank of "God" and the job description of "Father" and "Son", respectively.

Thus earth's existence has had Jehovah presiding over it as God in the world's longest on-the-job training, with Elohim only occasionally stepping in, such as when Jehovah was being a mortal, when directing the creation of the world, or when providing character references ("this is my beloved son").

As to the former - gender and family go to the heart of our beliefs about the nature of heaven, and a relationship that excludes one of the genders and excludes the possibility of children cannot match the gold standard according to those beliefs.

I think you'll find that /most/ members of the church still have no answers about the whys and wherefores of that. And those that do have answers, are probably just guessing.

What I can say is, there was never any scriptural mandate for restricting the priesthood by race, and it's not entirely clear how the policy came about. As far as I have been able to tell, it was largely due to Brigham Young's influence, and while he was the president of the church, he never claimed to be infallible and we don't believe he was. Beyond that, there's a lot of, "I really don't know." And it was all before my time.

Have you ever in good faith attempted to falsify your own beliefs? Have you ever looked into the historicity of the Book of Mormon?

There are a great many problems with the claims made by that book. It claims to document ancient Mesoamerican civilizations which did not exist. There was no such person as "Jared" and there was no such thing as the "Tower of Babel." There was never such a people as the "Nephites." There was never such a people as the "Lamanites," and Native Americans /definitely/ and /indisputably/ did /not/ descend from a few Middle Eastern Hebrew families. That book /definitely/ claims that ancient Jews migrated to +the US+ the Americas thousands of years ago, which is a thing that /definitely and indisputably did not happen in any capacity whatsoever./

Mormonism is less than half a step above Scientology on the scale of "most obviously fabricated/invented religions to have ever been fabricated/invented" (obviously /every single religion which has ever existed/ was fabricated/invented, but the con artists who fabricated/invented Scientology and Mormonism in particular left glaring paper trails documenting the fact that they just made it all up).

How would we know if we'd found it? A lot of Mesoamerican writing is iconographic. With the culture itself long gone, and without the ability to read what they wrote, how would we know whether any given artifact was owned by people of semitic descent?

Can you elaborate on this? The Book of Mormon does not clearly identify which region of America it takes place in; what do you consider to be "basic mistakes"?

Interestingly, it does make specific claims about Arabian geography, from the initial migration, and those claims are startlingly accurate.

There is no reason for you to try and defend Mormonism's version of history other than that you were (probably) raised to believe it. To the rest of the world, it's blatantly false because all the evidence is against it.

If you consider yourself any kind of rationalist (maybe you're just here for the entertaining stories, which is fine too), my suggestion is to head on over to [[/r/AskHistorians]] and try to open your mind to the idea that, like 99.99% of the planet's religious people, you're just believing what you were raised to believe because you were raised to, not because there's any better reason for you to believe it than them to believe their religious histories.

If religion is infallible, then you should follow it, but you should also make sure it actually is infallible. Especially when the Holy text literally shows scripture being quoted for evil. If religion is fallible, why should you follow it instead of ethics based on simple principles rather than narrative? I frankly don't think there's a good answer to this question. This is especially germane to the issues at hand, because if the practices and social mores are created by people; then what's the point of believing them rather than living a life based off of simple principles and their consequences?

It actually doesn't make very many historical claims. It's a religious history, with the authors explicitly and repeatedly stating that they left out most of the names and dates and places, because a) those things weren't the aim, and b) there wasn't room to write all of that.

There are a number of city names, but with no precise locations, only vague directions between them, and little indication of how such names might appear in writing, especially since Mesoamerican writing appears to be largely iconographic. Likewise the names of rulers, which would be even more of a needle in a haystack.

There are implications that the climate was quite warm, but that's not much to go on.

There are names of plants and animals, but exactly how they match up to the names we might use now is unclear. Still, the [[https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Basic_principles#Question:_What_is_an_anachronism.2C_and_what_should_be_borne_in_mind_when_assessing_the_Book_of_Mormon_.28or_any_other_text.29_for_supposed_.22anachronisms.22.3F][trend over time]] has been to discover that more and more of the claimed species did, in fact, exist.

If it helps, I'm quite willing to admit that there is insufficient historical/archaeological evidence to prove the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, although I could point out some remarkable guesses that Joseph Smith would have had to make in order to forge it. But ultimately, I haven't tried to prove it archaeologically, and as previously stated, I doubt that there can be enough certainty to either prove or disprove it that way.

The stated aim of the Book of Mormon was to testify of Jesus Christ and invite people to come to Him. It shouldn't be surprising at all that we don't learn very much detail from it about geography, language, architecture, or politics. It touches on all of those briefly, and more, but it never goes into real depth with any of them, because they're not the point.

*********** Alright. I think the value of Truth should be self explanatory. Little truths add up to big truths, which change beliefs. Any truth that is counter to your expectations should be especially valuable, because it means that your overall schema is wrong. Maybe slightly, maybe majorly; that's kinda the whole value at the heart of the scientific method.

Anyways back to the original topic. The Mormon church has a history of supporting bigotry and suppression of the rights of disenfranchised groups. Orson Scott Card actively championed those beliefs; that makes him a bigot.

Its members as far as I can tell, seem relatively unconcerned by the effects of the political actions of their church (or they've left). Casual acceptance of bigotry has very little effective difference from active support of bigotry. Financial contributions move that into active bigotry.

Finally, I haven't read a convincing reason why to listen to or respect such beliefs, especially legally. They're not the truth; members seem unconcerned with the truth when it becomes inconvenient. Either it's "I don't care to research it," or "we can't know," or worst of all "it's lost to the sands of time. (50 years ago)" These responses not only enable bigotry; they also prevent members from examining the present to prevent the same mistakes in the future.

These beliefs don't come from a coherent set of principles, because said principles are never named; having families and believing what leadership tells you seem to be the only principles that I can see. Worst of all, these beliefs seem to be constantly changing, yet their adherents don't seem to understand how that affects the relationship of the current beliefs to the objective truth.

Eh, the OP put it better than me when he said, "But I think it's important to note that, while hatred is about values, prejudice is ultimately built on poor thinking. One can be solved by education, another can't.

Unless, of course, the value of Truth is too low on the hierarchy. There's a chance that Truth just doesn't matter overly much to Card. He has too many beliefs that come not just from the land of ignorance but of falsehood. "

That's a very old question - "If God is good, why is there suffering?" - and not one I can properly address in a few sentences.

These people were /murderers/ many times over, capped by killing the prophets who came to call them out. They were killed because their body count piled up too high to let it continue.

Let's say we get those two things up and running and it's all safe and effective. Two lesbians can conceive a child who is biologically related to each parent in /exactly/ the same way that every other child is related to his/her parents, and two gay guys can do the same with the additional step of an artificial womb.

The fact that penetrative sex doesn't occur should have no relevance, because "test tube babies" are born all the time and no one bats an eye, I don't think people really even think of them as "test tube babies" anymore because that's just how fertility treatment is done. Disregarding any discussion of adopting/fostering, or the fact that there are already /way/ too many people and maybe reproduction /should/ be limited, we're maybe less than a decade out from the first homosexual couple producing biological offspring.

How does your perspective on homosexuality change in a world where homosexuality is /not/ a "dead end"?

I'm confident that /without/ the possibility of children belonging biologically to both parents, the church will never consider single-gender and mixed-gender relationships to have equal religious value. /With/ - well, time will tell.

Certainly our doctrine places a high value on children having the right to be raised by their parents, so if we do start seeing children born to two fathers or two mothers, there would need to be some kind of shift to accommodate that. I've not heard anything from the pulpit to define what that shift might be, though.

** This is a /very/ well done piece of propagandistic persuasion.

In the attempt to point out the biases of its target, stepping back for a moment and look at it, all it really accomplishes is confirming the biases of its writer.

The writer apparently went into this hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero", only to realize that they held opposite opinions on some very key beliefs. The mental anguish of this discovery led to lashing out an accusing the person of insanity or mental degradation rather than accept the much more sane possibility that that person /did not believe the same as the writer did/. It's a simple truth of life that no human is perfect, and no person will completely agree with you on everything.

#+begin_quote
  “false beliefs about a specific demographic that knowingly disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic.”
#+end_quote

This is the definition of 'bigotry' established by the writer. At no place is this established in relation to OSC. The closest thing to fulfilling the definition is pointing out that OSC thinks that same-sex marriage is a sin. This is not a false belief, it is in direct congruence with his religious beliefs. The belief is not even false in general terms, as all longstanding religions have the same tenet. OSC writing and working for his beliefs does not make them false. If one wants to take offense at the concept of 'sin', then one must follow a religion without such a concept or have no religion at all, in which case the proper response is "so what?"

OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  if you've spoken with bigots at all, they always have justifications for bigotry.
#+end_quote

All people have justifications for what they believe. Is the original writer implying that this is not the case? It must be strange to discover that other people might have rational reasons for their beliefs, but it should not be a surprise.

#+begin_quote
  So what were Card's views on black Mormons?
#+end_quote

I wondered how long it would take before the racist card would be played. About halfway through the article, it seems. The amusing part is that OSC doesn't much seem to care, but observe the written trickery that seems to accuse OSC of racism despite not showing racist tendencies.

It's about at the Obama portion that this entire thing falls apart, and it's right at the moment where *THIS* :

#+begin_quote
  While Card doesn't quite fit that pattern, and breaks from it entirely in some places, he made one that seems to run parallel to it in other places.
#+end_quote

Turns into *THIS*:

#+begin_quote
  Do I think he would have said that if Obama wasn't black?
#+end_quote

One comment that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted?

Yeah, no. I'm sorry, but just because the writer believes that Bush is more stupid than Obama, it doesn't mean that OSC disagreeing with him means OSC is a bigoted racist.

That's not rational. That's not even partially reasonable. THat's just... sad.

--------------

The entire piece follows a similar pattern, over and over, and it gets rather tiresome reading it. There is nothing direct, merely backhanded compliments that get torn down, and then indirect accusations that are not fully supported before moving on to the next. At least they are all tied together somewhat, with the implication that if enough of them are questionable then they must all be true, and thus OSC is a bad person.

I myself disagree with OSC on numerous points, but I'm not going to call him racist, bigot, toxic, or any of the other buzzwords that get thrown about nowadays. I am interested in the man's writings, not his politics, and I don't even agree with the mainstream that he's all that particularly amazing. Like Frank Herbert and "Dune", I consider his first work to be amazing and all the ones thereafter on a slow decline from that greatness, as if the most important concepts they had were put forth into a masterpiece that could not be equaled. But I see no need to accuse the man without basis, attack his beliefs, or attempt to imply he is something he is not.

The irony is that I rather enjoy the works done by the original writer here, and by reading this piece, I have just went through almost the exact same cycle of discovery that he went through with OSC. The well-done and extremely creative rational writings must now be forever separated from the beliefs and actions of the person who wrote them, as they are vastly contradictory. But I do not see him as an evil bigot or anything of the sort, just a man who believes differently. Ironically, this places him in the same company as OSC, and to use a recently overused quote: This does put a smile on my face.

Why are you trying to make past views of the religion he belongs to a negative slander on a man who is indifferent to it? Is he not allowed to believe differently? Are all religious people within a certain religion in 100% alignment with each other on every single view?

See, for anyone else, it's a situation of "His religion believes something we may consider bigoted, but the man himself seems not to believe that". Somehow, you want to make this a negative thing, and there is little reason to do so unless you are trying to make him look bad.

Please, though, do /not/ stop writing your stories. You have a talent, and you should continue using it and sharpening it. If you think about it, you've learned much and grown thanks to OSC's works, despite your disgust with the reality of the man.

Alright, I'll break this down with an example: if someone says "Gay people molest children so shouldn't adopt," this would be a bigoted belief, yes? If they justify this belief by saying "There are a lot of men who molest young boys," does this justification for their belief make it less bigoted?

If you say yes, then we have bigger problems going on here, but if not, then congratulations, we agree! My point in highlighting this was to head off people who might argue that "OSC believes he's doing what's best for children/families/God/etc," because that doesn't change the classification of the belief as bigoted.

Well first of all, because OSC isn't criticized only for his gay bigotry, but also for potential racism. So you know, it would have been a little weird to ignore that.

As to clumping it all together... Ehhh /waggles hand left and right/ Sort of, no, but a little, maybe. Prejudices of all kinds basically follow the same flawed epistemics, I don't know for sure if they're correlated, but if someone shows signs of one kind of bigotry I'm certainly less surprised if they turn out to be bigoted in other ways too. I do explain this in the post, but you're off the hook on not recognizing it since it's actually a rather complex point that I made over the course of a few paragraphs.

Basically, I was pointing out that it's really tempting to just blame Card's religion on his beliefs about gay people, but that there are underlying failures in Card's epistemics and patterns of behavior that show him failing to distinguish truth from falsehood and failing to empathize with or be charitable toward those he disagrees with, the way I would expect someone who "hates the sin but loves the sinner" to do. Bringing up his worrying silence on the historic racism of his church doesn't fit my model of a Card who hates bigotry.

Well, yes, according to many ex-mormons, but even if they're all dirty sin-blackened liars, dude was 27 when his church finally decided maybe black people deserve to be equals.

You know what, I'm turning this flurry of questions around, because their answers seem pretty obvious from my post (that you totally read fully and carefully). En garde!

Why do you care so little about his church's racism? His church that he thinks is infallible about gay people? His church that he defends constantly? Card isn't "all religious people," he's an outspoken and fairly famous member of his church, and of course he's allowed to think differently, my point is if he did he should have /said so./ You're not even a little bit concerned that maybe the guy who's totally "indifferent" about his church's about-face on racism might be racist? You don't see any remote shred of a problem, there? This really strikes you as totally off topic? Your picture of a non-racist Card just meekly stays silent on that? Because "indifferent" is not a good look on him at all, and if your goal here is to try to convince me I'm wrong, you're just shooting your argument in the foot with that word.

#+begin_quote
  Nice dodge. I notice you avoided the key part, but that's fine.
#+end_quote

You seem confused, that was a "direct rebuttal." You said X, I pointed out why X was wrong. Rebuttal, not dodge. And which key part was that? "Foreign policy?" I mentioned that, actually. You have to be specific here if you want to defend your points, because they're not doing well.

You accusing me of accusing Card of racism just because he insults Obama is about as empty an argument as me accusing you of defending Card because he insulted Obama. It's not a really effective argument, you see?

I care little for its racism because I consider Mormons to be silly at best and heretics at worst and... more importantly... because they've fixed things and I don't consider them forever tainted by some 'original sin' of racism.

Most churches are against same-sex marriage. This is for the obvious reason that it directly goes against its tenets. This is also for the less-obvious reason that at the time most them originated, human lives were nasty, brutish, and short. Any society that didn't heavily factor into account the best ways to maximize its reproduction ceased to exist. If you really want to get into the depths of that topic, we can, but it's probably not best done here.

As they simply don't intend to have /church-sponsored/ marriages, and as same-sex marriages can be done /Just fine/ by the *GOVERNMENT*, totally ignoring religious institutions, this entire line of argument is a non-starter. If they decide, say, to start throwing same-sex couples off of rooftops or burning them at the stake, I will happily oppose them in various unfriendly ways. /Especially/ if some of those oppressed people are friends of mine.

#+begin_quote
  my point is if he did he should have said so
#+end_quote

This is something /you/ expect, if not outright /demand/ of him, lest you consider him guilty. I, on the other hand, believe in the concept of "Innocent until proven guilty", and the *best* you have to offer is an absence of said proof.

#+end_quote

Might be. No, I don't stay up all night wondering if random people /might/ be racist.

If I did, with over 7 billion people on the Earth, I'd never get any sleep.

Even if he is /somehow/ racist, if he stays quiet, leaves it out of his writings, and doesn't actively hurt anyone, he's allowed to live his life how he chooses. I'm fairly sure this is /exactly/ the same view he has of the intimate relationships of same-sex couples in their own homes.

He called him stupid. He called him the 'stupidest' on foreign policy. Is that all a President is? No?

Then hardly "incredibly insulting". I could call you incredibly stupid /right now/ and you probably wouldn't care, on account of it not being incredibly insulting, but maybe it /would/ rustle your jimmies.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  The article is inexorably linked to the original experience. It was unpleasant for you then. You decided to go into more detail
#+end_quote

Over 10 years later.

#+begin_quote
  and found that it was even more so at the later point in time.
#+end_quote

Where did I indicate that? I guess it was exasperating and disappointing, but by "unpleasant" you're linking back to "mental anguish," which does not describe the fairly calm and analytical frame of mind I was in when writing this article.

#+begin_quote
  Nothing in the portion you quoted was factually incorrect.
#+end_quote

Hmm, let's look again:

"The writer (that's me) apparently went into this (this being this article) hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero" (incorrect, that was 10 years aog) only to realize that they held opposite opinions on some very key beliefs (still 10 years ago)."

Now you could argue that you meant "this" as "this whole endeavor of looking into any of OSC's beliefs at all at any point ever," but see, that's a pretty big sleight of hand trick, because when you say this:

#+begin_quote
  Part of the impetus for your 'deep dive' was previous discoveries. Part of the purpose of the article was to interpret and explain your findings in a way meant to convince others of your point of view. If A = B, and B = C, then A = C.
#+end_quote

You're using some pretty slippery assertions to set up an inexorable logical chain that implies that my motivation and state of mind from 10 years ago unquestionably biased the research and writing of this article that you're responding to. "Part of the," "part of the..." These statements are meaningless without the assumption of linked mental anguish between the me from 10 years ago and the me from Sunday. You're stating assumptions, not things "factually correct," as A =/= B, and so A =/= C.

What was that phrase you used? "Propagandistic persuasion!" Good show. Next!

#+begin_quote
  "I decided he's not a bigot, except that he's a different kind of bigot". I did finish the article, thank you for the false assumption that I did not.
#+end_quote

Well when you state something so blatantly wrong, what else should I assume? That you're lying? If you disagree with the idea that someone can hold religious beliefs that are bigoted without being a bigot themselves, you should have just said that, and we'd be having a bit of a different discussion!

#+begin_quote
  I did. I would assume you would try to be better than him. If you are saying you are the same, or that it's OK that you do it because he does, then criticizing him for things you yourself do is hypocrisy.
#+end_quote

Nice dodge, but no. I'm planting a flag here; are you admitting you were mistaken, or not?

Don't shift the goalposts and try to make this about my attitude, I'm happy to justify that later, but not until you admit that what you said, and I quote, "OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post," is factually inaccurate, unless you are honestly going to sit there (or stand, or lay down, I don't know your life) and try to argue that calling someone the stupidest President in history on foreign policy is "less insulting" than saying someone isn't bigoted, but their religious beliefs are, which again I defined as “false beliefs about a specific demographic that knowingly disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic.”

(Not to mention all the other stuff he said, which again, you're not showing any evidence that you read, not just about Obama being a dictator by character, or being a contemptuous person, but also the insults he's heaped on liberals and climate scientists and Mormons who disagreed with him... but let's put all that aside, unless you want to earn extra points)

I'll wait here before going further on this post, or else this point will get lost. I should warn you, I /really/ dislike it when people avoid responsibility for their mistakes in arguments like this: it's all good fun until you show no integrity, and then the gloves come off :)

You don't get to tie in the entire history and then when someone disagrees try to separate it into separate parts to call them wrong. If you tied all that time together in the article, referencing the entire span, then you will be judged on that entire span.

#+begin_quote

This line of argument is thus a non-starter. But, if you like, yes, calling someone stupid is less insulting than calling them a bigot.

I don't need to 'show evidence' that I've read anything. You're trying to put that burden on me because you falsely believe it advantages you.

He certainly did enough dictatorial actions. If the current President did half the things the previous one did, there'd be a bloodbath. This is, however, a completely different argument, and /meaningless besides as you've admitted OSC has ragged on the CURRET President as well/.

Honestly, I don't know why you're bringing this up at all unless it's to serve as a distraction.

#+begin_quote
  also the insults he's heaped on liberals and climate scientists and Mormons who disagreed with him
#+end_quote

Oh no, how sad. He's said mean things. Did he call them toxic and bigoted, too? Maybe "Bitter clingers"? If you /really/ want to go down this route, it's not hard to find mean things the targets of his annoyance have said, or even things you've said.

Wait... he disagreed with other /Mormons/? Well, there goes the "He must adhere 100% to the tenets of his religious group* bit brought up earlier. Good to know... now you can leave him alone on the racism part now that you've admitted this.

Simple math. You said "One comment that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted?" It wasn't one comment, it was more than one. You keep dodging this and shifting the goal posts and making it about tone or insults. It's math. You said one. There was more than one. I said your reading comprehension is poor.

#+end_quote

An experiment was called for! TO THE THUNDERDOME!

(Meaning the rest of your comment past this point was just more blatantly being wrong and throwing out red herrings and contradicting yourself about OSC not being insulting again in a stubborn way that I trust most potential readers to see through, so before we go into the briar patch I'm sticking to this flag I planted.)

To be clear; you want to perform a survey, yes? You've tried to shift the goalposts again, so I'm dragging you right back to another flag:

"OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post."

That's the survey. Whether I was more insulting to OSC than he was to others, like Obama or non-anti-gay-Mormons or anyone else.

So I'll post a link in the [[/r/rational]] discord and if more people agree that I was insulting, I'll apologize on my post, and if more people believe that OSC was insulting, you'll admit you were wrong and that your reading comprehension is poor and that you didn't actually read those articles you kept saying you did, or IF NOT ALL THAT, you'll admit that you don't actually care how insulting OSC was, you just didn't like that he was insulted and that rustled your jimmies.

Agreed? I know there's some worry of Halo effect because I'm me, so I'll let you pick someone to edit the survey questions to ensure they're neutral. Shake on it?

No, it's not better that Card named white guys who have never held office as runnerups; somehow it's still America's first black president who has that honor.

  Do I think he would have said that if Obama wasn't black?

  Do I think he would say that “Obama is, by character and preference, a dictator” if Obama wasn't black?

  Do I think he would “imagine” (all in good fun, of course, haha, it's just me Card the kooky science fiction writer imagining things that definitely won't happen the way we science fiction writers do) Obama turning “young out-of-work urban men” into a national police force to maintain his dictatorship if Obama wasn't black?

  Or that he would say “Having been anointed from the start of his career because he was that magical combination --- a black man who talks like a white man (that's what they mean by calling him “articulate” and a “great speaker”) --- he has never had to work for a living, and he has never had to struggle to accomplish goals. He despises ordinary people, is hostile to any religion that doesn't have Obama as its deity, and his contempt for the military is complete.” if not?

  How did you lose your belief?
#+end_quote

Part of the Mormon experience is going on a two-year proselyting "mission." I started when I was twenty. I was kind of wishy-washy but I still believed (in my first six months I even wrote a small book about why God didn't care about homosexuality, with an analysis of every halfway-relevant verse in our scriptural canon, which is larger than the standard Christian set), and about six months in, I fell in with a crowd of...I'm not sure how to term them. "Fundamentalists" gives the wrong impression, "Literalists" is in some ways correct but overall is probably the wrong term because I believed that (1) even our most prized scriptures could have been translated incorrectly and (2) it was all written by imperfect humans, who had definitely experienced the divine but didn't always know how to express it and, as well, sometimes had their own agenda or were otherwise Unreliable Narrators.

We took scripture /seriously/. Let's put it that way. Some of us were fundies, sure, but that wasn't our unifying characteristic.

Anyway, that's where I was at the end of my mission, believing that the prophets and apostles living today had seen Jesus face-to-face, that atoms were self-aware (look up Brian Tomasik if you want to see a nontheist treatment of that idea), and that even cockroaches had the spark of godhood in them. During this time I also became a hardcore pacifist and a socialist (the former died down quite a bit after my deconversion, since a large part of it had to do with God saying that pacifism was the way to go, but I'm still more socialist than not), and near the end of my mission (last six months or so) I got into Mormon Transhumanism, which is some pretty weird but neat stuff.

The problem with taking your religion really seriously, though, is that you can't keep doing that and ignore the problems that you notice. For people who were supposedly on first name terms with Jesus and God the Father, the Church's leaders were acting in some pretty un-Christlike ways.

General red flags included a slow drift away from the original doctrines of the Church in favor of becoming, basically, Weird Protestants; supporting various political causes that were totally at odds with Christ's teachings (hello, Iraq War); and spending millions of dollars on nice-looking temples while people are starving and dying of easily preventable diseases.

These and other matters troubled me during my mission (and before, to be honest), and this only grew over time. The breaking point came when I found out that the Church ran a hunting ground, the Westlake Hunting Preserve, that didn't just support itself but /made money/ for the Church: the sin of Cain wasn't just murdering Abel but doing it to get Abel's flocks, or "spilling blood to make cash," to paraphrase a Hugh Nibley passage I can't remember word for word anymore (Nibley is one of the big scholars within Mormonism). Now, the animals being slain here weren't people, and you might think that gave the Church a pass, but our earlier prophets (in modern times) had in no uncertain terms said that animals were important too. Several of them had even condemned sport hunting specifically: hunting for food was okay, but hunting when when you had other ways to get food was just killing because you enjoyed it.

It was as if the Catholic Church not only owned Playboy Magazine but had drifted so far over the past century that your average Catholic wouldn't understand why you were disturbed by this fact. Once upon a time many Mormons believed that it was a sin to kill a fly if the fly's only crime was being a nuisance to you, and now we were making money from the shedding of innocent blood.

My doubts had been growing up to that point, but that conclusively proved for me that the Church's truth claims couldn't be valid. They could not be currently led by God and be effectively profiting off of murder.

Other religions have ways to get around this, but it's a basic tenet of Mormonism that this is the last “dispensation” (era when there is a church in existence that acts with God's authority) and that not only is this Church led by God, but it will never fade away or be corrupted like previous dispensations. This meant that if the current prophet was not led by God then the Church had /never/ been led by God and Joseph Smith had not been visited by angels. If that was the case, though, then the argument for e.g. Jesus looked thinner than it did the day before, because there was some stuff about Joseph Smith that still seems a little weird to me, and if that could pile up around a guy whose life was pretty well documented then who knows what was made up or exaggerated about somebody living two thousand years ago.

At this point, all my faith in God ultimately rested on Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. Here was some Weird Shit that couldn't be explained well except through the existence of the divine, you know? Except, once I saw how present-day Mormonism effectively refuted itself, it became apparent that I really just hadn't tried hard enough to explain the Weird Shit.

I'm not sure what I would have done without that experience. It was clear, at that point, that I was already performing some pretty amazing philosophical yoga moves, trying to bend the theology in all sorts of ways to keep it from contradicting either itself or what I knew scientifically, so there might have been a breaking point somewhere further down the line. On the other hand, maybe I would have just doubled down.

I tried to dodge the ethical concerns of supporting the Church by separating it from "the Gospel" or the doctrines and supporting only the latter, but the sport hunting thing just sent it all crashing down. If I had been, say, Jewish, I'd probably still be a Weird Theist (or at least Deist) because it wouldn't be as easy for me to come across a hard contradiction that sends the whole artifice falling down, and I was definitely suffering from motivated reasoning.

I really like Mormonism at its best. It's got some flaws, like various inaccurate truth claims, but its earlier prophets had a top notch ethical system, at least in some places, and I have a soft spot for anybody, past or present, who tries to build a utopian community. Looking at Mormonism as it used to be, seeing how it is now, and being able to imagine how it might have been if events had gone differently, I'm still angry at everyone who decided to take the low road and turn the Church into what it is today. It could have been a real force for good and, besides that, I'm not a terribly good rationalist: I might not believe the truth claims of Mormonism, but there are aspects of it which I miss terribly and cause me to wish, every now and then, that I had somehow been able to keep making those logical contortions.

#+begin_quote
  It's 2006. Hurricane Katrina happened recently, and the tsunami in the Indian Ocean happened about a year before that. My mother and my grandmother are talking, and out of the blue my grandmother says something like "god sent the hurricane because they were living in sin in New Orleans, just like those non-Christians in Asia last year."

  My mother meditates on that for a long time, thinks about all the recently born infants who died without ever having learned a religion, has an image in her head of mothers holding their infant children as they all die, realizes that those same mothers would be the ones imparting a religion onto those infants' minds, and intuits one of the common atheist arguments - that no one believes in their religion because it's the correct religion, they believe it because that's what they learned from their parents and their society. She also realizes that religion has only ever been an explanation for the weather.
#+end_quote

[I do not endorse that exactly, though I think "explaining the unknown" /was/ an important aspect of the formation of early religion.]

#+begin_quote
  It's mid 2007. My mother tells me all this stuff she's been thinking about for the past year, and that she doesn't think she can believe anymore. She explains her reasoning poorly so it comes across like an emotional reaction to dead children or something, and I'm not convinced by her words. She still doesn't know whether or not there's a god, but she's thoroughly convinced that all known religions are man-made. I still believe. My mother does not.

  I observe that my mother is a good and moral person. I also observe that my religion asserts that */god is going to set my mother on fire forever/*. I find this disconcerting, considering that god is perfect and doesn't make mistakes and setting my mother on fire would be a mistake. I decide that my religion must've been misinterpreted by man because god wouldn't set my mother on fire, so I set about finding the hidden truth of god that's masked behind organized religion.

  I start researching into apocryphal texts and gnostic gospels and the history of the writing of the bible, stuff like the Council of Carthage and the decisions that led to which books to include and which books to leave out.

  I decide that the bible was divinely inspired, but that god simplified his message to be understandable for the ignorant semi-literate goat-herders who were living at the time, and then that simplified message was passed down through several generations via the spoken word before it was finally recorded by fallible semi-literate humans, and then translated and retranslated and translated yet again.

  I now basically believe that there is a god and a Jesus and a heaven, but that god's message has been so warped/corrupted by history that the only thing we can know for certain is that god wants you to be a good person.

  I discover that Revelations (aka the Apocalypse of John of Patmos) was included in the bible simply because it made for a more exciting conclusion and made the bible feel like it had a proper ending, and that it was nothing more than a coded message to early Christians written by a man who the Romans exiled for causing public disturbances. I look deeper and find that Revelations was not intended by its author as prophecy, and that "the end times" and "the Antichrist" were ideas invented during the Middle Ages when most people had no idea what the bible /actually said/ and had to rely on trusting the church's word.

  The most important thing I find is that the Council of Carthage almost used the Apocalypse of Peter as the ending instead, which is allegedly an account from the apostle Peter of a tour of heaven that he was given by Jesus Himself, who at some point said to Peter:

  *"It is because of them who have believed in me that I am come. It is also because of them who have believed in me that, at their word, I shall have pity on man. Thou must not tell that which thou hearest unto the sinners lest they transgress the more and sin."*

  No longer being concerned about god setting my mother on fire, I stop thinking about the history of my religion for a while.

  2007/2008 coincides with my freshman year of college. I take a world history class that fall, and a philosophy class and some sort of history of religion class that spring.

  At some point, I learn about Zoroastrianism and how it influenced all the little tribes in the surrounding areas, and I learn that the bible's account of "Jews vs Canaanites" is fabricated, they didn't coexist at the same time, Judaism evolved from the Canaanite religion. I also learn that the Jews were never slaves in Egypt, and that the events of Exodus are myth, not history... Moses is alleged to have been the author of Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers and Deuteronomy, but there was never such a person as Moses. I find that linguistic analysis shows that each of those books was almost certainly written by multiple anonymous authors, and so there are weird mishmashes of multiple contradictory accounts.

  Having learned about the similarities between other religions, I decide that christianity fits into the same mold. Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, Norse, whatever, it's all a pantheon with a main/creator god at the top, the bible just calls most of its gods "angels." I now believe that god told all the peoples of the world the same story and a thousands-of-years long game of "telephone" / "the whisper game" had fractured it into all these competing religions. As long as you believe in god and live a good life it doesn't matter which religion's path you follow, because it's all the same corrupted story.

  I look into the historicity of Jesus, and find that there had almost certainly never been such a person, and that his life story is probably a result of several individuals wandering around Jerusalem anointing people with the holy oil during the same decade, and a few generations later it's merged into one story of one man, and elements from other religions have been added as embellishment.

  So now I no longer believe there was ever such a person as Jesus and I no longer believe that a single word in the bible is an accurate account of any event that actually transpired in the real world, but I */still/* believe in god.

  We skip ahead to fall of 2008. I go back to college, and because I had been a stupid/anxious kid who didn't know how to talk to people (/especially/ over the telephone), I had neglected the previous year to sign up for a dorm room, and now have to live in an apartment off campus.

  Because of this, I have the option of moving back to [REDACTED CITY] a full two weeks before school starts, and I do it because I haven't smoked /any/ weed or cigarettes /all summer/ (I've been working 5/6 days a week and living in my parents' house). People I had known the previous year have also gotten apartments, but they've done it on purpose to facilitate their ability to party without getting busted.

  During that two weeks I try alcohol and LSD and mushrooms and ecstacy, and between all of the "big events" I'm never /not/ smoking hella kush (my college is in a mountainous area near where a significant chunk of the US's "good weed" is grown, so everything I smoke is named, none of it is just generic "good weed," Northern Lights and Sour Diesel and White Widow and Granddaddy Purp and Purple Haze and AK-47 and even /actual/ OG Kush and /actual/ Pineapple Express)...
#+end_quote

[Um, /anyways/...]

#+begin_quote
  I spend that time partying my way to Enlightenment every waking moment of every day. This sets the stage for the rest of sophomore year. Anything that doesn't directly relate to maximizing "the college experience" has been ejected from my mind. That includes religion. I go the entire year without thinking about religion even once.

  It's summer of 2009, a few weeks before the end of school. A FireFox extension called StumbleUpon is pretty popular during this time period. You click a button and it throws you to random internet pages based on your interests. It starts occasionally showing me articles about Richard Dawkins specifically and atheism in general. I hit "Stumble" again pretty quickly after glancing over these articles, maybe briefly thinking about how arrogant those stupid atheists are.

  It keeps occasionally showing me articles. The glances increase in length. Richard Dawkins turns out to not be the arrogant cockhead that christians say he is, and his words make a lot of sense. I ask myself "what would the world look like if god didn't exist" and it hits me that it would look /exactly like the world we live in now/.

  I have a very terrifying 30 seconds of confusion where I try to talk to god while also knowing with crystal clear certainty that god doesn't exist and that I'm talking to myself, and then I realized "oh wait, I already don't believe in god anymore..."
#+end_quote

I don't remember exactly what went through my mind at the very end there, all I remember is that I just unthinkingly considered myself to be a christian right up until the very instant that I realized I didn't believe in god.

In a way, it's similar to your story, and to most people's stories - gradually accumulating knowledge that's incompatible with your beliefs, noticing contradictions - but there was never any growing doubt of god's existence. Like, if I'd had your experience with the Westlake Hunting Preserve, I would've reacted by just writing it off as fallible humans being fallible humans. I don't know why I lost my religion at that particular moment. It just fell away.

I don't have a problem with someone choosing to be vegetarian, but really, "Cain murdering Abel is wrong, therefore the church owning a game preserve is wrong" is rather a non sequitur. He'd have a stronger case - albeit not a proper comparison to murder of humans - if the animals were just being wasted, which /is/ unscriptural, but IIUC that's not how Westlake is meant to operate; hunters are expected to take their kills with them.

Not to mention, “And wo be unto man that sheddeth blood or that wasteth flesh and hath no need” (D&C 49:21).

“And Cain said: Truly I am Mahan, the master of this great secret, that I may murder and get gain” (Moses 5:31a) is just the cherry on top.

  The Bible being of uncertain and mixed origin, with big question marks about the accuracy of substantial parts
#+end_quote

It is certain that the origins of the bible are not the origins it presents of itself. The Jews were never slaves in Egypt. There was never an exodus. There's no question about that. That means there was no Moses.

The accuracy of substantial parts is known to be false, it's not a question.

The creation story describes the earth as a flat disk set upon four pillars and covered by a dome surrounded by water; under the earth are paradise and purgatory, separated by the abyss; above the earth, set atop the dome, is heaven. This is not trivial. This cosmological premise is the foundation of the Noah's Ark myth and the Tower of Babel myth. Conservation of mass means there's only as much water as there is, and gravity works the way it does, and yada yada, long story short a global flood is physically impossible (and if all things are possible through god then why couldn't he Thanos-snap everybody but Noah's family?). The narrative itself offers the explanation that windows opened in the firmament and allowed the surrounding water to fill the dome.

And the Tower of Babel. That whole story rests on the premise that you can build a tower tall enough to breach the firmament and break into heaven. The story says god took that threat seriously. Which he shouldn't've done, if he were real, because there's no firmament. I know you guys believe god lives on the planet Kolob or whatever, but that isn't what's described in the bible, the bible says god lives in heaven and that heaven is sitting right on top of the firmament.

Yes. I already know all about "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." This is a fallacy.

Say you want to posit the existence of the planet Nibiru or Planet X or whatever it is. We would expect to see certain evidence if it existed - gravitational effects on the orbits of other objects in the solar system, or whatever, I'm not Neil DeGrasse Tyson (though if there be an infinite number of universes then there's a universe out there where I am). The fact that we don't see that evidence is strong evidence that it isn't there.

#+begin_quote
  it's not a question.
#+end_quote

Once again, there's nothing else I can say. The bible makes all the claims of Genesis (the creation, the flood, Babel) and those claims are simply false. The earth is 4.5 billion years old and was formed along with the rest of the planets by the accretion/consolidation of the sun's protoplanetary disk. Life popped up about a billion years later, mammals a further three and a quarter billion years after that, and humans a paltry 200,000 years ago. If the bible's claims run counter to this, then it's not a question, the accuracy of the bible is simply false.

There are other factual claims.

The census mentioned in the gospels happened in real life. It didn't require a single person to return to the town of their birth, much less /literally every citizen/. IRL that would've collapsed the Roman economy. Also, that census happened in 6CE. Herod was a real/documented historical figure and he died in 4BCE. Matthew says Jesus was born during the reign of Herod. Luke says it was during the census.

Leviticus flat out states as fact that the bat is a bird. Birds are dinosaurs. Bats are mammals. The /humans/ who wrote that book didn't know enough about the world to understand that "Wings =/= Bird."

One nitpick, just wanted to point out that you seem to be painting the intellectual darkweb with one brush. As a movement it leans right of center on average, but they have liberals as well as conservatives. When they talk about the intolerant left, they're not saying all leftists are intolerant, they're specifically referring to the /intolerant/ left, the extremist part which has come to dominate much of liberal culture and which bullies, silences and excommunicates anyone who disagrees with the tiniest part of their ideology. Or at least that's what a lot of them mean, it probably varies a lot. The intellectual darkweb's main if not only unifying goal is free speech and free intellectual discourse, and they came about largely as a reaction to censorship and persecution of dissenters by the left, which has moved a lot of civil and reasonable conversations outside the Overton window. Aside from that, I dont think there's anything else that everyone in the intellectual darkweb agrees on.

I agree with everything else you said in your article though.

They're all fairly famous people who still spend time complaining about how they're censored, when what they actually mean is that the things they say often get negative reactions (often for bad reasons, but still). Fringe leftists yelling at people who disagree with them is no different from fringe rightists doing the same; it's just an unfortunate part of the territory. I disagree that it's come to dominate much of liberal culture, but mostly because I think people are bad at noticing gradients of poorly communicated ideas vs actual hateful beliefs.

Yes fringe people on both sides of the political aisle yell at those they dislike, and both the left and the right do some pretty awful things at times, to a fairly equal degree I think. But they have different styles. they dont always do the same awful things as each other. For instance, the right's approach to science it doesn't like is to publicly deny the science and ridicule scientists. Meanwhile the left's approach to science it doesnt like is instead to move the overton window so that the science it doesnt like isnt socially acceptable to publish in the first place and if possible infiltrate a field to help facilitate this. This makes it a lot harder to catch left science denial than right science denial, but I've read a lot of stuff about researchers whose universities refused to publish them for fear of backlash, or when they do publish they get backlash. Researchers sometimes get fired from universities for talking about their research.

And there are plenty of cases where people lose their jobs and livelihoods because of expressing the wrong political views. When someone's livelihood and reputation is put at stake over mere differences of opinion, even when those opinions arent prejudices, and the punishment is carried out without so much as a trial...

Furthermore, the leaders of a movement are not the whole movement. A movement can be popular and still be silenced at the same time. The famous and high status people are the ones who are able to speak their minds and get away unscathed. Most everyone else has to keep their mouths shut in public or face the consequences.

I would strongly recommend you read this slate star codex article, it might put some things into perspective:

Also, I strongly suspect that you haven't read much if any of the SSC articles criticizing the sjw movement. Many of them are very insightful and informative and I think he has a LOT of very valid points which many people arent willing to hear. For instance you can find some of them here:

***** You raise a lot of good points, as does Scott, and I have actually read a lot of his articles criticizing SJWs; Radicalizing the Romanceless was my first exposure to the site. I'm a huge fan of his and his writing, but of all the things I agree with him on, his attitude and perspective on SJWs is the one I disagree with most; I honestly think he's often unaware of his own biases that lead to him missing the mark when he criticizes Leftists, and I think he recognized that a bit with his article on Conflict Theory vs Mistake Theory.

To address this topic specifically, let me expand on what I meant, and you let me know if we're more in agreement than it sounded.

My problem with IDW is not borne from ignoring the harms of PC culture: the reason I call them absurd and counterproductive is that they're fighting PC culture in the worst way I can think of. Maybe I'm wrong in that, but by making a tribe whose main identifier is being persecuted for unpopular ideas, and not of being rational or correct, they end up missing the mark rather often. The articles I linked to expand on this further, but Scott touches on it in his post too.

You know it's gotten bad when people in the IDW sometimes defend each other from attacks that are 100% deserved, like when Robin Hanson says something stupid and gets shouted at and others in IDW feel obliged to defend him, because an attack on one of them feels like an attack on all of them.

I guess I can sum up my position by saying something like, if the IDW cared more about pushing the overton window than pointing out how persecuted they feel, I think they would be more successful at pushing the overton window but less successful overall. This is related to Toxoplasma of Rage stuff that Scott touched on in that article you linked too.

I definitely agree with this:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

But my perception of IDW is that it's driven largely by the egos of those in it and so they can bash back against those who bash them, not ensuring that Joe Everyman can talk about gender differences at the water cooler.

I say this with varying applicability to each person. For example, Jordan Peterson is a good clinical psychologist and a hack at basically everything else he talks about. Sam Harris is amazing, and I think he deserves basically none of the yelling-at that he gets. Robin Hanson has a lot of interesting and sometimes good ideas, but he also says a lot of really stupid stuff, and he seems incapable of telling the difference, or putting in any effort to communicate his controversial ideas better. I haven't seen Eric Weinstein say anything that deserves condemnation or attacks, and indeed I'm not sure if he ever has been. Ben Shapiro is Ben fucking Shapiro, and if I have to go into the problems with him we'll be here all day.

(That's another thing: I think a lot of the problems these people face is not just because of the topics they want to talk about, but the way they talk about them, and by focusing on the way they're treated rather than examining what they said and why it got the reaction it did, I think they calcify. I'm actually writing a couple articles on this right now, hopefully I'll put them up soon)
