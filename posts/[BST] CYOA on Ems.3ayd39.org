It occurs to me that CYOAs ( [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/top/?sort=top&t=all]] ) are, effectively, a genre unto themselves. It also occurs to me that the setting I worked out for LoadBear, at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit]] , could form the basis of one. Eg:

Choose Your Origin:

- Old cryonicist: Frozen before humans could be reliably brain-scanned. Latest death-date: 2035. Starting budget: Your trust fund (if any) is tied up in legal knots; you have $10k in donations from a cryonics mutual-assistance group.
- Research subject. Earliest death-date: 2030. Due to glitches and experimental procedures that didn't quite work, -1d6*5% to starting humanity.
- Medical upload: You were going to die anyway, so why not?
- Enthusiastic Volunteer: You had your whole life ahead of you, but decided going digital was even better. Earliest death-date: 2035. Starting budget: Your life's savings, $20k.
- "Volunteer": Pressures were applied by those more powerful than you, and getting your brain diced was the least-worst option.

Hardware, Running Speed, and Copies

Mind-tweaks and Software

Job and Lifestyle

... etc, etc. I'm reasonably good at the worldbuilding side of things; not so much at the graphic design elements. Anyone want to help me hash out the details on this, and assemble an oversized GIF or three?

**** Sure, and people talk about video being "on tape" when they really mean a hard disk, but when they're talking specifically about the technology they refer to DVRs instead of VCRs. Heck, "tivo" has pretty much become a generic replacement for "tape".

They're talking about SSDs lapping hard disks in peak storage in 2016. Hard disks will remain cheaper for a while, but I suspect that by 2020 nobody's going to use hard disks for anything but super high capacity "nearline" data center storage. By 2040 it'll be like talking about film cameras.

Anyway, I just found it kind of jarring. That's all.

**** Well, I can't help with snazzy images, but I /can/ help with the inspiration/imagination thing. If you look at the top posts from that subreddit, you'll see one thing that they tend to have in common; all the choices are positive.

I think the reason that people find this more compelling (assuming upvotes are roughly equivalent to "compelling") is that they like to imagine themselves in a good circumstance, and they don't like to imagine themselves in a bad circumstance. People don't like choosing the least-worst option, and if they /do/ have to chose the least-worst option, they don't tend to give it that much more thought. It doesn't capture them in the same way.

So you want your prompts (which is what every choice should be) to expand the possibilities outward, and each needs to be positively compelling in its own right. You /especially/ can't have a mix of good and bad options, because no one is going to give that much thought to the bad options after they've seen how bad those bad options are (which means you should just not write the bad options in). The inspiration comes from people trying to evaluate.

(The one big caveat in regards to negative choice is something like [[/r/wouldyourather]], but the purpose there isn't imagination/inspiration, it's meant to reveal something about a person. There's little lasting impact to those, I've found.)

Now /that/ is a criterion I likely wouldn't have thought of, especially so early in the design process, but which is worth keeping in mind.

In a number of the CYOAs I've looked at, there are /some/ negative choices - but they're generally provided with some balancing mechanism to make them worth considering anyway, such as a point-build process. That's why I threw in the 'humanity score' in the post's examples. Combine that with a cash budget, and it should be feasible to tweak any given option to be a choice worth contemplating.

Whenever I see such a term, I always wonder whether the intended meaning is 'anti-corporatist', as in against mercentalist oligarchies who conspire to prevent the rise of any competitors; or 'anti-competitionist', as in forbidding anyone from even trying to offer better services for lower cost than existing providers.

There's a difference between the form of capitalism which Adam Smith espoused (and David Brin currently champions), and the form of capitalism preferred by the current reigning elite; and getting rid of the latter shouldn't necessarily mean getting rid of the former.

Of course, once you start having /ems/ around who compete with biological humans, then even competitionist capitalism may lead to Chinese-style "interesting" results...

Neither. Rather than just pointing you to [[/r/socialism]] or some propaganda literature, we have a middle-ground subreddit entitled [[/r/DebateaCommunist]] where you could ask the relevant questions about what we mean by "anticapitalist". If you do want some propaganda literature, the /Communist Manifesto/ and /Debt: the First 5000 Years/ make very good sequels to Yvain's "Meditations on Moloch".

I honestly am starting to feel like someone needs to write "A Rationalist's Introduction to Why People Don't Like Capitalism and What They're Talking About", and since I'm the only one /this/ intensely interested in destroying capitalism, I'll probably have to do that. It might come after the entire rest of everything on my queue, but if it gets sufficiently delayed it'll come after I [[https://kitano25.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/e382a4e383a1e383bce382b8-11.jpg][pick up a Stone Mask and start yelling, "I REJECT MY HUMANITY, JOJO!"]] (That's actually a terrible idea, since I really don't want to subsist off blood and avoid going outdoors during daylight hours.)

The very short summary is: we are against /private, profit-seeking ownership of the means of production, and their operation via wage-labor/. The reason for italicizing that definition is because it's /important/: almost all economic systems have included /elements/ of communal cooperation, loose social cooperation (as between ordinary friends rather than tribe-mates or family members), trade and exchange, and hierarchical domination. /Capitalism/, as such, is a historically recent (1800s, more-or-less) and particularly pernicious arrangement of these elements according to the definition I gave, and in fact even capitalism has taken varied forms in different places and times, some more vicious and others even somewhat benign. Moreover, all of them were /instituted/ by the deliberate imposition, through violence (usually /state/ violence), of new ways of living and new ownership arrangements on existing populations.

Or, to sum it all up, we are talking about a system created by people, not about some kind of "naturally-occurring" economic phenomenon. In fact, the best argument usually made /for/ capitalism is that /naturally/ occurring economies are /really fucking poor/.

All capitalism's variations, by definition, are characterized by private, profit-seeking ownership of the means of production, and the operation of those means (such as machines and such) by wage-labor. And the standard anticapitalist criticism is that capitalism contains "internal contradictions", or in other words, it cannot keep the promises it makes in order to justify itself.

(So for example, capitalism promises cheap consumer goods, but then creates glut/depression/debt-crisis conditions in which the overwhelming majority of the population can't /afford/ those consumer goods. So you end up with "poverty in the midst of plenty", as Henry George put it in /Progress and Poverty/.)

#+begin_quote
  Of course, once you start having /ems/ around who compete with biological humans, then even competitionist capitalism may lead to Chinese-style "interesting" results...
#+end_quote

Hence why we say that capitalism has "internal contradictions": in the limit as goods and labor grow more plentiful, investments grow more scarce (because the most productive potential enterprises already exist), and thus both workers' wages and the owners' rate of profit falls while wealth accrues to rent-extractors. This is an unintended, counterintuitive, undesirable, self-destructive, but /causal/ result: the attractor state of the system.

The usual counterargument is social democracy, which is actually a very good system for its available level of technology, but also has a tendency to be dismantled by ideologues trying to make a purer capitalism. Social democracy also contains its own internal contradictions, such as generosity to consumers, workers, and retirees eventually leading to a reduction in the rate of profit, thus creating capital flight.

*TL;DR: Capitalism, especially the particular variety of /neoliberal/ capitalism we experience in Western countries these days, is only one possible economic system among many, rather than [[https://unlearningeconomics.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/how-natural-is-capitalism-exactly/][a name abstracting over an inevitable fact of nature]]. You not only can but /should/ reasonably expect that increasingly powerful minds, unbound by physical bodies or today's laws, might invent something more suitable to their own circumstances than a linear extrapolation of today's economic system (which is itself a kludge-loaded dying whale with increasingly many band-aids strapped on to make old social arrangements keep sputtering on in the face of new technological and sociopolitical realities). For example, what would ems think of copyright?*

Hence my inviting you to an entire subreddit devoted to tabooing the words and talking about what everyone really means. Contrary to the name, there are lots of pro-capitalist people on there who can discuss well.

But "social democracy", for instance, means something roughly like, "partial nationalization in some cases + welfare-state + pro-worker labor laws + capitalism". Or, if you prefer extensional training samples rather than intentional definitions, "that thing they had in post-WW2 Europe, until Thatcher mucked it up in Britain and then the rest of the Continent followed suit in the '90s."

It really isn't, because copyright law is directly about regulating the substance of an em's life: data. Ems can't exactly have any kind of a living environment to interact in or with without data, and copyright laws are all about restricting which bits of data can go where. Wouldn't an em naturally want to carry, "the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it" to its logical limit and take a Pirate Party-type position on copyright?

Maybe. Or it might decide that since it's data it would like to have control of its own fate and not depend purely on physical and cryptographic copy protection to give people an incentive not to fork it into a torture sim.

How does an em make a living, presuming you have a scarcity-based economy and it's not just /free/, if not by producing digital goods, or using digital goods as tools to produce physical goods and services?

What about the copy of a book an em keeps on its /bookshelf/? Although the memory thing is actually pretty important, considering how many of your memories are inevitably going to contain what could arguably be called "copyrighted material". If your physics class used a copyrighted textbook, do your memories of the class constitute copyrighted data for which you have to pay? And what if you don't pay: do you have to forget physics?

As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, my current candidates for ems' jobs are white-collar paper-pushing, driving a robot (such as a vehicle), human interaction (such as personal concierge), or lab-rat. All of these require, at the least, that the electricity used by the em's CPU be paid for, which seems likely to be a scarce resource to the time in question.

Have you read "Manna", by Marshall Brain ( [[http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm]] )? I've been wondering how far along in that progression it would be most plausible to set things, for this timeline.

  Where are my CYOA options for "take over the world in 15 days"?

:) I'm already hoping I can arrange the Em CYOA to implicitly allow the reader to put together such a build, ala the Morrowind intelligence-potion Singularity.

The maximum score idea is based on the principle, in some versions of Islam, which forbids too-accurate representations of living things, especially of people.

#+end_quote

In the "LoadBear" exercise, I assumed that neural scanning good enough to create humans arrives in around 2035, and the overall setting is 2040; given the numbers I extrapolated from current trends, that seems to be just around when the major economic/political changes would likely start hitting.

Ah, that makes more sense.

For the LoadBear thing, I just used straight-line extrapolations of present-day and historical trend-lines. With a few assumptions about em size, in 2035, the minimum cost to run an em is around $15 an hour; in 2040, $2 an hour; in 2045, $0.20 an hour; and by 2050, around $500 per year. This is probably underestimating how fast the tech will change once high-skill em researchers can be run at greater than realtime, but suffices for simple worldbuilding where there's a lack of a coherent model that includes the greater complexity.

********* It's been in my to-read pile for quite some time, but has never made it to the top.

(In case you're curious, not counting re-reading S.I. to refamiliarize myself, and various non-fiction research reading, my to-read pile is currently topped by the 40-odd Oz books, Pratchett and Baxter's "Long Utopia", the fourth-and-subsequent Lensman books, and selections from my collection of John Varley.) (... Okay, I just realized: something old, something new, something (frequently) borrowed (from), and something blue.)

** Some of the particular CYOAs I'm feeling inspired by:

- Star Dust, at [[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/StarDustCYOA]] , creates a whole world out of some ship-building choice-making.
- Rebellion, at [[https://feathersnake.wordpress.com/2015/01/30/rebellion-cyoa/]] , has a system with multiple types of points to buy.
- Treasure Hunter, at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/310e5h/treasure_hunter_cyoa/]] , lets the user create a nearly complete story (out of a number of possible stories) for themselves.
- Super Soldier, at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/2fj7fd/super_soldier_cyoa/]] , demonstrates a basic character-creation process.
