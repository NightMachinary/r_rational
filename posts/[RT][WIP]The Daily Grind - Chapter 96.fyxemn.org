** I still can't believe that James and company haven't thought to /purchase/ land to use their greens on. Using greens on a rental or a leased location just seems silly to me when they could buy a property and have much firmer control over their long term ability to retain it.

*** That's a good point. But up until just recently, they haven't have access to the kind of funding they'd need to really make that work. There's a gulf between "we're not strapped for rent anymore" and "we can afford property". They'll certainly get there someday, but it's a work in progress.

**** The existence of that gulf depends on location and whether you're willing to buy rural, but yeah it can be big in some places. I can also see it being something that wouldn't initially occur to life-long renters in the first place. And there's always the work around of, if their income growth is high enough, they'll eventually be able to just give their landlords an offer they can't refuse to buy the entire place---that should be the end goal for the corporation/building-property where the dungeon is located. If they own the dungeon's real world location, security can't ever be improved to keep them out.
