I've recently been watching a number of property shows about buying houses turning them over and selling them and from those I've been convinced that a lot of them don't seem to be rational.

The real life people seem profoundly irrational. They utterly ignore all mathematics and logic in favor of carrying out their vision.

House buying is about four numbers. Buying price, upgrade cost, ceiling price and selling price. You have to buy it at a good price, upgrade it cheaply, and sell it at a good selling price which is determined by the ceiling price (the most a property has been sold for) in the area.

The characters on these shows seem to act in an utterly stupid manner. They mortgage themselves up to the hilt, quit their jobs, and then completely ignore all advice from experts, don't do proper maths, and tend to break even or make a loss. They do very little research about the area, if any, don't research the costs of making their vision.

Whenever challenged on this they just retreat to saying that their vision (they use that word a lot) excludes doing whatever. They could budget to fix the holes in their roof, but their vision doesn't include that. They could avoid adding in things that appeal to them but no one else in the area, but they have a vision, and are appealing to a niche market.

Anyway, do you think it would be possible to rewrite this as a rational fiction? You could easily make it some sort of mystery. Present a house, present various challenges and problems and see if they can find the best way to actually increase it's value and handle the various problems that come up, deal with authorities, handle their emotional desire to make a house that appeals to them and only them, and then to make an awesome profit and be richer.

Do others think this sort of thing would be doable? I imagine a lot of it would be about making it very visual, which is hard to do in text form.


** Dude. House selling isn't fiction. You sound like you could flip a house better than most professionals on TV. Don't write a story about this idea; go start a business with it.

*** The TV shows aren't fiction, but a story about them would be fictional. Not that I'd object to writing Harry Potter and the Methods of House Flipping where Harry Potter desperately tries to flip his wealth into enough money to save Hermione.

I could, but I live in an area that wouldn't give great margins, and I have a stable career, and I lack effective DIY skills. Success in this sort of thing requires either good DIY skills or good contractors (or both) good skill at getting mortgages, good finances, a lot of properties in your area that are undervalued or such. I don't really have that skillset so it'd be a risky proposition at the moment. This is true for many of those on the shows.

** This is a little different than Internet fiction. You'd need to convince a studio to give you a television budget to make a show about people doing math for a half hour in order to buy a house to sell it for more, and hold the kind of people who would watch a house flipping show for hours of a lazy afternoon. Plenty of people make money being rational house flippers and plenty of people crash with burn, but to make a show novel and also about minimizing risk is a tough task. More so selling it to a production house, since the name of the game is manufactured conflict and easy compromises that will float attention for advertisers.

*** I was talking more about writing this as a story with words. I'm aware I or people here would have trouble attracting a television budget for anything.

** I'd read about someone managing a mercenary company, maybe even a particularly exciting real-world startup, but this seems much too mundane and boring (at least in text form). Sorry.

** I'd love to read that (but then I'm planning to buy a house soon so I'm rather interested in this :-) )
