** Yeah, I'll admit I read this. Sunt, the author of Mind Control University (which is honestly a better fit for recommendation to this sub, since it approaches all of the same issues in more depth and with no explicit smut, in fact [[https://fiction.live/stories/Mind-Control-University/uScpa3Z6TKhEjYhta/home][here's a link]]), described it as "the best piece of mind control fetish fiction he's ever read" or something to that effect. I remember thinking "well fuck, how am I going to avoid this now?"

Honestly it's not bad. They're anthropomorphized versions of the character, so the fact that they say "everypony" instead of "everyone" on occasion is pretty easy to ignore. Other than tails and manes, they're described as having all the right anatomy in the right places and most of it's up to the reader's imagination anyway.

That being said, I wouldn't have recommended it on here. Even moreso than Erogamer or Time Braid, this is porn. This is a story about sex that sometimes also has a plot interweaved between the sex. I'm not even sure that I'd recommend it as porn to anyone who isn't either a brony or a hypnofetishist. If you aren't either one or the other, then I'm not sure how it holds up. I'm also not saying don't read it, I'm just saying that I'm not sure, because I have an obviously biased perspective. I've enjoyed some absolute garbage writing that happened to perfectly suit my kink, but that's not the same as something actually being well written.

*** I mean, I wouldn't say that the objection is that it's about /status./ We've had MLP fic in here, and some of it makes the recommendation lists practically every month (hello Friendship is Optimal, hello Maretian). We've had plenty of vaguely NSFW fic in here, though it's rarely the explicit focus of the story.

I think the objection, if there really can be said to be any in a thread with only 16 comments half of which are the OP, is that this one is mostly /just/ porn. For me, I come to this sub to get fiction recommendations because there's a pretty good hit ratio- out of every ten stories people recommend on here I find two or three I like. When the sub starts to blur the line on what actually counts as ratfic and people start posting recs for terrible manga or the latest anime fic-stravaganza, that ratio goes down. Pony pornfic is the kind of thing that'd have to be really /exceptionally/ rational to clear the bar of "sub-worthy" for me, because there's /so much/ of it and just kind of allowing it willy-nilly is likely to dilute the pool of stuff I'd consider rational and worth reading still further.

Ultimately it's a very gatekeepy argument which is probably why I don't feel comfortable making it. If the mods are cool with it I'm not going to argue, but if I had to give a vote this is one of the few I'd want to see some exceptional evidence about before I gave it any kind of "rational fic" sub stamp of approval.

I wouldn't say that the mods are "cool with it", we just don't have any existing rules that would prohibit it, and in an ideal world, if people see something that they don't like or doesn't fit, they downvote it, and the curation is done that way (ideally with a message saying why it was downvoted).

Your humble mods /don't actually have the time/ to quality check everything that's posted here, and having the mods try to sort things into "rational" or "rational adjacent" or "not rational" is a rabbit hole that we couldn't fit down even if we wanted to. (We /do/ sometimes police discussion threads, removing the low effort ones, or redirecting people when they should have posted in one of the weekly threads, but that's a lot easier, because it doesn't require reading tens of thousands of words to make a judgment call.)

I specifically approved this post after it was removed by Automoderator because it's not in violation of our rules. I hope that if people would like to see less of any content in this sub, they downvote it (which I did, after reading the first chapter).

That simply is not the case. It has a lot of pornographic elements, especially in its first half, but it devotes just as much time to the plot even then, and by the second half (starting with Past Sins), the plot takes over and porn only occurs occasionally. There are entire chapters in this without any pornographic elements.

Is it more pornographic than Time Braid? Yes, definitely. Is it a work with a distinct rational plot? Most certainly. And as the definition of rational fiction doesn't include a clause about such a work needing to be non-pornographic, well, FiMC is qualified for this [[/r/rational]].

Sort of sequels to the ratfic [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]]. It turns out Bella is not an individual, she's a /pattern/. A Bella shows up in a wide variety of fanfics and original settings, where she (generally) acquires blatantly unfair amounts of magic, takes over the world, and dates someone interesting. Eventually, magic breaks the boundaries between worlds and the Bellas (including /Luminosity/!Bella, in those continuities) start meeting each other and solving each other's problems.

(If you're reading The Erogamer, this is what the "[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-26#post-1307983][From Sheen to Glow]]" perk is about.)

I don't /recommend/ Glowfic, mind. It's not for everyone. It's written by two authors as forum roleplay, /very/ long, uneven in quality, and optimised for exploring personal interaction rather than advancing plot in a satisfying manner.

They are all listed as being 12-13 at the time of part I, which is when the Chunin exam takes place. /Time Braid/ never contradicts this, and in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][chapter 1]] Sakura explicitly mentions that she is 13 (and that when she uses Naruto's Sexy Technique on herself, she looks like she has aged to about 16).

Sakura loses her virginity to Sasuke in a threesome with Ino in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/2/Time-Braid][chapter 2]]; both of them are non-loopers, and Sakura has been looping for less than 6 months at that point (she spends 3 days trying to tell her superiors about the loop, then decides to try passing the exam; she makes it a week into the exam, then gets disqualified after a double knockout with Ino; she has a breakdown that lasts for several days, then decides to try the exam again; it takes her 2 months to work her way back to fighting Ino, then she spends 1 month training with Ebisu; she is killed in the invasion and resets, then decides to try seducing Sasuke instead; she spends 3 weeks asking him out with no results, and a few more days going on dates with other boys; she talks to Ino and the two decide to seduce Sasuke at the same time using the Sexy Technique, which works).

The characters in /Time Braid/ do not act like children, but neither do canon characters. The difference is that canon characters only act like adults when it comes to fighting (typical for a shonen manga), while the characters in /Time Braid/ act like adults when it comes to fucking as well. Whether this is a realistic way for child soldiers to behave or not is up to you, but these are definitely not the smothered, overprotected children of a 21st century first world country.

Maybe some would say there's a point where you need to read 200 pages of poems and descriptions and/or sex scenes before you have an action that is qualified as rational but in my opinion as long as the actions that do exist are rational it fits, even if people uninterested in poems, description, sex scenes, or what have you, would be better off simply reading a summary.

I both like and dislike how this turned into a meta-discussion of perverse and emphatically sexual ratfics. Personally, I tend to enjoy those: I love the erogamer, enjoy time braid, and I'm excited to have discovered a rational my little pony mind-control erotica. That's some kinky stuff.

IMO, it's clear that rational fiction is defined by whether the characters act rationally, with coherent personal goals or at least realistic psychology, when they empirically approach unanswered questions, that sort of thing...*when* their thinking and decision making is the current focus of the story. You don't disqualify a ratfic by fitting in *too much* of another theme that is of itself perpendicular to rationality, such as fighting or scheming or sex; only irrationality and making characters hold the idiot ball to serve the needs of the plot do that. Personally, long kinky sex scenes interspaced with sound reasoning and decision making to move from each one of those to the next sounds like a perfectly valid sub-genre of ratfic, and like something I might enjoy reading!

I'm honestly quite disappointed that this gets so many downvotes, especially as the main reason for that seems to be "I don't like pony porn", which isn't really a reason to downvote a rational fic on [[/r/rational]] - I'm not a big fan of science fiction, should I therefore downvote all SF works posted here?

And I don't mean it like a Harlequin romance novel, where there is 1 page of fucking for every 250 pages of build-up; the /majority/ of this fanfic consists of anthro Twilight Sparkle having anthro lesbian sex with other anthro pony mares.

So why in the hell did I post this to [[/r/rational]]? Because the premise of this fanfic is that Twilight discovers a mind-control spell but she has no idea how to use it. First, she learns how the spell works through a combination of experimentation and trial-and-error. Then, she begins munchkining the spell. And /then/, she realizes that she is not the only pony in Equestria who knows this spell, and that she had better think very carefully if she wants to get through this with her harem and her free will intact...

I am nnnnot adverse to mind control erotica. But I'm not into quadrupeds, and in its choice of vocabulary this fic skews more pony than human. In fact if you hadn't explicitly mentioned anthro I might not have noticed (though yes, there's occasional mention of hands and human articles of clothing).

When character from the show use their iconic voices, it gets pretty hard to keep /pony/ out of the mental picture.

**** I've had that same problem before, not just with anthro pony fanfics but with any written fiction where my initial impression of what the characters look like contradicts their official appearance (as canonized in book covers, movie adaptations, etc...). My solution, when reading online at least, is to keep another tab with an accurate depiction of what the characters look like open, and refer to it whenever my mental picture of what the characters should look like starts to slip, until I internalize what the characters' appearances are supposed to be (in this case, [[https://derpibooru.org/1816822][anthro]] [[https://derpibooru.org/609132][images]] of the mane six).

****** What part of this conversation is confusing? I'm not into quadrupeds, so [[/u/erwgv3g34]] is suggesting a way to enjoy the fic without having intrusive pony-fucking mental imagery.
