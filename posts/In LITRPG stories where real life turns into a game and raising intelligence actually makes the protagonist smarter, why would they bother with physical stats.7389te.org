In most role-playing video games INT governs magical power, as opposed to STR which governs physical power. If we assume that there's no difference other than aesthetics between a punch(STR) and an energy bolt(int) then it wouldn't really matter which stat you increase. Punch the bad guy into paste or throw a ball of lightening at him, two widely different approaches but same end result.

But if we take into consideration the real meaning behind the stats, if Int actually made you smarter, wouldn't it have double the benefit? why would you put points into STR which raises your fighting capability when INT does EXACTLY the same thing but also makes you smarter?


** 1. INT may not actually make you smarter, it may be an abstract measure of magic power or efficiency.
2. In games, raising stats typically costs exponentially more EXP as the stat goes up.
3. In games, raising stats may be cheaper at lower levels.
4. INT based attacks may use up mana points, while you can do STR based attacks all day.
5. Old school D&D style games explicitly limit you to a certain number of spells per day.

*** I realize it widely depends on the system, but don't forget that the theme in all of these stories is life turning into a classic rpg game, not something completely random, and the protagonist can usually gather easily whether or not INT makes them smart/improve magical power- by the game overlay and a little bit of testing.

It's like supply and demand- a very crude economic model that wouldn't perfectly apply to every real life situation but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken into consideration.

Obviously someone new to the situation wouldn't have all the data, but the moment they realize that:

1.INT raises your "firepower"( fighting capability) 2. INT actually makes you smarter.

My experience with these fics is that they're almost always depicting games which have been balanced to assume that INT is a stat of the /character avatar/, as operated by a merely-human-level player. Then, separately, there's something else going on /outside/ of the game, as part of the narrative conceit, that unifies the player with the character, thus making the INT stat /also/ translate to increased intellect. My impression is that the games-as-designed don't usually take this unification into account in their balance.

One piece of evidence I have for this, is that although many characters in litRPG worlds have magic powers commensurate with boosted INT, I've never read a litRPG where any character /other than the protagonist/ has the sort of intellectual capacity you'd get by boosting INT in a game where INT controls that. It's only ever the protagonist that gets this effect, if it happens, because it's only the protagonist that isn't "from" the game.

Which is too bad; I'd love to read a litRPG where the protagonist is a permanent "merely human", brought to a fantastical world but not governed by stat-progression rules, who instead notices that everyone /else/ is governed by stat-progression rules, and so sets out to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingSim][raise]] an NPC party member into a God.

- You stand in front of a werewolf, magic ran out and he doesn't listen to reason. Do you still put your points in INT at that moment? Safety is not something you'll have to be given.
- Do other stats come with their own special benefits? STR allowing /muscle wizardry/? END making you immune to magics?

*** Thinking that improving your intelligence would result in personality death strikes me as a basically impossible position to hold.\\
After all it would imply that you are dying /all the freaking time/ without any "special" means of altering your mind. Whether from maturation, intelligence increases (if the protagonist is a teenager with some neural development ahead of them), or just from their mind being temporarily altered by tiredness, drugs, or any number of other things. There would also be no way even in principle to assess whether a given change would be enough to count as death.

Of course I generally have my own issues with identity change being too conflated with proper "oblivion" death since from an internal perspective they wouldn't resemble each other. Having your personality forcibly altered can be terrifying all on its own without trying to insist it's the same as having your brains blown out.

The challenge can be adjusted by adjusting this "thrown move" or "inattentiveness" rate. This is how variable-difficulty AI works in everything from fighting games to Go.

Imagine that an em was constructed by starting with a similarly "perfect" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing][general game-playing]] AI template, as best as future-tech can make it; which was then "skinned" with the personality, preferences, and memories ripped from a human; and which was then handicapped in a similar manner until the average output of their thought process matched the level the game-world wanted.

******* I think what is happening here is that you are defining intelligence as one of the integral aspects of the mind, while everyone else is defining it as one of the minds abilities. It's similar to difference between how cleverness and memory are treated in the English language. We say 'I am clever' and 'I have a good memory'; in this case people refer to their intelligence as something they are, and their memory as something they have.

In this debate I think what is happening is you are saying, for example, "I am a level 18 intelligence, changing me to a level 6 or a level 24 would be changing something integrally tied to my being", and other people are saying "I have a level 18 INT stat, changing that would only alter one of my capabilities, and would basically be no different than if I altered my STR stat."

Personally I believe that the only truly integral part of my mind is my self-awareness or 'consciousness' I guess (though that word is too fuzzy for most debates). My beliefs may change over the course of my life, but I wouldn't consider an earlier instance of me a different person, despite us having radically different minds. And while waking up after a bad night of drinking not remembering what happened is scary, I wouldn't think that the version of me from the night before (which had access to all of my memory plus the memories of what they were doing at the time) had died and been replaced by a different mind with one night of memories missing.

Your consciousness is a side effect of everything else in your mind.

One of the best fictional depictions of the result of suddenly getting superintelligence (significantly > 18 INT) is in /Protector/ by Larry Niven. It's also a pretty good book with some excellent physics hacking and rational characters (albeit with a bit of a '50s mindset since Niven was born in 1938).

I'd also suggest reading a bunch of Greg Egan, especially the short story /Mister Volition/.

However if I were to forget all my German, or all my English, I would have lost an ability, but not something integral to 'me' as conscious individual.

And while consciousness may be a side effect of everything else in your mind (I don't want to turn this into a debate on consciousness because those tend to just start going in circles), you have to admit that it does not 'feel' like that on a day to day basis. I feel like there is a 'me' thinking this sentence. When I am successful at meditation, I feel that there is a 'me' how has managed to stop thinking. From my point of me, my emotions happen to a central 'me'. While emotion and memory and thought are all key components of the mind, and consciousness as we know it couldn't exist without it, subjectively all those things can, or always do feel like things that a conscious mind does, rather than what a conscious mind is.

Basically here is the main thrust of my point of view, in a much simpler form that I probably should have used in the first place. Intelligence, in my point of view, is similar to the muscles of the body. Increasing intelligence, in a world where such a thing is possible in a clear quantitative way such as INT stat, would be more akin to building more muscle, and less akin to ripping out the muscles already present and replacing them with newer, shinier ones.

Thanks for the fiction recommendations :) I find that in debates about hypothetical things, peoples opinions are quite influenced by the fiction they've consumed on the topic (because, naturally fiction is the one of the main places where ideas such as this are expansively and thoughtfully explored). For example one of my siblings rebelled quite stubbornly against the notion of anything but a brain made from meat ever being considered conscious, until she watched Black Mirrors Season 2 Christmas Special and suddenly had a change of heart.

Living where I am right now, in a year or two the german-speaking version of me would have died, but I will still be here.

And if I go out drinking, and drink badly, then in the morning I won't remember what happened the night before. But would the version of me from that night, which went to sleep with a full memory, be said to have died? I hope not.

And to continue the muscle analogy; no I would no longer really by considered a homo sapien if my muscles were powerful enough to life trucks, but I would still be 'me'. Whether or not I could still be counted among the human population, I would still be, essentially, the same person I was before. Sure I would have much stronger muscles, and perhaps the point of view these much stronger muscles afforded me would make it so that I quickly formed different opinions and beliefs than I would have had before, but I simply cannot see how the actual act of altering my muscles in the first place would in any way 'kill' a version of me and replace it with a newer, stronger version.

Education also changes how people think, but we don't say that school 'kills' kids and turns them into students. When a reformed racists makes their new, better beliefs public, we don't mourn their old selves.

And to use a far more fictional example, when we're reading stories about people living in classic 'mutant gene' worlds, and the main character, inevitably, develops some kind of superpower, we as readers don't act as if the character we loved had died and been replaced by a superpowered version of themselves. Even if they suddenly develop precognition, or greatly accelerated thought speeds, we still think of them as themselves, but with a superpower.

And in the same way, if my INT score right now is 20, and I found out I was in a LITRPG story and found some way to change it to 40, I would do it. Because I don't think that would kill me and replace me with a smarter version of myself, but rather just make the central, integral 'me' smarter. In the same way that alcohol certainly lowers my inhibitions and, arguably, my intelligence, but it doesn't kill me either. And in the same way that drinking too much and forgetting a night I used to remember doesn't 'kill' me either.

But if you were going through some total mindwiping, the new you would not be the same (e.g. you would lose any of the influences your German heritage had during your upbringing, informing your current attitudes and behaviors).

Chemical interference in the brain is bringing in another level of complexity. But yes that drunk version of you (who did not have a full memory, since memory loss occurs due to memories never being stored in long-term-memory) is dead if you assume you will remember nothing (and no one will remind you) and none of your actions will ever inform a future you.

You're confusing/overlapping the muscle analogy with uniformity-of-consciousness (though yes, such a muscle upgrade may change the way you perceive yourself, especially in relation to other humans). I'm not sure how you can say you're not killing your old biological version of yourself when you are a distinctly new creature.

Education is essentially the same, except it's gradual and people are slower to recognize a "change" when it occurs over a continuum of time. You're appealing to emotions here with the word "kill." Education in its many forms does "kill" the students' old selves but it's rarely labeled as such except when it violates social mores. Many mourn the brainwashed youth of ISIL.

In fiction, it's because it's a, well, polite fiction. Our tendency to perceive sameness is Gestalt prägnanz in action. Even if the onset of a superpower marks a change in thinking/behavior, we prefer seeing it as a continuity. By the way, there are stories that explore these issues of identity (off the top of my head, Worm, fanfics like Tabloid).

You have a strong faith in uniformity-of-self and I don't want to argue about the metaphysics of identity on an emotional basis. There are many studies on the relationship between intelligence (usually measured by IQ) and personality/behavior.

Well, (and this is only a basic level of understanding, I'm not a neurologist) your neurons interact with each other by releasing neurotransmitters. Memories and skills form by proteins building up on/in the synapse which gives more weight to a neuron/neurons. Those neurons fire more readily in the future, especially when other neurons that fired at the same time do. In that way, patterns form in the brain and you learn. The "mind" is the map of those patterns. If you change brain structure you change the map. There is no "mind" entity floating around, being fed by the brain. It's a map generated by the brain. You can run the map on different hardware and it will still act the same (brain uploading) but if you change the map by changing the hardware you have changed the mind, which can be considered death. We accept a certain amount of variance as a matter of course, since a lot of things affect the brain. How the amount of variance that means death is defined is up to you.

The basic way I handled the issue is that the protagonist has lots of traits he is trying to raise, focused around his mind, but 'int' isn't one of them. he has 'short term memory' and things like that. It all combines together to make who he is. The /physical stats/ aren't even shown for him. For this exact reason.

For example, you could make spells depend on magic circles (possibly mental visualization), whose lines/angles have to be adjusted to determine all kinds of attributes. Like a fireball would have size, temperature, mana cost, direction, speed, etc. And the mage has to compute the mana cost correctly as a function of the other attributes: too low = spell fails to activate, too high = spell backfires.
