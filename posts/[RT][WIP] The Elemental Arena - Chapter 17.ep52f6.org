[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/445999/chapter-seventeen-base-building][Base Building?]] is now up. The game has changed, and the players now have a town builder on top of an RPG.

What other buildings should they make, if any?

** Caught up a few days ago. I really enjoy this take on a litRPG.

I wonder if Tygerion the Maker is actually sort of a good guy.

#+begin_quote
  "If you need further motivation, you will also want to win for the rewards; your planet will be in dire need of them soon. (...) Tygerion the Maker didn't expressly forbid me to say it" (chapter 6)
#+end_quote

Maybe Tygerion knows about an impending crisis that humanity might not survive without the rewards. Maybe the RPG setting, however violent, is the best way he thought of to design trials that look fair to every species, but actually give a huge advantage to humans who are familiar with the concept. Maybe he thought he needed to kill almost 80000 constestants in order to improve the odds of saving the entire population of Earth.

#+begin_quote
  "He is one of the most enthusiastic Trial Masters in quite some time." (chapter 3)
#+end_quote

This is weak evidence against my theory. It is most probable that he simply chose the RPG setting because he enjoys it. But he could be both doing what he believes is right and having fun in the process. (Another possible reading of this quote, but this seems too far-fetched: he is relieved to receive a possible solution to a crisis he knew was coming and works very hard on the trials to make this solution a reality.)

In chapter 16, I am a little surprised they don't even consider travelling all together to regroup with the other humans South. I am not saying they should have done this. But they don't even bring it up as an option. Of course there are downsides: the food issue, the two wounded (although Nathan now has the gloves for Emma to use her healing skill so they could travel once both are healed), setting up farther away from the central dungeon... But it would be a two hour trip instead of the four hour round trip Nathan dislikes. It would let them gather more people faster, since the other human groups are even further South. This means more people to contribute NPs to buildings sooner. And if the other players have already started putting up buildings, then it is better to expand on that camp than set up their own distinct camp (in chapter 17 we find out that they are the first to purchase a building, but they didn't know that).

Actually, they never consider that when they send people off to gather more groups, those groups might have similar reservations to travelling: wounded of their own, buildings that they don't want to abandon...

They could try and position themselves on the map to spell HI, or move in a pattern that other players could notice and respond to (for example an alternatively expanding and shrinking circle). They can check Ava's map to see if it is recognizable enough. This is a long shot: other humans need to have the map skill and check their map at the right time. But it would not have a high opportunity cost if they do it while discussing or eating or sleeping (if they can still stay packed enough for security). If they do manage to establish communication, conveying information would be long and tedious (spelling letters would work; chinese caracters would carry information faster but may be too complex to draw this way). Still, long distance communication with people they haven't even met would be invaluable. And who knows, it might unlock a phone skill.

*** I think Tygerion himself probably does have some very compelling reasons to make the arena as it is. It would make the story better to have a much-maligned character have some very understandable motives.

As far as meeting with other humans, the red dot on the map is likely to draw attention - but then, Ava could simply look to see if any others are approaching. That skill of hers is a very mixed blessing. Knowing where others are is important, but you're helpless to do anything if you see them clustering together and winking out of existence.

Communication is important enough for there to be a /Language I/ skill. Maybe advancing this skill can unlock some form of telepathy? Alternately, maybe there's an elemental or general skill unlocked by communicating over a long range. (Smoke signals, use of the scimitar and fire to reflect light, or waving of flags all spring to mind as things to try.)

** Very intriguing. Second chapter in a row that we've cliffhangered with a new piece of the game system revealed, lol. I'm going to take a guess and say that equipment fusion is going to be a wood-prime skill. It would fit with wood's element being a jack of all trades to be able to mix and match different pieces of equipment and loot, and with the game's seeming vision of locking what would normally be fundamental parts of the game to a minority of players.

I agree that medical tent was probably their smartest choice possible, especially since with the revelation that active and passive skill effects stack there's reason to think a building-based skill would, as well. Having a form of healing that doesn't cost EPs is extremely helpful to healers, who can then conserve EPs for offensive skills and hopefully prevent injuries to begin with.

After that, gear vendor is probably their best possible option. Lilly made an excellent point that she wouldn't be able to make a shield without craftsman tools, and now that we know the game's system explicitly supports crafting, it will almost certainly return dividends to focus on harvesting monster parts and wood to make their own equipment, which are the tools I imagine a gear vendor would sell. They'll probably get weapon/armor/equipment crafting as a skill out of it, too.

The part specifying that only /simple/ tents and fences don't count as buildings was interesting, since it appears the medical tent is still just a tent and therefore mobile. Obviously making three medical tents just for the settlement bonus probably isn't smart, but it'll give them a head start for any possible pioneer bonuses for making the first settlement.

In that vein, it seems their group is by far in the lead, which our MC calls out. First to activate an obelisk, first to create a building. If the reward for the first settlement is appropriately high (Say, +2 to prime element?) they may be tempted to invest heavily in buildings, even if they can't sustain them, just to make sure they get it.

*** I had the same thought about /Equipment Fusion I/. It matches nicely with /Buildings I/ and /Advanced Healing I/, which establish strong roles for the primes with those skills. Additionally, crafting and city building both come across as sub-games, making it a strong parallel.

**** Yup. Personally I'm a little iffy on Advanced Healing being their equivalent, because it's just a strong skill rather than a whole new dimension to the game with its own strategy, so to speak. Trying to fit in common game subsystems, there are a few that have yet to be introduced.

- Potions/Alchemy - the consumable side to equipment crafting, and what I'd peg for Water's unique skill

- Enchantment - the pseudo-blacksmith angle makes it a candidate for Metal imo

- Private Messages/Minimap - not likely to be a class-based thing since the Maps skill was introduced already.

The only one I can't think of off-hand is Fire's. Possibly some kind of monster taming/summoning system?

***** Pets are a relatively common feature in MMOs. Since we haven't seen anything sizable enough to use that isn't a monster, that sort of skill would probably involve a captured enemy.

Ava, the player with /Maps I/ skill, is a Water Prime. Due to that skill's interaction with the environment, I'm guessing it's a Wood 2 skill.

The mini-boss from ch.15-16 used an area Fire attack which seemed pretty powerful. I'm guessing that's the Fire 4 Prime skill, and that it's unlocked by using fire offensively. It doesn't line up with the sub-game idea, admittedly.

** Listed options were:

- Simple Tent: sleeps two (does not count as a building) - 50 NPs.

- Medical Tent: houses two patients - 150 NPs.

- Weapons Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Armor Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Gear Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Food Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Simple Outhouse - 75 NPs.

- Wooden Fence: 5 meters length (does not count as a building) - 20 NPs.

The players have just spend 150 NPs on a Medical Tent. They recovered 70 NPs due to a system reward for investing into a building the first time. They started with 284 NPs, and so now have 204 NPs remaining, plus 13 for the monster attack, plus a further 6 or so from harvesting and unlocking a new skill.

With 223 NPs remaining, they could just about afford to get a second Medical Tent, plus an Outhouse. This would guarantee them the first settlement in zone 14, and probably net them all a new reward. Waking up Zhang could get them the rest of the way.

*** I love that the author takes these things into consideration, it's what puts this story head and shoulders above the works of most authors I've read.

It kind of signals that it's okay to think deeply about the story and get engaged with it, and I find exploring the process a very enjoyable reading on its own.

I have some high hopes for the out of shape characters, they must have some first class mental stats to be picked and have made it this far despite the severe physical disadvantage. Like if they were the kid who was enthusiastically curious about everything and went on regular Wikipedia binges and actually retained most of the info or something.

Might not be great in direct combat but could become a fantastic force multiplier if they are allowed to grow. So much of a scenario like this is about discovering and making the right choices and learn fast from mistakes at as small a risk as feasible.

Industrialize the monster harvest with all the traps and cages, mwuahaha!

**** Both Ava and Angelo are Water Primes, and both show signs that they weren't initially very physically fit; i.e. they got in due to high Mental rating. With the first-in-zone bonus to Prime rating, they also both meet the requirements to learn /Advanced Healing I/. Angelo ran a dry cleaning business, and so very likely knows how to sew, suturing injuries to gain the skill. Ava's background isn't well-known, just yet.

It would make enormous sense for there to be a skill for detection, removal, and setting of traps.

** This chapter nails down at least the weakest upgrades as significantly less than five minutes of time spent disabled. Have we gotten any other data points on how long the knockout effects from bigger upgrades last? I recall Nathan just being generally worried about people upgrading shortly before attacks, but nothing super specific.

I'm interested in the possibility of using a Physical upgrade to heal mid-fight, if the fight looks long enough that an otherwise disabled player could be back in the action before it's over.

*** I haven't seen any really scientific measure of upgrade time. There seems to be a threshold of around 130 Physical where upgrades no longer knock out the player. They're still largely helpless, but can at least stay aware of the world and call for help.

This implies that what you're predicting will come to pass. Recovery buffs don't seem to help based on what we've seen - but Nathan's faster downtime may well be due in part from /Rapid Recovery I/.

** Oh sweet to see them try to harvest parts from the critters!

There are a few exciting possibilities I see right away.

There is of course building mundane rabbitsnares to catch beavers with Nathan's survival skill, but it proves promising that they might be able to SNARE the goblins and systematically steal their weapons and armor.

Having a shallow hidden spike pit might also be helpful for the boss now that they can sharpen wood with their steel knives, so far it seems pretty simple to lure even intelligent-ish enemies into traps due to their extreme aggression.

Still greatly enjoying this work and all the rational aspects of it. Every time I think "why don't they just...? And someone in the story proceeds to bring up that very question I get a warm happy feeling inside.

I see the effort tge author puts into making this a rational story and I appreciate it.

Also, am an accountant and I hate math, it doesn't come very naturally to me and I use excel and calculators for even the simplest calculations. Accountants who don't intuitively use math is plenty feasible.

And goddammit Johanna, you're a Swede, I know we can be sheltered but goddamn stop being such a Karen.

** Preface: I am enjoying the story and the writing in general.

  For the achievement of establishing the first building in zone 14, all contributing players gain +1 affinity to their Prime element.

Another instance of "humans did something before any of the other races in the zone"? I really hope we later find out that some other races got some similar achievements around this same time, which the humans narrowly missed out on, otherwise I'm feeling a lot of [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]] leaking into my [[/r/rational][r/rational]] here

*** The affinity required to gain this skill is pretty large.

What I'm scratching my head about now is that at least 4 of the 14 players (Nathan, Emma, Harrison, Lilly) started with +1 to their prime affinity. Either the prime-only reward is far more common, or else the players are insanely lucky with epic reward choices.

**** Not necessarily. The wording for Nathan's reward was +1 affinity /of their choice/, which is probably what makes it T1 Epic. A predesignated +1 affinity, to one's prime element or otherwise, is likely just a Rare reward though we haven't seen that show up yet.

Also it's worth noting that from the 4 rewards (total of 20) we've seen, we've got:

#+begin_quote
  40% Common

  35% Uncommon

  20% Rare

  05% Epic
#+end_quote

as the distribution. While epic may still be overrepresented here, a 5% chance of it appearing (discounting a possible Rare-tier affinity up) means that it would have appeared an average of 3.5 times over 14 players' rewards. Not too unlikely to have 4 people with it, then.

***** Half of the human players apparently died getting through the preliminaries before learning any affinity skills. Some, like Kean, died before even getting an affinity.

Emma is an example of someone who scored a powerful skill due to high stat and affinity - which she then could not use.

I think there probably is a bias toward high affinity, though, at the very least due to those selecting it likely having a better idea of how the game worked and what was expected from them.

Edit to add that of the earlier monsters, Horned Beavers are Water Primes and Guthark Tribesmen are Earth Primes, so a high affinity in either or both of these could well be pretty relevant to survival.

This part concerns me, too. Unless you assume humans are the best at something, there should be other races with more physical or more mental on average, so some of them should have been able to use 40+ EP skills from the beginning.

******* The Physical and Mental stats themselves are human-based, with 100 being average. I wonder how this is impacted on other species. For example, a physically huge species could have an average Physical stat of 200, or they could have an average of 100 (i.e. they're physically powerful, but the system only cares about stats relative to average for that species).

The stats shown for Guthark Tribesmen and Horned Beavers lead me to think it's the first situation, which would support your position.

There's basically nothing known to us about the other species at the moment. It could be that the truly smart ones are also antisocial and physically weak enough that a Horned Beaver represents a serious threat.

The two things we do know about them is that they've orbited their planet, and they've all failed past arenas. A few of them could be seriously threatening to humans, but a lot of them could be physically weak, especially with all of their technology removed. /(Edit: the second point here is almost certainly wrong. At least one of the other species must have a win in their long competitive history.)/

Making an elephant orbit the Earth is possible, but enormously difficult compared to a human-sized creature, so there is probably an upper bound on the size of the rival creatures.

(Side note: We've also orbited our world with chimps and dogs. While it'd completely break the tone of the story, I find the notion of teams of these species to be uproariously funny.)

My assumption for now is, until proven otherwise, that rarity works by default the same way for both drops and rewards.

Maya's been collecting all sorts of data, and may be able to reach conclusions on this based on drops from Horned Beavers and Guthark Tribesmen.

Then again, those orbs are small and easily missed. It's possible some of these have dropped and been left unnoticed.
