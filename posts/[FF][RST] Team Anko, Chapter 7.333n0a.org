** Okay Orichimaru the plan Denier is so far the best character in this fic, possibly any Naruto fic ever, what with his friendly goody free technique baiting and problem solving. More of him please. And is it possible for Naruto and co to just fly/jump really high to run away, and then flap/glide on some sort of chakra sheathed wings?

Now for the other mater.

How rational, rationalist and scientifically accurate will this new superhero story be? Will there equal intelligent division so that everyone (and i mean everyone who has a reason to be involved) is allowed to be smart, what's the scale of events and how long will the story be? Also what mood, if any, will it be written in? Happy fun times, spy/inteligence thriller, grimdarkedgy, interpersonal drama or something else?

  How similar would you say you plan it on being to Worm?
#+end_quote

Pretty much not at all aside from "real world + superpowers". Worm was a groundbreaking work with some really interesting characters and ideas. It is justifiably popular and has (at least partially) spawned a new genre. It also had quite a few failings:

- Only Taylor was allowed to munchkin her powers
- Power creep was off the charts and fighting gods is boring
- The entire concept of super powered people putting on costumes to fight / commit crimes / stop crimes is ridiculous. See '[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][CutLexLuthorACheck]]' for why. Even if they DO decide to commit crimes, a brightly colored set of tights and broad daylight is just stupid compared to dark colors at night
- The only reason Wildbow could find to justify this stupid behavior was 'alien worms infest their brains and make them do stupid things' which is a narrative cheat of the highest order
- Many of the villains (esp. Slaughterhouse 9) were [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][EvilForTheLulz]]
- Wildbow set up this interesting idea of parallel dimensions with parallel people, mentioned trade between them, and then never did a damn thing with that until literally the last few pages. The only place where parallel dimensions were really used was people-less evacuation points -- basically, glorified bomb shelters
- Wildbow established an interesting, articulate, inventive protagonist with a cool but not overwhelming power set that she used cleverly. He then turned her into a mute with a completely different and overwhelming power set and made her be the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne][OneTrueSavior]], the only person who could save the day against the final boss.

I disagree with costume opinion though. What do you feed a 600 pound Gorilla? Anything it wants! What does a pyromancer wear? Anything it wants!

If anything supers should wear what's most comfortable to them and what they like. I don't know how you feel about requests, but please have at least one person in CUSS wear a snuggie with kevlar coating and bunny ears.

And yes, supers CAN wear their underwear on the outside if they want, but who in their right mind would? Seriously, if you suddenly developed super powers and, for Dawkins knows what reason, decided to use them for crime...would YOU put on a brightly colored spandex costume? I doubt it very much.

********** Role scripts.

People could take their special supernatural talents and map them into any reference frame---being a super-gambler, for instance, or a super-doctor, or even a super-inventor. Those sort of people don't wear costumes, but they also don't get in fights, or think of themselves as "super." They just have a savant-like ability to do something, and work that into their lives.

Some people, though, take a supernatural talent and map it into the reference frame of comic book narratives. They wear the spandex for the same reason they fight (or cause) the crime: because that's What You Do When You're In A Comic Book. Not because it's a /good/ idea, but because it's a /cached thought/. What uniform do you wear if you fight crime with superpowers? "Uhh... spandex!"

(Though this would suggest that the more epistemically-rational a character is, the less likely they are to decide to wear spandex on their own, because they know to look past the cached thought. Were there any particularly /epistemically/ rational characters in Worm? Like, the Luminosity!Bella kind of epistemically-rational. I don't remember any.)

****** (It suddenly occurs to me that maybe when you say failing, you mean that it fails to be a rationalfic. In that case, please ignore this)

Can you really call it a failing if it allows the story to grow in new interesting ways? Wildbow told a story that hadn't been told before, and if you 'fixed' all those issues (without growing the story in new and nontrivial ways), what you'd have left is something way less interesting.

Can you really call it a failing if a repair job doesn't make it better?

It's not power creep, it's a dramatic increase in scope. Fighting gods isn't boring, it's awesome. It's not a narrative cheat, it's a setting.\\
Horror story monsters are EvilForTheLulz, too. Does that mean horror stories are bad? No, it just means the story isn't about the villain.

As for Taylor's power, she really should have been a thinker 12 or something. She had a massively parallel brain - the real secret of the story is that she was overpowered all along, it just took her a while to figure it out.

Not wanting to get too tangled up in this, I'll just respond to this one item.

Fighting gods is boring, because there's only two stories that you can tell. The first goes like this:

1. God/heroes come to battle.
2. God holds the idiot ball and decides to toy with his opponents.
3. Heroes lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, WIN! Yay, heroes!

The second story you can tell goes like this:

1. God/heroes come to battle.
2. God wins.

********* Fair enough. I don't think that invalidates my point though -- there's two scenarios: either god (is an idiot / holds the idiot ball) so that the heroes have a chance, or he isn't / doesn't and the heroes lose more or less instantly.

Rationalfic or not, characters shouldn't be pointlessly stupid -- whether you call that 'their character' or 'carrying the idiot ball', it's still bad writing.[1] If the only way you can have a fight /not/ be a curbstomp is for one character to carry the idiot ball, then you need to find a way to write your story so that battle doesn't have to happen.

[1] The only time that I think you /can/ have a character be an idiot is if they're only there for comic relief. Even then, you really want to go lightly on that note.

Hm. You know, I actually don't remember how it ended -- by that point I was really just reading out of stubbornness.

What I remember is that Taylor took a power boost that she was explicitly told would probably do horrible things to her and, oh shocker, it did horrible things to her, including making her mute. She then got with Doormaker, grabbed control of every cape in existence and...did something. The next thing I remember was her getting shot-but-not-really and then ending up in Dimension X talking to her mirror universe mom.

What actually happened in between?

Taylor lost control over most people because Doormaker used up all the batteries on his power.

Taylor remembered that Zion had predicted everything using his version of the path to victory shard, but realised that Zion is stupid enough to be wrong about what he was seeing.

Zion was enacting the path to bringing back his partner the entire time. So Taylor threw Oliver at him. Oliver's power is to become the perfect image of beauty to whoever looks at him, so when Zion looked at him he turned into Zion's partner.

Zion realised he hadn't /actually/ managed to bring back his partner with his precog powers, only to find someone who /looked like/ her, and that the cycle was well and truly over with nothing he could do about it, and in his despair he destroyed himself.

******** Yeah, agreed. There are definitely downsides to that kind of plot. And yeah there's power creep, and narrative cheats, and EvilForTheLulz is flat characterisation - but these things have their strengths too. Or maybe, they are the price paid for making other areas of the story better.

Fighting gods... if you're fully invested in the characters and plot by the time it happens, you don't worry about idiot balls and such, instead you cheer when the enemy makes an error. And the awesomeness of it makes everything better.

To summarise, I don't think it's a good idea to see them as failings. They're choices. And, if you choose to avoid them, you end up with a different story, not a better one.

Again though, if you're primarily worried about writing a rational story, it totally makes sense to see them as failings...

Anyway, chapters in CUSS will be given out for free via download link to people on my mailing list. A few days later the link will stop working and the chapter will only be available for purchase on Amazon.

No, she's Lightning and Fire. She doesn't do battlefield control -- not enough chakra and she's a close-range fighter. Naruto is the BFC on the team.

EDIT: They've actually got a good complement -- Hinata is close range, Shino is mid-range, Naruto is long-range, and Anko is free safety. Hinata provides perfect close-in spying and enemy detection (her Byakugan has a range of about fifty or sixty yards) all the time, Shino provides good mid-range enemy detection IF he's set it up in advance, and between the three of them they are aces at information gathering.

This reminds me of a a crack theory I once had, back when Orochimaru was first introduced in canon as the BBEG, that he had been alive for hundreds of years already (being a master of disguise and having several ways of overcoming old age) and had mad-scientist-genetically-engineered the Sharingan into existence in order to one day possess it, in a very Dune-esque way. Itachi, also being a genius in his own way, found out about this through Secret Ancient Lore or something, murders the entire rest of his clan just to throw a wrench into Orochimaru's plans (because he really was that dangerous...) but at the very end, just can't bring himself to kill his younger brother. Racked with guilt, he manipulates Sasuke to the path of hatred and vengeance (probably to fast-track his training as an anti-Orochimaru measure) and then flees Leaf because they'd have his head if they ever caught him.

Upon hearing of Orochimaru's invasion of Leaf, Itachi shows up literally immediately afterwards, under the pretense of scouting out Naruto as a demon host, just to confirm Sasuke is safe...
