  Interim chapters start next update day, not Parahumans 2 chapters.
#+end_quote

[[https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/an-end-to-the-twig-experiment/][And more clarification on what comes next:]]

#+begin_quote
  Worm 2 (Technically it's Parahumans 2) is rolling out soon. In the meantime, I'll be dropping some very super minor tidbits on the Worm website. These interim pieces will serve as kind of unofficial/prelude/tone-setting bits and will go up on my usual schedule, just as things for people to see if they're keeping to their usual routine of checking in. They will not be full-length chapters and may not even be 500 words long.

  This will go on for a couple weeks (5-10 segments on the usual Tues/Possible Thurs/Sat schedule) and the final installment in the set will link to the site for the Worm sequel. Links will also appear on all of my sites. This will give me time to hopefully get some final preliminary work done, wrangle the mailing list, and (ideal world) fix my currently scattered sleep schedule.
#+end_quote

But yeah, go read Twig if you haven't. I don't think I can oversell how great it is.

******** The power to generate additional dicks on hyper-arousal has incredibly interesting consequences, though! Is the matter to grow the dicks drawn from your body or created ex nihilo? Could you accidentally transmute your entire outer surface, or even your entire body, into dicks? Does this give researchers access to a limitless supply of dickmeat for in-vitro study so long as they can keep you aroused? Can we learn how to replicate this power and genetically implant it in embryos as a roundabout cure for ED? Could we modify the organ which replicates on arousal, or even make it possible to regenerate any organ or body part on orgasm? Is this power the one which will lead us down the road to immortality?

All interesting questions to answer. All questions which can be scientifically examined. Let's begin, shall we?

** Far from being excited about Worm 2, I'm actually quite anxious. While world building is amazing, for me Worm is mostly about Taylor, who is extremely unlikely to appear in Worm 2 in any capacity beyond a passing mention or a as historical/religious figure, let alone a protagonist.

I am also enjoying a steady supply of some great Taylor-centric Worm fanfics, and so I'm worried Worm 2 is going to pull away a significant chunk of the fandom, causing current authors to switch to stories about new characters that I don't care about.

As for Twig, I started reading it the last time a notification about it ending was posted here, and I've just finished Arc 4. While it is certainly better than early Worm, in almost any 'objective' metric I can come up with, it has also failed to hook me in the same way Worm did, and is, at points, a bit of slog to get through. But yes, if you have not given it a try yet, you absolutely should.

Rather I was more inclined to read an arc, go read something else, then come back and read another arc. But the actual arcs themselves, especially the character dynamics, were great.

I rate it above Pact at least.

***** Good question. I am going to say this represents my personal enjoyment. For example, in Worm, there is a huge slog fighting the clones of the (forgot their team name). However, the back and forth in trying to figure out what Tattletale knew was very drama filled and exciting.

With Pact, I loved the rules of the world, but wasn't a fan of where the main characters took it. I ended up losing interest in what was going on, and was more excited about interlude chapters with excerpts from the textbooks!

Twig (no spoilers) left me feeling like it was too slow, the world wasn't as interesting as Pact, the excitement wasn't as great as Worm's highs. But... I found myself constantly thinking about it, and found myself intwined with the main character's personality, and much more invested than the previous stories.
