Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** [Warning: shameless self promotion ahead]

I've been wanting to get back into writing for a while, and after hours of playing CK2, reading historical manga, and an abortive attempt to watch the lucario movie, I've started writing a Pokemon feudalism quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/an-age-of-stone-and-clay-pokemon-feudalism.50263/][here]]. It follows PMD rules in that humans aren't around, but otherwise the worldbuilding is entirely my own.

I'd love to see any constructive criticism/new voters, either here or in the thread.

** I'm late to the party because I missed the last few chapters of Worth the Candle (I like to let a few chapters of a story build up before going back to read, especially after a climax) so I figured I'd post this here:

Did anyone else get massive chills when reading these lines from chapter 120? I know I did: [spoilers for 120]

"Can we talk about the market forces thing for a bit?” asked Arthur. “Because I think that bears some digging into, especially if we're digging into moral statements.” “Moral statements!” said Fenn as she slipped into the booth next to me. “My favorite!” "

*** Spoilers, yo. Kinda shitty to point out that people who don't read each chapter as they come out exist, then turn around and spoil it for those who are still waiting.

**** Oh fuck you're totally right. What a brain dead moment. Gonna tag it right now. Might fuck up the quotations but it's worth it to avoid spoilers

******* You're using the spoiler tags that only work on old reddit. The tags as shown in the sidebar work for both. If you go to the [[https://new.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9hqtsj/d_friday_offtopic_thread/][new.reddit]] version of this page, you can see that they're not working.

(Spoiler tags were implemented via CSS hackery, which isn't available on new.reddit, which is why we haven't made the old tags backwards compatible - we can't.)

******* The difference for me is that your spoiler tag (in markdown) has the slashes like this: \ instead of this: /

On my screen, everything /else/ that people 'spoilered out is spoilered out.' Your quotation shows up as:

[spoilers for 120](#s " "Can we talk about the market forces thing for a bit?” asked Arthur. “Because I think that bears some digging into, especially if we're digging into moral statements.” “Moral statements!” said Fenn as she slipped into the booth next to me. “My favorite!” ") instead of: /[[#s][spoilers for 120/]]

*** Yeah, but in retrospect I'm considerably more shaken by all of Mr. Dice Guy's lines. Also his t-shirt. I feel like he's dropping spoilers for the rest of the story.

*** Yes, I thought this section was phenomenal. The argument, the fake-out, and everything about the DMs lines. (Also, the joke about average fridge sizes.) (EDIT: maybe we should be spoiler-tagging this? I know we haven't said anything that spoilery, but better safe than sorry.)

*** The story is very good at springing these 0-100 moments on you, with my personal favourite of course involving a certain cannibal.

One underrated scene that gave me more of a 'creeping' chill was during the Fallatehr arc when Amaryllis is driving Joon on the bike, pulls up in front of Fallatehr out in the open, begins trying to (ostensibly) play peacemaker between the two and you can feel Joon's rising horror as he tries to figure out wtf has happened to Amaryllis since he's been gone
