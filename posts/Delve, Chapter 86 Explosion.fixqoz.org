For one, the way he's unlocking every skill tree available is reinforcing his "soul", and there was a scene about how the Guard's lie detection didn't work as well on him because of it. I think once he unlocks everything available, it will unlock a special class at the level 25 upgrade point.

Also the scene about how he's speculating about how someone could learn the weapon Katas through practice (without the skills) leads me to believe he'll train to upgrade his staff fighting the old-fashioned way.

**** Yes, Rain has been forced into picking up Offensive Auras due to the lack of a reliable and trustworthy party. That's not the true power of the build, though. It's always been the massive mana regeneration combined with Utility Auras and especially the ability to constantly keep Winter active, even as far back as chapter 15 when it's revealed that's the reason Lavarro let him tag along to the mine. Beacon slaves aren't going to have exactly the same build, because they're kept low level so they have to be very specialized with their few skill points and they aren't allowed to have offensive skills so they can't escape, but the core principles seem very similar.

***** I think the bigger part is that he's a Dynamo with monolithic spirit. I know the empire uses monoliths a lot more than other countries, but there's no reason to assume they use /only/ monoliths. This is speculation since we haven't seen the Empire yet, but I think the empire slaves are part of the Worker (noncombat) class instead of Dynamo.

They get a raw boost of 50% better auras immediately, and Dynamo doesn't actually benefit them at all. It gives them more mana, but if they're just using winter or other auras they'll have more than enough mana for that. Force shield slaves also exist, but those would benefit more from int for the mana pool.

Since slaves can do their job arguably better by being a Worker and a Dynamo is a known (if rare) combat risk waiting to happen, they might even intentionally prevent them from being able to follow that build.

That's the story explanation, but it's not reflected in the mechanics; Synergy means that an Animus at Rain's level with his stat boosts (+29 to both Focus and Clarity) will have 41,500 mp and regen at 11,500 mp/day. For context, Dynamo Rain has 7,500 mp and regens 22,000 mp/day.

A non-monolith with 50/50 Focus and Clarity would have 9,000 mp but regen only 6,000 mp/day! That's *less* than an Animus! There's an argument to be made as a result of this that the class boost for Animus might only be +100%, rather than +200% for Dynamo, but that still leaves an Animus with 8,000 mp/day regen, still more regen than a non-monolith.

This is already plenty of mana for general use, though it'll take three to four days to regenerate from empty, but then we take into account that Rain still has Winter. With that active, a +200% Animus Rain would regen at 125,000 mp/day, and a +100% Animus Rain wolud regen at 86,500 mp/day. This is plenty to justify wanting the much higher mana caps.

********* Honestly the only thing I can think of is if Intrinsic Clarity / Magical Synergy doesn't give protection from mana burn.

In that case you could regen 86,500 mana but it'd kill you since you only have 10 'real' clarity.

As a side note, I want to see Rain mess up somebody using mana burn. Essence well dumping 10k mana into somebody who doesn't use mana (like Velika) should do a number on them.

With Dynamo, Rain's 229 Clarity gets multiplied to 687 (300%) effective by Dynamo. Then Magical Synergy means 25% of this gets added to Focus, which amounts to 171Â¾ (75%). This is why Rain has more mana than someone who simply split 50-50 into Focus. It would be weird if the logic didn't work in the other direction.

IMO the problem is simply that Magical Synergy is a poorly-designed, overpowered skill. It would make sense at 5% cross coupling or so.

******* the issue is that Animus can't sustain itself. it definitely would raise rain's top end damage by a massive amount(as far as i know) but how much higher(if at all) would it's damage be compared to Two aura's at once? cuz once Rain can unlock Prismatic Intent, he can run a single aura at max strength with full bonuses from all the modifiers 100% of the time and Winter aura for no lost mana. because don't forget, Rain's #1 advantage since coming to this planet is constantly soaking his brain in mana, letting the "overmana" help him adapt and learn faster.

or if he wants raw damage, two damaging auras simultaneously. he'd be trading massive versatility and sustained fighting strength, for an increase in burst damage that'd taper off much more quickly. and he's allready been established as a city level threat by the watch.

***** Well, a short burst of an aura has been described as a Nova, which I would assume is the shortest possible use. So rapid switching, at a high intensity, would be pulsing hot-cold-repeat novas.

The issue, I would argue, would be Rain as the epicenter. He would be exposed to extreme heat, then extreme cold, on repeat. He could be exposed to each temperature swing, in full, before the environmental effects of his Auras could normalize.

The only argument I can think of against Rain by-definition taking environmental damage from pulsing opposing novas would be the time it takes to switch auras vs. the time it takes for convection through his 'soul bubble' (area immediately around Rain's body that is unaffected by Aura) and armor shielding.

If he can do it fast enough, sure, hot + cold = room temperature. If 'fast enough' is possible is unlikely / undetermined.

***** I think it's implied that this is what happened, and that's what the majistraal were- a large scale efficient society that had a good infrastructure for farming blues. They collapsed however long ago, and things haven't recovered yet; those innovations/developments haven't occured. It's said at some point that monsters get stronger with levels faster than humans, to the point that most high-level adventurers who try and raise their cap fail and die.

****** Maybe. The way the system is set up does imply a cascade of soft caps, where the adventurer has simply got all skills that synergyze well/are useful/work for their build/have limited utility/make for decent party tricks.

As for "innovations" in leveling crafters, we see the infrastructure in place already. Crafter builds cage, crafter and peers pool money for a guild quest to capture a live monster and keep it subdued, crafter and peers poke the subdued monster for combat contributions points. Crafters make up their expenses by crafting and selling higher level goods.

***** Blues are almost never found outside of dungeons, and there's a limit on the number of people that can be in a dungeon at a time, meaning you're limited in how many people can be part of the hunting party. It also takes a long time for blues to respawn so there's a limit on how many people can kill a blue per unit time.

Citation needed. Every in-universe evidence says that they are rare everywhere, and the meta is that they are rare because the author clearly wants powers to be relatively rare so that he doesn't have to write a post-scarcity story. He's done a really excellent job of building a magic system that allows for very powerful people, is open to anyone as opposed to only those with the right parents, yet has enough restrictions that magic will be rare and powers will be special. The key element of that is having blues be rare.

Velka a couple chapters ago, the guild boss and older Citizen in their fight both used them, guild boss's ex used them in most arcs she's appeared in, Amerys did, who haven't we seen use them that wasn't relying on a permanent party member instead? Only the low level people who are still working on collecting the basic skills for their build.

Dungeons seem to have an 8-person limit (which Velika could stretch to 9 but we don't yet know if that ability can be reliably acquired). So one blue gives you up to 7 crafters - if you can get an adventurer overlevelled enough to babysit 7 tourists. At higher levels that's unlikely so the ratio gets way worse (and the risks higher).

You're right that /if/ there's any chance of tracking down a blue outside a dungeon (/and/ there's no limit to the number of people who can "contribute" to a kill enough to count), then you can get your cheap crafter army. We don't yet have word-of-god that one or both assumptions doesn't hold, but the lack of cheap crafter armies around is suggestive.

********** We know of at least one reliable and well known way to lure a blue outside a dungeon, and that's to use high level teleportation magic outside a city. If someone cared to refine this process they'd probably not even have to have a successful spell but simply design a teleportation spell that fails in a safe manner.

***** Monsters are stated to scale better and be stronger than equal level humans, so their power and danger increase exponentially. Rain theorizes that they either have unknown advantages or just have better builds.

In addition to that higher level humans seem to be much rarer, so the pool of higher level guards also decreases while you need more and more of them for the same safety. Also you would expect less of them to be able to protect you, higher levels mean they are better at killing 1 target and defending themselves, not others. High levels seem extremely independent in general.

****** It doesn't matter. Any high level adventurer can go collect a monster 20 levels below them even with no real tools to work with. A hundred crafters can then poke the subdued monster until it dies, and each get 0.001% credit which is enough for the level. Some of those hundred crafters can then make the adventurer a pair of pants or sandals. With the sandals of might and pants of right, and maybe a cage of sleep spell, the adventurer can repeat the process for a higher level monster. Rinse, repeat, until the adventurer and crafters are all gaining level caps from the process.

******* You're still basing on the idea that there is an effective unlimited supply of blues. That's not the case according to everything we've been shown.

Across the course of the story we've seen 3 blues: The musk wolf that Rain killed, the diremonk that Val killed, and the thing the Rain led a group kill on in the chemical dungeon.

Ameliah told Val/Rain/Carten that it would take weeks for the blue in the mine to respawn.

The Empire's beacons are all low level because the Empire doesn't want to waste blues on slaves. Their army does not consist entirely of gold-plates because there aren't enough blues to go around.

Blues are rare. It's not possible to have infinite numbers of infinitely-leveled crafters.

******** Blues aren't a limiting factor. Since you're apparently conflating 100 with infinity a NI (actual infinity) number of crafters can be leveled to "infinity (100)" using a single "infinity (100)" level monster.

And every single high (or even medium, going plaque tresholds) level character we've seen in action has demonstrated a detection skill. Most recently Velka about a chapter or 2 ago. Any of them can find a blue if they tried.

********* (Theoretical) limits to this: Effectively all of the Blues are found in dungeons, limiting the crafters created to 5(assuming 1 escort). (This is stated in story but isn't anecdotally true)

Non-low level Blues are constantly stolen from dungeons by lower level combat parties escorted by a high with stealth, impeding planning and hurting efficiency. This is getting attempted right now in story. This is probably the most wasteful result of the current system, the vast majority of blues are spent upgrading existing people as opposed to creating new ones, even the relatively low levels.

I think the best change to explain the current state would be to change it so that any higher level help with Blues "claim the kill" and prevent anyone else from leveling off it. This would prevent escorts, would explain the focus on combat classes since you need to kill a higher level yourself, but I would expect it to lead to more team builds also. Your "first blue group" would all have the same level caps and general progression so it would be beneficial to plan to kill the next Blue together in the future.

********** On changing things, maybe, but then our main character wouldn't have gotten his level cap just for being startled by one and being a momentary meat shield.

I don't know how stealing dungeon monsters works, though I'd imagine the process of pulling the monster out would kill it. Then again, maybe the slimes we see in the sewer are actually escaped dungeon monsters. If it's possible I bet you could farm a dungeon by continually killing off all non blues it spawns and having a servant level into a class specifically built to misdirect blues that may spawn so they can be left alive to level up.
