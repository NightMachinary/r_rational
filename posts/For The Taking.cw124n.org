  "People don't always get talked out of their soul."

  "Well, of course not," I said. "Imagine you were a demon and you could always generate the string of sentences that gets you a person's soul, and you wanted as many souls as you could have, would you talk them out of their soul every single time?"

  " - uh, yeah?"

  "But then everyone knows they don't possibly stand a chance, and they'll only do it if they're really dumb or really desperate. If you talk people out of their souls thirty, forty percent of the time - then people think they're smart enough, and maybe they take a chance. Right now everyone gags demons, circles in emergency kits have a gag, it's an automatic fail on most licensing exams to mess up the gag, the optimal percentage of souls to take is probably pretty low, they're immortal, why not play the long game - why not build us our arcologies on Luna and on Mars, let the population swell to a hundred billion, take a smaller share of a bigger human race -"

  This idea forms the basis for the rule I propose on distinguishing these demons from those which are merely destructive fiends, and on understanding and managing the aftermath.

  When the First Choir takes away from existence, nothing is created to replace it. At best, we find a pattern in the chaos that is left behind.

***** Right, so we know that souls exist.

Given that demons are /not/ coordinated, and given that some of them do a horrible amount of damage, not caring about their affect on other people, why won't any of the disparate un-coordinated demons provide a copy of the video data?

Granted, the author does state that the souls thing really was a joke in the source material, but I really don't think that fits the evidence as presented in the story.

Of course this presents a very interesting mirror to the whole AI box thing, which I presume was the intent?

I don't believe it's ever explained.

Glowfic magic systems are usually consistent, but don't always come with a Watsonian reason for their quirks.

Demons /can/ copy embryos that will grow into sapient adults. (As they currently do not have artificial womb technology, this only becomes relevant when they encounter an egg-laying sapient species.)

They /can/ copy most kinds of sapient AIs. Exceptions and complications do exist, though it's unclear if those are caused by magic and/or exceptionally good DRM.

They /cannot/ copy even people who come from apparently pure materialist universes without known afterlives.

They /cannot/ copy "magic" things. But the difference between "magic", "sufficiently advanced technology", and "sufficiently advanced technology that relies on different laws of physics" isn't always clear, so you often can't predict whether or not a demon will be able to copy a given thing-that-doesn't-exist-IRL.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If the protagonist had kept at it long enough, he would eventually have found an agreeable demon.

One of the unmentioned reason why some ethical demons choose to maintain that masquerade is that it provides a (comparatively) harmless outlet for the less ethical demons who want to mess with humans. If they're having fun trying to convince desperate humans to "sell their soul", then they're not trying to murder them or to go on a rampage.

Can't say for certain, any more than I can say of most glowfic humans that they aren't philosophical zombies, because glowfics almost never let you see inside characters' heads. But they behave indistinguishably from humans ([[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/153?per_page=100][or Tolkien elves]], as the case may be).

(Though like I said, the data on this topic is pretty noisy. E.g. those android elves /can't/ be copied directly - the copy would have a braindead brainchip. But you /can/ make a blank brainchip and, separately, a big computer that hosts the mind data, then transfer the mind data into the brainchip to get a sapient elf. BUT this is maybe due to DRM, which may or may not be /magic/ DRM, put in place by the sufficiently-advanced-or-perhaps-magic demigods of that universe. /And/ there's another demigod who's able to run an elf's mind data on a big computer, so it's not like the brainchip is somehow the true source of sapience. It's all shit like that.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

True. Thinking further, the worry is more that a troll demon will do something stupid. Most demons have lived their entire eternal life in a world with no death, no serious physical pain (demons have a pretty swell invulnerability), and no material scarcity. I can totally imagine one deciding to paint a continent pink, and doing it /very badly/.

(In the long run I think Daevinity's Earth is doomed. Even though mass-murdering psychopath demons are very rare and so are humans stupid enough to forget key bindings, they both exist. /Eventually/ stupidity will meet psychopathy and there will be a black hole where Earth used to be. No glowfic has explored this theme yet though.)

That doesn't threaten the game, though. That just shows why summoners have to be EXTRA CAREFUL, and now the government is going to crack down more and make the process more complicated with extra rules, even though this can't stop it from happening again, etc, etc.

Yup. Later in the timeline, after a few atrocities occur, it becomes illegal in most countries to summon without a license (which requires courses & exams).

But that only restricts conscientious summoners. /Stupid/ summoners are extremely hard to stop. All you need is a writing implement, a flat surface, and a summoning circle template.

Since there was mass distribution of summoning instructions during Revelation, /in a world that has the Internet/, circle knowledge is all but impossible to contain.

(Plus, having liberal summoning laws generates a ludicrous amount of wealth. People are bad at balancing that sort of thing against existential risks, as we know in the real world.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Later in the timeline, there's actually a police force that punishes /daevas/. It's quite clever: when a daeva is convicted of a crime, the police draws a whole bunch of summoning circles addressed to that specific daeva (you can do that). If that daeva is foolish enough to answer a summon, it's overwhelmingly likely to be one of theirs.

Once summoned, the daeva is made harmless by the circle's bindings and cannot leave until dismissed. The summoner just never offers the daeva a deal, so they're stuck in a perfect prison for the duration of their sentence.

Daevas who got perpetuity still escape on their summoner's death. But more circles have already been drawn for them, so if they have any sense they'll never answer a summon again.

(Though it's not a very humane system. Since daevas - especially demons - don't have human rights, some are left to stew for decades in what amounts to extra-terrible solitary confinement. Including some innocent demons, since demons are not allowed to speak even to defend themselves at trial.)

Why? Just make concentric summoning circles and add 'layers' as necessary.

From what you said, the circle itself does the binding. Just make 'demon cells' the size of phone booths and stack them on a series of ring plates slightly larger than the previous one as the time begins to run out, having a new guy 'complete' the circle each time.

Put THOSE in an even bigger facility with a /giant/ circle around it that gets updated from time to time.

Alternatively, if they can be summoned by AI or uploaded humans, create or hire "Warden" programs that do the job in perpetuity.

************ Good ideas. They don't work because a summoning circle only has power over the daeva it was used to summon. One daeva per circle, one circle per daeva.

Yeah, once you have immortal summoners things get much easier. Assuming you're okay morally with eternal imprisonment, anyway.

(Daevinity crossed-over with settings that have immortality a couple of times, but it was always immortality + tons of extra magic, so they just used the tons of magic to figure out a more humane and effective solution.)

****** They aren't coordinated /as a whole/. Doesn't mean some don't know each other, or that there's some sort of society or system that regulates their actions.

I can think of multiple reasons, none of which are fully satisfied by the story itself. 1) They are unable. 2) They are unwilling. 3) Something exists which punishes them for doing so, and only those who are indifferent to the punishment are willing to make the attempt. 4) They make up a reason at random (or don't even say there is one) in order to keep the joke going--ie doing it would ruin the punchline of the 'sell your soul' gag.

*** It's fairly obvious they don't take souls because they can't. People become demons or angels or whatever after they die as part the natural lifecycle.

The 'not talking' bit exists likely because earlier summoners figured out the game, but then when sharing their knowledge put in limitations to keep people from realizing that humans are just the 'larval form' in the life cycle of these creatures. Explains why not even the most evil among the demons is willing to threaten humanity as a whole (they won't summon black holes or create super-plagues or the like of their own volition, or agree to it if chosen).

Thanks for posting this one, I rather like it.

Did you write this piece? Ifnot, how do you know this?

We know of an example of at least /one/ who is clearly a post-human who wants to get in contact with people she knew in life. We don't know whether this means that /all/ demons are post-humans, or if there's a percentage. At least some are, but so long as one exists, the con is needed to keep humans from figuring out the game.

You would have to be the author to know this, otherwise this is baseless speculation. If anything, this would result in morally good post-human spirit beings *specifically trying to warn people* in order to prevent them from reaching the shitty afterlife.

I've read a few hundred pages of fiction from the same author set in this universe.

It's a setting for [[https://glowfic.com/][glowfics]]. While this piece is a lovely read on its own, and I often recommend it as such, there /are/ canon answers to the questions it leaves open.

(As usual, I /do not recommend glowfics/. The typical writing quality is nowhere near that of this fic, and the format is bad for storytelling.)

That will eventually happen. There's one demon in this fic who tries, which is what eventually leads the protagonist to the truth.

At this point in the setting's timeline (20-30 years after Revelation), most of the ex-humans haven't yet figured out how this all works - and they're competing for summons with billions of natural-born daevas who have even less of a clue.

Many won't have met any other ex-human yet. Only Hell has awesome internet everywhere to collate information, and nobody lets demons speak.

** This is really good! I like that there are at least half a dozen possible interpretations of what's actually going on.

I do think the "superintelligence maximizing number of souls to take" angle sounds a little implausible, since if demons can actually construct anything, an incredibly smart demon that got loose once could probably construct a self-replicator that made humans breed super fast or something. Maybe taking human souls the old fashioned way is like the demon equivalent of organic farming, but it seems more likely that something fishy is going on with the whole soul situation.
