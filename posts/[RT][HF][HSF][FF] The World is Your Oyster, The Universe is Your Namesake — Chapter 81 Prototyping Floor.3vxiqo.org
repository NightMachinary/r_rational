** I just noticed you mixed up stalactites and stalagmites in chapter 80 - stalactites aren't on the floor unless they broke off.

Great story! I've gotten bored of the real Steven Universe show, but your fanfic is brilliant. I can't wait for more magic alien worldbuilding goodness!

*** Thanks for noticing that mixup --- never would have myself.

And if you think that about my story, it is most certainly serving its purpose! :D
