** I'm starting to get AI-in-a-box vibes from the Bard. Black inspires the same sort of feeling except that he's less of a threat because he makes it very obvious that he's hostile to being in the box and that every move he makes is about redecorating the box to be more to his liking and/or burning down the box.

Bard, however, keeps popping up in places and doing things that an ordinary role player in the story has no business being/doing - like the guy who shows up at a house party, introduces himself as a friend of a friend and then you keep finding him walking upstairs or out into the garage, but he insists someone told him it was okay.

Not openly hostile in and of itself, but speaks to a motive that's not exactly above-board. Or maybe the proper metaphor is a story-teller who's realized she doesn't have to tell the story exactly as its written. Or a journalist whose realized they can twist the facts to fit their narrative.

It feels like she's operating in a blindspot of the Gods Above and Below - maintaining the cover/Role of the Bard who monitors the narrative and pushes heroes/villains in the right direction, but actually pushing them to some other, possibly cataclysmic end. I feel like when the Bard's endgame is revealed it'll make both Akua's Folly and Malicia's gambit to sieze it look like child's play.

** Wait, fuck, that means that the Bard /predates/ the Dead King? Was she attempting to make him take up a mantle from the heavens? Maybe he did, and maybe him being a powerful sorcerer allowed him to notice that his choices were being ripped from him, and in a fit of revenge and rage, he became the opposite of what Bard wanted him to be, the first of Bard's mistakes...

Or maybe that was part of her plan all along...

*** Probably part of the plan. Every story needs a villain. And what better villain than one that is way too powerful to die but is plot-bound to never be an actual threat to the status quo? A sort of Sauron-in-a-jar whose mere existence binds the rest of the world as Good just for balance.

That kind of bullshit has Bard written all over it. Nope out of that story right now, Cat, because nothing good will come out of it.

The bard is either a god, or a creation of the gods above and below, meant to keep the story going forever. Whenever /either/ side is truly losing, she's there to rebalance the scales. She isn't a hero, she's just recently been acting like one because the Black Knight's new kind of villainy is a genuine threat to the conflict between good and evil.

*** Crazy plot twist: Triumphant was a Bard from Wolof that accidentally ascended the throne of the Dread Empire, and had her brains shorted out by the Role of a mad tyrant the same way she had her normal behaviour was overridden when she was stuck in a schemer Role while talking with the Hierarch. Then she kept escalating and making infernal pacts, until she ran into an obstacle she couldn't just throw demons at - the Tyrian sea. It even fits with her final "Why not?", since the story of a madwoman running everything into the ground doesn't have that many ways to go, and a smallest initial impulse would be enough.

**** Names are bound to stories, and are shaped by the culture they originated from. However, Bard has been around since forever, and I think it might be /because/ of her meddling that she keeps some aspects. If the first Bard had a lute and flask, then the second one might also get one and so on and so forth until the lute and flask become a part of the archetype.

***** /The very same/ lute and flask? The ones that Catherine can recognize? Even her Aspects are more malleable (since it looks like the Name "the Wandering Bard" reflects specifically her ability to Wander in asnd out of existence, which implies Miraculous Ministrel or Troubadour might not have had it, or at least had a different form of it). The only thing that bothers me more is how nobody noticed yet that all the Bards ever were female. I know she had tampered with the records and the elves pieced her identity together long ago, but you'd think in a progresive work such as this one she'd be allowed to identify as a bard in a male/female body, with less emphasis on the biological attributes that don't necessary pass over to the next incarnation.

****** You need to remember that the world is progressive /because/ Evil is a thing. Good is very much founded on “moral” views. Evil on the other hand is more socially progressive due to being both batshit insane and more pragmatic. How on earth can someone in-setting be sexist/homophobic when a large number of the fucking terrifying dread emperors/empresses fit in that category. Hell, of the major characters, the only ones that are openly racist are “good” guys (/cough/William/cough/).

On your other point, you need to remember that some Names only appear in certain cultures (Like Warlord for Orcs), so it wouldn't be too weird if some Names belonged to one sex. Especially if they belong to a body-hopping eldritch abomination whose whole purpose is to fuck with the story.

In addition, it's highly likely that Wander is an aspect inherent to the Bard Name (Like Learn was to Squire) due to the fact that it's heavily implied that there's only one Bard who's constantly body hopping (If it was unique to this Bard, Black would definitely have made note of it). Along with that, the only people who know what Bard really is are either Genre-savvy (Black, Malicia, Tyrant), long-lived (Saint, Pilgrim) or have narrative breaking powers (Hierarch). To a normal peasant she'd just be another Bard.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/08/14/heroic-interlude-injunction/][Even Hanno is able to tell that Good societies progress despite the teaching of the Gods Above not changing.]] Things like slavery were viewed as a necessary evil in ancient Calernia. He may be a tool, but he's very much observant.

As for Evil polities being more progressive, remember [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/prologue-2/#comment-719][that Praes doesn't use it is more the exception than the rule, and a direct consequence of being on the bad end of that stick when they were under Miezan occupation.]] There are places like Stygia or Grey Eyries in any place where an Evil society becomes stable.

Regarding a Name being limited by its culture - while there were possibilities to play it that way, demonstrating how a different (maybe priestly?) Role sheped itself into Wandering Bard, since Black remarked that the very word used as a Name might have changed its meaning along the way, what the Woe are looking at looks like a fully formed Bard as we know her. Down to the instrument, which /definitely/ should have evolved over time (just google "lute evolution" to see what I mean).

Also, while Wander is definitely something she's used to and tied deep enough into the narrative to create and undo her body whenever it's convenient, I wonder whether the initial versions, with less narrative weight, would be capable of exactly that. It could have started as something like Fortunate Fool's Providence-assisted movement. Alternatively, different versions may have been tailored by the Heavens to have powers relevant to their story: Wandering Bard places emphasis on being in the right place at the right time (boosting Wander to teleportation), Miraculous Ministrel has more misic-related powers (like extending her suggestion-Speaking to her melodies, literally setting the tone of the Story, something like that?

******** Nah, what I'm talking about is that since the Bard has been around forever, she's been around long enough to have had some influence on her Name. That or it may be one of those “how you think of yourself influences your appearance” thing that Names have (Like how Cat is always short and has a limp, Masego being fatter/thinner than logical, Black and crew being younger) except because she's been around forever she's stopped thinking of herself as who she once /was/ and only truly identifies as the Bard, meaning that the lite and flask are the closest thing to a proper self-perception she has.

Also, maybe the random teleporting to story-relevant locations is inherent to the Bard Name rather than being an aspect? Idk, Bard herself breaks a lot of Name rules
