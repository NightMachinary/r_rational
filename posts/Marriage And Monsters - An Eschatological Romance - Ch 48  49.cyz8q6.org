** That use of backstory was both lazy and ingenious, I love it

That was such a treat to read :)

** This is spectacular. I haven't read the Culture series, though I've been meaning to correct that and I do have a basic understanding of the setting. A Culture ship is a perfect Death Star. The Barrier is a great standin for death/entropy as rationalist Final Obstacle.

I am so pleased with this. I love how narrative as a weapon cuts both ways. I enjoy the /Fine Structure/-esque Barrier. I love the Lovecraftian true nature of the Concept. I love the many disparate beings with stakes in this conflict. And I love how when Haley's plots work, it's as satisfying in execution as a great D&D session.

/Really/ looking forward to Sean's chapter.

*** Zeno's Paradox argues (somewhat convincingly in philosopher nonsense) that motion is impossible. But obviously motion is possible, because we all move all the time. When Sherlock first trapped the Dog with it, he said the Dog's metaphorical nature made it especially susceptible to these thoughts. Haley just kind of helped it get out of the loop I guess, of thinking motion is impossible and thereby being motionless, by focusing it on the fact that motion is possible (and perhaps with the snappy philosopher-quotation way she said it, given the Dog's bullshit Wonderland mechanics).
