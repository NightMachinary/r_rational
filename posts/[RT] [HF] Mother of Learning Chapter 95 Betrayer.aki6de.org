** Damn. I was right about Zach being the champion of angels but man, I did not even think of a possibility of a /death pact/.

And still, in retrospect, it was foreshadowed. Zorian contemplated that gods were major dicks, and humanity was better off since their disappearance. Well, makes sense that angels are major dicks as well.

***** I would need to re-read all the relevant bits, but isn't the relevant trait a direct line to the Ikosian Emperor who we know used the gate last? That was always what I assumed; Zach got picked because he was basically the heir to the gate from the perspective of the angels, esp. given that his family owned it until his guardian sold it back to the current royals.

Of course, if that's not the reason why, I find it hard to believe it's something so coincidental and trivial. If Zach wasn't just the default gate user by dint of being the sole survivor of House Noveda, why would an unremarkable boy get picked to be the savior of the universe? We still can't conclude they're not sneaky machiavellian puppet masters until we actually know what's up with that, because it might be possible that Zach was designed to fetch Zorian or some other convoluted nonsense that led to the present circumstances.

#+begin_quote
  His fellow time traveler was sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes closed, trying to sense the divine energies of his divine blessing and Controller marker. Zorian wasn't sure why he was doing that, to be honest. Both he and Zach had already succeeded at percieving those divine energies, and it was unlikely he would develop the skill much in what time they had before the end of the restart. On top of that, they had basically given up on trying to modify the temporary markers. There was little point to that now.

My point is that at this point in the story, QI has a role to play. He's the bad guy that the good guys have only ever driven back; even Z&Z at their peak aren't enough to take him on their own, they need a whole crew of top-tier archmages and a teleporting hydra. By this logic, QI will get murdered to demonstrate another antagonist's power, he will be defeated in some climactic conflict with Zach or Zorian, /or/ he will turn good and it'll be a “if you can't beat ‘em, join ‘em” kind of moment.

This is just based on the logic of stories generally. QI has been too important to the story for him to just show up with his troops, discover that things are completely off the rails, and then fuck back off to Sudomir's manor. He either has to be dealt with decisively or he has to become someone we don't mind seeing as one of the good guys.

That's all I'm trying to say anyway; I get the impression we're talking past each other, so maybe I'm just ranting to myself more than anything. Sorry about that.

The death pact Zach is under explains so much. It wasn't just a clever compulsion from Red Robe that pushed him to act so strangely, it was also the pact in his soul he no longer understood all the details of.

And we know that Silverlake and Red Robe aren't working together too well. Silverlake stated this chapter that she's withheld info from Red Robe, and it was implied this was for purely selfish reasons.

If Red Robe /is/ Alanic, this makes a lot more sense, because Red Robe is going to be immediately distrustful of Silverlake from the moment she shows up, even if they're 'supposed' to be on the same side. And Silverlake might assume he's going to backstab her the first chance he gets, so she's keeping him at arms length just as much as the she is the protagonists.

How? For one thing, Zorian is my leading RR candidate, and he's there from the very beginning. But if you don't like that theory, there are lots of characters introduced in the first loop who Zach would've considered as somebody to bring to the gate and who might be persuaded by Panaxeth.

Alanic and Xvim are awfully distant from Zach, however, even though they both often come up in these discussions. Zach claims that Xvim never believed him about the loop until Zorian showed up, and Alanic is someone Zorian only knows because Kael tipped him off. For Zach, Alanic is just a guy who gets killed by Sudomir early on. Given that pre-mind-wipe Zach presumably already knew that most aspects of soul magic were out of reach for him in the loop (and the angels made the ring something he could just go ask for), he's not going to go rescue him just to find a teacher for a subject he can't learn.

And frankly, six months isn't long enough for Alanic to give up his moral code. He actually had a religious debate with the primordial monstrosity he was living inside of at the time, mere months before the scheduled end of his existence. And given his apparent power with both church and state, the idea that he would betray Cyoria would be very, very out of character.

Also, when Zorian sees Damien again for the first time in chapter 66, the narration points out Zorian “had gotten good enough at his mental powers to immediately tell when he was in the presence of another psychic individual.” Since he wasn't that good back 40 chapters before, in a terrifying life-or-death situation against a much stronger mage, I'm comfortable saying he could've made a mistake.

He could definitely tell very early into his training who is and isn't psychic. I think all he meant about Daimien is that before he had improved he had a hard time tracking everyone around him at once which by the chapter he met Daimien he could do instantly and effortlessly. Seeing as he directly attacked Red Robe's mind there is no chance he wouldn't have noticed that RR was a psychic. Besides RR was worse at mental combat than Zorian and Zorian only had a few months training at it. A Zorian with decades more experience would certainly have been able to fend off such a novice assault. This also doesn't even start to consider that if RR was Zorian he has no reason to care about Veyers and no body to inhabit in the loop seeing as our Zorian is using it.

  "Oh fine, have it your way," Red Robe said with a dramatic sigh. "I guess I'll just have to rip it out of your mind like I did with Zach. Regardless of what those arrogant bugs told you, the aranea aren't the only ones capable of mind magic."

  Zorian felt the other mage trying to connect with his mind, but he immediately realized the attempt was incredibly crude and simplistic. Zorian was better and he knew it. Not willing to let this mistake on the part of his opponent go to waste, he promptly clamped down on the connection and blew Red Robe's telepathic attack to bits before counter-invading his mind. Knowing he had no experience with subtle attacks, he simply proceeded to blast the Red Robe's mind with an undirected telepathic scream. Red Robe flinched back and tried to terminate the connection. When that failed, he reached for his spell rod, but Zorian caused his hand to spasm and it promptly slipped between his fingers and clattered to the floor of the cave.

  After several seconds Zorian realized that, while the other mage was no match for him when it came to telepathic combat, he wasn't defenseless either. He couldn't overpower Red Robe mentally, and the moment his concentration dropped the other mage was going to sever the connection and beat him to a pulp in the physical world. He tried to commandeer the Red Robe's limb to release its grip on him so he could flee but the hand remained resolutely wrapped around his neck.
#+end_quote

Notice how he disdains the aranea; after he reads Zach's mind earlier in chapter 26, he calls them "thrice-damned bugs." But why wouldn't RR!Zorian have a different opinion? He would've entered the loop fully aware of what he had to do---free Panaxeth---and that goal wouldn't have taken him through the Dungeons of Cyoria, and it certainly wouldn't have endeared him to any passing aranea who happened to read his mind one loop. Our Zorian, who needed all the help he could get, had to rely on powerful allies like the aranea, but got /much/ more powerful as a result. And was still weaker than RR!

As for Veyers, perhaps Zorian and Zach soulkilled him together because Veyers was so dangerous at the beginning of every loop. Maybe Zach did it because Zorian got fried every time---you know how much he likes to sit next to the fire drake every day for the first class. Or perhaps Zorian decided to do it because it was a great false trail, soulkilling Veyers and erasing him from Zach's mind to mislead anybody who got wise to Zach's memory manipulation. Or maybe RR is doing a test, where he made Veyers aware of the loop, but erased the fact that Zach knew that Veyers knew from Zach's mind, and it's a very complicated way to see if the death pact gets triggered.

And if Panaxeth can make bodies outside the loop, why shouldn't he be able to make them inside the loop? Given Silverlake's hot new look, I think the theory still looks like a slam dunk to me.

Also none of your theroies theories can explain why Red Robe cares about Veyers. Zorian strongly disliked the dude but RR clearly cares about his well being at least a little bit. To your final point, that's complete speculation. If Panaxeth had the ability to make alterations to the time loop template he would have already won. By just editing it so the loop begins with Zach breathing poison gas after RR left the loop, his greatest enemy respawns and immediately dies. If he can do something as complicated as edit the loop to spawn a whole new body, something like that would be trivial and our protagonists would have already lost.

** There is no way this is finishing within 5 chapters without a Deus Ex Machina. Well, not literal one, a literary one.

I'm pretty certain he'll be able to do with hard work though, or at least has a decent chance. Clearly, divine magic is just another type of magic, and Zorian, Silverlake, and QI all have some experience with it. There are options.

I definitely didn't expect this though, but a divine geas does make a lot of sense. I'm curious what Silverlake has been doing, though, and I'm worried about her sanity. I doubt that whatever she thinks is 100% true, though. That said, the angels do have a really high focus on limiting loop repercussions, including extra loopers, so it makes sense they'd make a pact. There has to be some sort of loophole, though.

--------------

At the instant the fire drake attacked, my instant thought was this: it's a canary. In the original loop, no one helped Ilsa, but then Zach started to. Then, at whatever point, RR erased Veyers from the loop and Zach's mind, so that anyone who helps Zach could be an extra looper. Thus, Red Robe could quite possibly know that the third looper is Zorian.

It's still a big question how RR joined the loop. I still like the idea of someone being constantly befriended by Zach in the beginning, until they temporarily allied with QI to give RR a temporary marker. RR learned from QI to give himself a permanent marker, quite possibly with divine magic. Then, RR betrayed Zach, erasing his memories and Veyers from the loop. Perhaps Zach met RR through Veyers (I still like the Fortov theory, even if no theory fits perfectly), and deleted Veyers to make sure Zach would never have a plot thread to meet RR.

What would be even cooler would be if it was a double betrayal. RR agreed with Zach to get around the angel's pact, but still wanted to stop Panaxeth. They would totally want to work together if they were great friends; Zach really would want RR to not forget. So maybe RR learned the mind magic in order to remove himself and the original pact from memory, to work more in the shadows in preventing Panaxeth from coming out. The biggest problem is why would he constantly improve the invasion. My answer is to make sure Zach thinks they're super great, but easily beat them by the time he comes out unknowing.

I dunno, this is wild speculation. It would be amazing to see a double betrayal of the Antels and the Primordial. It would be even crazier if QI was once a looper with RR and left (though unlikely, because then he'd need the tools to leave, which would delete Zorian from the loop, but Panaxeth could have interfered; who knows).

Also, Angels are not good. They just want to enforce a lack of gods/divine intervention. Thus no Primordials, and super limited use of the gate (for worse case scenario). Especially since the gate's breaking.

I was also in the middle of making a theory about something weird going on with the fire drake, but that plot thread seems done. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Part of the deal he had with QI was a modified version of the ritual that turns people into a lich, made so that it works on a disembodied soul. If Zach dies, and his soul isn't immediately swept away to the afterlife through the death pact, Zorian could potentially deal with QI to get that spell and reincarnate Zach as a lich. A lot of people have speculated that Zorian would become a lich because of all the nefarious magics he learned in the loop, but this would be a really fitting way for him to use that knowledge.

To get QI's help, they could probably offer him the Orb or one of the other pieces of the Key. He's always portrayed as someone who honors his deals, so the idea isn't completely unworkable.

** Wait wait wait, Silverlake just said that the Death Pacts are inscribed on souls right? And that they are frustratingly impossible to circumvent? But we know that in soul terms, Zach and Zorian are really Zarian and Zoriach, because they got pieces of each other's souls from when QI tried to soul meld them together. Zorian clearly isn't instinctively feeling the death pact even though he has a piece of Zach's soul, and Zorian has examined his own soul countless times without noticing anything like that, so something is off.

Hypothesis A: Something about the soul meld ritual QI used can be used to void death pacts.

Hypothesis B: Zach actually doesn't have a death pact, but Silverlake mind magic'ed him at some point to make him believe he does. The fact that Zach instinctively feels that he can't let anyone mind magic him is extra suspicious, since that is a clause that only makes sense to have if the control over him is mind magic related instead of a soul-scribed death pact.

Hypothesis C: Somehow, the time loop marker, which is supposed to be absolutely guarded against spreading to other souls, got spread over anyway thanks to the soul meld. Yet the death pact marker, which is supposed to be absolutely guarded against being removed, didn't get spread over. This makes little sense.

Was it something RR found out by mind-reading, then mind-wiping Zach to prevent Zach from having to kill him? I could even speculate that RR and Zach were allies up to this point, with Zach willingly allowing access to his mind somehow.

I'm quite happy that this finally gives a compelling reason why Zach vehemently opposed having his mind read, despite the evidence of his mind being tampered with. He either was compelled to do so by his 'instincts', or simply didn't want to take the risk of being forced to kill Zorian.

** It was a bit underwhelming for me, I guess here are my highlights of the chapter:

Pan did make a custom body for Silverlake. It is still remains to be seen how special it is.

The angels are ... Well, after this chapter I'd say that they remind me of a incompetent people in power (bureaucracy) misinterpreting the orders or trying to follow something to the letter.

Gods, before leaving, casually told the lackeys they left:Try to make sure that no one is using SG when we are absent. If you have to use it, make sure the knowledge is not spread about it. It would be good if none of the primordials would escape their cages. And try to make sure the locals don't blow the planet up or at least try to prevent some wars/mindless slaughter.

So the idiots in charge had a large part in:

Cataclysm (tried to meddle in something and things went beyond bad).

Weeping (the splinter states were fighting for a long time for supremacy with a lot of bloodshed. Mages were usually heading those attacks/generals/whatever. So Angels decided to cut this ruling layer down a bit. Unsurprisingly the situation went from bad to worse and they especially hurt their own followers (church/priests tried to cure the sickness and were nearly wiped out).

They learned of the conspiracy to release Pan and the action they come up with is promising power/anything for a capable recruit (the time to hone his skills is long) with a minor deadly geas as collateral.

I guess the sentiment about capable people in government (especially in Easternish Europe) may have reflected inadvertently from author.

Zach had some suicidal tendencies for a long while and Red Robe is a friend?

Zach spent a lot of time in loop and learned and matured a lot. After he learned a lot he had seen the preventing primordial release would keep the status quo which causes a lot of regular folk suffering. And he met his RR and his passionate plan to make the world a better place. Zachs plan before encountering Zorian was die inside the loop (he asked his friend RR to remove some memories about loop so he could die in ignorance. And by dying he causes least amount of damage). Some sort of euthanasia. Then Zorian appearing in his life and it his life plan was derailed.

** OK, now's a good time. *RedRobe is Veyers Boranova.* I won't explain how, because I don't know. But here's the deduction.

1. RedRobe cares about Jornak Dokochin the lawyer. When interrogated, Jornak was not that fond for Veyers. Him saving the kid would be unthinkable. The counter argument: He could grew attached to the kid, like Zorian grew attached to Taiven despite their fairly distanced relationship at the beginning. It's a sound argument, but I wouldn't want to put much weight on that. I grew fond of Occam Razor.
2. The memory that's erased from Zach is on Veyers. RedRobe, because he presumably understood he would be killed if Zach knew about him, went on to erase the memory of himself. The counter argument: Veyers being erased could be a tactic employed by RedRobe for the sake of completion, as in, why just erase myself, why not everyone that could be connected to me; just like Aranea. It's also a sound argument and I'd put more weight to it that the Taiven-Zorian analogy, but I would like to think RedRobe was not as paranoid when he did memory erasure.
3. RedRobe left Veyers to his own device after some measure of security because he's fond his naive cringey old self. Unlike Zorian who got no option but to kill his old self, RedRobe could see him from afar. Beside, killing him or bound him in some kind of dungeon will be detriment to his plan. So, why not just spare him? The counter argument: Sending Veyers to his own device will provoke Zach and Zorian into hostile action, which ultimately will be a detriment to their plan. I won't put much stock on this counter-argument, because RedRobe was cautious; he won't underestimate the skill level of Zach and other ex-looper to get rid of Veyers without anyone noticing. Instead of thrown wrench, Veyers just became a momentary distraction if he follow this logic.

I think I have some other rationale behind these three, but I can't remember at the moment. So there you have it.

But as far as my Zorian-Is-RR theory goes, a mixed bag, like the rest of the chapter.

But on the other hand, this theoretical RR!Zorian doesn't seem like the type to do the whole “thank you for showing mercy” thing. Unless RR!Zorian is actually an insane gambit where he's really good, and this is just a super complicated way of getting around Zach's death pact. But that's starting to get crazy.

Either way, it's interesting that Zorian starts the chapter thinking about how /obviously/ RR got his start as a temporary looper. Given what we later learn about Zach's pact with the angels, it makes it far less likely that he would've gotten involved with an effort to bring someone out of the loop with him.

But if it isn't Zorian (still my leading candidate, though it feels shakier after that chapter), we now have some extra info about who it is. Somebody who could either convince Zach to change his mind, or get into a position where they could talk to Panaxeth. And whoever it is, presumably they knew about Zach's angelic death pact, or Panaxeth told them; that might help convince lots of people to think helping a primordial was a good idea.

Lots to digest in this chapter. Maybe I'll have a better idea of what's up after I sleep on it.

edit: Maybe the whole “showing mercy” bit is just RR pretending to be Veyers a little longer? But why? And is it significant that the bad guys are continuing to try and tempt Zorian?

*** I may be misremembering, but didn't Zorian find out that RR wasn't "open"? In which case, RR couldn't be Zorian unless he was faking it somehow. Also if Zorian is RR, how did they exist in the same place when they were in the time loop?

**** When he first meets Damien, Zorian talks about how by then, he was good enough to tell if someone was psychic quickly; when he encountered RR, he wasn't nearly as far along, and I don't recall him ever explicitly saying RR was a non-psychic, just that he wasn't very good. Which, as this chapter helps confirm, is a huge mistake---RR had to be damn good to manipulate Zach's memories without triggering the death pact's terms or the marker's safeguards. Just not as good as you can get by actually working with the spiders instead of against them.

And if Panaxeth can make Silverlake a new body outside the loop, what's stopping it from making a new one inside of it? And if it can get your soul through the gate, can't it hold onto the soul between resets, or manipulate it with the same kind of divine energies that the death pacts use?

He's already responsible for the real, permanent deaths of thousands of people in order to create wraith bombs. Hard to come back from that, I imagine.

But yeah, broadly, I agree; I don't think Zorian had to start evil to grow up to be RR. Zach's death pact is just another little complication that makes it easier for someone to decide to join Team Panaxeth.

** As I expect the true identity of Red Robe to be revealed within the next couple of chapters, I'd like to go on record with my Red Robe theory. I don't love it. I'm clearly making most of it up as I go, but it's the best I've got.

Zorian is Red Robe. Or, well, a copy of Zorian is Red Robe.

Some time before Zach got mind-wiped of Veyers, he placed a temporary marker on Zorian. Before the end of this temporary marker, Zorian is approached by Panaxeth and offered a deal. In exchange for doing his best to make the invasion a success and helping Panaxeth to be released, Zorian will be made a permanent looper and allowed to leave the loop whenever he wants. Zorian initially refuses, hoping he can find another way to escape the time loop or become a more longterm looper, but then he learns that Zach has a pact with the angels and is soul-bound to kill him if Zorian ever makes it out.

So Zorian changes his mind. But instead of merely becoming a permanent looper with a get-out-of-the-time-loop-free-card, Zorian also asks Panaxeth for an extra, unmarked copy of his soul (and body for that matter) to live the life he would have lived in the loop if he didn't make this deal with Panaxeth. Why? Because he is also planning on wiping Zach's memory of himself and when he starts helping the invasion in the loop, Zach would be able to figure out that the mysterious Red Robe must be Zorian if Zorian was totally absent. (We know that this is within Panaxeth's power to do, for the record, even if he never explicitly offered this deal to anyone. The whole time loop functions by leveraging Panaxeth's power to copy the souls of everyone in the world. What's one more soul?)

Panaxeth agrees to the deal, this Zorian becomes Red Robe and wipes Zach's memory of these events. But what about Veyers? Why did he wipe Veyers from Zach's mind? Because they had "soul-killed" Veyers together at some point on their adventures together. In order to wipe Zach's memory of himself, he had to wipe Zach's memory of them soul-killing Veyers, and if Zach doesn't remember soul-killing Veyers, he'll be confused when Veyer's doesn't show up to school like he usually does. Easiest to just wipe Zach's memory of Veyers entirely so as not to arouse suspicion.

Why did they soul-kill Veyers in the first place? Probably because he always got in a fight with a drake near the beginning of the loop and the flames tended to kill an innocent bystander (which may well have happened in the most recent chapter if Zorian and Zach hadn't been there to tend to the flames). Or because Veyers was just annoying them or they were just testing out the power and Veyers just happened to get hit. Whatever it was, wiping Zach's memory of Veyers wasn't for Veyer's sake. It was so that Zach wouldn't be able to figure out that he'd been mind-wiped.

One last question - why did RR!Zorian go get Veyers as soon as he escaped the loop? Likely because Silverlake had talked to him and, as such, he knew that Veyers was Zach and protagonist!Zorian's lead suspect and he wanted them to persist in that false belief. After observing Zach and Zorian's post-loop behavior for a while (and maybe by talking to Silverlake some more), he determined that they might not really be enemies after all. He decided to release Veyers to see what they'd do to him. They showed mercy, so now he wants to see if they can work together to get him out of his deal with Panaxeth. End theory.

#+end_quote

Clearly, getting to Veyers before Z&Z could ensured that he could use him to figure out who the other looper was.

I like the idea that RR!Zorian thinks he can get Our Zorian to cooperate after he's already killed a bunch of people and cooperated with Silverlake. But honestly, I think it's a trap. RR being secretly good would be kind of disappointing at this stage, and I think it makes for a better story if the two Zorians came out of the loop wildly different.

**** Misdirection against Zorian/the believed time traveling group. If Red Robe is in fact on Zachs side and was helping the invasion to simply gain training from the lich then I think it makes sense to appear opposed to Zach and to force him into hiding early on. Zorian potentially appearing meant they needed to see how Zorian would interact with Zach and that they needed to make the attempt appear genuine. To determine whether or not Zorian/the group was hostile to Zach and so that they don't have to worry about Zach being held hostage against them.

I don't think Red Robe is actually a pawn of the Primordial. My guess is that the rules the gods put in place insured that the first person to use the gate was able to leave as well as the person with the original marker. And that the primordial was bluffing when he said red robe was working with him.

Zorian didn't interact with Zach much during the loops Red Robe was there. I don't think it's a stretch to assume that a group of multiple time travelers isn't going to be willing to help Zach survive the month.

I think that the note in fact refers to Zach and that Veyers was originally removed from the loop for convenience, if Zach didn't intervene to protect the other students my guess is that people would have been injured and it'd have had butterfly effects on the campus.

Also Zach has to be kept in the dark due to the death pact and him actually having compulsions to kill people who tamper with his mind. Remember he'd have had no idea that Red Robe originally scrambled his mind without Zorian interfering. Red robe appearing hostile in fact makes it easier for Red robe to get Zorian to disable and mind alter Zach.

Honestly I don't have a strong conviction to this theory. I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case tho. I'm working backwards here. I started with "How can this story end in 5 chapters".
