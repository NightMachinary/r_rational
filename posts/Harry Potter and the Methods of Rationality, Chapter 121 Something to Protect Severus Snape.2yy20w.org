*** Well, in 16 years we'll get the more sensible (as in, the numbers are actually in order of significance rather than the ridiculous month/day/year hour/minute/second) 31/4/15 9:26:53.

Just before half 9 on the morning of April 15th 2031.

** This may be my favorite chapter to date. No great doings or adventures are needed just...quietness, and a fair bit of sadness, and a tiny bit of hope, as everyone tries to pick up the pieces.
