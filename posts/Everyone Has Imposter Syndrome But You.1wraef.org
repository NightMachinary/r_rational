** I don't know... This is just my opinion but I would like this sub to be about things directly related to fiction. I feel that if we allow everything the original purpose might get lost at some point. You can post these kind of things to open threads on [[http://www.lesswrong.com][www.lesswrong.com]].

But let's see what our new overlord thinks about this.

*** This doesn't really have anything to do with rationalfic. I would recommend instead posting to [[/r/LessWrong]], [[/r/LessWrongCirclejerk]] (which should totally exist), or possibly just [[/r/GradSchool]].
