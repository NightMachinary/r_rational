Time is the first chapter in a web serial I'm writing about a girl named Emily Arrington. She discovers an old book in an antique shop which tells her how to travel through time.

​

I /think/ it follows the hallmarks of rationalist fiction. Every character is intelligent and acts in their own self-interest, and no one has the "idiot ball".

​

I'd appreciate it if you gave it a read and let me know what you think.

****** Cool! If it's ok, just rewrite your post if you would. As it is, the verb tenses are passive instead of active, which leaves you out of the picture, and the whole thing reads differently if it's you who wrote vs not you. I.e., the "I /think/..." part sounds like "This author did a pretty good job doing the rational genre right!" when you're not the author, but when you are, it reads more as "I hope I'm doing the rational genre right." And "Give it a read" sounds like a recommendation of quality from an independent source when it's not the author, but when it's the author it's more like a request for indulgence.

That is to say, whether you're the author in this promotion makes a big difference in how people view your work going in, and is important to include.

Additionally, it's not a serial yet - it's just one chapter.

If it were me, I'd edit it to "Time is /the first chapter in/ a web serial /I'm writing/..." and "/I'd appreciate it if you would/ give it a read /and let me know what you think in the comments./" More upfront and more constructive and aware of your role of the author that way. But, do what you think is best - I'm just an internet rando with rando advice.

**** I'm not sure it's far enough along yet to get a clear idea of whether I think it is rationalist fiction, but I think it's great that it is intending to be.

I'm curious: one of the key elements in time travel stories (that are rational) is what the [[https://qntm.org/models][metaphysics]] of time travel is. Works range from "everything is immutable, and fate conspires to make this work out despite the apparent existence of free will" ([[https://gist.github.com/defunkt/759182/ad44c6135d168ae54503a281bb7e1a24c6c2ea0c][eg]]) to things like "time can be changed, which is simply the actor moving to a different possible path in the multiverse" ([[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/12/rudy-6-time-as-a-divergent-ser.html][eg]]). But to be honest, MOST time travel stories have a metaphysics where time travel works different ways as the plot demands it.

** Hard to say much with only one chapter so far. There's no time stuff yet, just teenager stuff. The dating stuff is rather plain, but the asshole-dad stuff makes me sympathize with Emily.

A few comments:

- Everything is center-aligned, which isn't pleasant.
- It was weird that Emily couldn't remember which class she was in with George given she's apparently really into him.
- There were a few punctuation errors at the ending quotes. Easily the worst offender was this one with the double-period,

The quote is treated as it's own thing like an interjection so you also need another period to end the sentence it's interjected into.

******** You've misunderstood what that means. Do you think that because there is no English pope handing down rules of grammar from on high that every imagined way of doing things is going to be regarded as equally correct?

People don't think that way. There are dominant views of how grammar is done, and authorities catalogue those views. Diverging from them will make people conclude that you can't be bothered to learn how to communicate clearly.

This is a useful assumption, because it keeps people adhering to one set of rules and that makes clear communication possible.

So, while you can use two periods in a sentence if you want, the price is that people will assume you're making a mistake and unaware of it. If that makes you happy, then by all means, nobody will arrest you for it. But some people simply won't read your work because the author not knowing the correct rules of grammar and punctuation suggests that the quality of the rest of the work will be similarly poor.

Do those statements sound more like prescriptivism to you, or a rejection of it?

The absence of prescriptivism does not mean that there is no such thing as correct or incorrect usage. There absolutely is a consensus view on most subjects of grammar, and diverging from it is perceived as incorrect, which is for all functional purposes the same thing as being incorrect under a prescriptivist standard.

I have gone looking and been unable to find any authoritative source that recommends putting a full stop within quotation marks and then again after them, except in the special circumstance that another poster explained above. I've gone through a number of style guides that all agreed.

If you can find something to the contrary, please, I invite you to present it, but I think you may have misinterpreted an error you've seen more than once for a common practice.

That's my whole point. I reject prescriptivism. If something is a mistake as in one would fix it on a second read without prompting then that is fine. I do not consider anything besides that to be incorrect. Nonstandard is /not/ the same as incorrect.

I never said it was common practice merely that I thought it was common in some dialects/language communities. And I certainly never said it was accepted. There are entire dialects which aren't accepted (e.g. African-American Vernacular English). And, indeed, most non-prestige dialects are /not/ accepted. I, normatively, and in accordance with science reject such non-acceptance as the ignorance it is. On this topic I am not delusional though I may be mistaken on the object-level that negates none of the general things I have stated.

****************** I'm having trouble wrapping my head around your position, here. You appear to be saying that you think the idea of there being accepted grammar rules is ignorant, implying that you believe that anybody should be able to make up whatever rules they want and they are all equally valid.

I don't think you've thought this position through. First, as a factual matter, a consensus view on what is and isn't correct exists. The fact that you don't seem to like the idea of a consensus view doesn't make everyone who participates in the consensus 'ignorant' somehow. That is snide and dismissive of most of society at best, and that isn't what ignorance means anyway. Ignorance means not knowing. Ignorance does not mean in disagreement with your personal ideas.

Second, we all benefit from there being a consensus view and from adhering to it. The purpose of language is to clearly communicate ideas. Having one set of rules is a key part of what makes that possible. When language balkanizes it gets in the way of communication. Criticize homogeneity if you like, but it has real benefits.

Having one set of rules could be useful and is especially within technical communities wherein they usually choose their own. Consensus when it does exist merely determines what people /think/ is correct. Language is always changing and is dependent on context. There are many language communities all with different styles. I think we disagree on a philosophical level. To make an analogy you seem like you would be a person that would dismiss climate change if they did a popular vote on its existence and 95% of people thought it was made up. So much so that you wouldn't even think of asking for scientific evidence.

Isn't the "usages determines what is legitimate" a reference to (local) consensus though? If the group that is communicating has a consensus to communicate in a certain way, then that is the language/dialect that is "legitimate" at that point in time and space?

If a single member of the group picks a different way to communicate, it will be "incorrect" unless it gets enough traction to cause the consensus drift to include it.

A variety/dialect can be better than another, within the scope "to clearly communicate with a certain group at a certain point in time". Like any task, the right tool for the job is better than the wrong tool.

********************* In this context "better" refers to moral (i.e. normative) superiority not increased utility. It's sociolinguistic and the scienctific stance is identical to the one given for race, nationality, gender etc. In as much as those things exist (looking at you "biological race") no one is "better" based on wherever they fall among these types of characteristics.

Regarding linguistics (and ignoring the things said about language utility) what you said is mostly accurate if simplistic and not necessarily the phrasing I would use to explain it.

The goal (when writing in English) is commonly to communicate the story clearly to the English speaking world in general, because your target audience is presumably global. The context then becomes a question of which language is the best tool to achieve that.

That means that, unlike in the case of something that is empirically true like climate change, the consensus view of the language's rules actually determines correctness.

This means that some individual believing that the rules are something else is just plain incorrect. The majority view dictates correctness and has legitimacy because it is a consensus. The individual's rules are not equally as valid as the consensus view.

I hope this makes the idea clear to you, because I'm running out of different ways to say the same thing and it is clear you've been misunderstanding descriptivism to mean that there are no rules and everyone's ideas about grammar are equally valid when it does not remotely stand for that idea.

You have to understand the idea of correctness is something that only exists in prescriptive thinking. There are rules but no way to break them. If I and everyone around me call the word "carmel" there is no authority that can tell us we're wrong. There is a dictionary editor however that will happily add our version to the dictionary though.

EDIT: I'll add some resources on linguistic prescription vs description.

********************** I am unable to find any evidence of a 'linguistic community' that uses the double full stop grammar you describe. I believe you are factually incorrect in thinking it is an accepted thing anywhere. I have invited you to provide evidence to the contrary and you've given me nothing.

You may be conflating descriptivism with the old linguistics rule regarding 'what is a word', for the purposes of linguistic study which welcomes anything anyone uses that anyone else understands, even if it is a single case. (It should be noted that this definition is for the purposes of study and classification only, not something incumbent on the actual users of a language to accept, and most do not.)

Descriptivism absolutely considers something that one person makes up and nobody else uses to be incorrect. Something must be in common use at least somewhere to be accepted as regular practice. That is fundamental to descriptivism. If it is not actually in common use then it is aberrant use not recognized by others, an error.

I am not sure how many more ways I can explain this point to you. You seem extremely focused on not listening.
