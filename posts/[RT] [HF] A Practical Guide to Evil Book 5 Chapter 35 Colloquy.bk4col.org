** I'm expecting the Saint to betray the group, since she wants Procer destroyed. Killing the Dead King would prevent that from occuring. It could be easily justified, since in her eyes Pilgrim and Sorcerer are both being deceived by a villain. It doesn't have to be an offer taken, maybe just a seed of doubt planted. Like the Dead King saying that of all the group, she'd be impossible to sway, and not making an offer at all.

*** She can't do anything to the Dead King, though? At least here. She's more likely to count on being able to kill Kairos and Cat later, IMO.

** I like the shape of things to come, we get to see the laws of narrative in the converse situations as previous books: a band of five heroes (of circumstances) charging into a great evil.

** ... Did anyone else see Epilogue at the top of EE's posts? I averted my eyes and navigated to the appropriate chapter, but I'd like to know if I am in fact hallucinating or is this actually happened as there is no 'Epilogue' at the top of EE's recent posts now. Would have been an hour or so ago.

** Does /every/ chapter of this really need to be posted here? I know folks on this sub love it but four of the posts on the front page at time of posting were PGtE chapters.

Disclaimer: I don't like the work and I don't think it belongs in this genre. That's a separate issue from it clogging up the subreddit though.

*** You say it is "clogging up the subreddit" but the reality is there are barely any posts on this subreddit and that's why you see so many PGtE posts on the subreddit, because its one of the only stories that regularly updates. If we truly had a ton of rational stories regularly being updated and amazing dicussions and they were being hidden by PGtE I would agree it could go in favor of more on topic content. But the reality is I can go to this subreddit and still find posts from a week ago on the first page. We don't lose anything by having rational-adjacent stories like PGtE posted. There is clearly a demand and a want to discuss PGtE because it ends up highly commented and upvoted relative to average story post.

*** I like the story myself so I might have some bias, but I like that the MC *tries* to be rational and think ahead. I like the subversion of tropes that at the same time use them at will.

Wasn't the discussion had somewhat recently about "what is rational "? I seem to recall the sidebar being updated?

EDIT: I'd certainly say it ticks at least one or more of the sidebar examples/criteria. If you disagree with the definition then as you say, that is a separate discussion. Given its popularity here you may find yourself in the minority however.

*** I think it's partly down to the Guide being the most regularly and frequently updated story in or around the genre. AFAICT, [[/u/Zayits][u/Zayits]] isn't an alt for [[/u/erraticerrata][u/erraticerrata]], so they're not violating the rule against posting your /own/ work more than weekly. That said, that rule as written has the obvious loophole of an author simply getting someone else to post it and the Guide is clearly the work that runs closest to violating the spirit of the rule.

As to whether it belongs here, I think it solidly ticks a few boxes regarding the intelligence of characters, reflection on goals and motives, goal oriented behavior. On the other hand, no one explicitly aspires to be rational, and the Guide universe explicitly runs on different rules than ours, with narrative tropes having actual, causal weight behind them. It means the major intellectual payoffs in the story come from the characters engaging in competitive storycrafting which is of.... limited import to our world, so even if the characters can be judged to be operating rationally for their world, it still ends up portraying heroes and villains doing their best to /seem/ heroic/villainous which is arguably the primary anti-meme of rational fiction.

Overall, I also edge toward saying that the Guide probably doesn't belong here anymore and hasn't since at least when Cat mantled Winter, but it did more solidly belong here in its early days and has established itself as popular with the community, and is kinda, maybe winding down and closer to the end than the beginning or middle, so...

**** Well, it belongs here more now than it did in book 4, so might as well let it stay.
