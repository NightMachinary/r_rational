** Amusing!

You need significantly more^{*} Druids and Clerics than given, because they have limited coverage, limited capacity, and deaths aren't going to be evenly distributed. Since you need about 8 Druids to cover Waterdeep using Tree Stride, that leaves at least some patrol areas with only one Druid on duty, which will fail if that area has more than three deaths in a day. Which, assuming deaths are distributed randomly, will be basically every day. And the actual distribution of deaths is not going to be as forgiving as random, either, since a lot of accidental deaths are going to be from multi-person incidents like carriage accidents or sneezing wizards.

^{*} I'd give you a number but I can't find the right Birthday Problem variant and I don't feel like coding up a simulation.

** I feel like the overall numbers in the plan don't hold out very well, because, IMO, it is too large/high level of a team for even a large city to field. TBF that's mostly just my gut feeling about magic and power levels.

A better way to judge the viability of this plan is to count up the daily cost based on DM Manual figures for paying a professional to cast spells of these levels, counting for some sort of discount for regular wages rather than one-off work. Then use more cost tables to determine how that compares to the economic output of a spread of two million people. That would take longer so I'm not going to do that, but maybe someone else would be interested.

Instead I'm mostly going to consider "what proportion of the population is actually of this level, and is it reasonable to think that from that number there would actually be enough people available with this specific build.

I didn't find any actual "official" numbers for the level spread in the forgotten realms. [[/u/fallencoder][u/fallencoder]] posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/597t3i/dd_character_level_demographics/][this chart]] which assumed a fraction of lvl 1 characters based on the US armed forces percentage, and then from that level 1 number assumed that each level above that had half the numbers as the previous level.

With that benchmark out of a city of two million you'd expect (.0012773%) only 25 level 10 people. Even considering that the high level people may gravitate to population centers for work I don't think you'd be able to create this team, especially considering that the 15 level 10 people you want are Druids, and those are the last people you're going to get to work every day in a dense city.

Personally I have issues with the assumptions on that chart on both ends. First I feel like modern US is a bad example for %combatants. We (and many other modern militaries) are all about a very small number of professional volunteers, which is basically the opposite of the medieval "conscript a bunch of peasants into a militia for a campaign season" model which is probably closer to D&D. But while I think the level 1 number would be way higher, I think the dropoff should be steeper.

I think the death and retirement rate of 50% is fine for the first few levels, but after, say, level 5 I think you'd be lucky to get 10-20% of the population to move on. Those people are either going to be higher fatality occupations (more adventurers and fewer city guards) or picked up in much smaller numbers for elite training. Additionally after you get to that point the retirements are going to shoot up. People will have avenged their Uncles and not gotten sucked into the next crazy adventure, they'll start to realize that their pockets have "retire forever" money in them, and they'll drop out of the business.

*** Well, Waterdeep does have at least 5 17+ level casters. Lirael Silverhand, Vajra Blackstaff, Wyllow, Manshoon, and Halaster. Now, three of those are not likely to be helping out the world above anytime soon, but those are just the ones described in Dragon Heist and DotMM that I can remember off of the top of my head, and they seem to signify a higher proportion of casters than [[/u/fallencoder][u/fallencoder]]'s analysis would say.

Still, perhaps it would be easier to brute-force the Gentle Repose issue by enlisting a ton of 3rd level casters who ride True Polymorphed Nightmares or something. A Nightmare enhanced by Haste, Expeditious Retreat, and Longstrider can move faster than a Druid with Tree Stride. 800 feet per round I think? (90 + 10)*2 = 200, with a bonus action dash, an action dash, and a Hasted dash.

**** NPCs in 5E don't have strict class levels, they just have statblocks, so the whole thing is kind of ... well, not /moot/, but it's trying to work out a problem that's undefined within the RAW, and not just because there are no RAW for population demographics. The rules work differently for PCs and NPCs, and directly mapping PC class levels onto NPCs isn't the assumption that the rulebooks make about how the world works. Yes, this does mean that PCs Are Different.

(This was not the case in 3.5E, but they changed it, because it was a complete pain in the butt, and statblocks are easier to manipulate than class levels/features, and it's all mostly invisible to the players anyway.)

***** Perhaps it would be easier to end premature death in someplace like Silverymoon, then, where in canon there are schools which produce actual spellcasters of various levels. Indeed their exact quantities and levels are ambiguous, but I don't think it's such a silly concept that you might be able to scrounge up a fair number of 5th level casters. I'm not an expert on Forgotten Realms Lore, but there are organizations like the Red Wizards of Thay which are canonically made up of spellcasters.

You're right that NPCs have stat blocks instead of class levels, but many do have the Spellcasting feature with a specified caster level. Here are some direct quotes from statblocks in Dragon Heist:

#+begin_quote
  Lirael is a 19th-level spellcaster.

  Manshoon is an 18th-level spellcaster.

  Vajra is an 18th-level spellcaster.
#+end_quote

The only actual "Class Feature" required for this plan is that of the Transmuter, who could be a Player Character.

** There's a major assumption here that I don't buy. You are assuming that each person who would otherwise die prematurely must only be rescued once.

It seems to me that there are plenty of situations where the same person would need to be rescued again and again:

- Thinking about the real world, the most likely would be deaths due to severe disease (if you prevent this particular heart attack, the patient might just have another next week), but this might be fixable by adding more divine healing magic to your scheme, if that restores the patient to perfect health.
- Once this system is in place, risk-taking behaviour could drastically increase. When the sport of beholder-go-kart-sledding takes off, your team is going to be quickly overwhelmed by a large number of 15-25 year-olds requiring rather frequent saving.
- Even in the absence of extreme sports, it's not too hard to imagine that (let's say) one of the premature deaths each day is due to a risk factor which healing magic will not fix - let's say that that person has a 1% chance to die each day (due to personal vendetta, dangerous hobbies, criminal activity, etc). Waterdeep will eventually end up with about 15,000 such people, requiring 150 interventions per day just for this group. (Numbers made up to illustrate the effect)

*** Yes, and those are very real concerns, so if this were actually implemented it would be something like the insurance industry in real life, wherein repeat offenders and at-risk people are charged proportionally more. That's how it works in my setting, the Wishbound World.

In this thought experiment, I've outlined in another comment how I imagine that repeat offenders would be heavily fined and eventually excluded from the system altogether. The EMTs are perfectly capable of withholding care to disincentivize risk-taking.

#+begin_quote
  Step 1, Somehow get a bunch of high level characters together to stop death.
#+end_quote

Adventurers commonly work together to keep people from dying. I don't see how this is different than getting them to stop an evil wizard.

#+begin_quote
  because they're either not preserving the balance
#+end_quote

What balance exactly are they preserving? If they just have to keep overpopulation from being a problem there are other ways of controlling it besides premature death. And other ways of preserving the balance besides keeping the population low. You could also try to magically feed more people, increasing the population that can be supported.

Also, they're not keeping people from dying. They're just postponing death. I imagine most people die of old age, so the life expectancy isn't even changing that much.

#+begin_quote
  Step 4, die as the city gets a train run on it by the 50+ deities whose portfolios include death.
#+end_quote

Everyone dies eventually. And if you come up with a plan to make people live longer and have more children, that's more deaths. Sure they'll be later, but gods are old, and also patient.

Also, plenty of adventurers do things like kill evil wizards that are killing people, and they don't have deities come stop them.

#+begin_quote
  Step 5, spend all of eternity in super-hell as punishment and warning to others.
#+end_quote

See step 4.

*** Could you link me to where Celestial patrons are explicitly stated to be evil? I mean, their spell list includes Cure Wounds, Leaser Restoration, Revivify, and Greater Restoration. Doesn't seem very anti-life to me. By your logic, any time high-level warlocks try to defeat evil or save the world, they'll be stopped by their patrons.

And I should note that while some deities may be miffed, this plan doesn't actually decrease the total death rate of Waterdeep. It just means that people die at older ages on average.

Most power in DnD is granted (heck even wizard/sorcerers pull from the weave). It's not science where you just input effort and output results; there's an alien intelligence on the other end that pulls the strings and decides on your spell as it supplies the magic.

--------------

Waterdeep has, what, tens of thousands of spellcasters? We know that Waterdeep has people more intelligent than is humanly possible on earth. We know that Waterdeep has the spellcasters to spare. We know that Waterdeep has capital-G Good characters who would want this to happen.

So putting it together, when there are people who are able/motivated/willing to do something and still /cannot do it/ then we know there must be a reason. Divine intervention seems likely to me.

***** I mean, divine intervention can justify anything. I could propose any way of improving people's lives in D&D, and now matter how realistic or well-reasoned my plan, you could respond with “divine intervention.”

There's also the possibility that the designers of D&D just never bothered actually running the numbers on how many resurrections versus deaths can happen each day.

And there's the possibility that even Lirael Silverhand made a similar mistake, because she didn't consider the idea that it would even be possible to improve Waterdeep so drastically and so quickly.

Or perhaps there just aren't economic structures in place that would incentivize this. In the real world you could point at drastic inequality and the way that half of the world suffers from an obesity epidemic while another half starves to death, and say, “there are lots of smart people with reasons to solve this problem, and plenty of billionaires, so clearly divine intervention must be why the problem hasn't been solved.”

At this point, though, you have just thrown away your ability to reason about the situation, though.

No matter what hypothetical situation that someone brings up to you, about anything at all, you can just say "well they aren't doing it, so there must be a reason!"

****** I think in this case there are a lot of /really/ obvious things stopping this from happening, since part of the conceit is creative interpretations of rules-as-written, which will almost necessarily conflict with setting-as-written. One of the biggest things that any sensible DM would almost instantly patch is the Simulacrum/Wish combo, which allows the caster to avoid all of the (many) negative impacts of the Wish.

It seems /much more likely/ that there's some interaction between those two spells which causes them to either fail, or have the usual negative impacts to the original caster, but which aren't explicitly written in the rulebook (which is, after all, the map and not the territory, since actual spellcasting is (in-world) more complicated than it is as presented in the rules).

FWIW, the Adventurer's League answer is that Simulacrum /can/ cast Wish, but that the stresses of Wish apply to both the Simulacrum /and/ the original caster, and if the result is not being able to cast Wish ever again, that applies to all future Simulacrum.

(That said, I do acknowledge that the conceit of the OP's setting is taking some questionable RAW, stripping out any DM intervention, and running wild, I'm just speaking about how/why none of this probably applies with Waterdeep-as-written.)

******* Yes, the Wish/Simulacrum thing is the most questionable part of this plan, but it's entirely possible to create value in other ways. For example, if the Wizard is 20th level, he could cast Fabricate 12 times per day to craft 12 1500 gp suits of Full Plate armor. He could then have a Transmuter Wizard use Major Transformation to convert the plate armor into diamonds.

As for the other “really obvious things stopping this from happening,” if you list them I can have a go at coming up with solutions.

******** I think where you run into a lot of questionable things (again, I understand that's the point of the setting) is in assuming that, for example, cost is a magical property of items, rather than an approximation of labor or representative of baked-in assumptions about the setting. Almost any time I read "a diamond worth 500 gp", I read it as "a diamond that would be worth approximately 500 gp in a typical D&D setting", meaning that if someone somehow manages to flood the market you don't need a diamond the size of a house, and if someone corners the market, the same diamond can't magically power twenty times more spells. Again, economic stuff is a setting conceit you're using ... but I don't think that conceit holds true in canon Waterdeep.

Using a combination of Fabricate and Major Transformation is much more defensible, but there's not much point in having a 20th level Wizard cast the Fabricate, because your two bottlenecks are the raw materials (steel etc.) and the Major Transformation, which is once per day (and also requires eight hours of labor to remake the stone):

#+begin_quote
  Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.
#+end_quote

But even given that's possible, we come back to something discussed elsewhere in this thread, which is how many people of which class levels we could reasonably expect to exist.

********* I'm glad you brought up the connection between cost and magic. In my original Wibblyverse post, I started out with a description of drastic gold inflation, but after figuring out more about magical industry, I've realized that it's not actually necessary to have have a strongly magic-influenced economy. So this post and my recent one on the industry of the Wishbound World is not at all based on an assumption that gem requirements are magically tied to economics.

Seriously, nothing about this plan for reviving people in Waterdeep depends on the gems being tied to economics. In fact, I made it specifically to work around the limitation of requiring a lot of diamonds. In the original Wibblyverse, each casting of Revivify would only need tiny, shoddy diamonds, because of the low value of the GP. In the current Wishbound World, Revivify does actually require a sizable diamond which would be worth 300 GP in a medieval setting.

And regarding the major bottlenecks of raw materials and Major Transformation, I don't think it's unrealistic to purchase enough steel for 15 suits of plate mail each day. If you say that half of the value of the plate mail comes from labor, then each Fabricate creates 700 gp of value, taking into account the resale of some products to cover losses.

And as far as the Major Transformation goes, I don't think it's that much of a stretch to have a single 14th level Transmuter in the city. You could even have a Simulacrum of the Transmuter build the Stones, so that he doesn't have to work 8 hours each day, since nothing about Major Transformation requires regaining hit points or spell slots.

The only actual high level caster you need is the 20th level Wizard, who can also be the Transmuter. From there, you can supply low level wizards with Nightmares via True Polymorph, and depend on one or two 5th level Celestial Warlocks.
