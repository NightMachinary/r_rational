Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I always get upset when this thread has no posts so here's a nice little general urban fantasy question.

We all know about werewolves, vampires and zombies. There was a mummy fad for a while, in the 70s or something. More recently True Blood has given us werepanthers (we don't talk about them), and faeries. Harry Potter gave us hippogriffs, which I am sure most people had never heard of before.

What are some creatures in mythology that you think are ripe to become the next big supernatural fad?

Personally I don't know why centaurs aren't more popular, as well as minotaurs. Both very classic humanoid creatures that you could probably tell some amazing stories about.

And then there's obscure folk tales - after all zombies are ultimately from an obscure (voodoo?) myth. Does anyone know an obscure folk tale creature that would be interesting to see in the modern society?

*** My prediction is for jewish-style golems. They serve as a great stand in for AI, so you could probably get some interesting social commentary out of them. Plus, literally chiseled abs and a very explicit master/servant relationship will make them great targets for the "trashy urban fantasy" demographic.

**** Shit, one of my OCs is kind of like that (but with a big helping of personality and self-agency). You're telling me that I'm going to have to give him an UFAI downside at some point, which I kind of love because I never thought of the "slavery" sort of thing in that context.

*** Dwarves haven't really gotten enough coverage. There's just so many plotholes with how they're commonly portrayed. What's their food supply? How do they handle ventilation? Do they have problems with flooding - if so, how do they deal with it? What do they do with the mining debris and sewage? Do they have draft animals or is everything manual labor? Etc.

Rational vampires could also be a thing. Sure, turning everyone into a vampire would mean the vampires have no food supply and go extinct as well, but communal problems arising from selfish individual actions [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons][hasn't stopped people yet]].

*** I have a friend whose kelpie story has been published and she's now writing YA banshees... Personally I'd like to see more about Selkies, but I'm not sure I want any of them to become a fad outside of Scotland and Ireland as I fear the terrible cod accents in the movie version :-)

** What kind of linguistic features do you think would occur in a species of not dieing from age or anything short of near total splattering and immolation would develop?

The ones I've already determined is a lack of gendered/sexed words except purely reproductive verbs.

A highly directional addressing system that can function to pinpoint an individual in most crowds and more or less replace the need for names when dealing with strangers (names are still useful when referring to an individual that you can't point at).

It's kind of a verbal equivalent of pointing right at some one.

The entities in question generally can vocalize around 14 seperate voices if pressed, but prefer to keep it down to five or six for normal comunication and the language effectively is impossible to pronounced without at least two-three separate voices.

Their speech resembles woodwinds/violins. When they speak human words it sounds kind of choral/musical and in skilled speakers this accent is tuned to be considered very 'beuatiful'
