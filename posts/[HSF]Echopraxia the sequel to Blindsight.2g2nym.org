As expected from the sequel to Blindsight, hefty implications about intelligence and consciousness in the design-space of all possible optimizers are explored and analyzed. Be warned. In this book, there are Aliens in the deepest, hardest, most steelmanned meaning of the word.


** I thought /Blindsight/ worked very well as a standalone, it'll be interesting to see how he builds on to the world here.

Also:

/Technically/ true, but some Twilight fans are going to be in for a bit of a surprise.

Best part is that some of them are from earth.

** It was definitely very nicely done. I'm not entirely sure it's quite as awesome as Blindsight, but it does not hesitate to apply the concepts from the first book in its speculations.

Watts also plays around with the idea of 'faith' in a way that's especially interesting, given that, in all, I think I can class it with Blindsight in the 'proto-rationalist' to 'rationalist' section of my library.

Do you have a postrationalist section? Is it bigger than "the blog posts of Will Newsome and Steve Rayhawk"?

**** I haven't yet had a use for the label, so no. What would you say characterizes it in contrast to rationalism?

I've been able to find Computational Theology, but all a quick search gets me for Steve Rayhawk is his LessWrong page, and some posts on OvercomingBias that link to it. Could I have a link please?
