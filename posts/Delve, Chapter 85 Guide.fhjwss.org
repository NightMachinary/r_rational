**** I mean whatever in that case. People not trying out dynamo and not understanding the implications of how experience works can (barely) slip by my SoD.

But specifically the non-awakened that were supposed to go into the dungeon were clearly behaving too dumb for reality.

***** Dynamo isn't that good, sure you get to cap skills fast (stamina would be even faster) but that's not what limits adventurers (including Rain himself) mid to long term. He's great against low level mobs in the area immediately around him, which is awful in the combat meta of the world. Although every party or at least town should have their own aura guy to fuel them.

Edit: Although a decent Dynamo/Stamina build should have unlocked tons of skill tiers and informed their government/group.

****** Why would the majority of Awakened be adventurers in the first place? You can figuratively print money with a good portion of those skills. And then pay Blue slayers to raise your cap.

******* The same reason kids want to grow up to be their sports heroes. Note that their role models really aren't that competent, either - even going back to the start of the story, adventurers are mostly loose canons.

High Clarity / low Focus tends gives Rain a tendency to over-analyze, which he must constantly pull himself back from. High Focus / low Clarity has the opposite effect, making for poor impulse-control. Add to this the fact that truly powerful people rarely feel consequences for what they do.

Pretty much every role model these kids have is like this, as is Velika.

******** Come on. The majority are unawakened and all of those guys were adults or late teens. No unawakened adult in an awakened world thinks they are the shit when all the monster killing since written history has been done by superhumans. The idea that an unawakened adult goes into a dungeon and expects it to be a cake walk is ludicrous for anyone who didn't either grow up superduper sheltered or fell on the head a few times too many. And in Rain's kindergarden group there's two at best who aren't completely clueless morons. Despite them having been chosen by lot.

Also, how did that archer girl become that good at hitting moving targets under stress without having gained any respect whatsoever for monsters? Is she a pigeon shooting noble that has some disorder that makes her not feel fear?

So yes, kids want to be their sports heroes. But how many teens and young adults think they already /are/ their sports heroes, even when literally being coached by a pro athlete?

********* I mean.... kettel's a moron from day one, the rest are nobles who just haven't had a chance to awaken, so they've been told from day one they'll be those badass superheroes /and/ have massive resources and societal power behind them. The only reasonable person here is the older mace welding married Lady, and that's kinda self explanatory.

********** But they more than anyone should know the difference between being badass superheroes and not yet being that. They literally live in the same house. I'm sorry, but the stereotype that being raised as a noble makes you a moron is not actually true. They just often lack empathy or the ability to imagine being poor, and when they actually are morons the people around them notice more due to their power and backing.

And Kettle is the one that knows that /Slimes/ are an easy, yet annoying challenge that need specific preparation to be beat by him.

*********** I think you've missed some of what I'm trying to say. They're raised in an environment where they personally* don't have that power sure, but they can borrow that power at all times and are basically untouchable because at any moment they're bothered by an unawakened they either have unawakened guards who are trained and armed, or can call down their family's version of Velika to turn people into paste. They're raised and trained specifically to inherit their family's build, so from birth they have the knowledge that they will* 100% become one of those badasses.

That's a perfect recipe for overconfidence imo.

Also Kettel but lard in himself to fight slimes and protect from acid, but also decided to fight slimes in the dark, with no knowledge of how blues work, while simultaneously harassing and belittling an adventurer who just saved his life. He's guaranteed a fucking moron. If rain was even 10% of the person Kettel had accused him of being, Kettel would've got punched in the face after demanding his cloak and left to die in the sewers. If rain had been any other adventurer, Kettel would've killed himself by opening his mouth lol.

Plus his constant bothering of the nobles. He's doing this with Rain nearby so presumably he feels safe, but in any other scenario??? Rapier noble would've spit roasted him and the worlds keeps spinning.

******* Awakened have plenty of money. Power and status come from being high level, so why should getting richer be their goal? Levelling requires either getting good at combat or getting assisted. A modern capitalist mindset is probably the wrong angle to analyze this.

****** Okay, but they are neither video gamers nor in a video game like situation. At all. They are (mostly) rich people going for the first time to an extreme sport seminar that, if successful, will give them immense amounts of status and further their career down the logical path. And they are going there under the suffrage and patronage of their unstable superhuman dictator. In a time of crisis and social upheaval.

So why are they acting like video gamers?
