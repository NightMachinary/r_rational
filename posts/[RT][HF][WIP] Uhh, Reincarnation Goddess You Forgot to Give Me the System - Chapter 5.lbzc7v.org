*** Maybe our protagonist doesn't know the difference?

**** Oh, I'm sure that's the Watsonian explanation, as another signal that while the protagonist is somewhat aware of RPG terminology, she doesn't know enough to use it accurately.

I just would not be surprised if there's some Doylist trolling of the audience going on here as well.

*** Yes, it's always been my plan to eventually crosspost this to Royal Road. I'd like to build up a bigger backlog before I start doing that, though.

(I mean... I've already written the first novel's worth of content, but I mean a bigger backlog of chapters that I've already posted about here, to the group that I consider the story's primary demographic.)

(Also, I'm still working on commissioning some cover art for it. You can't go big on RR without a cover, sadly.)
