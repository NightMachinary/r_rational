There isn't really a specific name for this genre as far as I know...I guess some kinds of portal fantasy count, such as "A Hero's War" and quite a few Game of Thrones self-inserts.

Either way, I suppose the criteria for a piece of "uplift fiction" is to have a character with the skills and knowledge of modern science/engineering/technologically related discipline inserted into a fantasy world that is stagnating in the high fantasy medieval era who proceeds to cause societal and scientific upheaval and drags the world kicking and screaming into modernity.

I've caught up with a few of these but I find myself wanting more. Anyone have some recommendations?


** The name of the trope is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][One-Man Industrial Revolution]] and I think the foundational work of this kind is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]] by Mark Twain. You can read it here: [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/86?msg=welcome_stranger][(link)]].

** Try the SafeHold Series by David Weber. It is basically about the main character uplifting the last human world after humanity lost a war with aliens. It is a great series with some of the best tactical land and naval battles I have ever read. It also contains an interesting religious undertone.

*** I second the recommendation, and yes Weber is very strong on his Author Tract how "soft" religion (no persecution of unbelievers, no messed up customs, etc.) is such a nice thing, while fanatical zealots are the evilest of evil (although I guess strictly speaking they do adhere to the rules on the sidebar, because they really believe in that shit). It sometimes reaches ridiculous levels, at one point in /Safehold/, I remember, some of the characters thought how nice it would be when after dismantling the false religion they'll re-introduce all the diversity of religions from the Old Earth. Although I must say that except for a few especially obnoxious episodes like that one, Weber is possibly the only author who managed to make his religious characters so nice that my militant atheist self finds them hard to dislike.

** A major theme of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With This Ring]] is uplifting DC Earth so that it can compete with other interstellar societies. It's a very slow burn, and the beginning few episodes don't indicate the quality of the whole, but overall it's very well done on a number of levels and I would recommend it without hesitation.

Much of the uplift is through getting various pieces of DC fiction to work together in order to improve technology everywhere. Mostly, this includes getting the super tech made by mad scientists to become widely understood and distributed, and in making magic available to everyone. As of the most recent update, this includes people working on making autonomous drones for controlling the weather on a large scale, special gates that are able to teleport you to their opposite gate regardless of distance, mass producing a superconducting wire for all kinds of uses, and advancing research in alchemy with a focus on human augmentation.

**** I've actually felt that some of the britishisms are more jarring than punctuation choices.

But then again, after you've tried to parse what judges think is proper grammar for writing legal documents over a 50 year span, anything else seems rather quaint.
