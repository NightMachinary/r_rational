*** With the scope of the topic, I'd say it's a near-equal fit for General Rationality, even if OP is brainstorming a particular scene.

** It's not very clear what level these students are being taught at, but here are a few ideas across the spectrum. Mostly math, but some of the latter ideas are transferable to other subjects.

- For arithmetic I recommend arranging pebbles (or some other convenient object) into groups/grids. This makes arithmetic concrete and gives a convenient way for students to check their work (without a calculator, in case they don't exist). If two six-year-olds are arguing about whether 5 x 6 is 56 or 110 they can arrange a 5 x 6 grid to see that it's actually 30. Similarly five-year-olds can check for themselves that 5 - 2 = 3 by taking 2 pebbles away from a group of 5.
- I'm not sure how to turn this into a low-effort pedagogical trick, but something that's worth mentioning (that numerically-able people seldom think about) is the importance of distributivity. You might be surprised by the number of adults in the US (and I imagine quite a few other countries) who cannot multiply numbers with two or more digits in their head. They /need/ paper and pencil, since they only ever learned the "carry-the-one” algorithm that's popular here. A mental calculation like 57 x 23 is made a lot easier by considering (60-3) x 23 or 57 x (20 + 3) instead.
- If you're going to give them silly and tedious exercises like adding up the first 100 numbers, it might be fun for the students to discover the formula 1 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 after much frustration and boredom.

In reality lots of puzzles and riddles would probably be better than drills. Some complementary ideas:

- Have the teacher give them a ruler and compass, and a list of exercises (construct n-gons, bisect lines/angles, square a circle(!?)). People don't need supervision to work on these problems, and it helps students understand notions of proportion, equidistance, loci, etc.

- Give them “experimental problems,” like: Determine the relationship between diameter and circumference. Calculate the value of pi by measuring these quantities. Come up with a formula for the volume of a ball. Even just measuring these quantities are good exercises in problem solving (wrapping string around round objects to measure circumference, use water displacement to measure volume, or perhaps trying to approximate the area/volume of a circle/sphere by counting squares/cubes). Instruction along these lines (giving hints as necessary) doesn't require much time/effort on the part of the teacher. Experimental assignments like this can be used for physics and chemistry too, and would go a long way in cultivating the correct mentality a student would need to survive a rationalist plot line.

Yes, that's exactly what happens in my story :)

Also I really like the idea of having the students work on experimental problems, it's right up rational alley :)

** Books always work. Depending on your setting, books can be rare, but I get the feeling the teacher would at least have access to some.

My guess from googling is these are word problems?

***** Yes; a wide variety of word problems presented as a form of entertainment, generally ones that can be solved with innovative application of high-school math (helped along in some cases by pencil and paper). And some of which are more logic-based and less mathematics-based.

The emphasis is on innovative application of well-known or easily derived techniques, not on complex computation.
