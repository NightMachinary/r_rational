Had to take a week off to think carefully about where I'm going with this. Thanks for your patience, all.

Pyrebound is a year-old high fantasy serial, set in an original, Mesopotamian-flavored world where society is built around resisting an endlessly recurring magical disaster. The tone is dark, the pace brisk, the worldbuilding deep. It starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][right here]].

(I really do appreciate my stalwart fans who kept on TWF voting even during the dry spell!)
