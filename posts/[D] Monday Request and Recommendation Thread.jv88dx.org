Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

** Im looking for some rational, or better, rationalist stories of the "survival" theme.

I can do anything from deserted island survival, wilderness survival, space survival etc. Especially Man vs Nature kind of a book, in which the protag must rationally utilise his knowledge and skils to survive, create primitive technology etc.

Basically Rationalist Minecraft/Rationalist Robinson Crusoe.

*** It's been a while since I read them, but I can't remember anything particularly irrational about Gary Paulson's Hatchet books (if you take into account the main character is a kid who doesn't know what he is doing at first).

The TV series Alone is also pretty good if you like survival content. All the footage is self recorded by the contestants who are dropped off in the wilderness somewhere and have to fend for themselves for as long as possible (multiple months sometimes). Not exactly rational content, but the people who learn and adapt and develop better strategies tend to do better.

** I've surprised myself this November by, on the whole, keeping up with NaNoWriMo, and I think part of what is helping with that is, 1) focusing less on writing something /good/ and more on just writing, and 2) publishing what I write online so that I can track both my wordcounts and people's engagement.

All that said, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37261/to-hold-dominion][To Hold Dominion]] is a xianxia-inspired (though not particularly xianxia-esque) high fantasy story about three characters from different worlds, and a mysterious tournament. I'm not writing it with any specific rationalist bent other than my own predilection for rational stories... Anyway, I'll copy/paste the Royal Road summary below, which might give a better idea.

Cassiel is a student in the Valley of the Crystal Sun, doomed to obscurity and neglect because of her failure to fully integrate the vaunted Sunlight Crystals.

Iyojin is a studious Weaver in the Paperhall, working to complete her new Chitin weapon in order to graduate, even as pressures mount.

Lairas is a wanderer and a thief, and has just gotten away with the biggest theft of his life - stealing a Spirit of Slaughter from Wellspring Barrow.

Their lives are about to become entangled, as each seeks achievement, insight, and safety in the mysterious Tournament - an event that will pit warriors from across the continent of Inara against each other for glory.

*** "Secure in their lives" would be hard to find unless you're specifically asking for slice-of-life. But you can look at Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga, which starts with Aral Vorkosigan and Cordelia Naismith in their 30's/40's. It then continues with the next generation for long enough that they, too, have whole books as fully adults.

Eh, "read Bujold" is basically an evergreen rec at this point anyways.

You can also look for Asimov, I don't think he ever wrote any character younger than thirty. I guess that's why Robot City was done by other people.

You'll also find that the "steadiness" you're looking for in character written as 40-somethings is as much an illusion in fiction as it is in reality. Because let's be honest here: none of us 40+ know what we're doing any more than we did when younger. We just fake it better and better.

But they are in fact among the perfect examples, because the kind of /supported/ confidence that they bring to the page is really relaxing to me, and I'm glad that she brought that level of confidence and maturity to the other characters over time. (Ivan. <3 )

But yeah, "read Bujold" is definitely an evergreen rec! And I'd say that "read Jemisin" might also qualify. And of course Marie Brennan and Jo Walton have written books from that perspective too.

A few of the protagonists there are, well, perhaps mature is the right word. They certainly know who they are at the time the series starts, though some of them are trying really hard to deny it.

It's brilliant, the characters are great, and it has the absolutely best depiction of a barbarian in fantasy literature history.

Do be advised, though, that it comes with every trigger warning possible, which will still not prepare you for how grimdark and gritty it is.

But yeah jokes aside a lot of the characters are mature adults, not settled in the slice of life way mostly as the books tend to focus mostly on wanderers, soldiers and people in times of great societal change (a feeble attempt to cram the awesome, humongous storyline into some sort of category) but there is a distinct lack of YA-ness even in the young adults that do play a role (it takes like five chapters in the first book for the young officer the story follows early on to get murdered in an alley).

A lot of the characters are fairly sure of their place in life, and settled in their mindset - responsible adults surviving in a dangerous world, basically.\\

** Volume 10 of the Japanese Light Novel series So I'm a Spider, So What? just released earlier today(and it was damn good), and I'd like to recommend it here. Based on previous threads, I see a lot of people like the typical JP isekai setting you always see in manga and anime, although it's unfortunate how most of them tend to be horrible.

I'm really impressed by Spider though, I feel it's the only JP isekai that does the normal isekai story well. Isekai is like the junk food of fantasy imo, the setting and elements are pretty cool, but they're usually done incredibly shallow, with most of them just copying the same tropes and cliches, with very few actually putting in the proper world building, character building, and personality to make it good. Spider is an incredible isekai that really utilizes every element of the typical isekai story properly.

Before I talk more about it, I will say that some may be divisive about it. It starts off as a litrpg monster reincarnation story, but later on it moves away from both the litrpg grinding and monster elements, and some people may be bothered by it. If the fact that it doesn't stay as a litrpg grinding monster story, then I'm sure you'll really like Spider, because the story is fantastic.

Whenever I read or watch an isekai, I'm always very cynical and judgemental, and realize that the worldbuilding is shallow or makes no sense. Questions like 'why is there a litrpg system in the world?' and 'why was the mc even reincarnated and why do they have cheats?' and 'why is it always a hero vs. a demon lord?', tropes and cliches that a lot of series cling to without any proper purpose or reason, it's just there. In Spider, every element of the story has a purpose. There's an important and logical reason why the MC and her classmates were isekai'd, and why they have cheats, and why the MC even reincarnates into a spider. There's a reason why there's a litrpg System governing the World. There's a reason why there are humans, elves, and demons, and there's a reason why there's always a human Hero and a demon Demon Lord, and all these elements are crucial to the overarching story and play into it in very satisfying ways as the mystery of the world is slowly unraveled.

Story elements aside, it has a lot of personality, charm, and soul. [[https://imgur.com/a/SrCiFZy][Here's]] a little excerpt from the latest volume, and the author exudes personality and emotion into the writing, making the novel feel so fresh compared to the dry, exposition-heavy, and boring isekai novels and MCs you usually see. The writing is very balanced. It's not always humorous, the author knows how to write comedic moments and tones, but the character development and emotional scenes are handled exceptionally as well. There's a lot of serious, intelligent, and grim characters too, and the writing captures those moods perfectly. The ending of volume 10 blew me away with the MC's revelation and conviction, but I won't reveal that here as its MAJOR spoilers.

The story is really impressive too. The author respects the readers' intelligence and doesn't do exposition dumps or trite plot points, the way the story progresses, reveals, and misdirects is phenomenal, I'll just leave it at that. The characters are exceptional and all are very well-written, with many being foils to each other or making excellent use of the isekai setting. The MC has been fighting for survival ever since she was born, and through those struggles has the ability to change the world. Another classmate is born as a human prince and serves as commentary on the generic isekai protagonist, clinging to the ideals of his past life and wanting to change the world without sacrifice, except he doesn't have the strength or conviction to carry it out. Another classmate, best friend of the human prince reincarnation, reincarnates as a girl and has to struggle between the identity of her past life and her current one, as well as deal with her ever changing feelings for her best friend(who is unfortunately generic and thus oblivious). This character is actually written and handled exceptionally well, as light novels are notoriously bad at writing women. And so on and so on. Spider takes the typical elements of the generic isekai setting and crafts an absolutely stunning story.

The story is surprisingly rational too. There's a lot of bits about the world and how things work. In this volume the Demon Lord orders her Demon subordinates to put down a rebellion, and the novel goes over how despite there being a litrpg System, virtually everybody has stats in the several hundreds range, with people having stats in the thousands being pretty much legendary warriors, so battles between two armies will be virtually equal. The MC, despite occasionally being a bit goofy, is very competent and tries to optimize her stat and skill growth, especially so when she's training Vampy.

So if you like JP isekais and aren't bothered by the fact that the story shifts away from level grinding or being a monster, I'd very highly recommend this story. I personally think there's no JP isekai better than So I'm a Spider, So What?

The last time I talked about Spider here, some mentioned that the price might be a bit high, as its a light novel series. There are some ...easily accessible methods, if price is a concern for you.

Additionally, the series has some really [[https://imgur.com/a/M5HYfIh][adorable]] illustrations.

** I saw the movie [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3118452/][Circle]] (on Netflix) some time ago and really liked it.

#+begin_quote
  Held captive and faced with their imminent executions, fifty strangers are forced to choose the one person among them who deserves to live.
#+end_quote

Essentially a group of strangers from a pretty wide cross-section of society (race, gender, sexual orientation, wealth, etc.) must convince each other who to kill for one of them to stay alive. They're stuck in a room, each in a small circle, and can't move. They can only interact by talking, so we (as the audience) have to judge each of them based on their values and biases.

The only thing I didn't really like was the end should have been left more open-ended. But other than that the movie was enjoyable.

I've been reading [[https://mangadex.org/title/41161/gorae-byul-the-gyeongseong-mermaid][Gorae Byul - The Gyeongseong Mermaid]] and I really like it. It's a manhwa (Korean comic), but I feel like it's a good fit here, mainly because of the characters. Similar to the above, we really examine their goals and motives.

#+begin_quote
  "If the life that you had regained, was one that I had breathed back into you... Is it too much to hope for you to love me back with that life?" The year is 1926, in Japan-occupied Joseon. 17-year-old Soo-a is an illiterate handmaiden working for the household of a prominent Japanese collaborator. One day, she discovered an injured young man lying unconscious at the beach, an independence activist called Eui-hyeon. The sweet and innocent Soo-a nursed him back to health, and Eui-hyeon told her the tale of the "Little Mermaid", a princess of the sea who saved a prince from his death. Having fallen in love with Eui-hyeon, Soo-a was determined to meet him once again. But she knew not then, of the fate that awaited the "Little Mermaid" on her quest to reunite with her beloved.

** Anybody got some good munchkin stories? I liked both of the Naruto fics I see here all the time, the need to become stronger and the waves arisen. I think because naruto is easily munchkinable. I don't even need strictly-rational books, I once read a munchkined erotica book. So really anything you got for me would be great.

If y'all have any recommendations that'd be great! I like Harry Potter as well and I think I read a minchkined fic of that? But I'm not sure. In general I like Harry Potter fanfiction though.

It's a great story that's totally let down by its translation - but somehow, that doesn't entirely stop it. The MC is a fairly standard cultivator with amnesia (he lost his memories about two years ago), but he's driven to optimize what resources he has in order to get stronger.

The story starts out as almost a cookie clicker type thing - the MC has X fields of spiritual grains which he needs to take care of in order to generate Y income using Z spiritual arts - but the plot quickly smacks him in the face and forces him to scramble to keep up.

(You'll need to poke around a bit to find the original version, the one on Amazon had all the D&D terms changed for copyright reasons.) There's also Erfworld, if you're down to read a comic.

You might also enjoy some of the time loop Naruto fics. I think people on this sub like Time Braid? Someone's probably already recommended Mother of Learning to you; it's probably the best of the time loop stories.

I do actually mostly like this fic -- the characterization and writing are mostly solid, the dialogue is fun, etc. But I get really bothered by how consistently it portrays the FMA characters as smarter and more mature than the HP characters.

And like, look, I get it. Harry Potter suffers from a lot of worldbuilding issues and characters do get handed some pretty big idiot balls. Everybody has read the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/8kr0n1/why_harry_potter_needs_a_gun/][Why Harry Potter needs a gun]] copypasta and HP:MOR. But c'mon, you're just gonna let the FMA characters completely smoke the HP characters? Just off the top of my head, they imply (it hasn't been tested) that they'll just snipe Voldemort to buy themselves some time while he gets a new body, Hawkeye throws off imperio on her first try, Ed beats up Moody and Snape simultaneously, and Ed and Al /create an array to turn off magic/ (I haven't actually watched FMA, I think that one is canon?). Like, if you're gonna curbstomp one setting so hard, why do you need 200,000 words to do it?

It's like, Dumbledore has to be explicitly told "hey, even if we can't kill Voldemort permanently, it took him 13 years to get a new body last time, so why don't we kill him again to buy some time?" Like, in canon, they didn't do that because Voldemort is guerilla fighter who can match Dumbledore 1:1, not because /they didn't think of it/.

That's not even getting into the more minor ways HP characters are dumb, like the teens getting their wands confiscated by Ed multiple times (they try to Obliviate Al for some dumb reason, I forget), or being completely fooled by Mustang's "oh I'm a harmless politician routine", or being confused/horrified by the idea of legal prostitution (yeah, IDK, that one was weird).

Currently reading "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13576158/1/Theogony][Theogony]]" -- again, not /rational/, as only a tightly constrained embodiment of rage could be, but well written and I think enjoyable for fans of Worm and the God of War series. It's also got the implausible "all ye olde mythes are /real/" thing going on, but that's a trope I happen to enjoy.

I also have a *request* for a recommendation: I've read a number of magical elementary school stories (e.g. Harry Potter), a few magical high school stories (e.g. Year of the Griffin), and even a magical college story (e.g. The Magicians). Are there any good magical /grad school/ stories, esp. at the doctoral level? Dealing with magical dissertation committees, magical publishing, magical lecturing, a more mature, level-headed approach to magical relationships, etc. Something that has [[http://phdcomics.com/comics/most_popular.php][Piled Higher and Deeper]] energy, e.g. the describing that trope-y first-college-class scene where our fish-out-of-water protagonist looks around the lecture hall and sees the mysterious snake sorcerer cloaked in shadow, a gleaming, armored paladin, a princely middle eastern stereotype adorned in jewels and scimitars, a scantily clad tree nymph, etc. etc. but from the perspective of their seen-it-all-before grad student instructor who just wants to make it through this first lecture to get back to grant writing and experiments. Maybe also something with a harder magic system able to invert Clarke's Third Law (“sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology”).

Alternatively, any (magical or non-magical) fiction that features adult characters experiencing grad school, or else a magical school story told from the perspective of an adult non-student (a groundskeeper, a teacher, etc.). Unseen Academicals comes to mind, but I felt that to be more a story taking place at a university than a story for which the university setting was essential.

Like, as an idea I love it. You get a group of once in a million mages and what's the best use of them, civil engineering of course. It's a fantastic decision.

However, I've never felt more than this story could have shaved thousands if not tens of thousands of words by just fucking drawing it. It's just so bloody dull to read, and there's no payoff for it. Nothing ever comes of knowing that they had to do it by 3m instead of 4m, hell even all the fancy materials they get to use is just, I don't know porn for an engineer about what they'd do if they didn't have a budget? Like, wow it's going to last 10,000 years instead of 1,000 what an exciting thing to tell me, are we going to experience that difference? Is it ever going to matter to the plot or even to the characters? It's like he read the Wikipedia article (or more likely a dozen deeper books) about canals and then wanted to tell me all about that with a practical example. Half of the book could almost be submitted as proof for a civil engineer graduate that they can design a canal from scratch.

The first one was pretty good [well, at least it was interesting/different enough to make up for its flaws] and I don't know about the rest after that since I stopped after finishing the second. It took me two months to read the second one and six days for the first (and tbh the first is already written in an almost obnoxiously difficult manner, it reminds me of reading Robinson Crusoe or something). Compared that to ASOIAF: [[https://i.imgur.com/RXIHpDy.png]]

This is what I wrote in my own notes section on my book history after finishing it:

This is like reading a civil engineers manual, who tf thought this would make for an exciting and interesting story. I get that it's a good way of demonstrating how the characters can really impact the world by massively terraforming and causing huge economic changes but still story benefit do we get out of fifty pages of measurements. If he wanted to do all this he should have just put in pictures. There's a reason irl engineers use blueprints not describe stuff because describing stuff takes forever and is impossible to picture. Also I feel like the constant mention of metals and compounds is meant to be bragging about how amazing they are but he uses it so liberally and they got a house from an elemental with zero cost so why not just do that with whole villages I don't understand why no one would try to do it before on a larger scale.

I can distinctly remember Juniper and Raven express negative feelings about it, and possibly others as well. The idea is that Uther is an otherworldly, mythically perfect being, but the more they learn about him the more the myth is tarnished by reality, with his unapologetic plagiarism a part of that.

Additionally, Arthur at least had the decency to make his works adaptations, fitting to the time he found himself in. Star Wars becomes a medieval knights tale, for example. And he was doing it purely from memory, so his knowledge and skill as a writer was essential to the stories being viable works or art. Just knowing the plot of Romeo and Juliet is not enough to right a good book about it. In contrast, in Throne of Magical Arcana the MC just inexplicably has a library in his head with perfect copies of an untold number of books in it, including sheet music for countless classical songs that he goes on to recreate exactly and pass off as his own.

**** Not really, IMO. I've watched Korra and also read 'Somebody That I Used Tahno', and feel that both are slightly above average but not great.

Republic City and the bending is all portrayed in the show, and IMO those visuals are the best part of it. In the fic though, lots of the description and interactions in the story assume you know what's going on. It starts in media res /and/ in a flashback /and/ with an unreliable narrator, which is much harder without knowing the plot of the story beforehand. Korra's setting and plot also has idiosyncrasies that the fic just rolls with, which are easier to absorb in a visual medium (eg, like giant mecha exist but guns don't).

****** If you're talking about how it was handled, then I'd agree. I don't mind a show having a more politically focused aspect to it, but only if it's done right and not forcing in today's issues. For example, Star Wars the Clone Wars actually had decent politics in it, especially towards the end of season 6 with the banker clans and what not. Can't think of any other at the top of my head though.

***** Have you ever watched this? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhS4a11jZOg]]

It had a huge like to dislike ratio, before that got removed.

To summarise - The Legend of Korra is a bad show attempting to cash-in on the popularity of the original.

It's crew and humour are bland and forced as hell compared to the cast from the original series and it's better than the aspects from the original show that doesn't either care about it or wouldn't have significantly and improved the original show that much.

You can still love it and it has quite a few moments, but there's no way in hell that it holds a candle light to the original in terms of overall quality or someone else put it:

- /I walked into this video like, “I love the Legend of Korra, but somehow, this video will probably still manage to convince me it sucks.” I walked out like, “I still love the Legend of Korra, but now I know IT SUCKS!!!”/

****** Well, I haven't seen that particular video before, but that was kind of my opinion on legend of korra.

It's an alright show. They get most of the combat right, and republic city itself is pretty cool the way only steampunk '20s can be. But I don't think it's as good or as deep as the first avatar and it doesn't give us as much to think about.

I'll give it a watch though and see if that video changes my mind.

*** The best part about Somebody that I Used Tahno is that it ends, satisfyingly. Most plot threads are tied up neatly and the ones that are left aren't big enough that it's annoying.

I really liked the romance too. The characters have their own priorities and motivations and the romance serves to deepen their actual bonds instead of becoming something separate from their roles in the story. It's an overall satisfying package, highly recommend.

Oh and as a rec for your request, if you're able to tolerate the initial inconsistencies in Ar'Kendrythist, it gets really into magic research. Granted it's not really magic grad-school, and there's a few existential threats that get in the way of magic research. It's more like magic professor, except the professor is foreign and has really specialized knowledge. Later on in the story the protagonist works with archmages who are leaders in their own field to research different types of magic or figure out ways to gain spells easier and cheaper. He even joins magic school as a grad student of sorts, and takes classes and does terrible in some and well in others. Even later on he works directly with other archmages to develop new spells, and sometimes gives lectures to other archmages.

** First, a meta recommendation: If you have a library card but haven't been going to the library (for obvious reasons, natch) [[https://www.overdrive.com/][Overdrive/Libby]] are services that let you 'check out' virtual books from your library. Wait lines can be fairly long, but the trick there is to just place multiple holds at once, and then at some point the books will start to roll ib.

Their book discovery service is pretty mediocre, so I would recommend setting up a GoodReads profile, tracking the books you've read, and seeing what they recommend you.

Now, for actual pieces of fiction:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red][All Systems Red]] - Murderbot discovers what it means to have free will. Humorous and well written. Covers a number of rational-adjacent topics, but the main character is deliberately written to be irrational.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50548197-a-deadly-education][A Deadly Education]] A more mature 'magical high school' novel. The setting is deliberately irrational, but the characters take measured actions to achieve their goals. Good, fun read.

**** I think the reviews criticizing Novik of racism in her work (even if they don't go so far as to accuse Novik herself of racism) are really far off the mark. The main character has a very transactional view of relationships as what is clearly a coping mechanism, not as some sort of proxy for denigrating other cultures. Yes, people from other cultures are shown in negative lights, but given the very global nature of the novel's characters, that was practically impossible to avoid. Accusing this novel of being racist when its entire point is to demonstrate the unjust power of entrenched, exclusionary ingroups is to completely miss the point.

Maybe if this had been Novik's debut there would be more reason for suspicion, but her Temeraire series is a pretty pointed critique of imperialism and racism (both in the magical and mundane senses).

***** My prior enjoyment of the Temeraire novels is one of the reasons I wanted to like this work, and at the same time of of the reasons I was eventually so disappointed with it.

Perhaps it's the case that this specific work hits closer to home as the character and I are of similar backgrounds (which itself is another reason I really wanted to like it - representation in fiction really is nice), but it's only skin-deep at best. To take a line from that review that perfectly encapsulates what I'm not sufficiently eloquent to say: "her Indian heritage is a veneer placed on top of a character who is otherwise just a default white protagonist." The "diversity" depicted in this work is written in an incredibly orientalist and imperialist manner - claiming that a character of one background yet characterized by unrelated tropes shows a basic lack of any research or respect given to the topic at hand, that speaks louder to me than other elements.

I realize that this may sound like strange pedantry from someone who's too close to the topic at hand, but reading this novel was a very dissonant experience, where at every turn I found the details to be in opposition to the greater themes, and as such, despite my best efforts, I couldn't enjoy it.

****** I think you went into this work looking for the chinese students to be chinese, and the arabic students to be arabic, etc. but in the context of this work, the chinese students are chinese /international students/ and the arabic students are arabic /international students/. To the extent that this story is imperialistic, it's that it does recognize the inherently imperialistic nature of modern schooling and globalization. The students resemble many of the foreign students I met in college myself, with different native tongues but western sensibilities. There is a significant difference between your a average, say, indian, and the type of indian that grows up learning foreign languages and consuming foreign media, with the backing necessary to enter a prestegious international school.

In fact, it explicitly points out towards the start of the work that the scholomance's anglocentrism is a direct consequence of how european imperialism affected other populations, and that resurgent foreign enclaves are actually working to subvert that.

And while I would agree with some criticism that the main character is designed to be easy to self insert into (dark witch? Noted several times in the story to be athletic and attractive, but without paying attention to any specific features? Intimidating aura? Catches the eye of the school's most popular boy by acting aloof?) I would take issue with calling her a default /white/ protagonist, especially since she'd singled out among her own childhood community for being nonwhite.

** I thoroughly recommend [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/reverend-insanity/][Reverend Insanity]], the first Cultivation story I've gotten into. The premise is that an evil powerful Cultivator (originally from Earth) is finally struck down by the righteous, just as he manages to get a reincarnation power, so he has the advantage of 500 years hindsight to maximise his paltry resources and get ahead of his rivals. In spite of the OP-sounding premise, his every success feels hard-fought as he navigates between penury, cultivating with his average talent and keeping below the threshold of being targeted by stronger families and institutions for all his outrageous deeds.

The whole thing genuinely feels interwoven and dynamic, the MC desperately struggling to keep ahead of everyone he's abused and slighted. It's like Worm in that aspect, every action having consequences, things that happen in early chapters coming back 100 chapters later. Each chapter is very hard to predict, there's all kinds of 2nd and 3rd level games being played. The other characters act reasonably; MC has to expend effort to push them into a corner and they'll strike back if they can. They have their own goals too.

The whole thing is very very long. If you've ever sighed at seeing a story that's under 100K words because why even bother... there is no such problem here! The translation is good I guess, though I have nothing to compare it too.

On the other hand, the MC is unrepentantly evil. It makes sense for his character, moulded by 500 years of an ultra-Darwinistic world with its own inequality-rich magic system. So if you're on the lookout for an even slightly good MC who'll hesitate before ritually sacrificing a young girl to be eaten by a bear in order to get stronger, this isn't for you. He's much the same as HPMOR Voldemort. If there's a moral of the story, it's: "always go your own way and follow your ambition, no matter the consequences for anyone else." If there's a single theme that stands out it's :"Organizations, tribes and countries are all parasites, trying to lure you in and subjugate you: there is no true right or wrong, only strong or weak". Now I think about it, this might be veiled criticism of the CCP. Overall, the story isn't pointless edge, it's heartfelt, steelmanned and genuinely insightful IMO.
