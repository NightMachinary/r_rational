** Funny thing is, since Sombra is a part of Athena that means there is no way for her to betray OW at all. Then again it's possible Gabe knows in general how Caduceus works and he expects Sombra to be nano infiltrated anyway so he is playing along?

** I knew that McCree idolized Amari, Athena knew that, Zeigler probably knew that, why did she let McCree escort Amari then?

*** McCree and Amari were jointly escorting Morrison to a cell- they didn't have any reason to suspect she would help him escape.

IDK if that didn't come across- I started writing a (pretty boring) scene that went into the details, but I decided to cut it and let Sombra recap instead. Skimming the chapter, I /think/ I didn't miss anything, but from the inside it can be hard to tell when you're making inferential leaps the reader isn't making.

**** Escape isn't the problem-Ziegler had mentioned earlier that Amari had reacted badly to the Ending Death bit, so to have McCree be the one to escort her is to have Ana re-find out through someone who doesn't understand the full story. Better she find out from Ziegler or Athena who can actually explain things before she develops an incorrect conclusion based on limited evidence.

All in all, it's a tiny amount of "why did she let that happen" for me, easily explained by them being distracted, but I think it is there.
