** I recently started to read it and i'm enjoying very much so far!

Thank you for providing a good piece of literature. Lately is hard to find something really worth reading.

** Am so fucking pumped to read this. BRB.

Edit: actually a bit put off with a full chapter of shit I'm too stupid to understand the implications of, lol. I think this is the kind of chapter I come back too in 5-10 once stuff actually happens and I'm like /”ah, that's where that's from”/.

*** Huh, well you're not the only person saying this so I doubt it's your intelligence that's the problem. Is there anything in particular where you went "argh this is too much stuff to take in right now"? Or is it more everything taken together?

I'm thinking of removing the Kabuto scene entirely tbh, also because I feel like it might make the chapter too frustrating to readers due to dramatic irony etc.

**** The only thing that confused /me/ was that Tsunade is alive, but I'm guessing this is gonna come up later as a plot point. I thought Kabuto was cutting her up into pieces in the previous chapter, I guess he was doing something else to her.

*** Nope, no resurrections for me. I always hated it as a kid when authors would chicken out like that - the threat of death is what makes action scenes (and stories like this in general) so tense and exciting. Whenever I read stories in which there's a huge battle and nobody important dies it breaks all suspension of disbelief for me.

Still, I'm getting a bit worried that I might have made the story feel too dark because of it. Gotta be careful with that stuff. :d

**** Honestly, it's fine. I'm a bit sad that Kakashi is out of the story so early since he was always my favourite character in Naruto (probably because he's not an angsty teen like literally fucking everyone else in the main cast), but oh well, such is life.

Thanks for writing.

**** I think it's fine as the deaths are all pretty much from a singular event. That makes for a dark /section/ of the work in the aftermath, but the work can move on from that.

  Naruto went through the ritual as ordered, barely *even* balking at the fact that they were being instructed on how to grieve for a man they hardly *even* knew

Perhaps better not to repeat "even", but it does have a ring to it

#+begin_quote
  "Actually,” said Shino*,”* I anticipated the possibility of you changing your mind and have positioned my allies so as to allow for maximum flexibility in our decision making process.”

Space should come between comma and opening quotation mark.

*** Thanks! Fixed now. I've also changed Naruto's line to make the group sound less stupid by making it clear that they're not gonna discuss any secrets in front of Kabuto.

    “Naruto.” Sasuke touched his shoulder and turned him around until the two of them were facing each other. There was a strange sheen to his grey eyes, as if they still held onto some of their power even when his Sharingan was deactivated. “She's not dead.”

Look, [[/u/Sophronius][u/Sophronius]]. I'm not asking for you to send me a literal gold metal. I'm only asking for credit for reading your entire work, and understanding that Sasuke is the exact kind of person who would casually genjutsu Naruto here.

I'm really happy that you're back btw. This was a story that got me through quarantine this year. Even if there were no chapters from here on out, I'm happy for these.

*** I don't know what you mean, Sasuke is just being a good friend here because he's a nice guy like that. Ask anyone in Konoha and they'll tell you what swell guys the Uchiha are :>

On a serious note, I'm very flattered that you'd spend your quarantine reading my story! and even more flattered that you'd read it carefully enough to look for subtle clues like that. :)

  “Yeah,” said Naruto, feeling some of the tension slip away from his shoulders. “You're right.”

  ...

  "No. It is only natural to spend more attention on those who have need of it. But, all the same, I can't help but wish that...” He stopped when he noticed Sasuke looking at him. “Never mind. It does not matter.”

How paranoid is too paranoid?

Anyway, looking forward to getting more details on Sasuke's new technique.

Anyone have ideas on how Kabuto is hiding his intentions? Is there obliviation in this universe?

*** My guess is that Kabuto is hiding his intentions with literal brain damage and can heal himself later. That or copious amounts of genjutsu.

**** The brain damage idea is interesting, but would require some really incredible precision. Maybe he has some way of preventing memory formation (brain damage could work) and uses that whenever he does something for Orochimaru.

With Ino's clan around, I think using genjutsu to deceive all of them isn't really feasible.

***** I agree that Genjutsu on all of the Yamanaka's is unfeasible, but self Genjutsu to make Kabuto love Ino might be feasible as long as Kabuto never decides to flare his chakra.
