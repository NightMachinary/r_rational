** I think Sydria is the one who got Dream Eater to put the geas on Seti. DE never said it was a vivamancer who sent her, so she could have been someone Sydria knows.

*** So that she could spend some time with her helpless brother and help him?

Shit just got real in this chapter. Seti abandoning his family completely? I suppose the life his family provides is really not what he wants, but still. I feel quite bad for Sydria, Seti has expressed zero gratitude for anything she has done for him.
