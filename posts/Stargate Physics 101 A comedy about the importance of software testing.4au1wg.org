** I love this on a level that cannot be described in English. Maybe Furling has a word for it.

** This is totally canon in my head. The sad thing is, the stargate is actually incredibly safe by Ancient standards. It has an intuitive interface, failsafe mechanisms and it outputs its warnings on stderr.

Most of the problems the SGC has with its target are due to the fact that they are using a housemade cobbled interface that physically manipulates the gate instead of the normal "press the buttons to activate" DHD. Plus, Goa'ulds always sending super-powerful energy beams at it to blow up earth.

*** Even a number of times the systems they use come up an error...and then they just find a way to circumvent it and dial to the place, causing some kind of problem

*** Yeah, it was written by [[/u/DRMacIver]], and he posted it here. It was recently on the front page of hackernews, so that's probably why it's here.

**** (In my version of canon) Temit is a bit odd by Furling standards. The obsessive attention to detail and quality control is normal, but the ability to put up with the Alteran lack of it is not.
