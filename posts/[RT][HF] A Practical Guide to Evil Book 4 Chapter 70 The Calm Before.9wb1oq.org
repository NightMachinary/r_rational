**** Hmm I took the phrase "Just for tonight" they mentioned at the end as a death flag because if Archer dies in the battle, they'll technically only be sleeping with each other for that specific night and never again.

​

I also interpreted the sex scene as part of a trope in stories where protagonist & love interest beds each other the night before and on the next day the love interest gets unsuspectedly murdered, which becomes a pivot for the protagonist. Considering that they've mentioned this is a Below-backed story, this could potentially be a pivot point for Below to empower Cat.

*** Wasn't there an interlude where a similar thing happened between Ranger and Black early on in their careers? So I think Archer is safe, especially if this was all planned by her, which it might be. I can easily see her doing this to tune Cat up for the coming fight and maybe lay the groundwork for Cat to get a sudden level up during the fight when Archer is in danger/injured.

** Well that was a long time coming. Such a long time coming in fact that my prediction went full circle and i ended up thinking it never would.

This chapter gave a lot of much needed explanation for prior events and some even more needed sense of import and scale to this whole arc. It's starting to feel a bit more meaningful and less contrived now.

#+begin_quote
  It's wasn't impossible to throw around the kind of workings I'd seen fae royalty employ, it just wasn't possible without going fucking crazy.
#+end_quote

Here's our explanations for both why a) Cat struggled against a lesser tier Mighty and b) why abandoning the Mighty in Arcadia was actually dangerous to them. An Insane Winter Cat could steamroll any Mighty and when the Mighty were left in Arcadia insane fae royalty were what they were exposed to.

My main question now, is..

#+begin_quote
  if I'd led the army I currently commanded against Diabolist at Second Liesse we would have ripped her to shreds. Hells, unless the Lone Swordsman had a very good story at his back Urulan would have torn through the poor fucker in an hour's work and gone for a drink afterwards.
#+end_quote

..if this is true then why hasn't Cat gone back to Callow with her OP Drow army? Yes, she stands to gain more but she is also taking a gigantic risk by trying to topple Sve Noc. Her current army is a huge power boost and is, most importantly, far stronger than she would have hoped to find when she entered Drow territory in the first place. I mean she has 10+ Cat-equivalent-power Mighty alone and there is no way she was suspecting to gain that much when she arrived. The potential benefits from the dwarf deal surely aren't worth the risk.

Have i missed some prior reason given for why Cat isn't just cashing in her winnings and gating out? Has she constrained herself in some way with her Dwarf bargain or Drow oaths?

*** It was made fairly clear in the fight against Urulan that Cat wasn't going full out. She hasn't used her domain nor did she link in with Akua to use greater workings. People (and Cat herself) use it to make a false equivalence between her power and what the drow can dish out, when in reality she did half of what we've seen her do against Skein, and even that would be sufficient is she fought smarter. She struggled because she was an overconfident idiot.

**** So i'm willing to buy that if Cat fought at the level she did against Skein then she would have dealt with Urulan. What i dont buy is that the interpretation the text is selling to me is that it was clear she wasn't going all out and that Cat is mistakenly making false equivalences. Here is a quote from her fight with Urulan:

#+begin_quote
  I realized, dimly, that if this went through entirely I might actually die. I'd treated the Everdark like a training exercise, sometimes almost a game, but I'd been swimming in the shallows of this sea. There were monsters in the deeps that would make these look like imps. I close my eyes and let Winter loose. Frost formed all over my body, rapidly thickening and then shooting out. They had a globe of Night, I had a globe of ice. In a pissing contest of raw power, I'd bet on me every time. The Night ate into the ice but I kept pouring out Winter, its delighted laughter sounding softly in my ears. At first it devoured quicker than I made, but I dug in my heels and truly let loose. It became even, and I felt my blood turn cold as I dug even deeper.
#+end_quote

By no means does that indicate that Cat is holding back (though i agree that information we know from the Skein fights may suggest so). After this fight against Urulan we have:

- Cat mentioning again how she almost died

- Akua talking to Cat about the fact she almost died and needs to use Winter more like a mage (not, 'fight like you did against Skein')

- Cat mentioning how she doesn't think she could take the high tier Mighty in (insert whatever name Drow city she was in)

- Cat mentioning again in this chapter how strong the Might are compared to herself and how she could beat them but would need to let Winter loose more

If interpretation A is that i am supposed to read this and go 'ah, Cat is making that same false equivalence and erroneous judgement again that she has five times in as many chapters' and interpretation B is 'inconsistent writing' then i'm sliding down Occam's razor and going with B.

We've seen her unleash it on all the significant opponents so far (Skein, Saint, etc.) and I would argue its use signifies the kid gloves are off. The fact she almost died is pointing to how overconfident and ineffective she was rather than making a statement on how powerful the drow are. That's how I interpret it anyway.

Don't get me wrong, I expect the drow in Holy Tvarigu to be more powerful than her. However, nothing I've seen from the sigil-holders in her cabal leads me to believe they could survive her domain or even match the level of destruction she's capable of.

** I liked this chapter. Cat and Idrani sitting around, talking about the important issues, and advancing their character arcs. I'm a fan of this series mostly for the characters and the world building, and this was a good chapter for both. Acknowledging some of the inherent shittiness of what they're doing, talking about their place in the game of the Gods,speculating about Sve, discussing future plans (if somewhat opaquely) and of course their relationship. Good stuff.

There was also talk on what stories are in play, which I appreciate. I feel like too often the story, at least recently, is left as some vague, nebulous, and yet all-powerful force that you can't really guess at. If we don't know the shape of things in advance, then there are too many tropes and archetypes to really narrow down which ones are at play, and (at least for me) it can feel somewhat arbitrary when it's revealed in hindsight which ones were at play. So yeah, I enjoyed the story talk.

(Although I did find it kind of funny, how Cat apparently missed the narrative forming around them and then not even a minute later Archer talked about how strange it is that Cat pays so much attention to the story)

It did revisit the plot problems I had with the last chapter though - where the seven sigil-holders of Lotow completely gave up all of their resistance to being enslaved after a day (or up to a week, which is hardly any better). Again, Cat hyped up Urulan, comparing him both to her now (as one of the top ten most powerful beings on the continent), to Will (who Urulan would have put down without issue), and describing what sort of destruction he'd carve through the Procer/Callow. She even specifically said how a cohort of Drow that powerful would take half the heroes on the continent to put them down. But a cohort of Drow entered Arcadia and started rethinking selling themselves into slavery not even 24 hours later? This does not seem like the Arcadia we saw in Books 1 through 3. Whatever, I guess I'll write it up as first draft weirdness and try not to think about it too much.

But there was also (more) confirmation that Night can be harvested from those who do not already have Night, which I personally appreciated, as I've been arguing this point for something like a month now.

I strongly suspect Cat is wrong about this. I'm nearly certain that the Heavenly Light will turn out to be a near perfect counter for the Night.

Not to mention a bunch of subterranean monsters coming to the surface, slaughtering innocents to gain power, is setting themselves up for a heroic story. Even more so with the Grey Pilgrim on the heroes side to nudge things the right way.

**** I can definitely see a Light-Night interaction happening. Hell, from a Watsonian perspective it's probably needed just to keep narrative tension and stop Cat from steamrolling the continent. (Assuming some pesky Hero doesn't develop an aspect that lets them 'Free' the Drow from their oaths or some such).

But I'm not sure the heroic story impacts Cat's analysis. I think we can count on Cat "I'm always thinking about the story and it weirds out my friends" Foundling to have thought about the story implications. Hell, she explicitly factored the story into her Urulan vs Lone Swordsman calculations.

I also don't think that any of this hugely impacts on my broader point in that paragraph, which is that it's weird that seven Drow (who Cat thinks could tear threw the continent and destroy one of the more effective heroes we've seen without effort) would spend an afternoon in Arcadia and then decide that they should sign up for that slavery thing. Arcadia doesn't have Heavenly Light. Maybe there was an interaction with whatever Summer is now? Although that's a bit of a stretch, as they were dropped on the edge of Winter.

Stories are the law, there, and Cat is constantly aware of the stories she's spinning. Coupled with her human Free Will (TM) and it's a wonder she had any difficulty at all.

Arcadia is the perfect place for Cat to conquer because the relative power differentials between her and her foes don't matter when she can make a story to beat them. Mighty of the Everdark don't have that advantage. The story foisted upon them was of the displaced generals, tricked into imprisonment on a faraway and hostile world and beset on all sides by incomprehensible fiends.

Big assumption with nothing to back it.

Remember, the first time we met Drow was outside the Everdark, and they had no issue doing their Night tricks.

And then this chapter Cat is imaging what the Drow could do outside the Everdark, and she's very clearly imagining that they would have the power of the Night on their side. After months and months amonst the Drow, with Ivah to explain how Night works, you'd figure she would know.

Considering the Sve Noc didn't want/couldn't let any of her followers leave the Everdark, I assume that being in a different realm for them was stripping them of their purpose? Which may be why defeating Sve Noc is required for Cat to actually /get/ her army, and not just slaves who keep getting urges to go back into Everdark.

Or perhaps they were concerned about what happens to their home when they weren't around? Who knows. We don't have a POV from them, but something about not being able to return to the Everdark had them throwing their pride away. Combined with Cat's hypothesis that the bargain of duration is not a problem for the Drow, it builds a clearer picture, though still somewhat vague.

Not just throwing their pride away, but deciding that their vow to kill cat for what she'd done, and their utter disdain for the idea of signing away their free will and living under the threat of death in a slave-army pointed at the heart of the Everdark, which will then be used to enforce the Liesse Accords in what's presumably a fight against anyone and everyone on the continent.

All this in under a day.

(Also, just for the record, if the Drow's goal was to get back to the Everdark and remain there, signing oaths that give up all of their free will and involve protecting Callow seems like a very inefficient way to go about it)

And that's enough, rally, but let's keep going just for fun.

In 68 Cat mentions how the Drow are only bound by oaths and fear, which certainly sounds like a recipe for hate to me.

  It was a confederation of tribes, if anything, bound to me by oaths and fear
#+end_quote

This is reinforced when in 70 Cat says:

#+begin_quote
  Sure, odds were good that every single member of my Peerage -- even Ivah -- would turn on me in a heartbeat if their oaths allowed for it
#+end_quote

Which really just reinforces that the Drow are not really huge fans of her. Particularly no those she forcible enslaved.

  But a cohort of Drow entered Arcadia and started rethinking selling themselves into slavery not even 24 hours later? This does not seem like the Arcadia we saw in Books 1 through 3.
#+end_quote

I think you might just be forgetting some of the more impressive feats we saw from the fae nobility in book 3. Just off the top of my head, there was that one guy who lifted up most of a lake and turned it into levitating walls of water twenty feet high around the entirety of a port-

#+begin_quote
  There was a Count in there who had water sorcery, and the prick had been cautious enough so far we hadn't been able to reach him. When I'd gone to lead the charge he'd surrounded the entire port in a wall of water twenty feet high, and while I could have probably forced my way through that I was unwilling to exhaust myself on a second stringer.

  --------------

  Hierophant's arms were held up and shaking as he dealt with what looked like a small lake of levitating water. That was a lot bigger than I'd thought it would be.
#+end_quote

Or the Duchess of Restless Zephyr, who destroyed entire formations of soldiers and created localized earthquakes with a single blow, and had a cool desiccation power-

#+begin_quote
  I moved before the thought was finished, and that was the only reason I survived. The hem of my cloak was caught in the area where her power surged, and the cloth thinned and dried instantly. Considering the amount of water there was in my body, the thought of what would have happened to me if I hadn't moved was chilling.

  --------------

  I struck down with my sword and the ball of winds followed, smashing into her and detonating. Dry winds howled all around as the arm she brought up to shield herself was ground out of existence, her tall silhouette plummeting down like a gold of old had kicked her back down to Creation. My control over the winds was beginning to wane, and I hurriedly forced them down to follow the Duchess. She'd fallen in the back of the lines of golden fae, the ground heaving at the impact, and that was where the winds unleashed the fullness of their fury. Fae were scattered like insects, the hurricane my opponent had meant to destroy me with blooming life a flower in every direction.
#+end_quote

Or the Lady of Cracking Ice, with literally the lowest rank of fae title, still being able to make a guy just shatter without any visible projectile or spell-

#+begin_quote
  “Who are you to-“ the soldier began, before a fracture line ran along the length of his body.

  His eyes widened, then he fell into a shower of shards.

  “I am bored with this interlude,” the Lady of Cracking Ice said. “Shall we proceed?”
#+end_quote

Not to mention that fae travel in hunting parties of four or more, meaning that even if one of the Mighty might be a step or so above the average fae noble, he'd be facing down multiple peer-level opponents with abilities he's never seen before-

#+begin_quote
  About an hour in we ran into a hunting party. Not in the sense that they were hunting for us, but in the way that Callowan nobles hunted deer and rabbit. There were a dozen fae, all mounted on too-perfect white horses, but among those only four mattered. Two men and two women, colourfully dressed where the others were in drab blue-grey and armour. The nobles -- for I was relatively certain that was what they were -- immediately took the lead and diverted their party towards us.
#+end_quote

Personally, I don't think it's at all ridiculous that the Mighty would have a hard time in Arcadia, especially since there's no indication that they have any idea how to manipulate the narrative in their favor, which is a pretty huge disadvantage against these opponents.

I appreciate you grabbing quotes, but these examples really don't hold up against the Mighty. Urulan alone and in two minutes pulled out a list of powers that went something like this:

Dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode.

First off, I'm not sure why you're assuming that these Drow, who re full of Secrets, would be ignorant on the basic physics engine of the world. Stories are hardly obscure knowledge. Add to that that the drow actually know about the Fae and Arcadia, or the 'Splendid" and "the garden of the Splendid" as they call them.

Secondly, stories in Arcadia are the sort of thing you can fall into /accidentally/, and the Drow were given one hell of a set-up, after Cat went Classic Evil on them, with a monoluge about how inevitably they would become her minions, walking away from the trap she'd put them in, and them vowing that they would kill her for what they've done.

Well, not really? In both cases- Urulan didn't fight Cat to a standstill, he lost without even driving Cat to use her domain, despite having multiple advantages (centuries of experience, time to observe her before battle, two powerful rylleh) and Cat fighting significantly under even her current potential.

And secondly, Cat hasn't really pulled out any feats that are more impressive than a middling-tier fae noble yet. In terms of raw power, by far her most impressive feat so far was picking up half a lake to throw at the crusaders, but that was only while Akua (who has significantly more skill with manipulating magic and a greater ability to control herself through the effects of principle alienation, effectively giving her access to more power) was in control, and even then that only makes her roughly the equal of a single fae Count.

Cat, despite her theoretical power ceiling being very high, doesn't actually have access to most of that power, and isn't terribly skilled at using the power she /does/ have. Things will change after she has access to a full court of nobles to shunt her principle alienation off to, but right now I wouldn't rank Cat as much more dangerous than a fae Count or Duke.

Half the point of Arcadia is that it doesn't matter if you're Named or not. Everything /else/ still has to follow the script. This is without mentioning how Cat swept them up in her story.

And they're not heroes, sure, but this also doesn't matter? This was one of the first things we saw when entering Arcadia. Besides, plenty of villains have stories about vengeance, and those don't end with them immediately giving up at the first obstacle.

If the story has arbitrarily decided that it's going to be a narrative that sets Cat up to win without her having done anything to deserve it, then I take issue with that. Especially as this wouldn't have bee something built beforehand, but instead something happening behind the scenes without build up or warning to solve a major problem off-screen.

Yes, this is demonstrated when Ivah shows great confusion when Archer talks about the narrative, and how it has no familiarity with the Splendid. Oh wait

Also, it's common knowledge outside of the Named - there were laws created for the Legions of Terror telling them that they're not allowed to fight unwinnable battles. The main religious text of Calernia touches on Names and Roles. It's hardly some hidden knowledge.

And why would it matter if the knowledge was split up? These guys have an awful lot of Night.

#+begin_quote
  Hells, unless the Lone Swordsman had a very good story at his back Urulan would have torn through the poor fucker in an hour's work and gone for a drink afterwards.
#+end_quote

So Cat, back when she was still just the Squire with only two aspects to her name, beat a Winter Duke at the centre of his power using a shitty story. The Lone Swordsman, who was roughly comparable to Cat when she was this powerful, needed a very strong story to even stand a chance of winning against Urulan. It's pretty clear that Urulan is a more powerful figure than the Duke.

And the Duke was one of the biggest boys in town - a Duke is essentially the highest rank of nobility outside of royalty. This puts Urulan near the top of the Arcadia food-chain. There were seven Drow, all stronger than it. What was going to braek them in a day? Sure, the king/queen could have wiped the floor with it, assuming they were hanging out at the edge of winter and immediately jumped into a fight with them, but then the Mighty would have died, instead of signing themselves into slavery.

For added fun, Will survived running around Arcadia for six months while being hunted by the Wild Hunt. If we say that he was backed by a very good story (which makes sense, he had that pattern of three running in the background), that puts him as roughly comparable to Urulan (or, at least, at the point where Urulan doesn't "tear though him", but let's be generous), then any one of these Drow should by all rights have been fine. And there were seven of them. And they started accepting slavery in a day.

Fae power is extremely high, but balanced by the fact that they have to conform to the story, no matter how much of a fickle connection it is. Would someone like Urulan even be capable of thinking from the perspective, considering how he got to where he is?

Also Will had a lot of support and had an external story running, which meant that the Wild Hunt had really no way of killing him there. It was functional immortality and he abused it to get some harsh training in.

Stories are very much a part of Fae balance, so what Cat is implying is that Urulan could have killed Will even with the powerful story backing him, because he's a mortal, and only confined to stories on a small to medium level. And so, a bunch of more powerful than average people are stuck in Arcadia with no food, harsh weather and Fae surrounding them. Fae that are definitely trivial for them to defeat *IF* they even have a sliver of story backing.

The problem is, Cat can't really draw the full power of Winter without properly shunting it's influence on her mind. So it wasn't really as much Fae royal vs Mighty drow, than Fae royal able to use only a small amount of her power while underestimating her enemy.

"they'd only changed their minds after Mighty Orelik vanished without a trace. Sooner or later, those treading the domain of the fae were found by them"

It makes sense that the Fae are a whole new enemy for them, they haven't encountered their kind before, they don't know what Fae can do, they don't have their sigil with them, and they are in enemy territory without proper food shelter or backup, all of which were locked by Catherine. For a culture where survival and rising in power is prized above all, it would also be trivial to choose survival over the possibility of imminent death.

Now have the queen of winter, cat, feeling actively hostile towards the drow in her realm.

That's because Will would have to fight Urulan in Creation, where the story can be undermined by the earthly practicalities (like the acid dissolving him faster than he can Rise).

Also, keep in mind that the fae would have the number advantage and actual familiarity with their powers, both of which Cat lacks.

I don't think saying that Cat is weaker than the fae really holds water, when even unfamiliar with her power she's happy to call herself one of the "ten most danerous Named on Calernia's surface".

Do you think all but ten or so Named would be weak enough that entering Arcadia would be so mentally scaring that they decide to sign away their free will in a day?

Like it or not, Cat's one of the bigger fish in Arcadia now, and Urulan, who was weak and alone when compared to these seven, was someone who could give her a run for his money. There's not much that could have threatened him in Arcadia, let alone seven stronger versions of him. Let alone challenge seven stronger versions of him to the point where they decide to sign away their free will inside of a day.

And fae that are weaker than them would have (a) provided a meal that increased their power, and (b) offered a way out, assuming they could make gates.

In the sense that she would "have always had" the signet ring giving her a claim to the Duke's power, and the King's "promise" to empower her. It didn't actually give Catherine the title before she killed Auster, but it /did/ put her into situations where their powers could be matched (the duel without champions on the Duke's side vs. Urulan's rylleh blowing Cat up for half of the fight, the fae going into close quarters and allowing Cat to track him vs. the drow just spewing acid onto her general vicinity, generally gloating and temporizing vs. shutting down everything she was trying to set up). Duke of Violent Squalls had survived, if anything, more hits, but kept coming for the opponent fated to slay him, while Urulan made only one major mistake - approaching the "corpse" - but it killed it almost instantly.

If you want to see how fighting a fairy without a story actually looks like, go back to the Rider of the Host - who had been essentially wiping floor with Cat until she realized she has the narrative to turn the tables on him.

No, because one of the core qualities to a Named is will, and that matters in Arcadia.

This was one of the problems I had with skipping past everything to do with Lotow, actually: there are important details we can only guess at.

But if this is a temporary thing, it certainly makes it more palatable.

Although it still involves the Drow deciding to head back to the Everdark, for reasons, to fight in a slave army heading towards Sve Noc, who's perhaps worse than the Faerie monarchs and certainly a bigger fixture in their minds.

The fairies in this case also seemed to make a correct decision to not show up until they can isolate one of the intruders (though we don't actually know how that ended up, even if we know that drow don't have a good way to deal with glamour and flight).

#+begin_quote
  This is true, but being individually somewhat equivalent to the faerie queen who's one of the ten most dangerous people on Calernia is also important, in Arcadia and everywhere else.
#+end_quote

I wonder how accurate Cat's assessments actually are. Some of our low expectations of her come from her doing stuff like walking into a fight with an unknown opponent with only infinite regeneration to keep herself going, but then there's the fact that there seem to be either remote (horned lords, elves, giants, monsters in the Waning Woods and Brocelian forest, some god in Greywood that Akua couldn't manage to capture despite her entire dynasty living right next to it etc.) or subtle (the Wandering Bard, Grey Pilgrim, Tyrant of Helike) powerhouses spread all over the place. Catherine tends to take into account and prepare only for threats she saw deployed before. I fear this is going to end with an “and so Triumphant wept, for she ruled but a fraction of the world and knew it to be vast beyond her reckoning”.

  If your argument is that Urulan was actually unimpressive all along, then Cat disagreed with you in this very chapter.

No, my argument is that martial power isn't some kind of absolute parameter independent of the circumstances, and that it can be made irrelevant with right preparations for specific circumstances.

#+begin_quote
  If keeping their possessions was the goal, signing themselves into slavery did not accomplish it.
#+end_quote

Again, is this actually slavery? Yes, the tightness of the bindings makes that uncomfortably close, but they kept their sigils and right of command over them. What Catherine dictates is the manner of military response - evacuation instead of harvest and (presumably) long and bloody guerilla warfare. She's not asking oaths from the drow she doesn't give weapons potentially dangerous to herself - which, while still a dick move, is understandable to sigil-holders in question, and preferrable to being harvested by the other ones stuck with them or being ruined by those who took the deal, respectively.

  Yeah, that was what I was saying. And, more importantly, Cat knew she had a shot at victory, while the Duke only yelled in surprise when it turned out she can damage his armor.
#+end_quote

At which point he proceeded to lose the fight, and the capabilities he showed in losing were far below what a single sigil-holder, who was weaker than the seven trapped, demonstrated in a minute or two.

#+end_quote

And? You're pointing to that as an example of how fae should apparently auto-win against one of the strongest groups we've ever seen in this story, when the displayed capabilities were still leagues below what a single one of their lessors demonstrated.

#+begin_quote
  (though we don't actually know how that ended up, even if we know that drow don't have a good way to deal with glamour and flight).
#+end_quote

I'm going to disagree.. Urulan was momentarily inconvenienced by both of thse things, and then proceeded to continue kicking Cat's ass until he made one fatal mistake at the end.

It's also worth noting that the variety of powers Urulan alone showed off was far greater than just about any other character we've ever met. hell, in abot two minutes he pulled as many tricks or more than we've seen the fae collectivley use.

I'm also worried about power creep.

But his doesn't really matter, because we're comparing groups of things that are known. We have the Mighty, the Fae, and whole lot of heroes and mortal armies to compare them both to.

And the underlying point is that the Mighty are certainly not so far below the fae that we shouldn't question why the Mighty sell themselves into slavery after 24 hours.

That's a big yes. Hell, it's worse - I'd rather be a slave than be magically bound by 17 oaths which include, but are not limited to, terms like "do literally everything I say or instantly die".

***** Have you considered the story lost in Arcadia and eaten/enslaved vs lost in Arcadia and tricks thier way out?

Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean here.

You think the Drow's story was either them getting lost/eaten, or them tricking their way out?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The Drow's behaviour set we've seen involved them smacking /other/ people around.

The whole reason Cat needed an alternate plan to deal with Lotow was because of how good the Drow were at killing.

#+end_quote

Again, this isn't quite parsing for me. Milder version of what?

But calling them mild doesn't seem very true. There are 19 oaths which are pretty all encompassing and ultimately boil down to "obey everything Cat says or instantantly die". What part of that is mild?

Also worth noting, every time we've seen the Fae interact with Creation, it's involved the /Fae/ getting tangled up in their stories and losing because of it, and never the other way around. Stories represent a huge vulnerability to the Fae because, unlike everyone else, they are completely restricted by them.
