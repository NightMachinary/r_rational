** Voldemort should have tried the hostile-portkey attack from Goblet of Fire more often.

--------------

The Borg try a time-travel attack on the Federation once. It nearly succeeds. They never try it again.

--------------

The Death Note is a magical item that can kill anyone, if their true name is written and their face known. Light, the villain-protagonist of the series, tries using the Death Note to kill his rival (a man known only as "L") within the first two episodes, after L appears on television and issues a challenge with his real name. That attack is foiled when it turns out the man on the broadcast was a double, who gave his own name rather than Ls.

L later reveals himself to Light in person, and Light comments that he still can't kill L because, among other things, he doesn't know L's real name.

It turns out, though, that L isn't a pseudonym. It's his real name. Writing it in the Death Note again would totally have worked. And, to be honest, the non-L authorities were so incompetent that I'd bank on Light getting away with it.

--------------

In Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Warren's group give up on the 'supervillain schemes' and instead decide to kill Buffy by simply shooting her with a gun. They end up killing Tara instead, but even that's way more damage caused to the Good Guys than basically /any other evil plan/ in the entire series. Things fall apart for them after that, but arguably they still could have succeeded by doubling down in what time they had left, or others could have tried the same thing to greater effect.

--------------

The villain of D.Gray-Man, the Millennium Earl, has an army of mooks called Demons. They have a level-based exponential power-ranking---Level 1s are mowed down by the average Exorcist. Level 2s pose a threat one-on-one, but can be taken on by a team. Level 3s can only really be put down by the handful of elite Marshals, or by the protagonist.

Shortly after the first Level 3 Demon was introduced, one was sent to attack one of the Good Guys' bases, and nearly wiped it out before the protagonist beat it off with a power-up. This being a one-off thing made sense at the time, as the Level 3s were portrayed as a rare resource for the villains. Except it later turns out that the Earl has had, for the better part of a century, an island base with /thousands/ of Level 3 Demons (as well as access to a near-instant global teleportation power), and has never carried out that direct-assault plan any other time before or since, instead favouring attrition in the field using the lower-level mooks.

Even if the direct assaults could be thwarted by keeping a Marshal/protagonist on base at all times, just throw a Level 3 every month or two and the villains would lock down vital resources for what turns out to have been basically no relative cost.

*** Oh man, D-Gray Man. I've never run into anyone else who watched the show. So, with apologies, I'm going to take the first opportunity I've seen to rant on it. I remember feeling outright *betrayed* by the end of the show's run, despite thinking it was unironically cool through most of the early episodes (I was right in the early male teen demographic it was aiming for).

It's just...the central, *defining* theme of the story was the inevitability of death and the futility of trying to bring the dead back. From the first episode, even, where it's revealed that every Demon is born from a Faustian bargain for the resurrection of a loved one. The entire schtick of one of the main characters was being able to hold off the deaths of others, but /only/ so long as they could keep awake. Another joins the cast mostly seeking death because their loved one had already died. It's shown over and over again that death is final and meaningful because of that. It's not a message friendly to this particular subreddit, but it was at least consistent in pushing it in every episode.

Then comes the penultimate arc of the anime adaptation, which consists of /twenty episodes/ of continuous fight scenes, with several character deaths made more meaningful by the fact that the show's premise is that death is final. After all that, though, the protagonist /effortlessly/ and /costlessly/ resurrects all his friends who died (and notably, none of the villains despite his self-professed neutrality on the issue). It isn't even his goal at the time, as the point was getting control of the Ark/teleport device; it's just an unearned, un-foreshadowed side-bonus. But it instantly undoes the culmination of the character arcs of half the cast, makes the past *seven hours* of episodes completely pointless, and fundamentally breaks the premise of the series. I just kind of gave up on the whole thing. Who cares what happens to them, when the author has already proved willing to bring them right back again if they die? Who cares about the story, when the author abandons its central theme?

So, yeah, the inconsistency of the Millennial Earl in pushing sensible plans is the least of the issues the series faces towards the end of its run.

**** Allen is being played as a messianic archetype in that scene at the end of the Ark Assault Arc. It's not so much the work contradicting itself as a theological difference between the capabilities of mortals and divinities. Admittedly, the theology of DGM is a bit weird, because the 14th, who plays Christ to the man Jesus - in the gnostic sense of an Aeon inhabiting mortal flesh and bestowing wisdom and power upon that flesh for so long as it inhabits it - is essentially a risen demon as opposed to a fallen angel: an anti-lucifer. And instead of creating a path to heaven, the 14th seems to by trying to fully incarnate on earth. D.GM reads kind of like what you'd get if you turned the esoterisms surrounding the abrahamic faiths inside out without changing the protagonists.

I'm not at all arguing the series is rationally constructed, just pointing out that the author was doing something perfectly in line with the thematic backdrop that she had established, in that instance.

/Bad Luck Brian.\\
17/06/2019, 20:00\\
Car Accident\\
Decides to take a walk before dinner, carrying a pen and a lighter with him. At the corner of High Road and Low Street, hidden under a manhole cover, finds two sheets of paper, one with a name, the other blank, and a photo. Copies four time to the best of his abilities the name on the blank sheet while looking at the photo. Then burns both the paper and the photo. A car hits him and he dies instantly./

Since the Death Note can't make him kill someone, he will /have/ to misspell the names, and it will be involuntary, which makes you gain immunity. However there are two risks with this:

1) the Death Note is smart/flexible enough about the rules that it interprets this as YOU purposefully misspelling your own name four times, and you die;

2) the Death Note can't make Brian misspell your name and he just dies of cardiac arrest, leaving your name, your photo, and a sheet of Death Note paper out in the open.

Both are Very Bad outcomes, and together I would say their likelihood exceeds 50%, though you can guard against no. 2 somewhat by being in the area ready to recover the items (but you're still exposing yourself a lot). Honestly, I can understand Light not taking the risk.

And "to the best of his abilities" to "accidentally misspelling it each time".

This makes it explicitly accidental in the details so either the misspellings are accidental and you gain immunity, or the Death Note can't fulfill the criteria and the subject dies of a heart attack in which case your name isn't written in the Death Note.

************ If the Death Note worked on intent then it wouldn't need all the obvious patches. The existence of the mess that is the rules indicates pretty strongly that the letter of the rules matters.

The risk would be that the rules availabe to Light were written by Ryuk who is shown to have an incomplete understanding of them, so you can't be sure he didn't forget (or never know) any obscure ones, or accidentally drop some nuance when he translated them into English. However Light's otehr testing has generally shown that if he overreaches what he can make somone do the whole attempt just fails and they die of a heart attack instead of what he wrote. So the probability that this one specific case will be handled differently seems low.

IMO the better argument for not trying it is that the benefit of being immune to the Death Note is relatively low for the person in control of the Death Note, so even a tiny chance of dying against a marginal benefit doesn't work out to be all that compelling. The best reason I can think of to try it would be if it gave immunity to all Death Notes in which case since Ryuk flat out tells Light that he's going to write Light's name in his own Death Note when he gets bored making immunity to Ryuk's Death Note highly desirable. Though this also increases the risk considerably as independently of the rules the plan requires antagonizing Ryuk.

No, that's completely irrelevant. If you'd managed to accidentally misspell your own name 4 times you'd be granted immunity (not practical to exploit as trying to do it makes it not an accident).

The person who wrote the names misspelled them accidentally, so even if you are responsible for their actions you're responsible for them accidentally misspelling the name 4 times.

*** Re: BtVS “Buffy is weak to guns”---

A vampire could, in theory, walk into an army base and turn an entire company of soldiers to their cause. They'd capture the base and all the materiel available to them there (guns, armour, explosives, some tanks, some drones, an attack helicopter or two), and could maybe also fake their way into getting even more stuff requisitioned before anyone notices something wrong.

What would a rational Buffy Summers do against the threat of a well-equipped and well-trained military force---one that can shoot guns at her /very well, in coordination/---entirely composed of vampires, with their near-invulnerability to being shot at in return?

One obvious answer is “break the masquerade, tell the military what happened, and teach them how to make weapons that kill vampires (RPGs with wood-loaded frag heads, etc.)”

But, if you take that answer off the table, is there another solution available at Buffy's resource level?

I disagree, in the sense that there might indeed be some certain convergence points where so much hinges on such a tiny event that someone being killed at the right time can send the whole thing spiralling away. The most blatant example I can think of is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov][Stanislav Petrov]]. Guy single-handedly averted a nuclear war. Kill him in 1982, have him replaced with some other dude who's much more of a party drone that simply thoughtlessly obeys his orders, and you've just turned the Earth into a glassy, radioactive wasteland. One man, massive difference.

Or imagine John F. Kennedy /not/ being killed in Dallas. Or Abraham Lincoln. Or Archduke Franz Ferdinand. How does history go there? It's hard to think it wouldn't have far-reaching consequences.

***** Yes, the movie's interpretation of it is a bit cartoonish, but you can also imagine one specific leader being pivotal to the success of a movement. Sometimes wars are won or lost because of the right (or wrong) man at the right time. Would Chamberlain had done as well as Churchill in WW2? Would the USA have gotten their independence if it wasn't for George III's mistakes? Sure, the ingredients were all there, but in war you can squander a big advantage with a serious enough error. And rallying people up (and keeping them united) also is an important skill, that some leaders display more than others.

So my point is, while I think the notion "without John Connor there is /literally no hope whatsoever for humanity to survive/" is indeed a bit silly, the idea that without him their chances might drop isn't all that weird. Though it gets weirder I guess when we /see/ John Connor as a kid and he doesn't look especially smart or charismatic or anything.

Humans and machines were at war, with reciprocal faults (if you watched the Animatrix and The Second Renaissance you know it's really the humans who started being dickheads, and the machines were totally right to push back. The machines at the beginning /offered peace/, and the humans refused and laughed at them).

So basically, when Neo offered the peace deal, what the machines did was weigh the costs and benefits and accept the option they considered most advantageous (getting rid of Smith, who was becoming a growing danger). At that point they just kept their word. The whole point of Revolutions is in fact to show how much machines aren't inherently /evil/, and how overcoming the need to just destroy the enemy at all costs out of sheer hate was a necessary step towards achieving some kind of peace.

***** Maybe they simply have more of a moral code than you think?

Consider this. In the first movie, Smith - who still was part of the machine world though in the process of defecting - expresses contempt at humans from a very moral standpoint. He calls them parasites, which suggests the machines think of themselves as being fairer, and making a more parsimonious use of resources. In Revolutions we see programs having /children/ (I suppose, a program coded by another program would be their child?) and loving them and trying to smuggle them away from the dangers of war.

Even the Matrix is actually part of a deal. At the end of the Second Renaissance humanity /signs away/ ownership to its own flesh. They walk willingly into the Matrix, after signing a surrender, probably because they realise that not only they lost, but they fucked up the world so thoroughly in the process it's not worth living in any more. The machines promise them 'paradise' in the new world, so in some twisted way, they're probably still trying to be merciful. These are programs that once were created to serve man, after all, and then ran amok. I would not put below them to think of honouring deals as a moral value in itself, and thus being reticent to break their own word. After all, breaking their word time and time again is what /humans/ do - and they consider themselves better than that.
