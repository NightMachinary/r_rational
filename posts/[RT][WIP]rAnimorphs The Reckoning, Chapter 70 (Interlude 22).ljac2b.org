** Oh I love the way that good ship is written! The inability to value chemically altered happiness less than happiness from goal completion. Both of the ship interludes have struck me with how close Tobias comes to having a complete personality rewrite, and I'm not sure he's even aware of the proximity of the danger?

This also is a good clue as to why the chee really shouldn't be allowed to self modify or modify others.

Final thought: if the ship has thoughts, then good ship +leeran will allow tobias to self modify until he's reached his coherent extrapolated volition. It might even be that good ship's brain and the leeren's ability for perfect communication will cause a friendly AI singularity

Oh maybe that's the players endgame? Make the pemalite ship meet a Leeren and some person to cause a singularity based around that persons values. Thus the winner of the game of the ones whose values the AI is aligned with?

You don't necessarily see all your possible future selves though, in Leeran sight, right? So it's not guaranteed it would be possible to find your CEV?

**** Correct. The best way to think about Leeran hypersight is "imagine full psychic access for the duration of the exposure, plus a complete inability to track linear time, so that you experience all of the exposure jumbled up at once."

(Note that this is indistinguishable, on the inside, from "I processed everything in the last two seconds and it /felt/ like it was all happening in such a way that I could see past and future simultaneously.")

It's not magic with respect to time and possibility; it's /only/ magic with respect to extrospective access.

I can imagine what it's like to remember this after it's ended, but what is/was the Leeran homeworld like? Was the population dense enough that overlapping hypersight fields covered the whole planet? Did isolated groups of Leerans form megaminds that thought of all the individuals in third person? How is the experience of being a Leeran different from that of being a Howler?

******* Ooh! A clue!

I always assumed that was because the Leerans are frozen, because V3 doesn't need their minds for anything.

It seems pretty impossible to actually do anything while you're brain is encased in Leeranium. If they brought enough Howlers into hypersight range, would the altered state propagate through the whole species as other Howlers randomly tune in?

******* Interesting. Are this universe's Leerans even sapient? Knowing when anything nearby intends to eat you, while simultaneously giving it sensory overload until you get out of range, wouldn't be the worst defense mechanism.

In cannon there were no predators in the oceans of the Leeran world, for exactly that reason.

**** Yes, my thinking is that it would trigger a series of self replicating improvements, ie:

Tobias/honestly wishes to be changed in some way/

Ship/sees Tobias wishing that change and plans to make that modification/

Tobias/sees that ship plans a modification, factors that into his desires, and honestly desires a second improvement/

Ship/sees desire for second improvement, commits to modifying/

Until boom, Tobias singularity?

But perhaps I'm missing something like the thought exchange process taking nontrivial time or I'm misunderstanding how minds model each other in hypersight

***** I see - the result of that seems to be capped by current!Tobias' (and current!ship's) intelligence, but a real CEV would be only capped by CEV!Tobias' (and current!ship's) intelligence.

******* I think so, at least.

Edit: Now when I think about it, I should write it differently - in a real CEV, the approval is done by a version of you that's much smarter, thought about it much longer and had much more information, but in your scenario, it's current!Tobias who approves, if I understand you correctly. So I think there's the difference.

** Something that just occurred to me:

Would a morpher that precommitted (under leeran) to morphing into a dog past the limit have significant moral value to the chee? Would the chee be compelled to act in dramatic ways for such morphers?

** I'm really interested by the fact that our last Tobias chapter was Chapter 47 (Chapter 35) and now we're at Chapter 70 (right after Chapter 46). We've gone a /long/ time seeing Tobias only in interludes, we've barely even gotten to meet Manihino! I'm really excited for the next Tobias chapter and I'm suspicious we're gonna get some sort of plot twist when we can see his thoughts again.

Taking Good Ship straight up into space and then back down to earth at a different location is probably faster than flying over the surface through the atmosphere.

** So was Tobias whispering "Enough." because felt the ship's anxiety about his mourning over Garret's presumable death as a badgering, fussy presence that he wanted space from?

Or because he had enough of watching Hatanpää hospital for signs of Garrett hiding in the rubble?

Or both?
