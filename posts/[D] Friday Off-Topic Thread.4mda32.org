Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** What concept needs it's own word?

Here's some [[http://jisho.org/search/%E6%94%B9%E5%96%84%20%23sentences][example sentences]] with English translation. That being said, a loan word doesn't always have the same meaning in other languages.

******* Yeah. Comparison to "progressive" doesn't really work, because if you call someone "progressive" you usually mean that they hold liberal views, rather than that they're striving to better themselves. And obviously that comes with a lot of baggage, where most people will take it to mean "liberal".

I might just borrow from the Latin "profect" and use "profective", which would at least let me give my own definition.

I disagree. In context, for that strange little couple, the word 'eight' does mean "I'll love you forever." Would that get it included in a dictionary? Probably not. Things don't get included in a dictionary unless enough people use a word to mean something.

Again, words mean whatever people mean when they say them. What else could they possibly mean?

"The ambiguity only exists in English," is not a valid criticism, because I'm not trying to make a universal claim that apply to all languages that can express the concept of eight. I'm making a claim only about the English word "eight."

Yes, there is. If you're asking do I think "Eight" has a commonly accepted definition of "I will love you forever," the answer is no. If you're asking do I think that, in context, *it means I will love you forever," the answer is yes. And I think you agree with both of those things.

So really, all we're arguing about is which of those constitutes a "definition." To me, that isn't a very interesting discussion.

Let's start over , moving back to the original point. All words are context dependent.

The intended meaning of a sequence of letters (a word), /must/ depend on context, because that's how the accepted definition of a word changes. All words have changed, therefore all words are context dependent.

What word could exist that has never, and will never, change in meaning? There is no word that is so immutable that it could survive a hundred years of being used "incorrectly." If you agree with that, you must agree that the context of a word determines the meaning.

We can quibble over whether that context derived meaning is a "definition," or we can argue over how common that new context must be applied before it is a "definition," but those are just semantics.

**** I did a reverse search for 向上心, which has that meaning applied to oneself. Some derivative of "aspiration" or "to aspire" is the accompanying translation. From OED:

  *aspirational* /adjective/ having or characterised by aspirations to achieve social prestige and material success
#+end_quote

That doesn't have the meaning of "better" or "positive utility", though.

Your best bet is to reverse search "change for the better" or "progressive" or "strive for change" in other languages, then translate their in-language definitions back to English. Using "progressive" I found the French "évolutif", which based on [[http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-definition/%C3%A9volutif][this]] may indicate it's close to what you want, but based on [[http://www.wordreference.com/fren/%C3%A9volutif][this]] one would conclude otherwise.

*** We seriously need a word for "a purpose which isn't meant to achieve any higher purpose"- like the survival imperative, or love for another person, but also things like an aesthetic preference, or an addiction.

I feel like peoples' motivations are one of the most common and important topics of discussion, but the absence of a word like that can make those discussions very difficult. For example, if a purpose is just a means to an end, it's possible to use reason to convince a person to abandon it, but not if it isn't. That's a distinction that's important in everyday life, but unnecessarily difficult to communicate.

The lack of a word like that also prevents people from arguing over and forming consensuses about what are and aren't means to ends, which I think has contributed to us as a civilization having a very poor understanding of what we're all driven by.

Also, a word that describes when two things are correlated because they're caused by a third thing could be useful.

*** I don't know if that one has a concept word, but there are a variety of creative ways to insult someone who is getting aggressive at a perceived insult. "U mad bro?" is one of them, but there are several that work well in person (for certain values of "well"). This isn't usually a good idea though, since it won't improve the social move, and will in fact be a real insult, probably making the situation worse.

This doesn't stop people from doing it though. Accusations of people being "butthurt" when someone responds to an insult are common amongst teenagers and young adults. Same with "don't get your panties in a bunch," which is both insulting /and/ dismissive (and sexist!). I've definitely seen people laugh off perceived insults because of things like these, but yeah, probably not what you're looking for.

***** Hmm, I personally don't like doing that. I dislike doing anything that makes me seem like an oblivious or non-savvy person. How I respond to someone thinking I insulted them varies a lot (since this rarely happens to me), but if I think someone is being overly aggressive, respond in a way that makes it clear it was not meant as an insult. If it's not someone I know, especially if it's a man, I usually act dismissive and make a joke at their expense. Alternatively, I offer an insincere apology and smooth things over. If it's a close friend, I make a legitimate effort to smooth things over, but it's not something that happens often.

Really, it depends on the case, but I don't make a habit of backing down, looking oblivious, or submitting when people challenge me aggressively and claim I've insulted them. I try to either retaliate immediately or explain it was a misunderstanding. I've never had something become a physical fight or anything like that, so this seems to work--for my personality and social circle, at least.

This kind of thing is pretty rare, though, so it's not something I think about much. My acquaintances rarely respond aggressively when they are insulted, and we already trade insults as part of humor, so it's not normal to escalate after being insulted.

Normally, it's fairly obvious that it's a ruse, but the aggressive person can't call you on it without being more obviously aggressive, which costs a ton of social points, sometimes enough to expel them from the group.

Most people are rational enough to not risk that on a passing insult, and as for the people who aren't, it's generally worth the fight to expel the person from the group. For me, it's not worth dealing with a continually aggressive person.

***** Yeah this is my default social tactic when someone is acting more aggressive than is needed.

If someone is really socially oblivious, and ignores that obvious deescalation because they don't understand it (as opposed to ignoring it on purpose) then sometimes you need to take them aside and explain explicitly what they've done wrong.

If someone is really itching for a fight, you either become aggressive back, and hope they're bluffing (unblinking eye contact helps), or submit tacitly and hope the rest of the group doesn't like the other person enough to include them in the future.

Intro to information theory, one-way algorithms, and quantum physics was great when bored in high school - I played a lot with the Venegiere cipher.

*** I guess if I have to choose, I would take good English and a Mary Sue over competent plotting and bad English, though it sort of depends on what we're talking about. Generally speaking, bad English will stop me every paragraph or two before I can move on to the next thing, while a flawed story will only stop me when something particularly egregious happens (or will make me dislike it when I'm done).

I guess in movie equivalents, it's like choosing between a well-oiled Hollywood wish fulfillment extravaganza, or a thoughtful low budget movie with bad audio mixing and cheap-looking special effects. The former is watchable but disappointing, while the latter probably makes me so uncomfortable that I won't finish it.

After I first read /Background Pony/, years ago, I was actually rather worried at the thought that it might replace /Time Braid/ as my favorite story--both because it was based on /Friendship Is Magic/ (which I only barely liked, as opposed to /Naruto/, which I liked /a lot/), but also because it was mostly a tear-jerking drama (rather than a blood-pumping, awe-inspiring adventure, as /Time Braid/ is). Was I shifting into the personality of a stereotypical "brony"? Was I becoming a boring person who would prefer Hercule Poirot to Yagami Light and Miss Marple to Dagny Taggart? Neither of these was a fate that I wanted.

Conveniently, however, all these worries vanished after my second reading of /Background Pony/, which firmly placed it in the number-two position. Later on, other stories reassured me that a person could still enjoy both drama and adventure without having to choose between the two.

However, I don't like the feel, texture, and experience of eating oranges, while I quite like those qualities of apples. So therefore, I will usually eat apples instead of oranges if presented with a choice of fruits - again assuming roughly equal qualities like freshness etc.

They say it is vitally important that I choose to "get out of the car" without being influenced as to what that entails, otherwise my experience will be colored by their statements and therefore limited.

Oddly enough, I think I've already done it. It's when I got back in the car and listened to some very intelligent people explain why it was impossible to know that anything exists outside the car because every scientific test of outside phenomena has failed to detect anything outside that I began to doubt whether I'd ever left the car at all.

Then suddenly, I couldn't get back out of the car. I couldn't feel the connection to the world beyond the windshield I had loved, or hear the ones I'd met outside anymore. I eventually convinced myself that my disbelief was doing more harm than good and was able to leave the car again, but my skepticism keeps trapping me in.

I started this conversation because I have been unable to reconcile my scientist side and spiritualist side. Each time I think they've arrived at an agreement they end up back in conflict because I cannot purge myself of doubt even though I believe both to be true.

#+begin_quote
  It isn't possible to produce an accurate map of a city while sitting in your living room with your eyes closed, thinking pleasant thoughts about what you wish the city was like.
#+end_quote

Let's say you have a certain piece of map that is able to give certain benefits to you --- namely, it is able to serve as a rather effective coping mechanism and stress reliever. To keep this map in your possession, however, you have to restrict yourself from going into that area of real territory and comparing there how closely your special map-piece represents that landscape.

Will the rational choice to make be checking the real territory no matter what, just for the sake of scepticism? Or scepticism itself serves a purpose for you, and the choice should be made after comparing pros and cons of all possible stances?

Right now, as I understand it, your potentially-inaccurate map has the following markings on it: 1. “there exists at least some afterlife”, 2. “there exist at least some intelligent and friendly sophonts in the afterlife”, 3. “at least in some cases communication between our world and afterlife is possible”.

So the comparison between not-checking and checking the map's accuracy breaks down into at least the following PROs and CONs:

Not checking

- + powerful coping mechanism \ stress reliever
- - information about reality that has a high chance of being inaccurate

  - - risk of being manipulated by others through the beliefs you hold
  - - making important life choices based on high-importance (top-consideration) assumptions that are potentially inaccurate
  - - risk of gradually acquiring a blind-sided worldview which will hinder deep-level understanding of how reality works

Checking

- - coping mechanism likely diminishing in effectiveness or being lost altogether
- + ability to determine just how accurate the piece of map was

  - + /[opposite of the above-listed]/

Furthermore, the (+) coping mechanism could likely either be replaced with others (using CBT, as an example), or just preserved through some mental work.

******** Your reasoning is impeccable, but I've already tried that. When I realized that certain parts of my map were inaccurate (pseudoscience that supported my spiritual beliefs), I reexamined the territory more closely only to find the implication that experiences important to my way of living had never occurred. The most logical course of action was to become an materialist atheist, but I have found that path impossible to follow and attempting to do so caused me nothing but depression.

In The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, the author theorizes and presents some compelling, though not conclusive, evidence that religious belief may have a genetic component. Given my utter failure at being happy while believing in materialist atheism I am inclined to believe as well that atheists lack the genetics for "religious experience". As a result, they gain no psychological benefit from religious practice and have difficulty comprehending why anyone would.

When I ceased to believe my map was accurate, I felt a void within myself that I had never felt before. The only way I could fill the void was by convincing myself that the really important parts of my map were still accurate, it was just the unimportant parts surrounding them that I'd been wrong about.

Well, if what you're looking for is faith \ religion for their own sake, then shouldn't it automatically become unnecessary trying to prove their validity? In other words, if in both cases --- of your beliefs a) being true and b) not being true --- you'd've to make yourself believe that they were true lest you became depressed, then shouldn't finding out how true they really are be pointless? Your end-goal is preserving your beliefs in either case, so you can just decide for yourself to keep believing, with no proofs necessary \ required.

#+begin_quote
  I must find a new way.
#+end_quote

You could also try experimenting with this “religious instinct”, trying to find which patterns of thought activate \ satisfy it, etc. This could potentially help you devise your own toolset for achieving that “religious experience”. Simple, yet working religious system that is intentionally maximally isolated from aspects of the material world could maybe help keeping the positive effects of both bullet-lists.

p.s. If your standing assumption is that:

#+begin_quote
  atheists lack the genetics for "religious experience". As a result, they gain no psychological benefit from religious practice and have difficulty comprehending why anyone would.

then perhaps you could ask for additional advice from places like [[/r/exchristian]] /(just as an example --- I don't know how good that particular sub-comunity actually is)/. If there are people who were non-forced believers before who managed to become atheists without sacrificing their happiness, then your worsened psychological state should've had other explanations than you being intrinsically religious.

I started exploring New Age spiritualism out of a desire to gain spiritual enlightenment and understand the Truth about topics like God, the afterlife, and supernatural phenomena. I did not follow my beliefs for their own sake, but because I believed they were the path to Truth. I chose to become a student of science for the same reason.

I reached the point where I was happy and motivated to keep working, but then I discovered the skeptic community. Suddenly, science threatened many of my beliefs and I listened because I love science as much as spirituality. I had to know if I was right to believe what I did, but with my newfound skepticism I found it impossible to know if anything I believed was right. I told myself that my memories were not false, but I still doubt myself and fear losing my faith and the good things that came with it.

My faith gave me a sense of empowerment in life and harmony with the world, while rationality taught me to feel disempowered in the face of the chaos surrounding me so I could change it. They were able to coexist for the longest time, until I realized my faith was not and could not be accepted by rationality because the only part of it that really existed was my subjective experience, which I should distrust to avoid bias.

Yeah particularly because it may lead to falling for the placebo effect or similar mistakes. Maybe there's a way to set an experiment so it can be measured, like having a rational researcher measure the effects on the brain of the practicioner while he projects or meditates.

I think it'd be a cool experiment.

** I have been reading the Berserk manga this week, and am about halfway through it. It's not rationalist, and the MC's main advantages appear to be the power to fight on with pulverized organs and the ability to wield a 600 pound 'sword' that is bigger than he is. Even so, it's one of my favourite pieces of fiction ever, and I recommend it to anyone who has ever enjoyed dark fiction. The world is grim dark, humanity's place in the food chain sucks, and despite that there is a lot of room left for humans being human. At least for the 80 chapter long 'flashback' or whatever that is. It's looking like there will be a lot fewer main characters and a lot more monsters from now on though.

But. I have learned something very important for my own writing from it. And it's not something awesome to be replicated. It's something a very skilled author did that turned out to be a major mistake which I will work to avoid in my own writing. There is a 'controversial' 'lost' chapter that the author retconned and banned from being reprinted. The scans I'm reading included it, so I didn't realize it was retconned until later. The reason the author doesn't want people to read it is because it sort of pulls the curtain away and reveals the wizard. Or more precisely, [[#s][All the biggest spoilers of Berserk all in one place]]. I'm still enjoying this story very, very much, but I've been pondering for years how much of the hidden 'true' plot to reveal in my own world, and after reading Berserk, I think it's convinced me to leave a lot of things unsaid and uncertain until as late as possible. It's one thing to /think/ [[#s][HPMOR example because everyone here has already read it]], it's another thing entirely to have it spelled out explicitly less than halfway through the story.

** For fans of time loop stories, like /Time Braid/ and /Mother of Learning/, may I suggest a currently airing anime, Re:Zero? The premise is that the MC is suddenly transported to an alternate fantasy world, and then through the natural consequence of being a baseline human in such a world, dies shortly after. He than loops back the beginning, and, well, shit happens.

The biggest thing I like about this story is how seriously it takes the mental trauma associated with looping. Zorian from MoL doesn't really have that many bad deaths, the only really bad one I can remember is right after the Aranea massacre, where he took a restart off to get his head back in the game. On the other hand, one of the first deaths the MC from Re;Zero experiences is a slow, painful death from disembowelment that lasted hours. The anime does a great job showing the mental trauma that will accumulate from these types of painful deaths.

As to whether the show is rational or not, is up for debate. The MC isn't a genius, which can be said for most anime MCs, but he's in way over his head and under a great deal of mental strain so I think he can be forgiven. He does display a fair amount of insight and level-headiness when the situation demands for it. There hasn't been that much worldbuilding to declare if the world is coherent or not.

The animation, music, voice acting, everything is top notch. There's going to be 25 episodes so far, but I won't be surprised if the studio decides to adapt the rest of the story, given how popular it's been lately.

I think those first two episodes led me to expect that it was going to be some kind of a deconstruction like /Madoka/ was for magical girls, but it's really not that, it only has a few trappings of being a deconstruction.

He's a simple, happy-go-lucky guy. Which is the /completely wrong kind of protagonist/ to stumble into a violent time-loop story.

He overcompensates, and /tries/ to be a playboy or shounen hero or caricature of himself when he thinks he must. But it's not sustainable, and cracks appear more and more frequently in the facade. I think he's actually quite a believable character.

It's about one of those virtual reality games, in the same vein as SAO, but without the 'you die here, you die for real' aspect. The main character, username Weed, spends a year training in swordplay, martial arts, and the like before entering into the game itself, so he's playing with a much better understanding of combat than most other players. Combine that with a complete willingness to grind all day every day and you get an overpowered character. The real bullshit comes in with his class. Not only does he obtain a secret class from an ancient emperor, but he also gets a bullshit sword style from the emperor's legacy. This class is sort of like a DnD mage, in that it starts off weak, lacking in the bonus to chosen weapon damage that other melee and archery classes would have and being unable to cast spells, but ends up growing to insane levels via it's ability to master all general skills such as cooking, smithing, tailoring, repairing and, in particular, sculpting. Sculpting is the main aspect, as his strongest skills depend on it for bonus damage, but reaching each milestone in any of the other general skills gives stat points that could only be obtained by levelling up or grinding for points a la The Gamer.

Anyway, I'm rambling here but the point is that it's a good read. It's not what I'd call rational, but it's well translated and a fun time. I'm under a third of the way into the amount of material that's currently been translated, though, so I'm expecting some major power ups to occur.

** This week I binge watched/read a really fucked up anime/manga called [[http://myanimelist.net/manga/18597/Sankarea][Sankarea]]. It starts as an ecchi romcom that later develops into a really interesting romance-drama and that I'm thinking could be easily tweaked into a rational story with Transhuman elements.

Its about a zombie obsessed guy that finds a formula to create undead in his basement and in a fit of hubris decides to try it to bring his dead cat back to life. In his quest for undead creation he befriends Rea, a girl with a really fucked up family that in typical anime fashion doesn't find his "hobbies" weird and decides to help him with his little experiment.

After certain complications that include Rea stealing some of the apparently failed formula and her attempt at commiting suicide with it, they discover the last experiment was successful and ends up bringing the cat back to un-life and turning Rea into a zombie.

The story follows the protagonist's attempts to keep Rea and the cat from decomposing and finding a way to completely bring them back to life.

The zombies are really interesting as they retain their memories, personality and rationality unlike more traditional "rage zombies" but with time start losing sectors of their brain that make them confuse love and lust with huger. They are perfectly capable of planning and premeditated action in the first stages of the zombie state, just changing their goals towards eating those closest to them without even realizing it which makes them more dangerous than typical zombies.

I think it could make a great rational story about a protagonist attempting to perfect the cure for death. Ironically the grandfather with senile dementia that only acts as exposition and comic relief in the anime is closer to our rational protagonists and has a bigger role in the manga as he [[#s][Sankarea]].

I found it oddly inspiring and would like to expand on that premise once my schedule's more free.

The anime has nice music and animations, particularly the camera angles are really good in a SHAFT like fashion but the manga is way better with a bigger focus on the reanimation process, the state of zombies and going way waaay darker in later issues as Rea's condition worsens while the anime only covers the first arc and takes a more Slice of Life/Romance focus.

**** Yeah its not a rational work, hence why I posted it here. I think it has potential to be one due to the subjects it deals with and I'm thinking of trying to make a fanfic of it once I'm more free.

  All of their problems, from the rom-com to the zombie biology mysteries, could be solved if the characters would just talk to each other already.
#+end_quote

I'd contend with this part though. The romantic rivals solved their issues rather fast and they don't let the drama drag for too long with the exception of the zombie issues which don't have a clear cut solution.

And the grandfather that has the answers isn't in position to explain due to his dementia.

Which chapter did you reach?

***** Chapter 14. Getting around the plot-device dementia ought to have been the protagonist's driving goal from the moment he discovered the grandfather's connection to the book. And then the scientist shows up, she's sane (mad-scientist theatrics aside), and if nothing else she might be open to trade.

But instead the major characters do the [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][other kind of Hollywood Zombie]] thing. They just carry on with their routine lives as if nothing had changed, waiting for solutions to drift into their lap or for the next crisis. (While the minor characters just take everything in stride, full NPC mode.)

This is starting to sound harsher than I mean it. It's nothing out of the ordinary for mangas.

 

edit: huh. Chapter 15-16 made huge progress on getting characters to talk to each other. I wish the whole manga was on that level.

****** No probs actually I like it because it could be good inspiration for the rational fic.

Yeah now that makes me wonder if we're just too used to low quality works or its just a cultural thing that makes them resort to the same plot devices.

In addition its nice to have someone to discuss the anime and manga with given that its fairly obscure. When it aired it had to compete with other works like Fate/Zero and Hyouka which made it even harder for it to be recognized.

Glad you enjoyed that part. It starts picking up from that volume which is where the anime left off. Overall it has its ups and downs.

Also if you don't mind the spoiler, this becomes a plot point later.

** Something I thought I'd ask a community who's opinion I respect.

So, a friend of mine asked me to be her Dominate a few weeks ago. It's a fairly novel experiance as it's outside anything I've done before and not something I had really even concidered. I've done some research on the subject so I'm not completely out of my element any more.

I've pretty much just been ordering her to do things that are good for her or things she'd like to do anyways but for some reason or another hasn't. (So far, we've gotten her eating well and actually getting her vitamins and minerals. Daily excersise, and I've had her pick up a few physical hobbies so it's not a chore. I've also made her start reading various rational fic to ease her in to rational thinking.)

Punishments have pretty much just been used to reinforce the positive behaviors or for her fun. (Outside of a few things that disgust me, I've really got no personal preferance on such activities.)

It's interesting having someone that listens to everything you tell them to do and then watch them improve as by outsourcing their directions you wind up skipping over a lot of issues that crop up in self direction.

However, I was in discussion with a friend of mine the other day and she suggested that Dom / sub arrangements can never be healthy because even asides from the type of people they tend to attracr, even the "best" of them still encourage an unhealthy dependence and that any positive progress the sub makes is rooted in the Dom.

I disagree, as I feel that positive neural patterns can be built over time that will last even if the relationship winds up not.

Thoughts?

*** Yup, I've been banned from a few, though I have trouble remembering their names and nothing of value was lost. Some mods like to ban based on what opinions you express, no matter how calm, reasonable, and well-sourced you are. Some will even ban pre-emptively, without you setting foot in the subreddit. (It's not like ban evasion takes effort either.)

*** I've been autobanned from some just for commenting on [[/r/tumblrinaction]] back in the day. Other than that, I got banned from [[/r/askreddit]] once because someone said they didn't believe in NSFW tags and I replied to a link to Blue Waffles, and once from [[/r/politics]] for calling someone a shill after they posted 196 pro Hillary comments in one day.
