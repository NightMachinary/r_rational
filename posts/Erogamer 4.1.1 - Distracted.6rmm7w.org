** There's a math equation that was put into part 4.1.2 as a puzzle meant for the members of [[/r/rational]].

We must solve it!

Here's a [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=graph+1+-+(1%2F(1%2B+(e%5E(ln(X%2F(1-X))+%2B+((2Y)%2F(pi%2Be))+))))][link]] to where I made a 3D graph of the equation in Wolfram Alpha for anyone who wants to see it.

** Having Eliezer solve this may count as cheating, but as anyone in stats or ML would recognize:

Is there any particular reason why you're talking about yourself in third-person, Eliezer?

**** It indicates that I'm referring to Eliezer as a kind of object or role in the larger world rather than as my agent-that-is-this-agent. In this case, the perhaps-problem is that something that sounds like it was meant for typical wandering readers of [[/r/rational]] is being solved by someone with a special role relative to [[/r/rational]]. Like, okay the founder knows stats and already knows how to interpret a logistic function, but perhaps that is not what was to be tested.
