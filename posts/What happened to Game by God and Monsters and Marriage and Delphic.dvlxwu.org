I recall the writers being prepped to write more, and maybe taking a short planned break, then nothing.

For Delphic, [[/u/9adam4]] was plotting out the next arc, then poof.

For Game by God, its website vanished and I can't seem to find the threads for it anymore. The user seems to be deleted.

For Monsters and Marriage, [[/u/formerlysarsaparilla]] seems to have been gone from reddit after a planned release on October 1st.


** Sludge Preformation is, as far as I know, ended. Judging by its meta-narrative and writing style, there was a chance the author was pulling one on us and the story could actually continue, but that doesn't seem to be the case since the author deleted their profile and the website shut down. A shame because it was one of the few well-written fiction in its particular genre.

I have a backup of that story if anyone's interested. I could PM you. I got it from someone on one of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s previous weekly threads. I don't know if it's right to just freely distribute it, but since there is no word from the author yet I think it's a fair game.

*** a brief history of Korridor:

- /Game By God/ was about a web serial writer who competes in a /Danganronpa/-style murder-mystery elimination game. It was put on hiatus a couple of chapters into its third arc because the author thought it was too ambitious
- /Ship Poster/ was about a virtuoso violinist hired to play for a luxury cruise ship that rich people go on to live out their final days. About two-dozen chapters were released in total before the story was also put on hiatus for reasons I won't repeat here (they were given in a blog post titled "You Fooled Me Once")
- /Serial Infringement/ had a really cool twist on a superhero premise, but only one chapter was released before the site (and the author's various accounts) went offline

of the three serials, /Game By God/ was the one most relevant to this sub, with the other two kinda shaking off the pretence of rational storytelling and becoming more surreal. They were all loosely connected by a broader meta-narrative, with the author posting meta interstitials in the gaps between stories

this all kinda paints a grim picture, but these stories were genuinely really great on a chapter-to-chapter basis, even to the point where I'd say they're still worth reading (we have archived copies of all the text, although you're losing out on the comments and other pages from the site, which were a big part of the experience at the time) despite their abrupt endings. At the time there was a fair bit of intrigue surrounding the site as the writing was good enough that a lot of people were convinced that it was all being done by an established author here. Whether they were or not, I personally figure they'll probably be back at some point with another new and weird thing

**** I had only read Game By God after it was finished. I thought it was in-serialization when I peaked in to the Table of Contents. Imagine my feelings when I found out it actually ended on 3.02. I liked the meta-narrative. Meta-narrative is so easy to fuck up and hard to do it tastefully. My only nitpick is that 'wildbow almost becomes a minor character' in that story.

I'm yet to read the other two but I have a backup of them so I'll get around to it someday. Sounds interesting.

Thanks so much.

**** I'm not sure, but your comment sounds like you made off line copies of the stories.

I have a copy of Game by God, but not of the other two. Is there any chance I could have a copy of Ship Poster and Serial Infringement?

Thanks.

***** we-ell, turns out it's a little more complicated than I thought. A few users in [[https://discordapp.com/invite/Ha3FUvP][Alexander Wales' Discord server]] put together various backups of stuff (search *from:150445824587988992* *has:file* there to find the most comprehensive one), but I don't really think they're complete and their presentation is pretty damn far from how they looked on the site. We did actually archive Serial Infringement when it came out (minus a single teaser post IIRC), so you can view the surviving pages [[https://archive.is/korridor.rip][here]]. A few of us had subscribed via email to the site and so still have all the posts sitting around in our inboxes, but they obviously exclude any corrections which were made after posting and so aren't really a great source from which to reconstruct the stories

the precedent is that every time the site returned after being taken offline, all the old posts were made accessible once more, so I expect (well, hope) that that'll be the case if the site comes back again

****** Thanks! I downloaded all three copies right next to each other, so I'll have to check through them, but better too many copies than too little!

*** It's a fiction that works best read close to the time. More like an AR experience. You'd be checking comments and titles ad you read it in a very meta way

Still I'm glad it was archived
