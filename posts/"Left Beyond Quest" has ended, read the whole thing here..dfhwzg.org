So, what happens if we put the canonically-hypercompetent government telecom repairmen in evangelical best seller "Left Behind" under the control of a bunch of 4channers?

They watch the Rapture happen, XCOM the Tribulation, and give God and Satan a run for their cryptocurrency.

** Great, now someone just needs to turn it into a cohesive story on an easily readable page, like with chapters, designed for webnovels and such, then I'll read it.

****** I read some of it, but it's hard to continue since you it's not in an epub.

Definitely let us know when it's in an epub. From what I remember, it was pretty cool, except I'd like it better in a story form.

**** Hey mate, could you make into an ePub as well? Love reading stuff on my phone but PDFs are annoying to read on a small screen.

All right. Which should I believe: the title of your post, or the name of the website?

** I found this page a couple of months ago I just took all the archived pages and glommed the HTML together. With calibre to do the conversion it works surprisingly well.

although if you wanted to make an into an actual novel just take everything GeistKlempner says and put that together.

Personally I think it's more entertaining to read it in quest form.

*** The left behind books? No, they're hot garbage.

There's a book "Antichrist handbook" about how bad the first book is. The author goes practically line-by-line, detailing exactly /why/ they suck so hard.
