Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** In a fantasy VRMMO how do you motivate players to stay in character? Not necessarily play a specific role but at least not do blatantly non-fantasy things like discussing the latest action movie or arguing about sports teams.

- The goal is to sell subscription to an "immersive" game mode, where the target audience wants to experience life in a decently realistic fantasy world while they beat dungeons and farm monsters for epic loot.\\
- There are weak AI systems available that can understand human speech almost as good as a human.
- Players can earn money playing the game, potentially even make a living.

My idea is that every day you "stay in character" as determined by a weak AI watcher you get a 1% bonus to all your actions, applied after all other modifications. Damage, quality of crafted items, movement speed, almost everything. This bonus caps at +20%.

Going "out of character" resets your bonus to 0% and you have to stay in character for 20 days to reach +20% again.

This makes having full bonus necessary to compete in almost any area.

Obviously malicious or repeated offenses results in your character being permanently transferred to a non-immersion PvP server, and you are permanently banned from immersive servers.

Would this be enough?

*** Having an accepted social convention for switching into out of character works in real life. Like MMO RP servers with a /ooc command, or covering your name tag when LARPing. It's a combination of having a social pressure to demonstrate that you fit in, with an actual release valve for doing the thing you want to do (because people do want to talk out of character sometimes).

Not sure what your actual goal is, but you might be able to achieve it with special effects on the /ooc command. Like you only ever talk out of character inside a Cone Of Silence spell.

**** I want to have a company that amongst its full dive VRMMORPG products offer an "immersive" subscription, where you play the game and also get the experience of (sort of) actually living in a fantasy world.

A certain type of people will join those servers and try to ruin the immersion of other players for their own amusement. It's like a natural law of humanity.

I want to find a way to make it plausible that such incidents are rare enough that they need not come up in the story.

I was thinking that if you get removed from the server for egregrious immersion breaking, and lose a valuable buff for casual immersion breaking, there could emerge a server wide culture that adheres to the immersion rules.

You can always go out of the game and hang out in any number of virtual environments if you want to talk sports or real world politics.

Throw in long standing cultural pressure to make a clear divide between the two worlds and all you have to do is make a vague allusion to things and let your reader's cultural osmosis of everything from Robocop to Mad Max fill in the blanks.

*** It seems like you're trying to go for the carrot over the stick, but this ends up being the stick anyway. Losing a 20% all-around buff that takes three weeks to get back is severe. Players wouldn't see it as a bonus, but a standard thing to have that can be taken away if they screw up. And players are going to screw up, you can't expect perfect role-play from anyone. Groups having to cancel raid night because your healer accidently talked to their friend about a new movie sounds awful. More importantly, living in constant fear of screwing up and calling down the wrath of the AI doesn't sound fun, even with a community that signed up for hardcore immersion.

That's not quite a deal breaker if the server and the community in it are extremely serious about immersion. But I think there's a way to do it that would ruffle less feathers. I would have breaking character put some kind of nasty debuff on you that only lasts for a very short time, maybe a minute (severity of the debuff and duration can increase or decrease based on severity). If you do it again relatively close to the first infraction, the debuff duration and severity grows exponentially for every infraction until the AI just kicks you.

If you do it that way, minor infractions can just be a slap on the wrist and a reminder that players need to take immersion seriously. Players can mess up and break character, take their lumps and move on. A player who constantly triggers that reaction but ducks the threshold for a perma-ban gets a reputation for it and would find themselves having a hard time getting into serious parties.

**** Adding to this, I'd make the debuf be something like Stark Raving mad, causing the character to move randomly, do humiliating things, and babble nonsense syllables.

I'd also set up some combination of prediction and variable delay, couple with the debuf having an ambiguous startup period, in order to be able to have the AI cut to it a few seconds or so /before/ the actual offense, and decide in a sneaky retroactive way if it was an actual offense or not, in a plausibly deniable way.

Finally, I'd give players an option they can flip between at will, that delays their speech further, and lets the AI do slight rewordings and replace isolated non-immersive terms. With this switch on you have to worry a lot less about accidental slip ups, but obviously the delay on communications is not acceptable in fast paced combat situations, and some would have highly specific ideas for how their character talks or issues with free speech/will, so it'd need to be an option.

Simple, inconvenient, and proportional. That's how you want a penalty to be.

You can multiply the freeze time for people who break character repeatedly. But as long as the AI can spot OOC on the fly, the "freeze" will be enough to stop any ongoing conversation that's OOC.

People who want OOC will find even a mild penalty enough to go to a non-immersive server.

What matters isn't the size of the penalty, but its speed and consistency in application. If your AI is good enough for real-time intervention you shouldn't need more than a nuisance penalty to push OOC players to another server.

** WARNING: long ramble on time travel mechanics

Is there any conceivable justification for the existence of cool laboratories for your characters to explore in a setting where information can be created via closed time loops*? Assume the people/organizations funding said labs have full access to whatever time travel technology exists in this world and can send information and possibly objects and even people into the past.

It seems like the logical consequence of access to such technology would be that at long as the people/organizations were fully committed to (and financially/physically/politically/etc. capable of) funding the research, they could simply send the results back to themselves before they actually expended any of their resources to build and staff the labs.

One idea I've been considering is that the labs primarily exist to analyze data and objects received from the past, but there's no good reason not to just send the results of this analysis back into the past as well.

One possibility is that sending things through time is an inherently lossy process. Objects come out looking like they spent a decade+ exposed to the elements, information gets completely garbled. These labs act like reverse archaeologists, attempting to decipher the ruins of the future.

The problem: I need my setting to allow for at least some small number of time travelers and I don't want them to end up as mangled corpses the first time they attempt to go through time.

This means some humans need to be able to violate these time travel rules.

This means employing these humans as inter-temporal couriers would circumvent a big chunk of the limitations I just imposed.

Maybe not enough to be fatal to the concept though. They can only carry as much data as they can memorize, so unless they have a perfect photographic memory, they can't recreate an entire physics paper they observed from the future. Lets assume that only a small subset of humans can become time travelers (the rest get treated like any other information and come out a pile of mangled meat and bones), so you can't just send your best scientist to share their insights with their past self**.

Primarily, they would serve as guides, informing researchers of what paths ended up being fruitful and which appeared to be dead ends.

Maybe you'll get one or two brilliant scientists who are /also/ time-travel compatible that will go on to completely dominate their fields, but in most cases you'll need to rely on third parties. I guess couriers could specialize in different subjects though, so you could at least get a time-traveler with a PHDs in astrophysics to convey the crucial parts of your paper on black holes.

*or alternatively, information sent from alternative future branches, although I'm leaning away from branching timelines since dealing with multiple time-travelers whose paths cross multiple times in such a world is a major pain.

**Which brings us to some of the thornier metaphysical questions concerning time loops. I've been discussing the necessarily prerequisites for closed time loops as if it there were some sort of "prior" state in which the loop did not yet exist, but from the POV of any characters in such a world, the time loops would have always been there. Either your future self sends you their research (and you in turn send it back to your past self after arriving at the same point in the future) and the loop exists or they didn't and nothing you can do will create such a loop.

I guess your options here mostly boil down to:

1) A viewpoint character /can/ create a loop by interacting with their past self in a novel way, after which...

1-A) They vanish, often from the physical universe in which your story takes place, but sometimes simply as the focus of the narrative (in cases where the old timeline continues to "exist" in some sense but is no longer relevant to the main story) .

I'll also include "all their memories are overwritten, effectively making them a different person" in this category. This is the fate of most non-viewpoint characters in any time travel story in which the past can be changed. In the context of a closed time loop, this means that the version of yourself who initially triggered the loop no longer exists. This a clean solution, but while its easy enough to switch perspectives to the version of the character for whom the loop always existed, your readers are now left with a gap where this version's personal history diverged from that of the original. You could say that everything else played out in exactly the same way, which may be a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel][necessary weasel]] in many stories, but it still tends to strain my suspension of disbelief.

1-B) Their memories are updated to reflect the changes they made while also keeping their old memories intact. Often this memory retention is only partial and requires some emotional/mental catalyst to access.

This one is fine if the interactions with their past self are fairly minor (ex: highlighting a certain passage in a book), but it gets hard to wrap your mind around once self interactions become more complex. Say you have a character decide to sit down and have a conversation with their past self in a world with a single, changeable timeline. Do they suddenly remember being ~20 years younger, sitting across the table, and hearing every word they now speak the moment the word leaves their mouth? Even if the older version's memories only update after they choose to say something, certainly this younger version will now approach the conversation differently, when they find themselves in the opposite chair. Basically, its nearly impossible to depict /unstable/ time loops in fiction. It's a case of endless recursion. Stable loops work okay, but having characters arbitrarily take certain actions or say certain things for the sake of creating/maintaining a stable loop gets old quickly. Probably best to keep characters away from their past/future selves as much as possible.

1-C) They persist completely unchanged, either because they simply created a new branch in the timeline or because their memory is somehow unaffected (in which case, the world around them may still have changed).

Only really makes sense in the context of a branching timeline despite being extremely common in works of fiction featuring single timelines.

2) A viewpoint character cannot create a novel closed time loop, only complete ones that have already been (partially) observed.

It's probably simpler to just forbid time loops that violate past observations, but this requires some sort of enforcement mechanism which will often feel contrived. It's not like the observation part should actually matter. If a tree fell in a forest a decade ago, the fact that no one heard it fall shouldn't have any effect on whether it's possible to go back in time and prevent it from falling. If you can't go back and kill Hitler, you shouldn't be able to go back and kill Hitler just because you were raised in a bunker in which you were never exposed to any information about WWII.

*** There's a much easier solution: You can send back research from the future with perfect fidelity as much as you want, but you still HAVE to actually do that research at some point in the future, including building labs and running experiments. Either something physically prevents you from not building or running the lab, or the moment you change your mind about building the lab the information that was sent back and anything that relies on it stops working/is destroyed.

For how time travel works in general; my favorite by far is that there can never be two timelines interacting, they all seem like they internally consistent only closed loops allowed model, you cannot change the future. But the way the universe does this is equivalent to the algorithm where you list every potential timeline, as a sequence of snapshots of possible configurations in a random order, then you remove the ones that are inconsistent or break the laws of physics or are inconsistent from the list, and those were never real. So you're enforcing ALL laws of physics in the culling stage, checking if a data structure is a valid solution to the question, and there is no chronological element or any special rules for laws related to time travel.

*** It would depend on how you defined time travel in your universe.

Since time travel is impossible in the world as we understand it. You can kinda just pick whatever set if rules as you like them.

Theoretically you only need to make one time machine as you couls have it in place it could be in all positions in space time at once.

So if you assume time travel works by moving throught a fifth dimention which contains our three dimentions in a way we can't understand then that works.

See the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov self-consistency principle]]. From the perspective of all observers, anyone traveling backwards in time will not do so to change the past but because they were always going to do so, and have already done so.

Suppose you go back in time to prevent Dahlman's mother from meeting his father as a child. Now Dahlman doesn't exist and current-you has no reason to go back in time, so you don't go back, Dahlman rises to power again, and you again decide to go back. It turns into an almost infinite cycle, but it's still an unstable cycle. However, any small random variation between each iteration could eventually stabilize the cycle and create a consistent outcome. For example, maybe you decide to write your younger self a letter saying what Dahlman does if he's allowed to live and rise to power, and how you can and must prevent that from happening. From the outside of the time loop, after you've gone back in time, the only observed outcome will be the result of the stable and self-consistent time loop where Dahlman doesn't exist and you reliably prevent him from coming into existence each time you go back.

*** Simple solution.

You need to actually /check/ the data from the time traveller before you send it to the past. If you don't check it, but simply send it to the past exactly as you received it, then the data you get is essentially random.

So, you don't need as /large/ a lab as you would need without time travel - you only need to /verify/ the experimental results, not generate them yourself - but you would still need a lab capable of doing the verification. (And you also need to actually send back the results, so that they /can/ be verified; if you don't eventually send them back, then history will change such that you never received them in the first place).

**** So, basically you can still get credit on answers you got from the back of the book as long as you're capable of showing the work necessary to reach them?

Suppose you set up an experiment in which you have thousands of people tasked with completing standardized tests and sending whatever answers they get back in time to themselves. If we assume that it's guaranteed that they'll be able to send the information back (ex: only people who have already sent the answers back are selected to move on the the actual experiment), all of them should be presented with the answers their future self got as soon as they start the test.

Now you designate one group to simply sit there for an hour and then sends the same information back, another to attempt to validate the answers for an hour and then send the exact same information back, and finally, one to send an improved version of the answers back (not only should they have more time to devote to the harder problems, they should also be able to catch many of the mistakes their future self made).

If the model you are proposing holds for this world, the first group should end up with answers that are essentially random (I find this outcome kind of unintuitive, it feels like it would make more sense to just not send anything back). The second should end up with results comparable to what they would be able to accomplish in normal circumstances (making these loops practically useless), and (assuming iterative loops are permitted) the third's results should be comparable to what they could accomplish if they had virtually unlimited time (and no issues with fatigue, since each iteration is passing the baton after an hour).

If iterative loops are permitted by the universe, utilizing them should be the norm in just about every field (with the resources necessary to create them). All creative/intellectual output should be optimal given the initial parameters.

This is kind of hard to write though. Any character with access to time travel would never really need to come up with any solutions themselves because they would have already come up with the optimal solution over the course of countless previous iterations. If we only observe stable time loops, we only observe optimal solutions. If we choose to observe the actual work being done, we're observing time loops that have not yet stabilized and will therefore be immediately overwritten (or branch into irrelevance).

set of instructions handed to them.

My main issue is one of perspective. I'm trying to develop a semi-coherent time travel system for a game, which means I need to take player freedom of action into account. I want to allow the player to jump back in time and make different decisions (AKA: save states), but this definitely isn't compatible with a single unchanging timeline since it has alternative timelines influencing the past. Branching timelines would be the easy answer, but

Every loop I introduce and force the player to complete is going to take away their autonomy. There are a limited number of ways by which a player can set up their own loops (such as summoning a future version of themselves to help them by making a strong precommitment and then immedatley going back in time to become this future version).

***** Hmmm. I think that it goes a little further than that; how much this type of time travel helps, depends on the problem that you're solving.

Consider for example, the following question:

I''ve multiplied two five-digit primes to get the product 625916291. What are the two primes?

Now, in order to figure this out, you're going to need to try dividing this number by various five-digit primes and seeing when you get an exact divisor. It will take... /quite/ a while, probably, because there are a lot of 5-digit primes. But, if you can use the time machine to tell yourself that one of the primes is 41041, then you can verify that (and find the other prime) a /whole/ lot more quickly and with a /whole/ lot less trouble - even though it would have taken you ages to find that without the message to yourself from the future.

So that's an example of a problem that's /easier/ to solve under this theory of time travel than without the time travel.

--------------

Now, let's consider your three groups. The first group don't even open the test books and just send back random information - they /get/ random information.

The second group attempts to validate answers and then - sends the information through whether validated or not? Then they're also going to get random information. (If they only send back the information that they have validated, then they will get mostly correct information - that doesn't mean that their information is correct, that just means that it /passed validation/, so if they make an error in the validation, then some incorrect information will slip through. It's at this point that they find prime-factorisation problems very straightforward to solve).

The third group attempts to improve the answer? Then... they'll receive information that is the best answer that /they/ can provide. That doesn't mean that what they get is the optimal solution. It just means that what they get is good enough that /they/ can think of nothing better (someone who makes the mistake of transposing a digit when verifying their long division might still send back the wrong information). But it does mean that, in an hour, they get the advantage of an answer that they might have given after /several/ hour's contemplation.

A stable time loop does not mean an optimal solution. It means that you have a solution that is good enough that, /at the end of the loop/, the time traveller /thinks/ it is optimal. A time traveller who is an idiot could easily end up with a massively suboptimal solution. A time traveller who fails to notice an important detail which is about to come back and bite them (but only /after/ they sent the info back) will also accept a suboptimal solution. And a time traveller who relies too much on notes from his future self (to the point where he's stopped questioning them) is /going/ to get burned by essentially random plans.

Ah. /This/ will make things difficult. (I thought perhaps you were thinking in terms of a book). Having players capable of pulling this sort of thing will cause you to run into problems. (Inevitably, but with a good system you can at least have fun going there...)

Hmmm. For a game, I'd suggest leaving the time-travel influences in two major categories: firstly, a player may precommit to a plan that involves (at some point) travel to the past. In this case, at the point at which the player may travel /to/, his future self can turn up. And the second category, is for purposes of foreshadowing; something along the lines of a badly injured future self appears, delivers a dire (but slightly cryptic) warning ("Don't trust... the third pikeman...") and dies in his past self's arms - that sort of thing. Someone who makes it clear that he's warning them away from a future that they do /not/ want to get to, causing the players to try to dodge it... (and /then/ once they resolve that, they have to also resolve the question of how to send a copy of this message back in time without dying in the past - perhaps using clones, or really good acting skills to fake their own death). Either way... the first option is entirely up to the players. And the second option should not be overused.
