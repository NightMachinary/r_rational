** [[https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Aspire-NVIDIA-Windows-F5-573G-56CG/dp/B01F5LWTX4][This one]] looks nice. Seems like it should be able to handle some games.

** You haven't really defined what you want in a laptop. Being able to run modern games just means that it has a good video card. Is this a laptop you want to keep for a few years? Should it be light so that it isnt a pain to carry around all day? Should it have a good battery life? Do you care about having an SSD or not? Budget isn't a huge issue, but roughly what price range do you consider too high? Do you want a really good processor or lots of RAM? Do you want a screen with good colors or a high refresh rate?

I'm not saying you need to answer every question, but as you have it now the obvious answer is a link to a laptop with whatever the laptop version of the GTX 1080 is, and I doubt that would satisfy you.

First, specify what you want in a laptop a bit more. Second, ask a sub other than this one, something like [[/r/buildapc][r/buildapc]], because this is a sub about literature, and largely fan fiction. Not about computers.

*** I want to keep the laptop for at least three years. I don't care about weight, but it shouldn't be larger than a foot. Battery life isn't particularly important since outlets are so plentiful at the university, even in classrooms. SSDs are cool but I'd do without if it's significantly cheaper. $1000 is probably the upper limit. As for choosing between processor and RAM, I didn't think those traded against each other, but just on price. Probably processor over RAM. Colors over refresh rate.

**** Yes, this is more useful information. I don't know much about buying laptops, so I can't really help you in choosing one, but this is the sort of information you should present up front when asking. Oh, and I didn't mean "processor or RAM" as in either or but not both, I just meant do you want either of them. Same for the screen.

Also, $1000 is really low to say that you don't care about the cost. $1000 will get you a good laptop, but not top of the line or anything.
