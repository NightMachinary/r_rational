  Teleportation. Yes, and absorption.
#+end_quote

Your "leaving" body disappears into nothing, leaving a vacuum. Your "arriving" body is transmuted from the nearest bodyweight-worth of matter, meaning that you arrive in a spherical vacuum, and are instantly hit by the in-rushing air. You need a protective suit and precise targeting to avoid killing people or injuring yourself whenever you teleport.

#+begin_quote
  Illusions. Yes, but isolation.
#+end_quote

Interacting with any person negates your illusion powers, for a length of time dependent on how meaningful the interaction was. Handing a cashier payment will depower you for minutes, a job interview will depower you for hours, and going on a date will depower you for days.

#+begin_quote
  Cloning. Yes, but crowds.
#+end_quote

You can be at most 1/10 of a crowd. If it is you plus 17 other people, you can't clone yourself at all (because 2/19 > 1/10). If there are 18-26 people, you can create one clone of yourself (2/20 to 2/28 <= 1/10). If you are in a crowd of 9999 other people, you can make 1110 clones (1111/11110 = 1/10)

#+begin_quote
  Precognition. Yes, and fear.
#+end_quote

This would be a granted power instead of a personal one. When you touch someone, you /automatically/ give them a precognitive vision of the next disaster that would befall them (if their actions wouldn't have been altered). In addition to granting the vision, you /can/ also give them a more-or-less specific phobia of that thing. Someone would be trapped in a collapsed building in a few years? Bam, claustrophobic. Someone would be bit by a black widow in a few months? Bam, arachnophobic.

This might actually be a cool answer to the question of what happens when you try to teleport into an object. Instead of just not being able to, or having [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Am7oKBD3PU][other complications]], you absorb the intersecting material for use as ... ammunition?

***** Yeah. Telematt (that's his name) starts every fight by teleporting down into the ground and absorbing stone in order to give himself a shell of armor. Or he teleports into the support beams of whatever structure he's in so that he can bring it to the ground. Or uses the absorbed matter in order to throw up a shield if he can't teleport. I don't know, there's a lot to work with. When he's done with a battle, the area around him looks like Swiss cheese.

**** Perhaps instead, when they teleport they absorb anything they've touched into their body, a little like The Fly. The first time they teleported they appeared naked as they had absorbed their clothes and now their skin was cloth-like, their feet rubber and leather.

They end up this patchwork, composite figure; their body a mosaic of different textures and materials. They can't carry equipment as guns and melee weapons are absorbed into them. If this were Worm, they'd look a little like Weld; definitely a case 53. If they don't jump then the soles of their feet absorb the material they were standing on, leaving rough footprint shapes behind. The absorption also grants a limited regeneration effect as the new material is used to replace the damaged skin.

They've never teleported with a person; they don't dare. Being grappled terrifies them, so they teleport rapidly and fight with hit and run attacks. The lack of ranged attacks frustrates them but their mild 'shaker' ability to damage terrain allows them to take advantage of their surroundings: absorbing parts of objects so that they fall, weakening floors, damaging sensitive equipment.

A powerful, flexible teleport and a durable, strong body; yet massively cursed too. Fun :)

** Benefits of consecutive yes-ands probably level off after the first thousand or so.

As someone who has done a bit of improv, the best use of "yes, and" I know is for when multiple people have cool ideas that they really want to use, and rather than fighting for whose cool ideas get used, everyone takes the coolest bits of their ideas and yes-ands them together. "Yes, we're going shopping for guns with silly names, and also you have this giant booger hanging out of your nose and I'm trying to be painfully polite about it." This is only a tiny slice of ways to combine concepts, and also only a tiny slice of grammatical uses of "yes, and."

The "I asked you for cough syrup and you came back with a zebra?" line is another good use of saying yes, where the speaker is riffing off the person with the zebra. They didn't come in with the cool idea of needing some cough syrup, it just seemed like a funny place the story could go. This is not yes-and as combining ideas of different origins, it's yes-and as generating apposite ideas to continue what others have started.

One can try to apply these to superpowers. The first "yes, and" would be more like how Sanderson smushed a couple of different ideas for magic systems into Mistborn, or how one might build superheroes with multiple gimmicks out of a bucket of individual gimmicks that you think are cool. "Yes, our protagonist rides a zebra (riding a zebra = cool), and they also can make the zebra they ride super big and strong (making things big and strong = cool), and the zebra can breathe fire (breathing fire = cool)." The second "yes, and" would be calling on your creativity to fill in what creates character, or conflict, or comedy, in concordance with the current creation. "We need someone to be super-strong. Yes, so how about they can only use their super-strength while wearing elegant clothing, and if the clothing gets ruined they lose their powers? Yes, and let's make them totally messy when off the clock."

The prompts from your generator generate results that look more like the results of the second process, because the first part of the prompt is usually cool, and the second part is usually dramatic. But the skills exercised are sort of a mish-mash. If it turns out well, I'm more inclined to attribute it to using yes-and skills /on/ the prompt, rather than putting "yes, and" /in/ the prompt.

Power to travel in any arbitrary temporal direction. Inability to do so automatically. Subject to the contraint of non-replacement - the user's conciousness travels, not their body. So, the user still experiences time flowing, but for them to flow though time, they must remember to swim. If they stop concentrating on moving from one second to the next, they won't. If they don't focus on keeping the pace steady, it will slow down or speed up. If they want a certain outcome, they might just subconciously travel towards it. They are everywhere they are, and everywhen they live. As a consequence of that sovereigntity, everyone and everything else is dead. The limits of who those other people can become is no longer what they strive for; merely the time traveller's creativity. The world is a pattern that can - will - one day be fully extrapolated, and once explored, it will offer nothing more.

Only a series of blind alleys and deaths leading to a time when the world is alive once more, and only - /only/ - because down those paths, the time traveller is dead, and therefore cannot observe it.

:\\
*Head Trip - Emotional Manipulation, and movement*\\
You can generate bursts of emotion in others, the intensity of these bursts increases based on the difference in relative speed between you. If both of you are standing still it's barely noticable, if you're traveling at high speed relative to them it's hugely powerful.\\
*Press Gang - Summoning, but crowds*\\
When in physical contact with someone you can use your power to cause them to trade places with one of your minions, these minions take the form of burly humanoid figures loyal only to you. The target of your power remains suspended unhurt in a pocket dimension until such time as you choose to dismiss your minion or said minion is destroyed. The target returns to the same location and in the same physical state it left in.\\
*Tag Along - Telekinesis, but velocity*\\
You have telekinetic control over yourself and one object, you can only move yourself when also moving your target object and you cannot move the two individually.\\
*Stonefish - Earth manipulation and metabolism*\\
Your geokinesis lets you raise walls of earth, launch stone spikes and swim through stone, your biology is uniquely adapted to this and indeed rather than food your body needs stone for nourishment.\\
*Dwarf Star - regeneration but mass*\\
You can regenerate from any wound, literally anything up to and including decapitation and anti tank rounds to the face. Problem is you don't have access to wolverine's meat dimension, most cuts or abrasions don't cost much but a big wound will trim a few inches off your height.\\
*Bug Zapper - electric manipulation but isolation*\\
You have an always on electrical charge running through your body, you can vary the intensity up to lethal levels and with a push extend the range up to ten feet however you can never lower the intensity on contact below the level of discomfort for anyone touching you.\\
*Jump Scare - portals and fear*\\
You instinctively know the location of anyone who is experiencing fear and can teleport to them. Your power's range is tied to the intensity of fear felt, mild worry can get you across the room, Outright screaming terror will get you across the city. Fear of you personally can be detected at a far greater range.\\
*Lead Belly - Regeneration, and theft*\\

You can make unlimited clones! But you get the real-time sensory inputs of all of them at once, plus your own. Or, on a more positive note, you can spin them off into their own lives and re-absorb them later, integrating their memories.

Or maybe the longer you stay in a form, the more it affects your mental state and sense of identity?

Could mean: Earth is manipulated via using thermodynamic currents; constant active manipulation of earth is required for the power user's body to warm itself; only the heat of Earth can be manipulated. The rest have similar meanings - the advantage of a string of prepostitions is one can take the most interesting and run with it.

** Worm is a very emotional story. It starts with Taylor trying to escape a life of bullying by becoming a superhero. It ends with Taylor bullying her enemy to death as a superhero.

Burnscar was the embodiment of an insane pyromaniac. The more she controlled her environment through fire the more powerful she was, the more she could escape problems and throw others into fire. But, she became increasingly insane and unhinged the more she burnt things down.

Battery was a police detective's daughter, one who believed that crime had consequences and who was trying to counteract another villain who controlled kinetic motion. Her power lets her charge up her powers to give herself great speed, electromagnetic powers, strength, in return for herself paying the consequences. And in the end, her mastery of the consequences means that she has to live her life close to the villain whom she got her powers to stop. And face the consequences of allying with cauldron.

Yes and is great for novice improv people, but it so often goes very wrong. At a basic level it works to knit the awesome ideas that two people have together, but it often goes poorly.

Sanderson's notes why limitations tend to be more interesting than new powers- because they add to the human element and make the person more interesting as a person to others.

Now, onto the weaknesses of yes and.

For a start, you don't have to say yes. This is a common error people make. Someone ties themselves up on a mock railway, cries "Free me, you scoundrel!". Do you have to free them? No, what you have to do is consider the emotional context of what they said, they are a helpless damsel who has been tied up by you, a scoundrel, and react accordingly, perhaps by doing a mad laugh and looming over them and announcing your plan.

This shows the big problem of a lot of yes ands. A person says something in a certain tone, in a certain position, with a certain facial expression, moving in a particular direction, using particular props. Your reaction should depend on all of them, but very often most of those are lost and one or two ideas you care about are kept while you continue with your thing.

I've seen this a lot in the sort of stories people write- they focus on creating some new and slightly different power but don't think much of the very human element of why people should actually care about your characters or be interested in them. They don't think about how it would actually look and how people would imagine it. They don't focus on how it would feel to the character and those around them.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upEBdKFGlPg]]

This is a comedy sketch. Notice the conflict in it.

A man sees a note in the rain and he wants to get it. He tries to get it with his umbrella, fails, tries to yank it out, fails. He tries to push the car away, fails. He then reads his newspaper for a bit and looks for the driver. He sits down at a nearby cafe, orders some tea. He watches with interest as various people walk by and almost but don't pick it up. Then he sees the driver return, and gets up... along with everyone else in the store, who apparently were also waiting for the note.

A good story has tension. One of the most powerful story elements is when someone has a strong point of view which they keep through a story till some great and terrible event relieves the tension. Limitations work better to foster that, generally. Saying no to certain things works to foster that. That's an advanced lesson for comedy students. Everything that's said has to go into your inventory, yes, but a lot of the drama comes from opposing viewpoints that people hold onto stubbornly, from people not being able to act and do things till something relieves the pressure. If you want more than constant absurdity you need to learn when to say no.

Yes, and ... this would have to be the subject for a different blog post. I agree with you about Worm being an emotional story and I think one of the things it did well was to link people to their powers in ways that went beyond the surface.

I'm just taking one piece of a story and examining it in isolation. I also think that there are a lot of people who just enjoy the powers of Worm by themselves rather than the characters those powers are tied to; I see that a fair amount on the [[/r/Parahumans]] subreddit.

You might make the argument that people wouldn't care about the powers if they didn't find the characters compelling, but I'm not sure that's true either. If it is true, then most people seem to be blind to what it is that they really like (which isn't a hypothesis I'm willing to entirely discard, but I find it suspect).

At any rate, this isn't about characters, or about why they're compelling, or even about whether to contrast or complement powers with characters, or use powers as a source of tension. This is just about making powers /by themselves/ interesting through add complexity.

**** You're somewhat evading my point through saying I was implying that people can't find powers interesting. I never actually said anything like "People wouldn't care about the powers if they didn't find the characters compelling."

Yes, some transient enjoyment can certainly come out thinking about powers for certain personality types, and rating and classifying the nuances of each power. It doesn't tend to last long, but it certainly appeals to the sort of personality who likes making small snippets of worldbuilding and moving on.

For longer stories people care less about individual powers. The appeal sharply falls off. They like comparing powers, seeing them in odd situations, and seeing new interactions and applications. Some stories try the DBZ/ Naruto approach with continual new powers and increasing escalation, which sometimes works.

However, that's unrelated to my actual point. My point was that you were taking poor lessons from the sources you found. You didn't take the lesson from Sanderson that more visual powers work better. You didn't take the lesson from Sanderson and Worm that limitations add emotional subtext. You didn't note the common weakness of yes and, that it leads to escalating absurdity (dbz style) and the value of context.

Sanderson spelled it out fairly clearly in his essay. You may agree or disagree with that, but he was fairly clear. In ignoring those points you are making powers, by themselves, less interesting. You're misusing a beginner lesson from improv in a way that often encourages rather poor stories.

You may agree or disagree with this point, but this point shouldn't be discarded- major authors think they're important reasons why magical powers are more interesting, beyond simple complexity. If you want to try out a new system, the value of visual and emotional components to powers should be considered as well, I feel.

***** It's not that I don't take those lessons, it's that I'm not looking at them right now. This is a post about complexity in magic systems; there's no reason for me to bring anything emotional or character-driven into it, because that's a different part of the master equation.

And I do (halfway) disagree with Sanderson. He says that limitations are good because they force struggle, increase tension, and add depth, which is all true. He explicitly says that complexity is not the point of the limitations though. In my opinion, he's missing part of the underlying principle; complexity is only good when it's emergent. Costs and limitations tend to give emergent complexity, but they're not the only thing that does that.

Take Sanderson's /Alloy of Law/. The primary character, Wax Landrium, has two abilities; one is to increase or decrease his weight, while the other is to push metal away from him. My argument is that this is more compelling and more interesting than him only having /one/ of those abilities, and the reason is that the interaction of these two things adds a pleasing, emergent complexity.

This is as in contrast to a character like Superman, who has two powers like flight and super-strength which provides additional complexity but not /emergent/ complexity. Or (as Sanderson says) having magic require a talisman that every character has all the time and isn't relevant to the plot.

So ... yes, powers should be emotionally resonant or dissonant, or otherwise compel the drama in interesting ways. Powers should be amenable to description within the text. But I consider that orthogonal to the point that I was trying to make and I don't think that this perspective /precludes/ either of those things in the slightest.

Which is an obvious issue to your replies. I am noting things and they are unimportant to you, so you are tackling more interesting points to you that I didn't make. It's not very useful. Why talk to me if you don't want to address my arguments?

Powers are inherently emotional and character driven, and work better when visual. Part of making a good power is considering the factors that make it work well, just as say, part of building a good car is about considering how humans interact with it. Maybe it would be more efficient without seats, but, humans. In Worm and Sanderson's works the powers are inherently connected to emotions and characters due to Shards and Entities.

A better generator might have something like "Sound manipulation. Yes, and charging, yes and surprise, yes and stripes." So, perhaps a sound alteration power that condensed sounds into stripes of higher and lower intensity, drawing streams into points which can be charged up and released in a burst against enemies. They can be stealthy and surprise enemies with bursts of sound. You can easily imagine a sensory result of someone being surprised with a burst of static, or stepping from silence to a suddenly intense stripe of sound.

  Above all, remember the point of this. It is not to simply be more complex. It is to force you, as a writer, to create better stories.

  He explicitly says that complexity is not the point of the limitations though. In my opinion, he's missing part of the underlying principle;
#+end_quote

You're misquoting him. He's saying that complexity isn't in and of itself the purpose, writing good stories is the purpose. He's noting that your values shouldn't be "Increase complexity" they should be "Increase story quality" with emergent complexity, if necessary. So you shouldn't judge your generator by "How well have I generated emergent complexity" you should judge it by "How well does my character work in a story." Emergent complexity can certainly worsen a story too.

Sanderson didn't write or care about the number of abilities- he explicitly noted as good lots of magic systems with lots of elements that worked well.

#+begin_quote
  Every magic has basic limitations, defined simply as the limited scope of the power. If magical glasses can let you see a mile, then the limitation is that they don't let you see farther than that.
#+end_quote

He has no issue with magic systems that have a limitation like "We just control glass and sound". Or "We can just teleport and use local telekinesis after we teleport" That's a non point to him, just a boundary. His point is more that your power will make a good story or not based on how well or poorly it interacts with the world and characters and your actual plot. Your current system precludes this in consideration of power generation.

I suggested a modification above to consider these in power generation- add an emotion and a visual effect. It's a practical criticism.

Please, if you reply, try to address my argument, not another unrelated one.

And why I disagree with them-

Emotion is part of the equation of power. Part of Burnscar's power is that it makes her insane. Part of Wax's power is that it causes him to want to preserve things. Better stories take emotion of powers into account.

Visual and auditory effects are part of the equation of power. Powers need to interact with other things and will make sounds and colours when they do. Better stories take visuals of powers into account.

The goodness is in writing good stories. Complexity, emergent complexity, and simplicity are all good. In Mistborn say, some people have all the powers, some people have some, some people have none. Emergent complexity on its own isn't a good terminal goal.

If you continue to mischaracterize me as saying "Emotions are entirely unconnected to powers and visual effects are and alexanderwales is wrong because he's not modelling that." Then, of course, you can continue to refute me, but I've never actually said anything like that. I'm saying emotions and visual effects=powers.

******* I don't quite understand how you're relating emotion to power. It appeared you were arguing for power-derived emotions being a necessary component for interesting, powered characters, e.g. Burnscar's insanity, Taylor's need for control, Grue's emotional distance, and Imp's need for attention. But your above reply implies it's the emotions each power inspires in others; I can think of disorientation and nausea for Vista, and perhaps temporal confusion for Clockblocker, but I don't quite understand how those feelings would pique reader interest.

I asked about Tattletale because I don't think her confidence is a necessary component of her power, nor do I think she has much of a visual effect. Thus I would disagree that emotions and visual effects are the essential building blocks of interesting powered characters. I would rather argue that to make interesting powered characters, one must as an author consider how each power might influence the personality and emotional state of their characters, given each character's background. Consideration regarding how visual effects of power use affect other characters is an issue unrelated to making interesting powered characters; it's more so a unique element of superpowered worlds that authors need to keep in mind during character interaction.

However, I may be misunderstanding your point; that's why I began with the questions.

Not really, I never said anything like that. I'm fine with people being written with no powers, simple powers, complex powers, emotional powers, unemotional powers. I said that visual and emotional components (and how people feel) make them more interesting, not that they are mandatory for every power ever.
