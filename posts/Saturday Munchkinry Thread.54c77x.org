Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

The Powers:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /clearly/ defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

- The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

- In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, /powerful/.

The Problem:

- In which we solve problems posed by other users. Be smart and expect other users to be smarter.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have a sapient blob of crystalline biomass, which thinks and communicates by its crystals touching other crystals of itself and sharing half-formed ideas among them. Basically a non-centralized brain. Naturally this blob didn't evolve things like vocal cords because it doesn't need them. The blob feeds itself by dissolving all organic biomass in its reach and converting them to crystals.

Blob has no concept of self but it is intelligent. You are a human with a normal body, you have a team of scientists with you and the resources of NASA. Blob is contained in a glass cylinder about twelve feet high.

Now, your team needs to find a way to talk with blob. "Find a way," or else you shall lose you funding, lab and reputation.

*** How does it interact with the outside world? There's no feasible way it could evolve intelligence without there being some sort of selection pressure. And how does it get food normally? Does it simply wait for animals to walk past it and grab them? If it isn't camouflaged then wouldn't animals learn to avoid it? Does it have means of locomotion? How does it use its intelligence to further its purposes of getting food and reproducing? What does it use to perceive the world in order to make decisions?

I don't mean to be pedantic, but knowing these details would probably give insight into how to interact with it in a way that it would understand. So I guess, if I was a researcher I would try to examine its natural habitat. Did it just fall from space one day and that's all we know? Because if so then I would try putting it in a variety of situations in order to test these properties in order to get a clearer picture before attempting intelligent communication.

**** It can reshape and recolor its mass as it requires, but only when it is sufficiently large. More crystals=more clever it gets. We know its intelligent because its spaceship was just more of itself, the burnt remains show something that looks like a genetic improvement chamber for sections of its body that were disconnected from the whole.

The crystals are mildly photosensitive but the organism could re-purpose them when it has a surplus.

Our blob is just the only section left alive when their spaceship crashed with an unknown object.

Again the reason why we can't just feed it animals until it gets big enough is that no one is willing to risk what the escape of blob would mean in that case. We don't know the physical capabilities of a full blob or its intentions. We cannot risk that.

*** I think the first thing I would want to do is test how it reacts to different food sources. It dissolves all organic biomass, so does it react differently to plant matter or meat? Is there a specific food it reacts differently to? If so, we can theoretically use the differences in food preference to establish basic Pavlovian interactions.

Something else I would run concurrently is try to harvest some of this crystalline biomass (hopefully there's a way to do it without harming the creature, its fear (or equivalent) would likely be a sub-optimal behaviour to induce). If we can tell the difference between crystalline biomass containing different thoughts, we could hope to establish methods of reading its thoughts by some scanning apparatus. If we can replicate crystals of different thoughts, we could have those crystals touch the blob to provide communication the other way. It wouldn't be aware of the setup, but it's intelligent, so we could make it aware if we identify the right thoughts to send it.

Of course, we don't know how the blob works, so any or all of this could fail spectacularly, but these are the clear first steps.

***** Chess on a computer is a video game? I disagree.

Regardless, the concept of beating a board game can be leveraged into making a physical game with programmable states - Turing complete, and thus anything computable can be computed.

A game where you win if you successfully factor a product of two primes before your opponent? The last step has to be you winning.

Or, here, I'll make it easier.

The game is your opponent draws a question from a deck of cards and asks you. If you get the answer correct, you win. If you answer it wrong, you lose. Like, game over.

Now just make custom cards and ask arbitrary questions. Instant gameover.

The game board is two equally sized squares, touching on one side, colored white and black. Two game pieces are placed on the dividing line between the two squares.

Gameplay has both players guessing (in secret) two three digit prime numbers, and if they divide 27,221 evenly, that player wins, and their piece us moved to the white square. That means you can have 0, 1, or even 2 winners!

Really the question is, what counts as a board game? How would it deal with an effectively pure luck based board game such as snakes and ladders for instance?

*** *The Fly Power*

"Absolute and impossible to be overridden control". Ok, time to generate infinite energy or wealth or whatever via doing things like controlling flies to spontaneously fuse into heavy elements. That and no limitation or organic flies. In the spirit of the prompt? No idea, but munchkinry and all right, controlling robot flies is at least a start, and stretching the definition of absolute control seems like something that should be tried.

*Board Games*

Already covered well in other comments. Can likely be utilised to win at gambling, depending on how far you can go with custom board games and the definition of board games lets you potentially become a source of any information desired. Assuming it has you win following the rules anyway, and not be swindling everyone else into giving up or whatever.

*Super Rectal Muscles*

Clench hard, attempt to recreate the new universe in your image because you just destroyed the current one.

*Livermorium Control*

Step 1 is spending a lot of time figuring out how to prove it, step two is I now have the ability to keep it from decaying and possibly get closer to absolute zero than has ever been done. What would scientists do for the chance to study Livermorium without the chance of it decaying rapidly? Just got to telekinetically suspend its state. Although this does stretch the usage of telekinesis a bit.

*Half-Invisibility*

I spend months training until I don't know the difference, making all of my both my left and right half from my own perception. Alternatively I exploit flawed wording and just do both to the lack of conditions about exclusivity of invisibility.

That or start research into what the uses of substances that change to match the refractive index of their surroundings are. Hmm, I wonder what happens if it separates two mediums? Water and air for instance, it should be analogous to one of the two, measuring using equipment that can pick up the tiny refraction anyway, which makes it appear as something it's not rather than not appearing. Might be able to do something with that.

For example, if you have physical access to a car's gas tank, you can convert the gasoline to kinetic energy to push the car, but you'll run out of gas far quicker than if you were just using the engine. You can also use your own calories for an energy source, but you run into the same efficiency issue. Power is line of sight for effect, proximity/touch for the source. The closer you are to both, the more efficient you get, but it's going to be less than burning/eating/otherwise using the energy in the first place.

I mean you can, but you won't get much, as you'll have to wait for the atmosphere to heat it back up same as you would anything else. You can't get something even remotely close to absolute zero using this power, it's not nearly focused enough. You're still not "netting" energy, but you are giving yourself a focal point to pull energy out of the atmosphere. You won't be freezing the planet with this method anytime soon though, since you have to wait for it to heat back up naturally.

*** Well it ought to be noted that with clever usage of reference frames this can be used in a way pretty similar to high level telekinesis. In combat choose reference frame such as a bullet traveling upwards at great speed, then stop the motion of your enemy relative to the bullet, thus shooting them upwards at ~the speed of sound.

Now interestingly there's nothing that says you need to actually have a object /to compare reference frames to/, so you can just imagine ay object with any speed, and with sufficient energy you can then make any other object match it's speed (from the theoretical objects perspective it would stop).\\
Now I don't know how you get energy to power this ability, so it's really hard to actually gauge what it's capable of. It's also not clear whether this is a superpower, or whether the preprogrammed geometric shapes act like magic runes that anyone can use.

In combat you can instantly destroy your enemy with trivial ease, it really depends on how you're getting energy, but I assume you can at the very least easily exert amounts of force that you could physically apply with your body. So it ought to be easy to constantly change your enemies movement or juggle them in the air, tearing any weapons out of their hands, and focus the energy on a smaller area to hurl projectiles like bullets at them. With larger amounts of energy just smash your enemies against the ground.

When it comes to improving society it's hard to gauge effects without knowing how you get energy to power the ability, and what the deal is with runes (and thus whether you can setup automated systems, or whether every use of the power has to be deliberately performed by you). If anyone can use the runes, then you want to ensure that nobody except trusted allies figures out how they work. Whichever governments have this are pretty much guaranteed victory in a conflict, so maybe only give this info to governments that probably won't go starting shit, so maybe like switzerland.

As for improving society: Well this could make getting things into space/orbit super easy. So just get the UN to build some enormous space colony, then you'll get it into space. Same thing goes for getting spacecraft around; you could spark a revolution in space exploration.\\
With enough energy you could bring mineral rich asteroids <10 miles wide safely to earth for mining. You could levitate amounts of water into the high atmosphere, then bring the giant pieces of ice back down to replenish lost ice due to global warming, or break it apart and let the ice crystals decrease the earth's albedo. Puting giant mirrors in orbit might be a useful way to get cheap solar energy. Who knows I'll be able to think of more if I know how the power actually works.
