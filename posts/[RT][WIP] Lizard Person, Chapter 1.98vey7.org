** This is the first chapter of something that's been on my mind a while, but I've gotten around to writing.

I think this chapter alone doesn't quite meet the standards to qualify as rational fiction, but the chapter itself is meant to be an introduction, more than anything else (most dialogue so far has been more polite or emotionally charged than deep discussions, etc). The story I'm planning is heavily inspired by rational fiction; future chapters will have more intelligent conversations, and hopefully the characters will behave in believably intelligent ways.

It takes place on a near-modern Earth with only minor differences, to explore a few what-ifs:

- What if telepathy suddenly came into existence?

- What if aliens demonstrably existed but Earth was isolated?

- What if an /only slightly alien/ alien actually existed and had celebrity status?

My goal is to continue writing (I imagine this plot being roughly novel sized, but who knows how accurate a prediction that will turn out to be), but I do not expect to work as quickly as most stories posted here. Does such a story belong here, or should I take it elsewhere (it is a little YA-esque)? If you could, please let me know what you think!

*** I really enjoyed reading the chapter, and am looking forward to more. To the point where I'd like to know if there's a place I can subscribe, I couldn't find anything from a quick look.

I think it fits right in in the subreddit. "Real" rational fiction is rare enough to be posted that "just" quality webfiction is quite welcome, IMO.

[Edit] Found the place to follow the blog, actually. Needs an account on the site, and the blog needs to be added to follows in the dashboard.

**** Thank you for the kind words!

Would you prefer I upload it to fictionpress or something instead of just blogspot? Where do your other subscriptions live?

***** Oh, it's completely alright. My other subscriptions live in my email, and now so does this one, that's all that I need.

There's no real benefit to uploading on fictionpress, I think.

I think [[https://archiveofourown.org/][AO3]] is a good platform, though. It actually has something resembling decent search, allows various different ways to read your work (including automatically generating an epub of it), and might actually have some people stumble on your work randomly on the site. But that's up to you.

[Edit] ... after a quick look on the AO3 original fiction page, it's a bit less wholesome than I thought. Still a decent platform, though.

*** Very nice, so far I really enjoyed the chapter = ) and actually have some high hopes with this, your Questions as a Setting seem to have a lot of potential and are quite intriguing. Are you going full worldbuilding on this ? If your goal is a mostly rational story maybe you can find someone with expierence as a testreader in the community to help you out catching most glaring inconsistencies and loopholes; a lot of stories seem to benefit hugely from that. But really a nice start and a good writing style.

**** Thank you very much!

Right now, the future of the story is only partially planned, and a lot is vague in my mind. The world itself has been partially solidified, but much of it needs work. Several difficult problems still need addressing, but thankfully I believe most won't affect the near-future plot in a major way (as mentioned, the world is isolated).

A testreader would certainly be a lot of help. It took some effort to go through this single chapter and make sure information was presented in an order that made sense. I'm not sure how exactly to acquire them, so if anyone reading this is interested, just DM me.

*** It's an interesting enough concept and the writing is snappy enough to want to read more. From a rational fic perspective, I'd want the story to begin to elaborate the goals of the characters and how they will be challenged by their environment. So far it seems pretty easy going without much conflict or foreshadowing of anything momentous other than too-obvious tropes of Rose actually being an evil mind control monster or the anti-rose faction showing up. What is the major thrust of the plot? how will the action and momentum develop? What interesting questions will this situation raise?

if you can answer these I think it has promise.

Nah, you're fine. "Examination of goals and motives" feels safe already.

** Alright, I'm intrigued.

  “How do you do?” Carol heard herself saying half automatically.

There was a moment between when I read this sentence and recalled the appropriate idiom. Plenty of time for me to think Rose said it :P\\

*** Thank you!

What do you mean by the bug-feature thing? If it were confusing whether Rose or William was speaking, I would call it a feature, but there shouldn't be any ambiguity whether Carol is talking.

**** The text is completely clear that Carol's mouth is doing the talking.

It's /funny/ because the other reason Carol would hear herself is if the telepathy control were real and didn't even require touch, and Rose was the one 'speaking'.

Definitely a feature, can't believe I didn't get that.
