[[https://www.reddit.com/user/eliezeryudkowsky][Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has at least one pseudonymous fiction.

It started with this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/e5ssj4x?context=3][comment]].

The latest [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lfu18v/a_recommendation_for_elahrairah_by_anderein/gmrq9po/?context=3][hint]]:

#+begin_quote
  I'll add "El-Ahrairah" to the list with "The Waves Arisen", "The Erogamer", and "Fargo", but still not that one thing I actually wrote, that's been recced on [[/r/rational]] a few times, which nobody ever suggests I wrote.
#+end_quote

So which writing has been recommended a few times on [[/r/rational]] that might be from Yudkowsky. Prime candidates would be [RST] fictions by authors who just published once.

Any more hints?

To Eliezer Yudkowsky: if you consider your fiction instructive why not reveal it for the benefit of the underprivileged who can't read a lot?

** I mean, think about what this thread is going to turn into (and likely how previous ones on the topic have ended up, I haven't been deep in here for long), it becomes a pseudo-recomendation and analysis thread of other rational works where people actively engage with the connection between the work and the author. Also, puzzles are fun, and any amount of hype and mystery isn't going to hurt EY's own work.

Also maybe it's much less deeply rational and EY wants to be able to write something that's less serious. Or maybe he wants to be able to write something with out dragging his reputation into the discussion, or triggering people's biases/putting them on guard. Or maybe the hint not being revealed after so long was just because he likes trolling people sometimes (if he steps in here to "reveal" and instead links a rickroll then I'm on point with this. Except now we all know to look for it so he won't do it. Unless he wants to move up another level and does it anyway. Ad infinitum).

BTW this is the reason some people assume yud let the AI out of the box in his AI box experiment but decided not to tell anyone the reason - because the reason was that doing so promotes AI research more than not doing so.

Notably, the first rule is "The AI party may not offer any real-world considerations to persuade the Gatekeeper party". While I cannot prove that what you describe didn't happen, I wouldn't expect Yudkowsky to lie about if he followed the rules laid out for his experiment or not.

***** This whole experiment is pseudo-mystic mumbo-jumbo. It may or may not have happened (My guess it is did happen, but like any stage magician Yudkowsky was simply careful in selecting the right volunteers), but it's obviously designed to build a cult of personality around Yudkowsky personally, and not for any scientific rigor.

The whole "I have a cunning argument that would convince anyone, but I'm keeping it secret" stick to just so transparent. I don't understand why people fall for it.

a better question is perhaps "why reveal the existence of pseudonymous fiction in the first place?" I'd've thought there was a general collective incentive /not/ to go thinking too hard about pseudonyms, but stuff like this places more scrutiny on works by seemingly-throwaway accounts, which makes it harder for people to write pseudonymously (regardless of their reasons)

** This is a bit late for the post but I feel like thinking out loud somewhere about this and might as well do it here. So like the thing that feels more like stuff that eliezer writes that I've seen is seeking power. But but the author is obiously not eliezer due to other stuff(like them having a patreon)

I once wondered if eliezer had written forty millenniums of cultivation because he did say he thought of trying to pass of "a girl corrupted by the internet is the summoned hero" as a translated Japanese light novel. (also this means that he might actually have done that for the thing where he changed writing stile) , but forty milleniums of cultivation is actually in Chinese and has stuff that make it very unlike the kind of thing eliezer would write, even if does seem like the author thinks along similar lines sometimes so definitely no.

Anyway extra thoughts, the pseudonym also can't have posted too much other stuff(unless it's an account eliezer uses often for stuff he doesn't want under his name) , probably only wrote a single fic and is most likely newer than eliezers account (though that doesn't narrow it down much) They also almost certainly aren't a regular in the discord. It's possible eliezer is on the discord under that name and has maybe even said something at some point there but definitely not regularly. It's most likely something short, doubt eliezer expends that much time writing.

It's also possible I haven't actually read whatever eliezer has written.

It's also been recommended more than once. And that might discard stuff the authors posted on r/r. It's maybe in hfy.

Could be a glowfic like he might just have more than one glowfic account. Glowfics that have been recommended is probably a smaller category.

I guess he could have written friendship is optimal, even if it's really not his style. Don't know enough about the author to discard it.

Things that speak against it being EY: Just about everything.

Things that speak for it being EY: There is one chapter (8.ii) that is basically a 40k/Gurren Lagann mashup (with orkz) which he has as a blank entry in one of the omake chapters of hpmor, and said chapter also has an (unattributed) EY quote in the author's notes.

Honestly I was a bit surprised by that! I guess that case, plus my experience writing "team tyler's van" with Alicorn, suggests that - even on those occasions where I've made zero effort to disguise my style, and am naming characters "Haroun Pevers, curious boy" - it takes either a lot of cumulative writing, or an extended exposure over time, before people start to perceive such a thing.
