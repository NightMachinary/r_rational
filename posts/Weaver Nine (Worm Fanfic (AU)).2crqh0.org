** Even more creative use of powers. I was particularity fond of the use weaver found for Noelle.

*** Ha, I wasn't signed up for reddit at the time you made the post, but I still wanted to make this post to thank you for recommending my story! I'm glad you liked it!

I probably won't be able to update often in the future, but I just added a new chapter (4.6) to the spacebattles thread.

** Far and away my favorite Worm fanfic. The original plot and the fact that we don't already know everything, because of the switch, makes it a great read beyond the usual fanfic.

*** I was disappointed when I finished reading through the Worm time loops and there was no more. Any other suggested reading on the Worm verse?

**** In no particular order, Cenotaph/Working Title, Here Be Dragons, Alchemical Solutions, Silent, Manager, and A Cloudy Path are all good.

***** Thanks, I'm an addict for good worm fanfic. I'm really enjoying anything I find.

I also found this Brennus story, not worm, but it's in a similar vein if anyone else is interested

** Read it. Liked it. Though I did feel (like in Worm proper) that I liked the [[#s][]] parts better than the [[#s][]] parts. Worm always felt a little too grimdark for my personal preferences, and a lot of the fanfic seems to carry that over (sometimes amplifying it). That said, the fact that it's well-written helps a lot.

** 3 chapters in pretty good so far and power uses are already at a high note so that's great as well.

** Trying to read this via forums on my phone is exceptionally annoying. Every chapter I have to scroll back to the top of the post to check the chapter number before going back to the table of contents.

** It's awesome. But. Is it so hard to understand how to punctuate speech in English? Surely people notice that you do this:

"Bla bla bla," said Foo.

Instead of:

"Bla bla bla." said Foo.

It's not like it's some of obscure punctuation rule; you see it all the time in books, in every dialogue ever, almost.

*** You are right, that is the rule. Unfortunately, the rule is dumb.

Alice: What did Jim say?\\
Bob: He said, "What is this?"\\
Alice: Are you telling me or asking me?\\
Bob: I can't tell. This is a written medium with silly rules made up by people who think ambiguity is poetic.

Alternately

Alice: What did Jim say?\\
Bob: He said, "This is a car."\\
Alice: Was he asking a question or stating that it was a car?

**** I'm not sure I understand your point. How is the written medium ambiguous? It is the oral speech that can be ambiguous in these examples. And in speech you can usually tell by the intonation.

***** The written medium is ambiguous because it is impossible to distinguish between the two cases presented in each example. In spoken language you can do it with intonation mostly.
