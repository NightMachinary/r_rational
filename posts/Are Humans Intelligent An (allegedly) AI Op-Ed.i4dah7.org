  So, what does it mean to be intelligent? It means to be capable of doing things that humans have traditionally done. To be intelligent is to be able to yell and scream at other humans, to believe humans who say things you agree with, and to be incapable of critical thinking.

Love this.

*** I didnt expect to be scolded by sassy, nihilistic “robot” today but here we are.

you must be smart because I agree with what you are saying!

*** It's not hard for a human to pass the turing test, and this seems a lot more coherent than other GPT-3 stuff I've seen of similar lengths. I suspect that it's very much human assisted.

**** Most likely a Frankencherrypick. I'd beleive that 90% was written by the AI, but not in one prompt iteration.

** I have a hypothesis that intelligence is what happens when agents are given the opportunity to make a ton of mistakes and learn from them without being erased. This is why machine learning algorithms make more intelligent systems. You're essentially creating a computer which makes mistakes /even faster and more efficiently/ than a human, so it can catch up to human capacity in an area faster than a human would. This is why adversarial networks are so effective. You're creating agents which make mistakes against each other at incredible speeds, so they can learn to make fewer mistakes in the future.

This also explains human intelligence. We're particularly resilient animals. Even with little to no technology, we can recover from injuries which would spell instant death to most other land animals. We have evidence of humans from 100,000+ years ago splinting broken limbs, 30,000 year old skulls with holes bored in them to alleve intracranial pressure, and evidence of stitches going back almost to the invention of thread. We have insane endurance, can survive absurd amounts of blood loss, and we protect each other. All of this taken together means we are far better at surviving our mistakes than almost any other animal. We can escape predators without sacrificing the weakest member of the herd, recover from heat exhaustion by sharing water supplies we carry with us, and straight-up repair a ton of injuries. If something doesn't kill a human in under 5 minutes, there's a good chance it won't kill us at all.

So we get to make a ton of otherwise lethal mistakes and learn from them, just like machine learning algorithms. The only reason we do this more slowly than computers is that we're evolved wetware, rarher than designed hardware.

*** I'd dispute that humans are better at survival than other animals - some people suffocate instantly with a thin mask over their mouths... /s

Seriously, though, the average cornered mouse fights harder than a human with a broken bone, or even a mild sprained ankle. It's just that we're so far atop the food chain that our mistakes don't matter - we have so much surplus energy, time, and intelligence that we can afford luxuries like caring for our elderly which are unavailable to other animals.

Your comment does read a bit like something from [[/r/HFY]], though.
