*** fyi I caught a couple of typos in your latest chapter,

#+begin_quote
  Whomever had been responsible for this had known what they were doing
#+end_quote

Should be 'Whoever'

#+begin_quote
  It started when I obsered that
#+end_quote

probably should be 'observed'?

** This story fills me with a really enjoyable sense of disquiet and mild foreboding. Its kinda interesting and uncomfortable at the same time, its great.
