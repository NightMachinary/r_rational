Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

The Powers:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /clearly/ defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

- The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

- In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, /powerful/.

The Problem:

- In which we solve problems.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** - You have the power to detect every water molecule within about fifteen feet. You don't have Taylor's power of super-multitasking, so you're not really processing every detail you have access to; you can focus on something to get more detail on it (and less detail on other things), but if you don't, you'll only get as much detail as you can handle.
- You can also teleport any water molecule to the general location of any other water molecule, and, for the sake of actual usefulness, may do this en masse for large groupings of water molecules. For example, if there are two glasses of water in front of you, each half full, you can drain one and fill the other through teleportation. (I'll give you a freebie here and point out that you can kill people within your range by draining the water from their bodies into the surrounding moisture.)
- How to best make use of this power?

*** I could see this being used to cure cancer by selectively killing cancer cells. Not confident because that might require super multitasking. At the very least, you could use it to detect and kill cancerous looking clumps as soon as they start to form.

You could also dissolve atherosclerotic plagues, kill infectious cysts, etc. And your skin could always be hydrated, helping you maintain a youthful appearance / be comfortable. Maybe use skin conditioning tricks to make people feel suddenly comfortable whenever they enter your radius -- a nice thing to do, with possible operant conditioning implications. (Making them uncomfortable every time they do something you don't like would be the evil option.)

It should also be possible to use the teleportation as a cutting tool, since you can increase and decrease the size of a fine point. Creating a vibration at any frequency in just about any object would also possible, since everything has some water in it.

**** Selectively killing cancer cells is really difficult because you can't see them and don't necessarily know where they are. Sure, you can see all the water molecules, but the hydration profiles of basically all living cells are more-or-less identical. You won't be able to tell one from another.

If you know exactly where a tumor is, you can teleport out the water...but then you have to deal with the fallout of mass cell apoptosis. Turns out, cell death releases toxic chemicals into the surrounding tissue which can cascade into more cell death. This is why surgeons actually remove tumors instead of, for instance, injecting them with localized poison.

Killing surface cysts should be doable, or at least draining them of excess fluid and allowing healing to begin, but I'm not sure about cysts deeper in the body. You will never have acne because you could safely exterminate bacteria on your skin, but depending upon how the power works this might require too much concentration.

*** I suggest hiring a plane and then teleporting clouds of water into a highly compressed sphere. Make the plane fly at a uniform speed so that your range changes every second, drag on the sphere by teleporting every millisecond.

It will take some time, therefore revert the sphere back into a cloud whenever you need to rest/refuel. Revert for the last time over some region with a drought. Let it rain.

You can make a profit by charging money, but that depends on your moral scale.

Edit: Compress many clouds in that sphere, it must be better than spraying water from airplanes.

Are there limits on the rate you can teleport at, or else the pressure you can teleport the water into? I'd look into buying a nozzle of some kind, and using it to power a long-range (>15 feet) cutting stream.

If you have good enough aiming, you can also create water explosions next to any object, and use that force to move it like normal telekinesis.

You may not have good cancer detection abilities (what does the water-profile of a tumor look like?) but you do have a good non-invasive surgery option in dehydrating and rehydrating selected tissues.

EDIT: I assume the teleportation is reactionless. Teleport the stream coming out of the cutting nozzle (or a different nozzle) back into the reservoir, and make a jetpack/rocket that you can refuel yourself.

By teleporting all the water molecules out of the bottom half of a glass of water, you could cause [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/6/][a small explosion]]. And I'm not quite sure what happens to a glass of sugar water if you just teleport out all the water, but I imagine you'll end up with either some sort of finely-ground, almost gaseous sugar, or a very flimsy, very fine sugar sculpture.

Note that the pudding's regeneration is not instantaneous, since it is possible to cut a slice of it; but it can be assumed to grow back essentially immediately once that slice is removed.

** Munchkinry challenge!

Powerset: Roughly [[http://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/chandra-nalaar][Chandra Nalaar]]'s powers, minus planeswalking. In other words,

- Lots of fire and explosions, limited by mana availability. Also, feeling some sort of strong passion at the time of casting is required to use the biggest spells. Feeling apathy or despair reduces your spells' effectiveness, and sufficient hopelessness can prevent casting anything at all.
- Ability to show off with fire on your hair and hands, along with correspondingly glowing eyes. (This automatically triggers upon extreme passions or when casting large spells, and may be manually used separately. Technically a spell in its own right, but draws only a tiny amount of mana to sustain.)
- Unusually high body temperature (always-on), but not so high as to be uncomfortable to other people's touch. Raising it further (over part or all of your body) is a simple spell, but takes more mana the more you raise it.
- Immunity to heat and your own fire (also always-on, draws no mana).
- Ability to draw mana and hold onto it for as long as desired. Mana pool size is limited only by how much you can find.

The setting:

- Easy mode: Earth as we know it, except that places generate mana as would be expected in /Magic: the Gathering/. You mostly need [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=289321][Mountains]], which can be locations like large foundries or boilerworks. No one else can access mana. You can also bond to a location, allowing you to draw on its mana when not physically there, by spending 8 hours there studying the location.
- Hard mode: Earth as we know it, but land does /not/ generate mana.

In either case, you start with a small pool of manabonds, which supply enough mana for you to throw a fist-sized fireball every minute or hold your body temperature at up to 110 degrees Celsius continuously.

The challenge: Take over the world.

****** Now I have had time to form a proper opinion on the Aetherborn. (Setting aside the nonbinary representation issue, on which I'll defer to nonbinary people.)

On the one hand, I like that Wizards has introduced a Black characteristic race that isn't commonly associated with evil and has clearly sympathetic motives as a group. I am of the firm opinion that declaring Black to be amoral is a flavor error and that the correct flavor for Black regarding morality is that a Black character's moral code, if any, comes from what satisfies them personally rather than from society (White) or nature (Green) imposing one. (The latter flavor choice does include lots of people who care only about themselves (e.g. HPMOR!Voldemort), but it also includes people who base their moral code on personally caring about others and will stand in defiance of society and nature to follow it (e.g. HJPEV).) Having the Aetherborn helps balance out Black's representatives.

On the other hand, I am displeased that so far the Aetherborn's short lifespans do not appear to be seen as a /problem/ in-Multiverse, despite the very glaring length difference between their lifespans and those of other sapient races and the fact that they are /produced by an artificial, controlled thing/. People are dying who don't want to die! Kaladeshi Consulate, have the ethical debate and fix your aether grid!

Then again, M:tG doesn't generally portray transhumanism in a positive light. Note the "death and decay are necessary" theme inherent in combining Black's mechanical and flavor elements with the problems which befall planes that don't have a balance of all five colors of mana. Also, observe that the most prominent self-improving character is Tezzeret, the most prominent immortality-/seeking/ character is Liliana, they are both the most prominent in those areas by a long shot, and they are both /terrible, terrible people/. In addition to working with Nicol Bolas for their own gain, thereby making his well-deserved "evil, power-hungry tyrant" image rub off on them, they are both conspicuously shown heaping abuse upon Jace. And Jace is the poster boy and /intended audience surrogate/ for the /entire game/ - who also conspicuously /fails to think of/ using his own powers for self-improvement, despite having the single best powerset for doing so (with the arguable exception of Bolas, depending on whether you look at power focus or power level). Admittedly, if he was allowed to think of that he would run away with the plot, but still.

I have feelings about the portrayal of transhumanism in media. Can you tell? :)

Also:

Of course, the Consuls are supposed to be the bad guys of this arc, having hired the guy who killed Chandra's dad and also made Tezzeret a judge for some reason, so them allowing their energy grid to continue making existential nightmares seems entirely in-character.

Then I realized that the fact that I'm thinking about the Aetherborn so much makes them the most fascinating setpiece Wizards has penned in recent memory. The whole Eldrich horror beyond mortal ken thing we've had for the past two blocks is cool, but most of the ideas in that sphere have already been written by someone or another. Before that, we had a pretty normal time travel plot (with none of the rational trappings that might have come from that), before that we had random Greco-Roman gods being jackasses, etc etc. Nothing really exciting or unique.

But I've never read of anything like the Aetherborn before. Nothing I've ever seen before combines pretty much every fridge horror trope possible, from accidental creation of sapient life to randomly short lifespans. And it gets even better! The whole nonbinary thing makes complete and total sense because the Aetherborn aren't evolved beings and can't reproduce normally! They can't sleep because sleeping is a function of meatbrains needing downtime, and beings made of Aether don't have meatbrains!

Wizards actually thought about these things and created something totally unique that I didn't expect. And that's awesome!

I totally get your feelings about the portrayal of transhumanism, but let's take a look at this in context. In the Magic universe, the only known methods of immortality were developed by the Phyrexians (Squee), or require selling your soul to four different demons. Whereas in our universe it is entirely reasonable to expect that becoming immortal is entirely possible, it may well be harder in the Multiverse because reasons, and it may well be that the only methods of becoming immortal require questionable moral choices. If that is the case, the fact that nobody seems to be searching for immortality rituals might well be justified if we assume that all of them are evil or require too many resources a-la the white reanimation spells anyway.

I was trying to give them a more charitable fair shake than "bad guys of this arc". You know, treating the Consulate as an organization of and created by /people/ with varied but understandable motives and backgrounds. Some are just doing their job, some really believe that they're making Kaladesh a better place by suppressing mages and limiting aether supplies, some have personal vendettas, some are secretly mages themselves, some are corrupt and using their positions for personal gain...

So yes, maybe it currently makes sense for them to continue allowing their aether grid to make existential nightmares. But it makes sense with explanations like "they didn't realize that the Aetherborn are existential nightmares" or "some of the corrupt / oppressive elements profit from the continued generation of Aetherborn" or "no one can agree on /how/ to fix the aether grid" rather than "for the evulz".

(I try to treat stories as rational until that falls apart. Admittedly, there are some aspects of M:tG where that falls apart /very thoroughly/.)

My inner Jace insists upon taking this one, so I'm going to let him type his response.

Sure, sleep in humans does perform meatbrain-downtime functions like replenishing ATP reserves in the brain and possibly helping remove waste products generated by brain activity, but that's not all it does. Sleep also has a large role in memory processing and consolidation, and that shows up quite nicely on the substrate-independent interface provided by mind magic.

So if the Aetherborn can't sleep, how does that affect their minds? Clearly at least some of them can perform complex long-term tasks that require lots of memory processing (see example: Gonti), so do they have some other means by which that processing occurs? If so, what tradeoffs does it have, and can meatbrains use it? If not, does that mean that most Aetherborn are even more of existential nightmares because they're good at sensation-gathering but have trouble learning from their experiences?

For a mind mage, this raises all sorts of questions. Can I tell if a mind is an Aetherborn simply by looking at its memory structure without reading any of the contents? If I see piles of under-consolidated memories in an Aetherborn mind, is that normal for them or a sign of pathology or interference? Are well-consolidated memories in an Aetherborn mind an indication that those memories were placed there by mind magic? How do the Aetherborn, both individually and as a society, adapt to any tradeoffs or difficulties in memory processing?

(No, I can't answer all those questions from my encounter with Ob Nixilis. He doesn't sleep either, but I didn't spend long enough in his head to really investigate that sort of thing, and it's quite possible that the answers are different for demons.)

  I totally get your feelings about the portrayal of transhumanism, but let's take a look at this in context. In the Magic universe, the only known methods of immortality were developed by the Phyrexians (Squee), or require selling your soul to four different demons. Whereas in our universe it is entirely reasonable to expect that becoming immortal is entirely possible, it may well be harder in the Multiverse because reasons, and it may well be that the only methods of becoming immortal require questionable moral choices. If that is the case, the fact that nobody seems to be searching for immortality rituals might well be justified if we assume that all of them are evil or require too many resources a-la the white reanimation spells anyway.

My gripe here is not that we don't have large numbers of prominent characters voluntarily joining the Phyrexians or making deals with demons for immortality. That part is fine. And sure, it's /possible/ that the only methods of becoming immortal that are available in the Multiverse require questionable moral choices.

But we don't /know/ that that's the case, and we don't know that because apparently no one did the very Blue thing and proved the general case either way. And as long as the people of the Multiverse also don't know that, it would be nice to see at least some of them searching for morally acceptable and not-resource-hogging means of immortality. Or trying to prove whether or not such means can exist in the Multiverse.

And even if the Multiverse does turn out to be a No Ethical Immortality Allowed zone, surely there are other acts of transhumanist self-improvement that lack that problem. We've already covered why /recursive/ and /mental/ self-improvement are quietly prohibited, but there's no reason for modifying one's own body to necessarily be an immoral act or one only appealing to immoral people. Yet if we look at individuals who have visible, functional body mods (you know, the sort of thing that /turns up on card art/ and the like), we get Tezzeret (who is a terrible person, as previously discussed) and the less well-known Daretti (who indulges in things like [[http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/bloody-instructions-2016-08-17][premeditated murder and burning people's houses down]]) and effectively no one else that's not better covered by considering them as part of a group.

If we look at groups with that visible, physical self-improvement focus, they all have some sort of terrible fate and assimilation plot involvement. Esper has its etherium crisis and the Ethersworn. The Simic Combine went around sticking cytoplasts to people without their consent, and then proceeded to maim or kill them with Project Kraj. Phyrexians are, well, Phyrexians, and they consumed Mirrodin.

Why can't we have Kaladeshi inventors that wear their own work as augmentation, rather than decoration, while still being morally upstanding people? Or sane, stable Esperites that take up a White code of "everyone should have the choice to improve themselves" and express Black self-interest and sacrifice through making personal sacrifices (time and effort, functionality tradeoffs, other resources), making something of themselves in the purest sense without imposing their views on others? Or Simic biomancers selling cytoplasts from well-tested lines to the willing, provoking discussions about the stratification of society? (Phyrexians would lose much of their identity without their assimilation plot, so I'll leave them alone.)

In short, why no nice transhumanists anywhere?

********* It actually looks like there might be some nice transhumanists on Kaladesh as well, what with the Fabricate mechanic, specifically glint - sleeve artisan. From a flavor perspective, that guy is making power armor which becomes a permanent part of himself.

*** Are you able to cast any red spells, or only fire-themed ones? [[http://magiccards.info/v14/en/5.html][Decree of Annihilation]] , [[http://magiccards.info/8e/en/204.html][Obliterate]] and [[http://magiccards.info/m13/en/158.html][Worldfire]] sound like they could do the job.
