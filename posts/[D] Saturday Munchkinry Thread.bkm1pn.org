Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** All humans have the ability to plane shift to alternate versions of Earth, subject to the following restrictions.

- Each person has exactly two planes that they can plane shift to. The first is the plane of their birth. The second is a personal plane unique to that individual.
- Each personal plane contains an alternate version of the world, identical to ours except that sapient humans never evolved.
- When a person plane shifts, they can bring people and items with them, so long as they are in physical contact with all items being transported, and the total amount being transported is less than one ton of material.
- Performing a plane shift requires significant effort, equivalent to about an hour of physical labor.

Standard fantasy safety measures apply as follows.

- Plane shifting occurs relative to surface of Earth, or the nearest celestial body as applicable.
- Plane shifting will place a person at ground level, at rest relative to the surface.
- Plane shifting will not place any transported objects inside of solid or liquid.
- Plane shifting swaps the contents of a physical volume, preventing vacuum booms.

What cultural changes would take place as a result of this ability at various points throughout history?

*** Keeping anyone captive becomes almost impossible; societies wouldn't be able to use jails or prisons.

Similarly, physical barriers and fortifications will be very different if anyone can travel from their birth plane to their personal plane, walk past where a wall would be, and travel back, like a 10-minute teleportation.

You might like to have a look at Charles Stross's Merchant Princes series, it involves a similar powerset and does a good job of exploring the implications.

Here's a few possible ways to maintain a secure location:

- Keep it on your personal plane and never bring anyone there. If you die, it becomes inaccessible.
- Keep it on your personal plane, use conventional barriers, and ensure that nobody gives birth there.
- Make it impossible to plane shift into using the safety measures: away from any celestial body, above or below ground level (justifies wizard's towers and dungeons), inside a body of liquid (use scuba tanks or drain the location when you need to access it), or moving at high speeds (constantly moving train vaults? centrifuge vaults?)

This could lead to the development of an aristocracy based on birth location: if a personal plane is settled and the person who it belonged to dies, only those born there would be able to leave the plane and return to it. They could ensure the security of their fortifications by forcing everyone else to give birth in an aristocrat's personal plane before being brought back, so that anyone else who shifts planes will be unable to return.

If everyone's personal plane is an identical copy of the same alternate earth, natural resources become much less of an issue: locations in the personal plane with the most accessible resources will be mapped and become centres of industry. If someone finds a vein of iron in their personal plane, they can return to their birth plane, tell their friends the location, and their friends will find the same vein of iron in their own plane.

Absolutely. I think that punishments would veer toward being either more or less humane than imprisonment, with nothing in-between. If it is something that could be immediately identified and sentenced, then physical punishment is possible. If the person can be immediately identified, then they could have fines imposed, since their goods/household would take longer to move.

Correct, planes could be entirely cut off from each other. I hadn't thought of a plane managing security by requiring all births to be performed off-plane, but that would make sense.

That is correct, natural resources are in the same locations across all planes. This makes precious metals be much less precious, as surface-level deposits that on our Earth were exhausted in antiquity are readily available.

*** Ideas not entirely dissimilar to this were explored in Baxter and Pratchett's Long Earth books. A warning before anyone gets their hopes up - the books are much more Baxter's style then they are Pratchett's, IMO. If you've liked any of Baxter's other stuff, the might be worth a shot - if you're thinking about reading them on the strength of Pratchett's name instead, you're likely to be disappointed.

Anyways, in those books you could travel to alternative realities in two different 'directions', each of which contained Earths that were slightly different but without humans when the story begins. The alternative realities are shared, not individualized. The story begins with the invention of a device that allows the majority of humanity to do this dimensional travelling cheaply and easily. The number of alternative realities in each 'direction' is extremely large and not known when the story begins.

The books are pretty decent about exploring how this radically reshapes human society.

*** How long does it take to plane shift? It is equivalent to one hour of physical labor, but does it actually take 1 hour to charge up the plane shift, during which time you must always remain in contact with all items and people?

Also, can you plane shift to your worlds even if you were plane shifted to someone else's personal plane? That's probably important to prevent plane shift kidnapping.

Furthermore, what does the following mean exactly?

Are these worlds going to be full of giant predators that now didn't go extinct because of humans? Full of jungles with unknown plants? Full of bacteria, viruses and parasites that our immune systems have never seen? That sounds rather dangerous to enter by yourself. And also an easy way for people to kill everyone by going to their personal plane, contracting some never-seen-before plague, and returning to the plane of their birth. Cultural changes will then involve tons of people dying to plagues and a few safe bunkers under total reverse quarantine that are in highly inaccessible places to prevent people from plane shifting in. Like deep underground or underwater or in space.

Predators, yes, along with any plants that were driven extinct by humans. Bacteria/viruses/parasites that are adapted to humans would be less common, as they wouldn't have any native humans to infect.

Quite so, apart from brief expeditions for resources, or for dumping waste. I imagine that there could be colonization pushes, with a slow building of structures/farms on one person's personal plane, followed by emigration.

Are there no apes or early primitive humans around? Even if there weren't, there are a lot of plagues that start in animals and somehow get transferred to humans because our physiology is close enough.

But let's look at the crime aspect instead of the disease aspect. Plane shift kidnapping doesn't work, and criminals can't be kept in normal prisons since they can just plane shift, move out of the prison's location, and plane shift back. Which means special prisons would be needed, like prisons on zeppelins or prisons in the ocean, that way plane shifting is death. These prisons would cost way more, so I imagine that there will be a strong shift in cultural perceptions towards favoring cheap capital punishments.

But before that, how would one catch a criminal? It only takes 5 minutes for them to escape to their personal plane, and if they are born on your plane they can return at any time, bringing with them drugs or bombs or whatever they please. Every person born on a plane is effectively a potential near-unstoppable villain for that plane. Which means that in order to have safe planes, one must impose laws where every baby is born off-plane except for a few heavily monitored exceptions for the purpose of bringing people into this plane.

Countries would also invest in building safe bunkers that criminals cannot plane-shift into, otherwise they could plane shift a bomb in, plane shift out, and the area gets destroyed by the bomb. Fortunately, a person can only plane shift to ground level, so building underground bunkers would work well. Ground level rooms can also be made secure by half-filling them with water, so people cannot plane-shift into the liquid water.

Also, rather than water, it would probably be more useful to use something like styrofoam or some other similar light material. Or have a bunch of strings hanging from the ceiling. Much easier to contain.

You can't really use personal planes to get around that, beyond a certain point, because if you put the gold in Sgt Bilko's personal plane, and he dies, it's all gone.

You can't easily colonize a personal plane for the same reason... it's like you're going to a new planet. Children born in the colony can only come back to Earth by hitching a ride on returning Earthfolk, though a pool of colonist children can serve to relay people to the new world and come back with one of their passengers.

#+end_quote

I think, with respect to the Far Future of that world, the most relevant fact that we need to understand is whether the starting map of the other plane increments with age (e.g. do two newborns a thousand years apart get the same pre-human template of a plane? Or does the later newborn get an "updated" plane of a thousand years later?)

If it's the latter....this society is eventually going to have a big problem as the template world degrades and eventually becomes uninhabitable, or evolves intelligence of it's own.

But as for the near term...

#+begin_quote
  What cultural changes would take place as a result of this ability at various points throughout history?
#+end_quote

-Due to every new-born having an entire planet, compulsory agriculture never happens. People will just hunt and gather in their ever-expanding plane-worlds forever. Going by modern hunter gatherers, and considering that this world would be /even more lush/ than that, it would have been extremely easy for any lone adult to sustain themselves /and/ 1-2 other persons through hunting and gathering. Humans are ridiculously effective as natural organisms even with stone age technology...and then consider that eventually they will invent technology /anyway/ and come into this lush world hunting with guns and such. (Unless they don't bother inventing tech until they're hungry, in which case they'll be hunter gatherers forever...but I doubt that)

-Since anyone can secede from any thing at any time, most of society exists as an anarchist's vision of utopia (though pockets of psychological control and aggressiveness may exist, it would be hard for them to affect anyone who isn't already inside of it)

-Some planes, especially the one where humans evolved and where the power started, will be default hubs. They may eventually become a bit crowded, but that's more or less okay (for us) because it doesn't really effect humanity if we destroy the ecology in those planes. Within those planes, scarcity over hub-resources begin to take hold to some degree, although this will ultimately be solved by anchoring additional hub planes together.

-By default, a plane is lost when a person dies. If society wishes to prevent plane loss, two planes can be "anchored" together by sending people to be born in them, then having the progenitor of that plane send them back. Those people can then take additional newborns to their "birth plane". In effect each plane can maintain a population of people who have been born in the other plane.

-two planes can "secede" forever by preventing the sending of new babies to be born in the other plane, preventing the incoming of new babies born on the other plane, committing genocide upon, or forcing out everyone who was born on the other plane, since there will then be no way for anyone to go to that plane and bring new immigrants. (Easy fodder for plot drama, as it would be easy for one or two people to be the "last link" between hub planes.).

-I imagine most conflict in this world would center around right of access to important planes, as most things humans usually fight over are no longer an issue. It would be incredibly easy for any individual or group who was sufficiently motivated to not want to be part of a conflict to escape from it (perhaps at the cost of losing access to an important plane), so most fighting would be between motivated combatants.

The personal planes do age along with the original. On astronomy time scales, this will become an issue in about 1 billion years, when the sun's increase in power output raises the global temperature significantly.

I'm not sure on this one, since to my knowledge the transition to agriculture happened in order to have a more steady supply of food, not to increase the total amount of food available. Hunting/gathering provides more food on average, but runs more risk of famine.

Agreed. Land would no longer be a primary resource, though developed land still would be. While a person could leave their home dimension at any time, it would require leaving behind much of the infrastructure that their home dimension provides.

#+end_quote

That's true in /our/ world, but you have to consider that said inconsistency in the food supply is ultimately due to the humans who were there /before/ those humans depleting the ecology of almost all it's megafauna in the first place. Behaviorally modern humans arrived on the scene with the ecology already depleted by other (non behaviorally modern) humans. You have to remember that even lower paleolithic humans have zero trouble killing large animals like elephants and whales, setting traps for small animals, etc...and you don't need a team of humans either, /one/ human with a long spear can kill an elephant. Stone age humans experience starvation when the ecology is depleted, when it becomes harder and harder to hunt because all the wild game is already dead...not because they are not consistent enough hunters.

I suspect one of the reasons that Africa is home to most of the world's remaining megafauna is because African megafauna have evolved alongside humans and for various reasons have a measure of adequate defense against stone age tech.

If /every single human/ can freshly be the sole invasive-species super predator in a brand new ecology, against animals who have never seen a human and have no life experience or evolutionary mechanisms helping them to avoid humans, spanning what is basically the entire planet, these considerations quickly evaporate. As for consistency? Remember that we can still share food at the hubs.

(What might be scarce, on the other hand, is the locations on civilized "hub" planes which conveniently correspond to ecologically desired locations on the wild personal planes - which would ultimately need to be solved via the aforementioned anchoring method.)

Now...if the wild-worlds were to undergo an ice age or a plague or something, that might be pretty annoying. (And they'd likely all have the problem simultaneously too).

  - if #2 is "sophonts / life can exist in alternate versions" and #3 is "yes", then default Earth eventually gets destroyed (e.g. pandemics, “alien” WMDs, etc); or becomes a hub connecting multitude dimensions of sentient species; and/or becomes an extremely tightly controlled territory with draconian laws and regulations.

- if #6 is "yes", then general security measures and protocols are very different from ours.
- the tactical and strategic role of nuclear weapons and other WMD is different. Less of a deterrent, perhaps, with some other functions in its place.

*** Hopefully this doesn't retread a lot of what people have already answered with.

*Prisons*

Prisons become completely impractical. Shifting automatically to ground/sea level makes it very hard to keep someone from escaping a hazardous cell. While initially people might think to build huge prison complexes on artificial islands, deserts, or other places prisoners wouldn't be able to survive shifting to, all it would take is one disgruntled individual to pull 1 ton of prison with them and effectively break everyone else out. (This is assuming you can shift parts of an item with you)

The only way it could work would be if A) the preparation to plane shift can be reliably detected and B) it can be disrupted, in which case you could have prisoners outfitted with taser collars to shock them if it detects and imminent shift.

*Security*

Keeping people out of things would be difficult, but at least not impossible. Security would be focused on keeping person-sized spaces from existing in secure areas when not in use, which could be done by lowering layers of mesh netting from the ceiling. Safes, depending on how discrete your material must be when shifting, would either have to be done away with entirely if someone can telefrag the door off, or be attached to building foundations to prevent them from being phased out.

Personal security would be a great deal more concerning. Phase-kidnapping would be a real problem when people can hold a finger to someone's shoulder while they're asleep and spirit them away 5 minutes later. Sleeping in general would become a scary activity, and sleeping in public would be taboo.

*Crime*

We could expect there to be a huge uptick in missing persons reports, since anyone who kills anyone now has a guaranteed way to hide a body. Serial killers would be a lot harder to catch. People would probably be a lot more okay with surveillance, cell phone tracking, and so on in light of that constant risk. Ironically, we would likely see a lot less poaching, as any hunter now has an entire world of untouched population up for grabs.

Aside from morbid crimes, petty theft would be on the rise. Big box stores would have to change their entire business model, more goods being stored behind glass and more display models only, with inventory being held in the back.

*World Colonization*

While I do think "Earth prime" (E) would continue to be a centralized hub for mankind, rich individuals and corporations would certainly create "private world networks" to their own benefit. They would begin with a single person transporting people and resources to their private plane (E' or F), full time, funded by some billionaire. When they have a settlement running, the generation of people born there will have F (and some F') as their phase worlds. Now, while the original person who had E and F as their phase worlds will eventually die, as long as you have a small population of people born to E and F stationed in the opposite world, you have continuous travel between them.

For example, given that a person's name starts with their native world, you have Edward and Fawn on world E, and Edith and Frank on world F. As long as you have E&F natives travelling in pairs between worlds, there will always be someone that can keep that connection active no matter what world they are on.

These worlds, I imagine, would mainly be used for resource mining, waste dumps, fast travel, and tourism. Since they require people to work, acting as a "world courier" would be a steady form of employment to many people. Eventually, population growth would begin to accelerate exponentially and economic growth would be limited only by the amount of people able to act as world couriers as industries become more and more efficient at extracting resources from worlds and shipping them back in 1 ton increments, and society enters a more or less utopian age thanks to an infinite amount of resources to extract.

*** History wouldn't be remotely similar, and the longer it went on, the more dissimilar it would be. Think about it this way.

- Everyone would have a secure way to store wealth. However, said wealth would disappear upon death. This would make our habits with money very different.

- Natural resources would be significantly more common. Imagine a society of migratory miners that teach their kids to dig up the same resources their great, great, great ancestors did. You could have 100 copies of the Hope Diamond. We would never have run out of Damascus steel.

- Hunter-gathering, and to a lesser extent, subsistence farming could allow substantially greater population density.

- Therefore, land on the prime plane becomes far, far more valuable. While everything else stays the same. Urbanization happens far earlier; everywhere. Civilization rests on control of houses, rather than fields, so the rest of the land becomes industrialized.

- Skilled labor gains in value, because differences of skill are more apparent in megacities. Making the most skilled artisans lots of land, increasing value. Maybe they work for social value as well as materials.

​

So, in summary, this could either lead to a technological explosion; or it could lead to a permanent state of huntergathering with enormous cities.

By the way what happens when a person dies? Is the plane inaccessible or does it disappear? The former situation leads to massively developed ancestral personal planes for wealthy families that have to be guarded against rivals or thieves attempting to steal a few hundred bricks out of your castle. If it's the latter and someone does while they have visitors do they just disappear along with the plane?

Speaking of transporting things, there are scientists who have meticulously tunneled a hole to the center of their personal planes by taking out chunks of ground just to see what the center of the earth looks like.

If the former situation in paragraph 2 is true, the mc's world is probably not the original earth. - it was made uninhabitable by people taking stuff to their personal planes until there just wasn't enough mass to maintain an atmosphere. Things like climate change are solved though - you just reset by migrating everyone to someone's personal plane.

- or they decided to become a party- or village- player, and it turned out that the larger a group was the more likely it would be to get attacked and destroyed, etc.

Beyond that, your best bet is to try to test if any low-hanging fruit from whatever litRPGs you personally know are exploitable, like:

- combing whatever HUD/game interface you have (if any) for wordings that give you information about the game, like "0 unallocated stat points" meaning there's a way to raise arbitrary stats, or if there's a skill store, overworld map, etc
- whether stats can be "trained" like weightlifting for STR, and if there's a diminishing return on it like so many Gamer stories

This actually makes a lot of sense though. In most RPGs, once you're ahead of the pack, you tend to stay that way. The XP-rich become XP-richer because they can do more things that will get them more loot and XP and make them more OP to grab more loot in an endless cycle. Even if you don't maliciously stomp on those weaker than you, the very act of killing the stronger monsters means less killable monsters available for the people behind you by the time they get to your level.

So what's most important is getting a massive lead early on, which is what you see in many of these LitRPG stories: the MC discovers some powerful artifact or skillbook or whatever that puts them way ahead.

With that goal in mind, first check whether indirectly setting things on fire gets you some form of XP.

If so, set a forest on fire. If you're lucky, that counts as you killing everything in the forest and you become instantly overpowered. Just err, check that there aren't any elves who would then consider you public enemy #1.

Conduct other kinds of experiments for mass killing methods. Can you divert a river to a cave dungeon and drown everything in it? Can you cause an avalanche on a mountain and kill everything below? Can you create tons of traps and get XP for every monster that falls in one? Can you create monster farms to farm up tons of XP? Can you divert a river away from the lake it feeds into, wait for the lake to dry up, and then go in and trivially murder all the helpless lake monsters who are now feeble and dying from lack of water? The last one actually seems pretty doable for most RPG systems. There are all kinds of ways to conduct mass murder without knowing anything about actual combat.

This of course isn't possible when you are a lone person and there's a high lethality rate but work as an organization and you can have a truely optimized second generation team.

** A ROB puts a hypercomputer in your head. Its mental interface with you is capable of accepting any mental or sensory input, and writing to any part of you external to your mind. For example, it can capture video of what your eyes and your minds eyes see, and it can play back whatever it has recorded over your eyes, but not through your minds eyes. It also has a third output, which plays a similar role to your minds eye, while being separate from it. The manual indicates this is a limitation of the hardware.

It comes with an operating system that can be rewound to any previous state, an operating manual explaining the low level specification of how it works and the computational model it runs on, and the source code and IDE's for popular programming languages extended to take advantage of the properties of the hypercomputer, such as real precision number libraries, no limitations regarding memory, and compatibility modes for running code written in the regular version of the programming libraries.

The interface for querying time returns a real precision number.

When a scan is taken of your brain, you can see where it activates your neurons, but can find no sign of the hypercomputer itself. That is, while the interaction between you and the computer seems to take place completely in real space, there is no indication of how it is capable of reading or writing brain states, or how it performs it's computations. This is not addressed in the manual.

*** What differences are there between this hypercomputer and a regular computer? Unlimited memory and precision is a plus, but most computers already have more memory and precision than you need. Also an internet connection so you can actually tell others about it. No point being precise to 3000 decimal places if the only way to transfer the data is for you to literally speak 3000 digits out one by one. Getting the exact time doesn't really seem meaningful either since by the time your brain has applied for or processed the information, an inexact amount of time has passed. Capturing video can be done with a regular computer as well.

So rather than using the hypercomputer for its computing powers, I'm more interested in the fact that its literally linked to your sensory system. So unlike a VR device that can be forcefully taken off or damaged, this hypercomputer always has control over your senses. The question then is, does the hypercomputer have the power to overwrite your senses? For example, can you turn off your ability to feel pain with the hypercomputer?

Rather than having the hypercomputer give you data after you are blinded, I was thinking more along the lines of preemptively writing a simple program that says something like "While light input > 100, do light input = light input - 10". So when your eyes are exposed to blinding light, the hypercomputer picks up on the brightness and immediately dims it to manageable levels. Would that work and thus stop flashbangs from affecting you?

Also infinite computation? That sounds ridiculously exploitable. You can write a machine learning algorithm that has infinite clones and infinite iterations to basically solve any problem whose solution is machine learnable, under the restriction of limited data flow into and out of you. That means you can play chess perfectly regardless of board size and pieces, but that wouldn't even be scratching the surface of what your hypercomputer can do. You wouldn't quite be able to turn your hypercomputer into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace's_demon][Laplace's Demon]], but you can probably get much much closer than anyone ever has.

Furthermore, she has subordinates who can see a few seconds into their own subjective future. She can also freeze time for these agents. Adding all this together, she can read these agents' minds and see what the future will be like by freezing them until the point in time she wants to look at.

The problem this character faces is that she is working for an evil magical dictator who randomly and frequently reads her mind very thoroughly. She has a system in place to wipe her memory whenever she isn't working on treasonous plots, and has set up a bunch of triggers to give her back her memories and true motivations in situations where she is unlikely to have her mind read right this minute. This does leave her a bit of a mess with a horrible sense of not really having a core personality, since it gets ripped out all the time, but she's had high functioning Borderline Personality Disorder for decades, so those above her are used to her emotions and actions not always making perfect sense, or not knowing herself why she did x. She's very useful to them because she has rare powers, but at the end of the day they think she's just too damaged and pathetic to be any kind of criminal mastermind, never mind an apocalyptic threat at the core of their own power structure. They see her as a tool that is very easy to destroy if it turns against them. /And when she doesn't have her full memories and motivations, she genuinely agrees with this assessment./

I think I have things worked out fairly well, but I want to be sure I don't miss something obvious somebody should be doing if they are intelligent. This character is evil and wants to basically destroy civilization because of some plot stuff we don't need to get into. She also works at the highest levels of the magical science secret police and is tasked with sniffing out world ending threats, and the few people over her do not want to bring about any kind of apocalypse whatsoever.

What she needs to accomplish to reach her very specific win condition is for the evil empire of Nazi Wizard Moria to believe that the world is going to end on x date /and they can't stop it/. She also needs to set things up so that she is allowed to be in charge of the last ditch Hail Mary efforts to help humanity survive the apocalypse. She cannot brute force anything, but she is extremely good at manipulating people and has no qualms about destroying lives. Now, this is what she has going for her:

1) Can read minds fully

2) Can look ~5 seconds into her own subjective future

3) Has several subordinates who also have one of these powers.

4) Prophetic powers resist mind reading in my world. Even if you have all the time in the world, you cannot read thoughts about the victim's own prophetic powers, nor can you see their visions. /But/, if you have the same power as someone /and/ you can read minds, you can pierce this resistance. So she can pierce her own subordinates' resistances, but because nobody but her has both, /nobody/ can read /her/ thoughts and memories that directly touch on precognition and viewing the future.

5) By freezing time for herself or her minions, she can look much further into the future, with no hard maximum

6) By /thinking about/ freezing time for herself, she can instantly make herself aware of simple things like how long it would take for someone to unfreeze her, how long it will take for anyone to come here if she never left the room, at what time does the enemy storm the fortress, etc

7) Nobody else knows about 4, and nobody can read this information from her mind, because it pertains to prophetic powers

8) She is the first person to figure out that they can extend the range of the power by freezing time, and she formulates her master plan before anyone else figures out this is possible.

9) Her superiors think she's a pathetic shell of a person who lucked out and was born with some rare and useful powers, so she is not a suspect or considered a threat

10) Because she is considered safe and useful, she ends up something like the 5th most powerful person in the empire, and can use secret police resources pretty much however she wants, as long as she can make it look like it's not a power play or actively treasonous after the fact

11) Thousands of people with prophetic powers different from hers believe the world is going to end around date x as well, and prophetic powers are maddeningly unhelpful in trying to gleam any information on what the threat actually is

The limitations she has to deal with:

1) Her mind will be read fully pretty much every day, and on random occasion several times per day

2) Her superiors, subordinates and pretty much everyone else are working pretty hard to stop the world from ending, they just don't know they have a traitor working against them

3) For the last several years before the apocalypse, the people around her will also know that the precognition can be combined with freezing time. They just think she reported it the second she found out about it (Which agrees with her memories... Most of the time)

4) You can change the future after having seen it, but that depends on /your/ actions. You can't see what would happen if someone else, unrelated to your actions, decides to do something else. If you imagine freezing yourself to see what will happen in ten minutes, the future you see is the one in the world where you froze yourself and didn't go off to do anything else

So, important things I have already decided to have her do:

1) Arrange for the death of every single person in the world other than her who has both precognition /and/ the ability to read minds. They are both really rare powers, and it's nearly unheard of for anyone to have both. Never the less, she looks /real/ close for anyone who does and eliminates them.

2) The empire knows toward the end that they can look further into the future by freezing time viewers in time, but they don't know that she and she alone can read these visions in others' minds. Therefore, she knows everything they have predicted about the future, but they don't know everything she has predicted.

3) By commanding a mind reader to read her own mind after she freezes and unfreezes time for them, she can read the mind of her future self.

4) By precommitting to make random things go poorly for those around her in timelines where things don't work out to her advantage, she makes the main players gravitate toward choosing futures she likes. For example, say the queens want to look at a potential future where they execute this or that powerful subject they have, just to see what happens, who is plotting against them or has skeletons in the closet, etc. She would have set up a dead man's switch for random things to go poorly if she were to die and stop undoing those plans. Think Voldemort in HPMOR setting up the Blood Fort sacrifice to murder hundreds of students, all the while planning to cancel the ritual as long as he wasn't stopped from doing so. By making it appear that things would get visibly worse if she died and stopped being a helpful non-threatening bureaucrat, she closes out futures where she is executed as a precaution.

...Geesh. That's a lot of information. So, is it believable for her to succeed with her plans here? This all happens hundreds of years before my books actually begin. In the first book, my characters end up isolated and stuck in the ruins of the capital of this empire, and figure out /some/ of what happened there leading up to the apocalypse. And also, toward the end of the first book it becomes clear that she set a few things in motion that have yet to play out, even though she died hundreds of years ago.

I want to make sure readers aren't annoyed and feel like this woman couldn't possibly have succeeded in sabotaging all the empire's efforts to avert the end of their civilization. So really, what I'm looking for is, after reading through all this, is there anything you can think of that I might have missed about how she is more vulnerable than I imagine her? Does this all have some weakness I didn't think of? And also just in general, given the powers involved here, is there any cool shit that should definitely be happening that it sounds like I missed?

*** Her superiors' continuous treatment of her as a non-threat feels somewhat of an idiot ball behaviour. Especially with all the power at her disposal and all the incongruent actions they are witnessing from her. This flaw is partially mitigated by #III-4, but not enough to not make them partially feel like hollywood zombies for plot railroading (IMO). So maybe insert some additional circumstances that would allow for her to successfully mask herself for so long?

And one thing I can think of her doing is trying to generate a self-fulfilling prophecy, brute-forcing variations of it until one of them shows in her visions to be powerful enough that once she broadcasts it in the master timeline it will captivate minds to a sufficient degree and start self-propagating until the vague-ish apocalypse prophesised by it can not help but be reenacted. I don't know if this is a cliche solution though, or how well will it suit the rest of your plot and setting structure.

**** She does have her mind read at least once a day, so that's part of why she never comes under suspicion. She also has a long history of mental illness - she was raised up because a lot of people thought "Oh man, what a shell of a person... But you know, I could really make use of those powers of hers..." When she isn't aware of her true motives, she has almost no direction in her life other than trying to be helpful to the people who raised her up, and wanting to feel like she's helping to protect civilization from the mysterious apocalyptic threat everyone is trying to put a stop to. It also helps that she genuinely hates one of the enemies of the country, and that prophecies seem to suggest this particular enemy will be some kind of trigger for the disaster. So anything big she does that she can play off as being a move against that enemy is seen as both more believable /and/ her trying to help.

As for prophecy manipulation, I didn't get into that in my first post because it's a whole other kettle of fish and gets quite complicated as well, but suffice it to say, she's got that covered. Destiny and prophecy can indeed be tinkered with and heavily abused under the right circumstances. The apocalypse she is working toward is 'supposed' to happen, and things go her way a little more easily because of it. Everyone else is trying to push giant boulders up a hill, while she just has to push them off course so they roll back down again. The power of destiny is not so strong that it's 'easy' so long as it favours you, and I hope I'll be able to show that as well, since it has some important limitations, but it's certainly an advantage to be working with it and not against it.

Thank you very much for your input! I realize that I'm only showing a small part of the plot and that that makes it harder to give feedback, but it's useful never the less. Thanks for your time.

** You have an iron buckler (a small handheld shield) with the magical ability to negate kinetic force.

Whenever a sufficiently strong kinetic attack (about the strength of a good punch) hits the front of the shield, the shield negates all kinetic forces applied to its front for 1 second, including the attack that triggered it. Specifically, Newton's laws are broken, as the attacker feels the opposite force pushing back, but the defender feels as though nothing has hit the shield.

This ability can only be triggered once every 5 seconds. If an attack hits after the 1 second negation period but before the 5 second cooldown is over, the shield behaves exactly like a regular iron buckler would. If the shield takes too much damage, the magic is lost.

What can be done with this magic iron buckler?

*** Unlimited delta-v for a spacecraft. Attach a bouncy ball to the buckler with a spring, such that the bouncy ball strikes the buckler every 5 seconds. Any time the buckler is struck, the center of mass of the buckler+bouncy ball system accelerates in the direction of the hammer. This provides a way to accelerate indefinitely, using only [[https://xkcd.com/2115/][a source of electricity]] to keep the bouncy ball moving.

The beauty of Merel's design is that you can keep accelerating at a constant rate indefinitely while using a constant amount of energy (as compared to an exponentially growing amount)

*** If it applies to all impacts, you could use this offensively. For example, bashing someone with the buckler would activate the ability, allowing you to continue the swing without any resistance or additional effort. That could impart a lot more momentum to the target than would otherwise be possible.

You might be able to use this like a high-speed hydraulic press or immovable pivot for a lever.

For the same reason you can bash someone with the buckler without encountering resistance, using the shield to arrest a fall would result in you digging far underground with the shield. So the fall might not kill you, but being stuck underground would.

***** You could hit yourself with the shield to stop a fall in midair. Falling feet first you can pull the shield up under your feet 1s every 5s of falling. So if you can survive impacts of 5s of freefall onto an iron shield this let's you fall from arbitrary heights! This is the equivalent of a 214km/h impact for a 75kg person.

Practically you can double your safe drop distance. If you can drop 1 story safely you can now do 2, 1 story drop onto the shield, and 1 story drop onto the ground.
