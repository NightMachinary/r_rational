Worth the candle hasn't updated in a couple of weeks. Any idea when it's going to update next?


** I don't like such posts. I feel they create an unecessary pressure on the author. He doesn't write on a schedule to avoid the pressure, and now people are asking when will the next chapter be anyways.

*** Fair point, I hadn't considered it when asking.

The reason I made the post is that it hadn't updated in a while (more so than usual), and I was, well, worried that it died. May have been an overreaction, but please believe me that I found myself checking for an updated multiple times a day.

So I looked around for any kind of note on why it's stalled, couldn't find anything, and then asked here, where clearly I got my answer.

If I was aware that the author was on vacation (which was a strong possibility given the summer), well, I'd have just waited patiently.

After thinking about it, I still think it's a legitimate reason for a post, but I could have phrased the question differently, and probably would have avoided implying that I'm asking for an update date, as opposed to making sure the story is not dead.

*** I'm a big fan of Worth the Candle, but the fact that it's so infrequently updated (and I recognize that it's updated in batches and it usually averages out to be at least one chapter a week) stops me from really wanting to support his Patreon. I wish that Alexander Wales wouldn't stress so much about having all his updates ready in a row and would instead stick to a more strict schedule. As it stands, it just feels like you might be paying money for a web serial that gets updated once a month and that kinda sucks.

**** The next update is apparently going to be ~40,000 words, the length of a mid-size novella. I think this is easily worth a few bucks. Looking back, it seems to me the updates average ~2 a week, which is honestly a pretty impressive pace.

******* I think my preference would definitely be in favor of "shorter and more frequent" than "longer than less frequent". Do you know why people opted for the former? Having longer releases means less opportunity (for me) to participate in discussion, which is one of the pleasures of reading a web-serial, since by the time I've finished the 40k words or whatever and venture into the spoilerific discussion thread, several days have passed and active discussion has died down

(when reading for pleasure I slow my reading to maybe ~500w/m -- I could do it faster and just focus on retaining information, but I don't for the same reason I don't fast forward through shows I'm enjoying. So it takes me ~1.5h to read, which I can usually slot in over several nights before bed, but only in so much a quantity. Plus, a more smoothly distributed dose of web serial means I've less opportunity to tire of the work during a long read -- I think enjoyment for me peaks a couple thousand words in and decays from there -- not by much, but not negligibly).

******** my guesses for why people might prefer batches:

the author might have voiced preference for batch. if you look up above, the comment saying "whatever works for the author" has significantly more upvotes than anything else in this thread. (search is not working for me atm, so i can't find that survey.)

batch updates mean fewer errors and more cohesive/satisfying story arcs where the cliffhangers are more like hooks into the next arc, rather than unresolved immediate plots.

people might be like me: my enjoyment ramps up and up the longer i read and get immersed in a story. so i prefer to read for hours at a time, rather than <10 minutes (a few thousand words at 500w/m). but i don't often have enough self-control to put off reading updates to get a big chunk. (plus missing out on the response threads, which is the best part of serials.)

I can understand "he's not updating as frequently as he used to" or "I got addicted to 10 chapters a month plx halp", but these are not "once a month" updates, nor do they merely "usually" average a more than chapter a week.

*** why do you think it's a supposed b-list work? isn't it the main thing he's working on at the moment?

if i ever manage to become a prolific author, i would consider using another pseudonym simply to get a more genuine, naive response from readers judging it on its own merit, and not influenced by my reputation or their own expectations of my work. (so not just because i consider it a potentially sub-par work.)

**** his words not mine. I was reading his patreon page about why he was writing it under CRJ instead of AW. basically he thought the self insert fic would be disliked and he was writing it for himself not for others and he wanted to keep that stress relief outlet separate from the main body of work. But we all love WTC so much he ended up giving in and and admitting he owned it.

I just like that what he considered to be b-list when he started is my most anticipated release.
