*** I'd also be really keen for a synopsis!

(incidentally, does anyone know if modern automatic summarization algorithms can understand narrative structure yet? I tried running the first chapter of HPN20 through smmry.com, which is what autotldrbot uses, but the output wasn't very good. Then I tried genericSummary() in the {LSAfun} R package and it was a bit better but still rather lacking. It looks like TensorFlow has some applications that allow fancier text summarization (i.e. not just important sentence selection) so I might try firing that up later tonight to see what it gets me. Not really my field though so I was wondering what the current state of the art is -- I've seen some articles on using RNNs to write /new/ stories but googling around can't seem to find any devoted purely to summarizing existing ones; edit: it looks like [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02268][this]] and [[http://thescipub.com/PDF/jcssp.2016.178.190.pdf][this]] might be worth adding to my to-read pile, and [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf][this]] looks pretty recent so I might try playing around with their TensorFlow/Python [[https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator][code]])

** I was massively disappointed when I binged through the whole thing and found out it wasn't updated in years, that's why now I'm massively happy that it's finally back, I'm very hyped.

** Damn you. I've been trying to submit this for several minutes now, and it kept telling me it was already submitted and then linking me to the post for chapter 71

[[http://sirpoley.tumblr.com/post/168091740244/harry-potter-and-the-natural-20-chapter-72-sd-19][From Sir Poley's tumblr.]] Seems like it isn't a fluke---he's working on it again.

** Reread the whole thing to get caught back up; it had been a while since I did so! I'm finding the third book to be pretty good, but it has a much different feel than the first two. It felt much more... serious, I suppose? There were still jokes and comedy, but overall it felt more like the author wanted to get on with the story rather than actually just let it continue paralleling the books. The Fiona chapters in particular were just super stressful. I wonder if he just lost the enjoyment of the writing and quit for a few years because of that?

Anyway, the new chapter was a welcome return, and while Sir Poley's tumblr said he doesn't have a set schedule for updates, hopefully we'll see more coming before too long. He has some clean-up to do to dust off the cobwebs; his intro on fanfiction.net is out of date (references having an updated character sheet on his Author page, but none exists), his forum page is full of advertising spam, and his tumblr updates infrequently. Hope this becomes a central project for him again soon!
