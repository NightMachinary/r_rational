** He shouldn't have called Harry Potter "kid." One of the things that's central to the HPMOR Quirrelmort is both his politeness and his distinct voice when talking to Harry.

"Kid" is an Americanism that's not in with the character. We know he calls Harry "boy" and has done so repeatedly in canon.

**** Two things: with "jarring," be very careful about the line between "makes people appropriately uneasy" and "makes people write you off, because you haven't yet earned their faith in an enduring manner (such that they trust that the wrongness has a reason)." This is how Eliezer lost a vast swath of readers in the first 10 chapters of HPMOR (e.g. "kids don't act like that").

Second, even with Quirrelmort being a mask, he spent the vast majority of his life in Britain, and the implications of /that/ should probably be adhered to, unless you want to take out screen time to justify him deliberately losing his native lexicon or whatever.

Edit: as long as I'm making a comment, tiny tiny ^{tiny} note ... use the em-dash (---) for jarring breaks, and ellipses (...) for trailing off. The very first sentence that's in all caps feels to me like it ought end with /DEAD---/ rather than /DEAD.../ because the latter seems to indicate lots of time and space, while the former seems to indicate cut-off.

  I don't know if I said it here or in response to someone else so I'll say it again, this is a very rough draft and I did a poor job of setting up that particular payoff. The whole "Voldemort genuinely realizing that Harry may be correct in evaluating that persisting in his psychopathy is in fact contrary to his own fundamental utility function" thing? That's what's supposed to have caused him to crack. There's a theoretical possibility that the entire structure of this chapter is going to be shuffled and rearranged, and Voldemort's breakdown might happen after the conversation about hedonics that I didn't include in this draft.

I have since then decided for certain that the chapter is going to be restructured/rearranged, and I have a pretty clear idea of how it's going to be done.

That sounds like it may work. Breaking his distinct voice is apparently what you are going for, but you still want his voice to sound British. I assume you are trying to make Voldemort sound a bit ruder and more causal as his ultra polite persona breaks? I wonder what British slang would work best here... possible British slang words to consider: prat, git, twit, twat. I don't actually know British slang, so I can't tell you what would best fit Quirrelmort-mask-cracking-but-still-British Voldemort but hopefully one of those will sound right.

You think this is a "Voldemort wins" premise where Harry loses. That's actually good to know, if it's true.

Is... Well, I don't want to ask a leading question and taint your observations.

Would you be willing to explain how you arrived at that conclusion? I thought I had made it as obvious as possible (without being overbearing) that "the man who variously self-referenced as 'Professor Quirrell' and 'David Monroe' and 'Lord Voldemort' and 'Tom Riddle'" had a deeper agenda than we were aware of during the final arc of HPMOR.

**** I didn't doubt that Quirrellmort has a deep agenda in that snippet. It just didn't seem like there's anyway that Harry has a place in that agenda other than a pawn. Based on what's presented: Quirell behaves in an antagonistic way (rather than like a mentor as throughout most of HPMOR); Harry is about to be mind-wiped and as such unlikely to be a threat to QM. If QM and Harry's goals were aligned, that wouldn't be necessary either.

Now, that's not to say that the story can't easily evolve into one with Harry as the protagonist and we witness his struggles against QM. Or anything else, like us slowly finding out what QMs 'third option' is. None of that would be particularly jarring. But as of the first chapter, it definitely does look like QM has won.

***** I see...

In my original draft, "Chapter 123" was relatively short, and then there was a line break and we moved directly into Chapter 1, just like this...

--------------

Chapter 1: "The Truth, Part 6: A Riddle Reiterated"

"Time is wasting," said Professor Quirrell. "Ask your questions, if you have them."

/Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why must you be this way, why make yourself the monster, why Lord Voldemort, I know you might not want the same things I do, but I can't imagine what you want that makes this the best way to get it.../

(fleeting disorientation)

A rush of adrenaline hit Harry's body like a Stunning Hex and he became accutely aware of a dull ache in his lower lip.

/Aw crap./

If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had just flashed into his mind, it would have come out something like, 'If I estimate the probability of what I just experienced occuring as the result of being Obliviated, versus the probability distribution for all the things that could happen naturally as a result of fluctuations in my body's various metabolic processes, then this experience is significant evidence that I've been Obliviated.'

But what Harry actually thought was, /Aw crap/.

/Question,/ said Harry's Ravenclaw side, /what are the chances that he isn't fully aware of the fact that we know we've been obliviated? You bit your lip before it happened, so you had to have known it was coming.../

--------------

That part is relatively final because most of it isn't mine, it's the beginning of Chapter 108 and I don't believe Chapter 108 plans on changing any time in the foreseeable future. Obviously I already did a "call back" to HPMOR with the "wordless inference" pattern so I'll have to rework that, but that's the flow of where this is going. The problem is that "StP: Redacted" more than doubled in length from what I thought it would be, it's almost a thousand words longer than HPMOR's first chapter; if I went through with my plan of having "Chapter 123" and "Chapter 1" be contained in the same chapter, my first chapter would almost /certainly/ end up /waaaaay/ longer than I intended. You have to hook people into reading, you can't just say "here's my first chapter, it's 30 pages long."

** Harry could have justified his disregard for Moody's warning, as I did when reading chapter 86, by assuming that everyone, as often, mistook common sense for Legilimency. Spreading that misinformation is totally in character for a Riddle - remember the finger snapping?

Also there was the part about Voldemort presumably not being able to use magic directly on Harry.

In fact this evidence is strong enough that I'm expecting you to reveal that he can't enchant Harry or legilimize without eye contact, this instead being a trick. For example, they might both be in the mindscape of a thrall of Voldemort's, or^{in^{the^{mirror}}}

Also if his death caused the end of the world it would hardly be "HE IS HERE. HE IS THE END OF THE WORLD.". If the heat death stuff was the true interpretation of the prophecy, Voldemort would recognize that, for he heard Trelawney's words and remembers Trelawney's voice - unless the heat death first needs to happen for him to recognize it?

*** I don't personally buy into that interpretation. I believe there's been a bit of a debate in the fandom about that for a few years now, whether "super-legilimency" is a real thing or a parlor trick.

This is my own parallel universe, which just so happens to resemble Yudkowsky's universe in every perceptible way up until a point of divergence. If there are an infinite number of universes, then there's a "you" out there in the multiverse who has, down to the atom, been exposed to all the same experiences and thoughts as you (and who's reading these exact words /right now/) whose path diverged significantly from your own at the word "significantly" when Princess Celestia opened an interdimensional portal into the alternate "you"'s bedroom.

As far as Harry using that justification in-universe, sure. If Harry hadn't been incredibly distracted, he might've been able to partake in witty banter for the audiences amusement, but "it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it." Right?

And as far as the magical resonance between Harry and Voldemort, Harry clearly used "Stuporfy" on Voldemort in HPMOR and neither of them died. Maybe I'll have Harry have thoughts about the resonance and Voldemort can interrupt those thoughts with a lampshade. Voldemort /definitely/ crafted a False Memory Charm and stuffed it into Harry's brainhole, and he /definitely/ used Legilimency to pop in and do a bit of executive meddling. They are not inside the mirror.

Also, in much the same way that the original prophecy could've just as easily referred to Neville as it did to Harry, this prophecy could've just as easily referred to Voldemort as it did to Harry. I suppose I'll have to clarify that in the text. To be fair, it's 7pm and I woke up /yesterday/ at 2pm. I started writing this chapter at 2am yesterday, and I finished working on it about 5 minutes before I uploaded it. This is not the final version, I'm just trying to get some feedback.

--------------

In regards to your question about masks...

(I already typed this out before you deleted your comment and I really don't want to waste it.)

Oh but he didn't /purposefully/ discard any masks, they all fell off when he [[/s][spoiler]]. I tried to use dialogue tags and body language and such to show him putting on his Prof. Quirrell mask after the incident (so it would already be firmly in place after the Obliviation), and that trend continues up until the point when [[/s][spoiler]], but then Harry interrupts him.

His 'Voldemort' mask fell off, he regrouped, then put on his 'Prof. Quirrell' mask because it was the mask he was going to need a few moments later. There's no one else in the room listening, unless you count /us/ of course, and he's not currently aware of our existence.

**** A bit of feedback:

1) I would have included a bit more disorientation and confusion on Harry's part after he comes out of the simulation. I don't think that even a strong rationalist like Harry would be able to so quickly come to grips with such a world-shattering realization that the past few eventful days of his life were entirely fabricated, or even that such a thing is possible. It seems like he should at least momentarily consider some alternate hypotheses (maybe that he was somehow teleported somewhere and that someone was impersonating Quirrelmort for some reason) instead of having him pretty much immediately jump to the correct conclusion of a epic-scope memory charm simulation. I also think it would be far more impactful if Harry realizes that Hermione is still dead a tiny bit later on rather than being literally the first implication he realizes. I think you may be suffering a bit from the curse of knowledge of knowing the story you're telling ahead of time, as the scene you're trying to set up makes sense in retrospect, but the dots didn't connect very well for me on my first time reading it through.

2) I really think it's a pretty big oversight to not at least mention Harry's Occlumency. You could at least have Harry try to hastily throw up some Occlumency barriers and have The Enemy easily overcome them, thus demonstrating their irrelevance, but the fact that Harry doesn't even try to resist the eye-contactless Legilimency seems pretty sloppy to me.

3) You're missing a closing apostrophe after 'Friend' in the sentence <"Nothing," said the man Harry had once known as 'Professor,' 'Mentor,' and 'Friend.>

4) I realize you stated you're explicitly moving away from canon on this a bit, but I think there should be a few more serious ramifications for Voldie using magic on Harry, at least make using the memory charm visibly painful and laborious for him. Just having him use magic seemingly effortlessly on Harry seems like a really jarring break from how it's treated in the original series.

Overall really, really good for your first public work. Looking forward to more.

***** Thank you for the feedback.

1) Disorientation and confusion is good, but I'm trying to maintain the illusion of temporality, I don't want time to stop while Harry has an internal monologue. Quirrellmort starts speaking to him before he's even fully out of the simulation, and Harry only has a few disoriented moments before Quirrellmort starts speaking again. I love HPMOR dearly, it has a special place in my heart, but it isn't perfect, and there are a lot of instances where the world stops moving to give Harry time to think. You don't have time to think in the real world. You don't have time to consider alternate hypotheses when The Enemy is speaking directly to you. However, based on your feedback, I will strongly consider reworking the "locate a hypothesis / locate a reaction / terrible realization" sentence to more thoroughly instill a sense of disorientation and confusion, but he only has about 4 or 5 seconds free to think, there are no free "momentarily"s in which to have considerations. I'd like to note that Harry never comes to a conclusion at all, much less jumps to the correct conclusion immediately. All he knows is that Hermione melted and then he was back in the potion room with The Enemy. I also disagree about the impact of the Hermione realization. I think that once he's had time to process that /something/ has happened and that he's lost two days, his first realization is going to be that he's lost Hermione again.

2) Harry is not an Occlumens, he's a little boy who fancies himself an Occlumens. Read the scene where Mad-Eye /immediately/ decimates Harry's barriers. Anyway, "it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it." Right? That's the point. Harry is bewildered and disoriented and his brain is trying to mourn Hermione again, his brain is doing too many different things to retrieve the tag "Occlumency," he doesn't remember what he ate for breakfast that morning and he's certainly not going to remember anything to do with Occlumency. You might be proficient in the proper use of pepper spray, but if you turn around and see a Grizzly charging at you, your brain is going to flush everything that isn't a primal automatic reaction. That's kinda what I'm going for.

#+begin_quote
  but the fact that Harry doesn't even try to resist the eye-contactless Legilimency seems pretty sloppy to me.
#+end_quote

He never thought once about the possibility of eye-contactless Legilimency after it was first mentioned to him (indeed, he didn't even give the warning any recognition at all as it was being given). He was thinking his own private thoughts while Quirrellmort wasn't paying him any attention, he had no rational reason to suspect that Q was capable of doing it and it doesn't make sense for him to try to "resist" it, as if he's aware of it happening in the first place.

3) By Jove, you're right. To be fair, that line probably isn't making the final cut, I was just trying to be done with the draft while not falling back into "draft-style placeholder writing."

Once again, thank you for your analysis. I'm definitely going to take a lot of these things into consideration; just knowing how people react to certain things lets me know where I need to make changes, this is incredibly helpful.

Also, since I keep throwing random tidbits of explanation into all these different replies, I'll put something here too; I don't think a lot of people realize that Quirrellmort's last line isn't referring to any specific person's death, or to "death" at all. I'll need to make it a lot more blatant, I suppose... there's a "happiness" argument that I cut out of here that would've happened after Q says "Does that sound about right" and before he mentions the third option. There's a bit of an argument about "happiness" in HPMOR Ch. 108 that was going to be revisited with stuff about hedonics and "fun" that I would've had to dive heavily into The Sequences for and I just didn't feel like doing all that today, because that would've required me to make a decision about whether or not Harry is allowed to remember that conversation, and I don't trust "sleep-deprived Liz" to make decisions like that.

I'll go ahead and say it obviously, because it was /meant/ to be obvious, the audience is /supposed/ to be perfectly aware of Q's motives before Ch. 1 even starts.

The third option. Quirrell doesn't want to become empathetic, he doesn't care about Salomon's House or any other Baconian and/or transhumanism utopia nonsense, he does not /at all/ want to be "fixed" like the Confessor from Three Worlds Collide. Quirrell also spent 10 years in social isolation floating around in space, and does not want to be alone with his thoughts for trillions of years after the earth is destroyed. I did a bad job setting up the values dissonance between Harry and Quirrell in this draft, and I see now that there is no hope of this chapter being a 5 page introduction before the main event, it's gonna have to top out at over 10,000 words. It's meant to be understood that Quirrell let his mask slip and had small breakdown because he realized that Harry really /was/ right, that the whole transhumanism thing that Eliez- I mean, that HARRY has been preaching, really /is/ correct, that life has value and that /he's/ the one with the problem. Obviously, as a narcissistic psychopath, this is a most unpleasant dilemma. His one joy was killing idiots, and Harry has categorically proven to him that he was "happying" incorrectly. He no longer has any meaning in life and has realized that the only way to end his suffering is to cease to "be." But Harry and all his stupid little Muggles are going to Live Forever in a Science Fiction Utopia In Space, which he may have dreamed of as a very young boy in the orphanage. This fills him with jealous rage. Thus, he settles upon a NEW goal, which is very much meant to be known by the audience but not by Harry:

The cessation of Existence. Oblivion. The destruction, not of the world, not of the universe, but of Reality, and All Possible Realities. Voldemort's goal is to Bring About The End Of The All.

I see clearly now that simply saying "the third choice is the cessation of Existence" was a woefully inadequate attempt at explanation.

****** I see, I didn't realize that Harry /doesn't/ in fact immediately realize that his experiences were faked, though looking back I can see what you were trying to convey. I sort of jumped to that conclusion because he immediately thinks Hermione is dead, which I imagined would only make sense if he thought the events of her resurrection were not true. I guess I have to say if I were placed in Harry's position, thinking that Hermione was dead would not be my first conclusion, I would think that some type of illusion or teleportation magic was at play (even despite the "melting" detail), and probably would continue thinking so until it was shoved in my face that it had all been an elaborate simulation, though maybe I'm not as clever as Harry.

While the desire for temporality is reasonable (I can agree that HPMOR is a bit long winded with Harry's thought processes in places, though I think it's understandable considering Eliezer's goals) I think you sacrifice a little bit too much and make it too hard to understand what Harry is thinking. There is something to be said for the fact that sometimes the speed of thought can be significantly faster than the speed of speech/text, such that it can be very reasonable to have a solid paragraph of thought description that only takes a second or two in "story time". I admit that it may be the case that I err on the side of enjoying an unrealistic level of description though.

Personally, my interpretation of the HPMOR canon was that Harry is a reasonably strong Occulmens, aided by The Enemy's adult thought processes being projected onto his immature mind. He seems to at least have satisfied a certified Occlumens instructor (though now that I think of it, I can't remember if it's ever stated explicitly whether or not Harry formally graduated from his instruction with Mr. Bester, though I know it's implied in several places). And I didn't mean to imply that Harry would have been trying to use Occlumency immediately upon being the room, just that he would have tried it after The Enemy explicitly explained eye-contactless Legilimency. While I concede I /am/ considering this from the comfort of my cushy armchair, Legilimency and Occlumency go together naturally enough in my brain that I thought of it /immediately/, which means I can't help but find it something of an oversight that Harry doesn't think of it at all. I appreciate what you were trying to go for with making him too panicked to think clearly enough to consider it, but I can't imagine that I'm the only one who's going to think that you missed something really important if you just don't mention it /at all/. Especially considering that you're branching this off of HPMOR, in which Eliezer writes Harry as being frankly /inhumanly/ good at thinking of such things ;)

I didn't want to bring it up in my initial feedback as I thought it a bit more of a quibble of subjective asthetics, but since you expound on it a bit more I have to say I'm not that much of a fan of adding impulsive behavior to The Enemy's base psyche. My interpretation of The Enemy in HPMOR is that while he is a narcissistic psychopath, he is at his core deeply rational, always choosing his actions based on maximum estimated utilions per expenditure of effort, and that he sees actions such as petty tantrums to be needlessly emotional and beneath him. In my opinion this unyielding rationality is a brilliant way of humanizing an otherwise very dislikable character, because even if you disagree with his values you can still admire his unflinching rationality (especially so considering the target audience of the story). Having some element of genuinely admirable character is an important part of making antagonists more than just clichéd Evil People who do bad things Because Evil, and having Voldemort be a genuinely rational character that harms people not out of sadism or carelessness but because it's simply the most effective way to achieve his goals is a beautifully effective way of achieving this, imo. That said, I do think your exploration of Voldemort genuinely realizing that Harry may be correct in evaluating that persisting in his psychopathy is in fact contrary to his own fundamental utility function is a /fascinating/ one, and I'm interested to see more of that idea explored in the actual text.

Anyway, even if I don't agree on an aesthetic level with all of your choices, I think your decisions are reasonable and I'm looking forward to seeing how your story evolves :) Don't take my opinions as anything more than a single subjective data point, I just hope that I managed to give you some of the different perspectives you were looking for in asking for feedback.

I'm just adding layers. Voldemort isn't going to be exhibiting any further impulsive behaviours, this is the only shown breakdown.

Well, your Voldermort apparently has the capability to run thoughts of other people at subjective speeds around 100x normal, so it would make sense if he could partially use this on himself when he needs extra thinking time. And Harry is a mind copy of him, so if you really wanted to +handwave+ justify Harry's thinking speed, you could claim he subconsciously utilized an ability Voldemort had modified himself to have.

I don't think it is. He brews the potion to extinguish the flame in the door to the Mirror room on the way in, but on the way out he effortlessly banishes the flame with a twitch of his wand. When he takes the newspaper from Harry to read the article about Rita Skeeter, the narration specifically says it was like he cast off a pretense of humanity, that he read each page in under a second. And there are multiple instances where Harry notes that Quirrell comes to the correct conclusion even when his priors are wrong, and I very strongly feel like those are references to Quirrell using Legillimancy on Harry. He has access to all of Slytherin's secrets. It isn't much of a stretch to imagine him being vastly more powerful than he lets on, and capable of effortlessly performing Legilimancy on Harry in spite of the resonance.

It's clear that Voldemort is immensely powerful, but that he's not capable of bringing his power to bear against Harry because it will resonate back against him with equal force.

#+end_quote

Yes, that'd be all well and good, but he didn't assume /anything/. Moody gave him his warning, and Harry didn't react to it /in any way at all whatsoever/, it was like it didn't happen.

--------------

Harry almost lost his grip on only pretending to hallucinate, only pretending to be the imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as the Legilimency tore apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe that he was on fire -

Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody's chin.

"You're out of practice, boy," Moody said. Harry wasn't looking at the man's face, but his voice was deadly grim. "And I'll warn you of this but once. Voldie isn't like any other Legilimens in recorded history. He doesn't need to look you in the eyes, and if your shields are that rusty he'd creep in so softly you'd never notice a thing."

"Duly noted," Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more shaken than he'd have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn't been anywhere near that powerful, and had never tested Harry like that. Pretending to be someone hurting that much had... Harry couldn't find words for describing what it felt like to contain an imaginary person in that much pain, but it hadn't been normal. "Do I get any credit for being an Occlumens in the first place?"

--------------

So I'll give him that, he didn't necessarily forget because he went off to cleverly play with his Time-Turner immediately afterwards. His thoughts are entirely centered on having his Occlumency barriers demolished, the immediately important concepts were /out of practice/ and /rusty shields/.

** This is the HPMOR!darkfic spin-off I didn't know that I needed. Very brilliant, very dark. The text does a good job with making us throw out all of our previous assumptions about Quirrelmort (his seemingly accidental rage filled toss of the Cauldron). This creates ambiguity and fear (will Harry die, will he torture's Harry's family in retaliation, etc.) In terms of getting an ending as Happy as canon, it makes it seem impossible, yet at the same time I want to see Harry try (although I would be interested in seeing this interpretation of Quirrelmort in action). Also, with the entire epilogue being an obliviated memory now, well did Quirrelmort know that was Dumbledore's real plan or guess at it? The explanation for Dumbledore's plan makes sense in hindsight, but did Quirrelmort fabricate this just to appease Harry's ego? If so, you will need an explanation for all of Dumbledore's weirdness, hopefully something more satisfying than senility and dementia. Remember that your are free to rewrite facts established as being merely part of the memory charm simulation, but at the same time, some readers may forget this so it will help to remind them.

Let's look at all the moving parts.

--------------

Rita's eyes narrowed. "Who do you think you are?"

"How very foolish," the man said dryly. "It would have been wise to memorize the face of the disguised Death Eater training Harry Potter to be the next Dark Lord. After all," a thin smile, "that certainly sounds like someone you wouldn't want to run into on the street, especially after doing a hatchet job on him in the newspaper."

--------------

she had a time and a place and a beetle to be. *She'd just* [emphasis mine] received an anonymous tip about Madam Bones making time with one of her younger assistants. That would be worth quite a bonus if she could manage to verify it, Bones was high on the hit list. The tipster had said that Bones and her young assistant were due to eat lunch in a special room at Mary's Place

--------------

"Miss Skeeter," said Quirrell, "I had hoped to find some lever that would prove persuasive. Yet I find that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of simply crushing you."

--------------

"Do you mind -" said Harry, at the same time as Professor Quirrell said, "I'm afraid I -"

Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn't.

"- need to go off and set something in motion, Mr. Potter.

--------------

The time was just before noon, and Harry and Professor Quirrell were seated at the foot and head of a wide, long, flat table, in a sumptuously appointed private room with thoroughly cushioned couches and chairs along the walls, and soft curtains hanging everywhere.

They were about to eat lunch in Mary's Place,

--------------

My interpretation of all this:

Chapter 26 begins on Sunday morning when the paper comes out

Harry leaves with Prof. Q. at 10am

they teleport to Diagon Alley

Prof. Q. leaves Harry and "runs into" Rita (who is there only because /he/ left an anonymous tip before they left to ensure she would be in the room at the time he scheduled)

He offers her the chance to retract her accusation against him before casting final judgement.

--------------

I might very well be wrong, but I think he already knew she was an Animagus.

Even though he's probably the one responsible for tricking her and therefore already knows the full contents of the article, he's not allowed to publicly know until Sunday, so he can't confront her before then. I'm about 99.999% certain that Act 6 of Chapter 25 happens during Chapter 26 when Prof. Q. leaves Harry by the newsstand; he had already made the reservation for Mary's Room by then, so it had to have been him who dropped the anonymous tip that caused Rita Skeeter to spy on the room. He already planned on her being there, he was just offering her a chance to repent.

I really don't think there's any evidence in the text of HPMOR that supports the "Legilimancy without eye contact" theory other than Moody's warning. Quirrell and Skeeter were having a conversation face to face. I think the bigger issue that most people are concerned about is whether or not Quirrell/Voldemort can use Legilimancy/magic-in-general on Harry at all. I think the evidence is there, but I just finished reading HPMOR again like a month ago, I'm not gonna turn around and read it again immediately to look for that evidence.
