** Thanks. My only critique is mainly a stylistic one so do with t what you will. When you switch POV you have a heading announcing who the new character being followed is. That's totally fine but you then start every new section with the name of that character again. Most of the sections seems to start with "Ruby was doing x" or "POV character thought y". I feel like you could experiment some more with transitions. Other than that I'm really enjoying this.
