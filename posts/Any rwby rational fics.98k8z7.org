Are there any rational rwby fics which are neither crossovers nor abandoned?

I remember the one where Jaun had a different semblance which was really good, but that hasn't had an update posted on here in a long time.

Thanks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132119/1/Reiteration][Reiteration]] is the closest one I can think of. It's pretty solidly handled for a self insert, though it stirs pretty quickly away from canon.

*** Decent writing, but the author falls constant prey to the fact that it's a self-insert. At one point he tries to rectify this and grow his character, but the crux of it is that the main character is a stagnant cynic who is always self-justified, and up against strawmen.

*** While it certainly contains rational overtones, it is not without flaws.

Main character sometimes does Sherlock Scans, for example.

Also, " it stirs pretty quickly away from canon" is an understatement. Winter Schnee is a younger sister, for example. There are hierarchies. It is basically an AU at this point. RWBY in name only.

​

I, for one, liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826167/1/The-Name-of-the-Game][The Name of the Game]] by Literalsin much more. (Thanks to [[/u/Random_Cheerio]] for reminding me of it).

​

EDIT: I just reached chapter 36. Be advised, the author likes his unforeshadowed shocking swerves and goes deep into AU territory. I stand by my classification: it is RWBY in name only.

** I like a lot the ongoing fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863738/1/Relic-of-the-Future][Relic of the Future]] by Coeur Al'Aran. It feels the most rational of all the fics he has written, and the plot is different from the show, as Jaune goes back in time and encounters younger versions of team RWBY and others.

*** Anti-recommendation as a rationalist fic - the main character doesn't pursue his goals so much as go with the flow and follow along with other peoples', the "munchinkry" is just him being given an obviously broken power and doing the bare minimum with it, the lack of enemies at his level that can give him a challenge leads to a constantly, absurdly increasing power level for enemies even past the usual for Gamer fics, and it kind of rambles on for a while before it gets to a point where the plot becomes interesting.

It's nice as a light-novel style power fantasy, and the worldbuilding is decent, but it's not great as a ratfic.

***** Luck was introduced but it was then literally never used after some gambling IIRC. :D Readers joke about it all the time.

******* Yea but my point was that the whole thing shouldn't have had luck from the beginning and it was introduced, used, and then just discarded without MC doing anything with it. Even if it has a good explanation.

I'd recommend Worth the Candle obviously. :D I don't think there is anything better.

I just saw some skeleton soldier manga that I liked because it used a time loop.

Fanfic.org has a section for "video game plot": [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Video-Game-Plot/105176/]]

There was some fun story about someone rebirthing as spider in some dungeon.

Chinese wuxian stories feel a lot like gamerfics in a way. But all I've read feel too similar to each other.

** RWBY has a bit of a cult following, and a decent sized fanfiction community, but I don't think the type of people who like it are the type to like rational fiction. Add to that the difficulty of figuring out how to mesh whatever ends up being canon in the future into it, when the whole story hasn't been released, means that the process is much harder. Sure, you could make it up yourself, but that would destroy some of the point of writing a fan work, wouldn't it? It's different from Harry Potter or Naruto, while also being different from the other fandoms we have works for here in that it's not quite obscure enough that writing fanfiction for it alone is unique.

So no.

**** You're considering the probabilities wrong. I'm saying P(rational|RWBY) is small, you're saying that P(RWBY|rational) is large. Whether or not you're right about people on [[/r/rational]] being RWBY fans, we still can't predict whether RWBY fans are prone to browsing [[/r/rational]]. (Which I have a strong prior against due to habit; not many people in /general/ are prone to browsing [[/r/rational]].)

***** P(rational|Any fandom whatsoever) is small. However, your original point was about probability of liking rwby given liking rational fic, not the other way around. The probability of any randomly selected rwby fan liking rational fic is entirely irrelevant. Rational fic probably has a smaller readership than the entire rwby fanbase. So liking rwby is not even weak evidence that one isn't into rational fic. You're doing the equivalent of saying "people who like apples are less likely to like microwavable sauerkraut." As far as I know almost no one likes microwavable sauerkraut, that's not something particular to apple eaters. The smell is repugnant. Better to get it fresh and cook it some other way.
