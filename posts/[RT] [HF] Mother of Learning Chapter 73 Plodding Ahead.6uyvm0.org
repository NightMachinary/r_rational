*** I'm curious what her response is going to be when they actually show up with Grey Hunter eggs. She seemed pretty unflappable, but two unknown teenagers with vast magical skills showing up outside her undetectable residence with items she wanted but had yet to request from them should merit some reaction. I guess they could bring Lukav or Kael along, since she's somewhat familiar with them, Alanic too, I wonder?

It would be funny if the eggs weren't an ingredient for some potion or ritual, but just something she really wanted to try eating.

Did that one simulacra of Zorian's turn into some sort of gun design enthusiast? It sounds like it started with normal anti-personnel rifle and now is playing with some huge magic-assisted anti-materiel rifle. The only job for the golems will be to make sure the eggs don't get crushed, because it's going to have absurd firepower enough on its own.

**** One use of grey hunter eggs would be to farm them. I don't think that's Silverlake's plan, but it could be worthwhile after the timeloop ends, even if just as a source of enhancement potions. Security would be tricky; I think individual alchemical metal cells with airlocks for feeding, all inside a pocket dimension, could be viable.

Why wait that long? Just put it on a magical platform, lower it into the gully, and fire into the hole. Based on the trap simulacrum's experience, it'll sense them coming, but they should still have a moment of time to fire before it emerges.

Myself, I'm curious about what kind of ammunition they plan to load up that will be suitably devastating to the spider without damaging the eggs.

******* I dont think they use a lot of man-portable firearms in universe against holmes, they'd be using cannons and magic rather than anti-material rifles.\\
That said, the ideal ammunition would be something like the Lehigh Defense extreme penetrator. Start with a bullet shaped bullet, monolithic hardened copper or brass, cut four scalloped bits off the tip, chop the nose flat. Ends up looking like you broke a Phillips head screwdriver. Tissue and viscera is directed outward by the scallops, cutting through other soft tissue like a diesel powered pressure washer. The exoskeleton contains the damage. And because it does not rely on expansion to create its expanded wound tract, penetration remains deep. Probably will exit the arachnid.

That said, RR won't be on their own. They'll have an army behind them, this time with summoned demons. I can only imagine that there will be quite a lot of combat once they break out of the loop.

  2. chasing off the hydra, some speculations, and some banter (1,422 \ 18%)

  3. getting one new infobit from the Guardian, tying up two “loose ends” that I remember being discussed here (spamming of the Guardian with questions, and bringing the Orb inside a Black room) (2,453 \ 32%)

  4. the public's eye on Kael and on Imaya's house (457 \ 6%)

  5. meeting with a fire elemental (638 \ 8%)

  6. the House Letova heist (582 \ 7%)

  7. fast-forward sequence for nine restarts (804 \ 10%)

I feel like #4, #5, #6 were too interesting to get so little screentime. To me, they felt rushed in the manner that the later chapters of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][/The Games We Play/]] have felt rushed.

How would you go about fixing that if you wanted to make them bigger, though? Move them to the next chapter to allocate them more space? Make #2 and #3 the shorter scenes? Something else?

I'm rather curious about what kind of payload will be in the cannon. Regular bullets would be problematic, indeed, although it's likely that at least a few eggs would survive. OTOH, a sufficiently potent magical warhead might work well, especially if they can get a shot off while it's still in its lair.

***** I've always felt that each arc of MoL lends itself fairly well to being its own book, such that a published version would be a trilogy. There would be plenty of opportunity to flesh things out, but in this case, I feel like this timeskip would still be useful. There's just too much minutiae that could be seen as distracting from the overall story. Their actual goals are much more limited than their eventual skillsets would indicate:

1. Leave the loop.

2. Neutralize RR.

3. Prevent the Ibasen attack. 3a.Neutralize the necromancer mayor. 3b.Neutralize the Dragon Cultists in and around Cyoria.

Everything else is just a bonus they were forced to acquire to achieve their goals.

Ways the fire Elemental Salamander Kilnfather thing would relate to Veyers' bloodline awakening ritual:

*Yellow, slitted eyes

*Fire magic

*Elemental spirit infused into living beings

*Hostile tendencies

I'm still assuming he's RR, because of Zach's memory wipe and the timing and thoroughness of his disappearance. But there are still a ton of unknowns.

*** About 1.75-1.85 years, if they managed to use all 3 of the Black Rooms for an extra 45 days each loop. I've got to wonder if Zorian is going to hit his peak mana capacity soon.

I'm not sure how much Zach's skills are improving, but Zorian seems to have made considerable progress over that skip. And they're even richer now? If they don't blow all their money on anti-Ibasen invasion measures and paying back people who helped them upon leaving the loop, I think they're set for life.

I feel like once they leave the loop and figure out RR, RR isn't going to be much of a match, even if Zorian doesn't get the doubled mana capacity upon leaving the loop that Zach has currently.

They never came up with a viable reason for it, beyond wondering if it's a super-rare Noveda trait. Bloodlines in general don't work that way though, since they decrease initial reserves by tying up a portion of mana into a permanent magical ability.

****** I don't consider it plausible.

The only thing we've really been told about merging two souls is that "the resulting entity is virtually always rendered insane or otherwise defective from the stress of the merger". "But!" you say, "if it's two copies of the same soul, then there should be no stress and no insanity!" Well, either the resulting soul will be different to the two inputs, or it won't. If it is different, then we can expect insanity etc. If it's not different, then why would it have doubled mana capacity?

And the tradeoff between capacity and control [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/sapient-species-of-the-world/#comment-196][extends to all souls]]. Even if you could somehow double your mana capacity without altering any other aspect of your soul (highly unlikely IMO), it would not be free; you would lose a great deal of control, just as if you had a larger mana pool to start with.

#+begin_quote
  "Ha. Well, it's not just that," Zach said. "The fact I was able to keep up with the academy curriculum at all, even before the time loop, pretty much shuts down the theory I'm just lucky. I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too... convenient to be natural."
#+end_quote

Edit: I think it's fair to say that Zach never got a good measure of his mana capacity before entering the loop, because Zorian didn't either, and Zorian was seemingly a much better student.

I've read most? of the same posts as you, so I can see where you're coming from that even if two of the "same" soul were merged, there's no guarantee that it would be problem free. But Zach and Zorian have the Marker built into their very soul, and that thing has a relative Swiss Army Knife amount of functions.

My view is this: the Guardian of the Threshold grabs the soul with the Marker from outside the loop, places it in the body inside the loop, the Marker combines the two souls and from that point on directs the loop to no longer create copies of that soul. Then when the loop ends, the Guardian will collect the soul from inside the loop and place it back in the body it was taken from. What I'm expecting is that when Zorian's soul from inside the loop is placed into his real world body, his (hopefully not too defective) Marker will then do the soul combining that Zach gained upon entering the loop. This will probably suck for Zorian, since his soul has diverged considerably from what it was before it entered the loop, but it shouldn't be fatal, because plot armor. Just weakness and a really bad headache for a little while, like with normal soul damage.

Of course, we only saw that near the end of an iteration, and it was an iteration where he had an idea that there were other loopers, so it's not surprising that he would have collected a suitable weapon. What would be more interesting is his confrontation with Zorian at the very beginning of the next iteration, before he had time to assault the treasury or visit another continent (and he certainly didn't fight QI).

The first being the Silent Gateway adepts activating the Bakora gates, the next was the red robed fanatics whom were releasing the Primorial with their chanting.

- What does this tell us about the nature of this mechanic? Next question is, does this help Z&Z in any way?

- nice to see a return of the magical rifle

- Lots of good info about portable dimensions.

- Zorian using soul magic as a means to telepathically communicate with his simulacrum. You guys predicted it!

- The Grey Hunter. How does a magical canon /not/ destroy the babies on her belly. So what's the plan, Zorian? Now I can't wait for the /next/ chapter.

Not for centuries, at least. And there is a chance that something inside actively broke the mechanism. Say, *a giant rampaging hydra*..."

Zorian gave up this method of storing information after learning the more efficient memory packaging technique. But combining this with the Orb's vast storage capacity seems to allow for munchkining lots of stuff across restarts?

I could not find any indication of whether or not the objects can be magical. But taking the word "blueprint" optimistically, we can expect that with good shaping abilities and enough crystalized mana, it should be possible to instantiate various magical objects in arbitrary numbers. On the other hand, Zorian does not seem to be using this method (at least, explicitly) for creating things, so maybe it only works for mundane stuff.

*** You may have a good point there. Zorian has focused on using his headspace efficiently, so he has just stored blueprints for notebooks, and later just for the ink on them. But with practically unlimited space, yeah, he should be able to store blueprints for instantly fabricating golems, or his prototype magic cannon.

You're probably right about magic items needing more work, though. You can't craft a spell formula without being able to actually cast the spell. In light of the latest world building post, I'd say that the mage has to direct mana into the formula in much the same way as directing mana into the elements of a regular spell.

So he could likely fabricate golem bodies en masse, but he'd have to individually craft the animation cores, which was always the hardest job.
