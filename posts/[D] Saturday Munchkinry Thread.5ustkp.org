Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

*** If it's a generic fantasy realm and not Earth, the maps on my phone would be useless, unfortunately, but I'd still have a major leg up in naval navigation because of my watch. Assuming a cosmological setup more or less analogous to ours, a way to measure time with precision would allow for longitudinal navigation that would be impossible without it.

Other than that, I honestly don't think any of my items would be useful. A pocketknife with extreme durability and self-repair is cool, but not exactly a major martial force-multiplier. Lacking a data connection, my phone's primary use would likely be as a calculator. I'd mostly have to rely on my knowledge of more applicable technologies (steam, gunpowder, etc.) if I wanted to make any real waves. I suppose the batteries in my phone and flashlight could do some interesting things once I had a use for electricity, but a few meager watts of 3.7v, even in perpetuity, would be hard to leverage into much.

** You can think of "what if" questions about past events and suddenly you (also) have the memories of the you from that (simulated) timeline.

Both the canonical and alternate kind of mesh together so small differences are harder to spot and larger differences have a kind of super imposed feel.

As you dismiss the scenario you lose the memories (like a dream) but you can keep records as usual.

Can you conquer the world?

[edit]

The implicit premise of the "what if" simulation is that it's about possible worlds, not an information pump or a genie where you state the end state and see how you get there, but you state a possible divergence (e.g. different outcome in some action, different choice) and you remember how that unfolded. For example if you had to guess a 128 bit number you can't simulated "what if I guessed the right number" and "remember" it, but you need to ask "what if I guessed the first bit is zero" and brute force it.

Another implicit constraint (it's better to spell it out) is that it takes time to go through the "new memories", as would take to go through regular memories.

  Consider a function that iterates through all possible passwords. I choose password N=1 to test. What if I were to test password N, and if it fails, to consider a 'what if' had I tested password N+1 instead?
#+end_quote

The recursive behavior allows you to test any finite numbers of possibilities in zero time. My simulated "what if" tries the first password in the list. If it fails (which is likely), then the simulation starts a simulation of its own to try the second password. If that fails, then the simulation's simulation starts a simulation to try to the third password. This continues until the correct password is found, which halts the recursion.

This can be used to solve any problem which can be iterated. Bank account passwords, testing of new machinery, design of ideal spaceships by brute force, etc.

- The sphere cannot move once created.
- At creation time you choose one natural law as expressed by a mathematical formula. Within the AoE that formula is inverted so that, e.g., F = 1/ma or a = m/F.
- Only one sphere can be extant at a time.
- The sphere lasts as long as you concentrate on it.
- There is a 10s cool down between uses.
- For some bizarre reason all physics within the sphere remains exactly the same except for the one modification you've made. In your munchkinry you may need to explain what that means.

What is "1" in those systems?

Normally, when 1 newton of force acts on 1 kg of matter, it results in 1 m/s^{2} of acceleration, and a naive interpretation says that inverting it should have no effect (1^{-1} = 1).

However, imagine a system where 1 newton of force is acting on 1000 g of matter instead of 1 kg. It would still result in 1 m/s^{2} acceleration before inverting, but the inverted value would be changed by a factor of a million.

I can't see how that would be possible.

For each physical law you can invert, there is a set of inputs at which inverting it does nothing (i.e x = x^{-1,} ignoring units).

In my first example, that is 1 N and 1 kg resulting in 1 m/s^{2} both before and after inversion. Assuming that that was the set-point, changing it to 1 N and 2 kg would be 0.5 m/s^{2} before and 2 m/s^{2} after, and more importantly, changing it to 1 N and 0.001 kg would be 1000 m/s^{2} before and 0.001 m/s^{2} after.

In my second example, the set point is 1 N and 1 g resulting in 1 km/s^{2} both before and after inversion. Assuming that that was the set-point, changing it to 1 N and 2 g would be 0.5 km/s^{2} before and 2 km/s^{2} after, and more importantly, changing it to 1 N and 1000 g would be 0.001 km/s^{2} before and 1000 km/s^{2} after.

The first and last examples are identical before inverting ( 1000g = 1 kg, 0.001 km/s^{2} = 1 m/s^{2)} but wildly different after the magic is applied.

*** Hmmmm.

Invert gravity - anything in the sphere is flung into the air (on exiting the top of the sphere, it follows a ballistic trajectory)

Invert (electromagnetic) inter-atomic binding forces - anything in the sphere disintegrates and the separate atoms are violently flung apart.

Invert friction - with careful choice of units, any moving object of known initial speed on entering the sphere can be accelerated to an arbitrary given exit speed. (More complex than either of the above)

Invert the strong nuclear force - I'm not quite sure what this does, but I suspect that the only thing left within several kilometres is a large crater which still glows a few centuries later. There will certainly be a lot of shattered atoms.

*** Interesting question! I think the best application of this power is to invert the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay#Natural_sciences][exponential decay laws]]: x = exp(-A*t).

*Radioactive decay*

N/N_0 = exp(-lambda t). After inversion, N/N_0 = exp(lambda t). That means it is no longer a radioactive decay. /New matter is generated from nothing/. You get free nuclear fuel and, in the long run, free energy.

The process will be at its fastest if you use the least stable isotopes. That means you will have to be extremely careful or your setup will go horribly wrong.

*Capacitor charge*

You can cause exponential growth of electric charge in the capacitor. This solution also gives free energy, but might be a bit safer (and slower. and less exciting).

*Other ideas*

Beer froth also obeys the law of exponential decay! It means that... actually, I don't think it is useful.

Maybe you can turn [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation][time dilation]] to your advantage, I am not sure.

***** Even given that, you still get a sphere of destruction. For example F=1/ma, smaller particles moving produces more force than large ones. The brownian motion of the particles that make up for example a brick wall, each atom would have an incredible amount of force. It would disintergrate and explode, the phyiscal law that allowed it to exist had changed to the extent that it can no longer exist in that state. The force of the air particles hitting into each other might even be enough to cause nuclear fusion. Thus, sphere of destruction.

The specifics change with the law being changed, but in each case I can think of normal matter is not able to survive the change. The physical law changing would have to only effect things on a macro scale to be function usefully.

In which case I'd probably switch some constants to do with nuclear fusion and make an absurd amount of energy and thus money, use it to fund existential risk projects and a lavish lifestyle. There might be some constraints but generally speaking it's hard to completely control someone with the ability to fly by hopping on a 5m long pogo stick and turning off gravity, as well as the capacity to destroy any extant material and be a one man nuclear state.

Also I'm sure there'd be some way to use gravity to make an alcubierre drive, so I guess explore the universe as a stretch goal.
