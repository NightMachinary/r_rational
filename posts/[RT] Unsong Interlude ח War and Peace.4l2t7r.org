  So “unity made manifest by symbols and angels” equals “Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels”.

My sides -- the wordplay in Unsong is simply superb

** Oh my god I laughed so hard I'm crying. Kissinger, and then Nixon visiting hell instead of china, and then Outer Gate, all in a row, just destroyed me. Dear lord.

** On one hand, I can't help but feel the actual plot has been moving along very slowly recently, with a lot more interludes and asides, and few chapters that focus on Aaron or Ana.

On the other hand, Alexander somehow managed to find a connection between God and Karl Marx that makes perfect sense. I don't think any piece of fiction has ever /impressed/ me more than Unsong has. This may be on its way to supplanting Worm as my favorite book/story.

*** I think Worm impresses me more, but only for sheer speed and length in which it's written. The same goes for Homestuck. Unsong is the first to impress me in the sense of "there's no way someone could do enough research to find a way to make everything fit". It's like that movie where they gave Excalibur both origin stories and had it make sense, except it does that constantly.
