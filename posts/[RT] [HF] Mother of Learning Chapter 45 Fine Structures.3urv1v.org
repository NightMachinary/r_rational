I do not disagree, but isn't it more likely that Daimen, as the prodigal son, has some degree of decent poker face? Especially since Zorian constantly harps on about how Daimen is so "charming" and good at talking to people?

I mean, you've gotta have some degree of sociopathy and psychopathy to support the invasion, considering how many innocents die in horrible ways, and how summoning the primordial seems to involve the ritual sacrifice of a little girl.

** If Zorian is going to be doing combat sparring then he needs to do it how he'd do it in the field. That means mind attacks while doing physical attacks and using items, he's nerfing himself hard to fight on an even playing field with Taiven. If he used items and mind magic he'd likely mop the floor with her and need to fight two people at once. If he intentionally wasn't using mind magic I'd hope for at least a line about it, but nothing.

Finally we are getting into the part of the story where Zorian does everything, he hasn't been exploiting this enough. He has infinite money, why not buy mercenaries and go kill bad guys and dragons and stuff to get combat experience? Or get the best personal instruction from all the best masters in the world like Taiven said. I truly don't think Zorians excuse of being busy is enough, he could have had people teaching him from day one. Money is power, yet Zorian only thought of the idea years later.

I think it's more of a personality flaw than anything, which is fair. Zorian (despite all his complaints) is a simple hard worker, he gets a task and completes it to the end, no matter how boring or harsh. He doesn't look for exploits or loop holes really. He hasn't really taken advantage of the time loop yet. Sure he's gotten teacher and spider help by tricking them or giving away things that won't matter at the end of the reset, but nothing major.

Anyone from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] could exploit the time loop better, but I doubt many of us would work as hard. Different methodologies but looking for exploits would probably win every time, after all you only need one good exploit to become very powerful.

Also as a side note why do people never erect shields that protect them as they move? Shields seem pretty useless unless you are prepared for an attack as they are stationary.

Combat reflexes are very useful for fights. By focusing single mindedly on those he is giving himself a valuable head up- mind magic is erratically reliable against prepared mages, items are very context dependent, combat reflexes almost always work. He can later learn how to incorporate mind magic and items into that style.

He explained in chapter. He's continually been facing issues that require him to build up some skill (recently, that mental packet which is degrading and which carries critical information and red cloak) and hasn't had time for a more ambitious approach. He has been trying to get the best instruction from the best masters in the world in mind magic. He has advanced mind readers, and enough mind magic and combat item magic to defeat most enemies he faces.

He has potent exploits- powerful mind magic, invisibility, bombs, golems. He's made excellent use of those to punch well out of his weight class, but he does face a big issue- he faces many enemies, and one good exploit can be countered by their allies. He needs lots of good exploits. A lot of that comes from his hard work. I don't know how well [[/r/rational]] people would do with gathering enough tricks to beat everyone.

So does every other mage worth their salt(other than the mind magic part) thats not an exploit.

The memory pack is a problem which can probably be solved in a couple months by a mixture of single minded research while ignoring everything else, money and time travel trickery.

The problem is Zorian is doing exactly what Zack is doing, he's trying to get good enough to beat the invasion on his own. He has two allies and only because they basically fell into his lap. He's not thinking big enough. You can't out hard work an entire country, you need men and troops of your own.

********** Well basically it's risk vs reward and with the time loop he doesn't really have risk. If he can make suicide rings that will kill him if he is unconscious or hurt mentally, he will be immune to mind magic control, especially if he can figure out how to avoid sleep for a month even if it hurts his body.

If he can also make his suicide rings able to destroy his body totally (some type of magical acid?) he is basically immune to soul raping as it's been shown that necromancers need a body, which is how he escaped red robe the first time. He can cover himself in so many failsafe suicide devices that he'll always die before mind or soul death. He is now invincible and only really needs to worry about the time loop degrading and red robe finding him.

Now he can take huge risks. Red robe wasn't able to find him the first time, it's logical he couldn't a second time, especially if he does it smart. He only meets his men by proxy, letter, simulacrum if he can make one etc. He could even train his divination with the spider tribes, he's good at it after all.

If his mercenaries turn on him so what, he'll die via suicide and start over, more informed and ready to lead.

If all that isn't enough he can blame it on zack and use him as a distraction. Zack can have his own army that is much more visible which red robe will target first.

Your suicide bombing plan isn't without risk either and it's not that easy. The gate is obviously warded heavily so he can't just teleport golems in, he has to teleport them outside the wards and walk them in. Don't you think explosive golems have been used before in the history of war, it's probably an established tactic with a known defense (blow them up before they come close).

He's noted that doing that is risky, because other things could trigger those states, and he has no way to avoid sleep for a month. Randomly dying also carries some risk- if it happens enough he could draw attention and he hates dying.

Extended interaction carries a heavy risk of being tracked. The first time Red Robe had little to go on. This time he would have more to track. Proxies and letters can be tracked, he can't cast Simulacrum.

Better to carefully investigate each mercenary company, a skill which requires good mind magic.

I presume he intends to do it at the end of the month and if he fails he'll likely just die. Red Robe isn't likely to be around the gate anyway, Red Robe has his own gate.

Learn it then, he has money, he can do a lot more than he currently is. Divination isn't an end all tracking art, I don't think it's that easy to be tracked, they have to know what they are looking for in the first place, which is where a distraction comes in. Also remember he'd be doing this (and telling his men) that this is for a government or some other entity, red robe wouldn't immediately think time traveler. Maybe he can be an offshoot of the cult of the dragon below, they are surely crazy enough.

Every plan has it's risk, but trying to fight an invasion on his own (or with a couple students and zack) isn't going to work. Zorian has correctly noted that, he's just not doing anything about it.

Also there's a potion that turns people into an eagle but not one that prevents sleep for a while? Infinitely simpler I would think. Sure it probably has big side effects which will conveniently not effect him.

There is a big risk, as noted above, that authors will see us as assholes for demanding that their characters take some weird course of action. Nobody103 is awesome and by my perspective Zorian is pretty rational. I'd be quite careful before calling his actions irrational. If there's a clear course of action he could take for victory of course, then it would be good to call it out.

  Yup, I'm not saying he does all this immediately, but he needs men and allies and not just a couple, he'll do all his big mercenary moves at the end of the month too and be as subtle as possible. Also remember he'd be doing this (and telling his men) that this is for a government or some other entity, red robe wouldn't immediately think time traveler.
#+end_quote

And the best way to ensure this is safe is for him to gather information on which people are potential leaks, as he is doing. Once he captures someone high up and knows who is in which cell then he's much less at risk of someone tattling on him to red robe. He can't control what red robe thinks, but he can control what red robe knows about him. He can maybe even monitor communication between red robe and his allies and set up an ambush.

  Every plan has it's risk, but trying to fight an invasion on his own (or with a couple students and zack) isn't going to work. Zorian has correctly noted that, he's just not doing anything about it.

  Destroying the gate in their main base would no doubt utterly cripple the planned invasion, unless a new gate was easy to build, which he doubted.

He explicitly noted an action which he personally could do which could stop the invasion. He knows where the exhaust port of the death star is.

The author has noted there are magical drugs that can keep you awake, but those have side effects.

Souls is easier. Souls have the advantage that they share the same operating system. You can plug an animal soul into yours without needing any trickiness about form changing, and rely on evolution/ intelligent design to do the work for you. It's like the difference from transferring genes between animals and making whole new ones.

He doesn't have infinite money. It's only however much mana crystals he can collect at the start, which only get refreshed at the start of the loop. He can't go kill bad guys and dragons like a superhero, because that shit gets on the news. Red Robe will come say hello.

*** I decided to make an easy step-by-step list of how Zorian can completely break the time loop and win easily. This is what I would do, though I have a few advantages over Zorian as I'm exploit minded and less anti-social as well as being grey morally.

1- We've been shown he can get tons of money from crystallized mana from only one dungeon, now map out EVERY profitable dungeon and do that, you are now the richest man in the world basically.

2- Use that money to buy a team of the best researchers and trainers money can buy. He can optimize this team every month by picking new members etc and can throw huge amounts of money at the problem. Take potions, drugs whatever to stop sleeping during the month, so what if it hurts his body, he'll be fine next month.

He can be taught exactly what he wants in the most efficient manner. Focus the best researchers and every soul mage you can find on understanding the time loop and improving his own soul defense and attacks. Also develop his mind magic as much as possible.

3- Buy a core group of mercenaries that will make up his "honor guard" optimize the best people for this job over time. Use this group to get valuable combat experience and leadership experience. Fight dragons and baddies and whoever and get enough illegal spells and equipment that you become a powerhouse.

4- Understand how to stop the loop (it is implied that he just needs to beat the invaders). Once your sure when the time loop will end focus on training and exploiting as much as possible until there are 6 months to a year left before the loop fully degrades.

5- Buy a big mercenary army, conduct guerrilla warfare during the entire month the invaders are there, cripple them until they are desperate. When they attack mop the floor with them by countering their every move, optimize over restarts. You can even bring in the government as long as you don't mention time travel. I'm sure with some money and influence (aka money) they'd be more than happy to bring an army to annihilate the necromancers island and defend the academy.

6- ???

7- End the time loop buy a plot of land, revolutionize mind magic and other fields, have kids and become the most powerful mage that has ever lived at the tender (physical) age of 15. Take that Damien!

If I were your Dungeon Master I'd make the first soul mage you hired that's clever enough steal your looping ticket and get you a game over (maybe you'd like to continue playing as that soul mage?).

Soul mages would be one of the few things that I'd expect a clever looper to stay as far away from as possible. No matter how much money you promise to a soul mage, once you clue him in to the whole looping business there's a big chance he'll take the best one shot he's got at turning on you and stealing your ability --- especially since you yourself aren't a qualified soul mage and don't understand how it works.

Zorian's chosen approach is almost entirely consistent with his personality. The only things that stand out are him not seeking better tutors (I think you'll enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567][Temporal Beacon,]] btw) and him not concentrating completely on the memory pack decryption. He could hire at least 2-3 different Aranea webs in a single loop, and so far he almost never even approached the one web that's described as the best mind-reading professionals. I am guessing that the Doylist explanation for this is that once the decryption happens, some “game scripts” will get [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent][triggered]] and the entire environment will get irreversibly changed, so the author is taking his time with the status quo while he can. The Watsonian explanation, however, makes Zorian look like an idiot in this regard.

You're severely overestimating how much money crystal-hunting can get him in a month's time. Maybe if he robbed some rich people or made some kind of deal with them, he'd get himself an army-buying amount of money, but otherwise there isn't much to do to get that rich in a mere month. Besides, even if he /did/ have the money to buy an army, the logistics of assembling so much people together would also take more time then he can spend on it.

They'd have two reasons for this: ether straight out betrayal (which did happen, and can be defended against by suicide), or when finding out about the loop and wanting in. In latter case it's a matter of trust, and Zorian decided to trust his current spider partners since he was in a zeitnot because of the deteriorating mem-package and had no other solution.

With the soul mages there is no such obvious zeitnot, so hiring them to research looping would be an /unnecessary/ and serious risk.

No, both areas of magic expertise exist outside of the time loop.

Yes, Zorian did take a risk with his current aranea partners because of the zeitnot. However, from a probabilistic POV, the more people Zorian meet that are capable of discovering the loop and manipulating his mind/soul, the greater his danger of coming across a treacherous party. That's why it's not a very good idea to meet/hire 2-3 aranea webs simultaneously as [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] suggested. However, it can be necessitated by the urgency of the packet decaying, so it's up to the author how to deal with the risk.

From the author.

#+begin_quote
  I thought of all the exploits mentioned, but for most of them I have three basic complaints: 1. They trivialize the risks inherent in their proposals, claiming that Nothing Can Go Wrong and all risks can be mitigated (ha ha). 2. They ignore the set-up time needed to make some of the scenarios come to pass. Some things cannot be done in a month. Other can, but would take years of repetition until you could align everything just right, which is a dubious time investment. 3. A fair number of them depend on assumptions that just aren't true. The setting doesn't work that way. As an aside, a lot of proposals focus on recruit a lot of people for his projects. This is obviously a potent tactics, if fraught with its own issues, but consider this: if Zorian was the type of person who was inclined to do this, he would be already dead by this point in the story. He would have made himself noticeable within the first couple of restart and gotten soulkilled by Red Robe before he was capable of doing anything about it. The same reason that is limiting his growth is the only reason he is alive right now.

Harvesting mana is not so great, but thankfully he can now just rob the aranean treasury for cash. The main argument against exploiting money is attention it would inadvertently get, and Zorian needs to remain unnoticed at all costs.

There are, however, some instances where Zorian can use money to solve very concrete tasks that are already on his list: Silverlake's task and that mansion in the north. I think he could at least make an attempt with a bunch of mercenaries. Since Tavien is sort of in the time loop now, maybe he will finally make some progress there.
