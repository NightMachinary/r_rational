I mean this comic strip here:

[[http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/]]

It's the second strip I'v read by this guy. The first one I read is something with the same creepy art style but about 'multi dimensional chip'. Both series are long and very entertaining.

*Is there anyone else who also read it and enjoyed it? What did you find most fun and peculiar there? What in your opinion could be improved (except the art, because everyone knows that)*

What rationalities and irrationalities do you find there?


** The multidimensional chip was fantastic, I'll check this one out too :)

** I mentioned this in another thread--the parts I thought were most fun were the "figuring out which vegetables are safe to eat" bit and the punchline of the "alien countercultures" page. The part where the good guys are trying to get the backlicker to say specific words was also pretty funny. Overall the strong points of the comic are the humor and creative worldbuilding.

I think the main things that could be improved (besides the art) are that the dialogue is stilted, most of the characters don't really have distinct "voices," and their personalities and motivations are pretty shallow. The love triangle/romance arc in particular was really paint-by-numbers except for the ending, and the plot thread about the real spy ended anticlimactically. For the most part the characters feel like little more than vehicles to introduce the next wacky alien design. And maybe that's okay, since the wacky alien designs are kind of the point.

There's an interesting blend of rationality and irrationality in that the comic goes into depth about the evopsych reasons behind the weird alien behaviors (which is the kind of intense dissection that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] readers tend to enjoy), but the fact that the aliens behave so perfectly consistently with their species' "backstories" is itself kind of irrational. Like, humans have our own baked-in evolutionary impulses, but a "rational" human wouldn't adhere to them to the extent the various aliens do, especially when it comes to the gender relations stuff. It often feels like each alien species' respective analogue of a human "redpiller" is writing their own chapter. This is probably because the alien cultures had to be at least somewhat simplified or each planet would have had to be its own entire comic.

I'm pretty sure these were features, rather than bugs.

As far as the redpiller stuff, I sort of took it as a sort of universal satire-- it satirizes alien cultures in the same way it satirizes human cultures, and in doing so meta-satirizes human culture because all satire and all sci-fi are written by humans, so our reactions to the "alien" cultures are really just reactions to human cultures in disguise.

**** I don't know about /features./ I think an argument can be made that they're not bugs, since the romance and other character stuff is superfluous to the main goal of the comic (exploring all the wacky alien species). But I also don't think a shallow romance is any better than just not having one at all. It's at best neutral and at worst a boring distraction from the fun alien stuff. If I were editing the comic I'd probably cut it entirely and replace it with a few hundred pages about the main guy figuring out which vegetables are safe to eat.

*** I think the bad art quality is good because it lowers expectations and makes it more enjoyable overall.

The same story with better quality art would be let down by other aspects more, the quirkiness wouldn't sell well.

Amazing art could probably work, but I think there's a big section between amazing art and that quality where it would be worse.

Maybe I'm wrong

As for your spoiler tags I thought the subversion was good, and if it was paint by numbers it was just so the subversion was better, in both of your points.

** Thorsby's latest comic [[http://trixie.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/][Trixie Slaughteraxe For President]] just finished a month or so ago. It's a fun tale on a smaller scale than Brain Chip. Probably not rational, but enjoyable, world-buildy and hilarious.

** I read through this when it was mentioned recently (the another thread mentioned in another comment, and plausibly prompting this post as well?):\\
My favourite part is 'The evolution of cultures' (c89), followed by 'Evolution of war' (c407), followed by 'Evolution of fiction Part 1'.

Occasionally in the overall fiction I have a bad-ad-hoc-theory impression (SMBC/BAHfest), as though an idea is latched onto which sounds fun even though implausible to be true. At other times, I found myself thinking 'this is fun to imagine taken to this extreme, but I can imagine reasons that would practically force things to not develop in this direction' (like HPMOR (I think?) eating-others'-young instead of decreasing reproduction). The cases that I know enough to get this impression from make me suspect that the ones I don't get the impression from are produced from the same approach, but with me not knowing enough to get the same impression from them directly.

In my favourite part (mentione above), I find the start implausible, the ending not-obviously-suspect-but-to-be-taken-with-a-large-grain-of-salt-anyway, and the (same) ending /delightful/.

** It is very much not hard sci-fi. It takes the pop version of evolutionary psychology and evolution in general (especially as it relates to sex and gender) and pushes it up to eleven. It also has a serious and straight forward air when it comes to no viewpoint exposition that could make an uninformed person actually believe that any of that stuff is in any way plausible. Whoever reads this should take anything said in it as interesting commentary on society using not quite proven scientific theories as style and flavor.

** I'm not sure it's rat-fic at all. I'm only halfway through it, and it's certainly an entertaining parody of all things evopsy (like how it's used post-facto to justify one thing and also its opposite), but it focuses on stupid characters doing stupid things for what they think are good reasons because of cultural dissonance, for the most part, and that's not very rational nor rationalist.

*** I wouldn't call it stupid when people optimize for unusual things. The one idiot ball that I grant the story has is that Dunkirk never learns to sit down not-Plume and teach him his job.
