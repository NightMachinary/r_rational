**** I'm thinking that's exactly why the full oaths is to the Sovereign and not to Cat. Back when Akua was controlling Cat's body, she was subject to all the oaths that Cat swore to. Conversely this means that as long as she controls the construct, she is Cat for purposes of oaths to "I". Given that the Sovereign is the full mantle itself and not the construct, I'm thinking that it works differently for oaths to the Sovereign.

** So for all the talk that Akua is incredibly dangerous and someone that Cat needs to keep on a leash... Cat's doing a fairly terrible job of keeping Akua leashed.

I grabbed most of the times the Diabolist was mentioned in the last 2 chapters, and the picture painted is one of Akua getting what is effectively almost complete trust. Just look at all of this:

#+begin_quote
  That was one way to call the gathering throng of the desperate and the ambitious Akua was keeping an eye on.
#+end_quote

Akua's in charge of keeping an eye on the Drow.

#+begin_quote
   I said. “Ivah will stay with you. We're moving in on the Berelun camp after Akua's people pick up the bodies for an auction.”
#+end_quote

Akua has "people" now.

#+begin_quote
  I'd been inclined to just cut them loose, but Akua had talked me out of it. 
#+end_quote

I thought the policy was to avoid listening to Akua on general principle?

#+begin_quote
  Akua had been inclined to limit bidding rights to the dzulu so that a warrior class would be created quickly, but I'd been of a different opinion. 
#+end_quote

Akua gets a say in the policy of how Callow's soon to be main military force is formed.

#+begin_quote
  We'd crafted the system with our time constraints in mind.

  It'd been Diabolist's idea.
#+end_quote

She also gets to form the basis of said military. Hmmmm.

#+begin_quote
  shunting off the alienation into the others who drew on the stuff of my mantle -- Diabolist, as always
#+end_quote

Yep. This won't have horrible consequences.

......

#+begin_quote
  “One hundred and sixty years, subjected to the full breadth of lesser and greater oaths,” Akua said
#+end_quote

Leave the Diabolist to handle PR with the Drow. Somewhat innocuous, but there's concerns expressed later that Akua might gain too much influence amongst the Drow, so maybe try to limit her contact?

#+begin_quote
  I glanced at the shade and nodded. She'd helped me with both the ritual and the wording of the oaths, putting her extensive experience with diabolism to slightly more acceptable use.
#+end_quote

....Sure. let the Butcher of Liesse, master manipulator, and expert of fine print draft the oaths that will bind your main fighting force into place. No way that blows up on you.

#+begin_quote
  Her continued genteel horror was always good for a laugh.
#+end_quote

I mean, (a) mistreating your pet monster is a good way to ensure said pet gets free and kills you, according to story logic; and (b) this shows a pretty nonchalant attitude towards one of the most dangerous threats to team Woe.

#+begin_quote
  “Diabolist,” I evenly said. “Report.”

  She sat at my side without need for an invitation.
#+end_quote

Again, what happened to not trusting her on general principle? Not too long ago she wouldn't have been given this much slack and now Akua is being invited into Cat's planning more than her actual loyal teammates.

#+begin_quote
  I was disinclined to let Akua Sahelian head what would effectively be my equivalent of the Jacks down here, but I might not have another choice. 
#+end_quote

..... Sure Cat. Give the Diabolist a death squad. This is a great idea that will have no reprecussions.

#+begin_quote
  “I'll see if I can spare an ispe, but that's unlikely until Lotow,” 
#+end_quote

Literally two seconds ago you described how this was a bad idea and would let Akua "sink deeper hook into the rest of the Drow"!!!

#+begin_quote
  Keeping Diabolist useful without giving her too much power was ever a delicate balancing act.
#+end_quote

Self awareness = 0.

These two chapters alone she's arguably delegated more power and responsibility to Akua than any other single member of the World has been given.

Akua sits in on policy discussions and makes suggestions that Cat implements, and this coming right after a set of interludes talking about how the Woe don't get enough of a say in what they're doing

She gave the idea on how to bind and incredibly dangerous fighting force, and then was given permission to help implement said bindings.

She gets given tasks to undertake on her own, and will apparently soon receive her own death squad and powered-up lieutenant, even while Cat considers how this will let her solidify her hold over Callow's main fighting force.

**** I dispute this. I'm going to go with the example of having Akua help out with the Drow, because I think that's the most egregious mistake here, but Cat's not making binary choices here - the possibility space for problem solving is huge.

There were a bunch of alternatives /to being involved with the Drow at all/ (let alone having Akua handle the idea and execution for binding the Drow) laid out in chapter 55. Cat rejected them because she didn't like the risk-reward ratios and/or she didn't want to get involved with Black and/or didn't want to treat with the Hierarch or the Chain of Hunger.

But apparently it's /better/ to get involved with the Drow? The traitorous bastards with the potential for exponential growth? The one's who can't be trusted without using Winter powers, which Cat has hereto been hesitant to use in case of narrative backlash, backed up by oaths crafted by a lawyer who she knows is out to get her? Oaths that have already had big obvious loopholes pointed out in them? There are several distinct layers of bad ideas going on here.

You have to measure the other options against this one, and this one doesn't look particularly great.

And then there's the fact that her original goal was to have the Dead King invade Procer to take the heat of her. This was the victory condition she laid out. Now, the Dead King is about to invade Procer and take the heat off of Cat. Yes, it's because of a deal with Malicia, but that's a thing that's happening. If Cat wants this army to deal with Procer - as she has described her motive - Procer's mostly dealt with. The other threats are a series of maybes where any potential invader would have their own logistical issues. Are these issues pressing enough to justify handing a ton of power and responsibility to Akua?

On top of that, if she weigh it up and decides that yes, she really does need an army, Cat has decided to hand out Winter titles, and we've seen first hand how powerful even the weakest of those are. Cat can just put those titles to use somewhere where betrayal isn't a seeming inevitability.

She has justifications for treating with the Drow, yes, but they're somewhat flimsy motives when dealing with the Drow involves setting herself up for betrayal during literally every part of the process and going along with almost all of Akua's requests for more power. Cat will be extraordinarily lucky if this doesn't blow up in her face entirely. And if it /does/ blow up in her face, well, then she's got a plague of mass-murdering, raping, slaving monsters in her background who grow stronger with every kill. That's a hell of a downside for questionable gain, and she's not doing much to contain the risk, as pointed out above.

But let's say that yes, she needs the army and yes, she's not going to go for any of the alternatives. There's still a bunch of different ways to approach this.

Cat hasn't made so much as a token effort to limit Akua's involvement here. If she's going to use these oaths to bind the Drow into her service, and the service of the Liesse Accords, then she has a range of options like trying to acquire an expert to help look through the fineprint (remember, she has minions with fast travel enabled). Yes, this will take more time, but she's not in such a huge rush that she can't afford to take basic precautions with binding the untrustworthy individuals who are going to compse the background of her military. I mean, she could spend more time going through the clauses with Archer. The loopholes pointed out here in the comments are hardly obscure technicalities that couldn't be caught by someone motivated enough to have a cursory look for them.

Giving power to Akua implies that it's a better choice than not giving it to Akua - and Cat's been pretty clear that the Diabolist it a traitor in waiting who is not to be trusted. Giving her own minions and a role in shaping and implementing critical policies is hard to see as an action that's more of an asset than a liability.

****** Her reasons for not trusting Black are that he manipulated her when they killed Akua (note that Cat would have lost terribly against Akua without Black's plan) and for destroying the array (which is a decision she later agreed with, if for different reasons, and she applied the same logic with the Crusade). Neither of these things hold up against /bringing a plauge of exponentially growing Drow into Callow and relying on Akua to prevent them killing everyone/.

Neither do most of Cat's other options.

The Drow, it has been made abundantly clear, aren't going to fall in line from Cat's strength alone. And even if they did, Cat can't be everywhere.

And even aside from all this, /trusting Akua to help write up the contract and manage death squads is a really bad idea/.

If a strategy doesn't work unless you're trusting Akua to make it work, then you have to question whether you should be implementing said strategy at all. You need to look at what the other options are again.

******* I think you're wrong about the Drow's growth rate and thus their possible long term threat, unless by "exponential growth" you mean that all population growth is naturally exponential, which would apply equally to say, Callowan cows.

Within the Drow, killing for Night is zero-sum, the group as a whole loses nothing but neither does it gain. Even if the Drow can learn via Night by killing non-Drow, the Secrets they learn will likely not involve any higher-level Night tricks, it'll be stuff like "literacy" and maybe "pike-holding." Not to be underestimated of course, but these are skills large fractions of the non-Drow population already possess. And a Secret is only useful to learn once. You can't kill two peasants to learn "double literacy," which means that Drow's power growth should asymptotically approach some fixed value rather than blowing up.

******** What I mean by "exponential" is how the Drow can leverage murder into learning stronger and stronger Secrets. Kill a master swordsman, and they've got a stronger chance of killing. mage. Kill a mage, and they've got a better chance of killing a weaker named (which, presumably, is where things like "the Secret of Many lives comes from). Etc.

Amongst the Drow killing is zero-sum, and that's one of the main things holding them back. Their restricted access to fresh blood - boxed in by the elves, the ratlings, the dead and the dwarves- is a large part of why they've both stagnated as a society and as a threat level. Let them out into the rest of the continent and that changes.

And there's no question as to whether a Drow can learn Secrets from non-Drow. That was one of the first things we learnt:

#+begin_quote
  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”
#+end_quote

Also, killing multiple peasants /is/ a good thing - it lets Drow more thoroughly master a skill, depending on what aspects their victim was good at (shitty example - where one swordsman might be good at offence, another might be specialised in defence):

#+begin_quote
  “Spear and blade and bow,” Ivah said. “Dimas harvested many, to learn them whole. It was great accomplishment.”
#+end_quote

Which is fairly terrifying, actually. They don't even need to kill a master swordsman or what-have-you to get the ball rowing. Armies of low-to-moderately skilled peasants is enough, as long as those peasants aren't /uniformly/ skilled (which people, as a rule, aren't).

  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

  I sucked at my lip.

  “Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

  The drow paled.

  “Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

  “It does, doesn't it,” I said. “The necromancy that keeps its army walking, you can claim it for the Night.

Killing non-Drow adds to the Night. The Night is knowledge. If you've got any evidence to the contrary, I'd love to see it.

But even if we ignore the only explanations we've been given as to how the Night functions... it doesn't change the fact that if every kill makes the Drow stronger, then every kill makes it easier to acquire more and more power. At this point you're quibbling over details.

*********** Rather important details in my opinion.

If we do not know the shape of the growth of the Night, then we cannot claim to know the consequences of it.

In any case, I feel that you are willfully ignoring what Ivah told Cat in the last chapter.\\
It has reached a point where it must seek ever bigger concentrations of Night, if it is to meaningfully grow in power.

We also know, that even though, Ivah and their warband, sought to add to the Night, they did not do so as powerful drow. Which carries implications as to how much is added with any given kill.

If the amount could follow an exponential growth, one would think that the stronger drow would have organized raids, to exploit this, and return home to claim a superior position.

Yet, we have not heard of this.\\
It is true that they have been boxed in by other powers, but Cat mentions that the rare raiding party has been observed, yet they aren't a threat.

From this I would conclude that the amount added is only worth considering if one has very little.

For though their empire is a ruin, a dark age does not stop people from following their own incentives. I would even say that that was why their empire fell.

You reference those sections to make your point, but miss alternative explanations.\\
We have too little information to go on, and ought to wait for more.

Ps. Sorry for the rambling structure, gotta get some sleep.

************ Again, we've been told what the Night is and how they can aquire it. Do you dispute these explanations, the only one's we've been given on how the Night works?

If all the Drow can reach the point of Ivah before diminishing returns set in, then shit, I don't know what to tell you. Sounds like a victory condition to me. And much of the danger is in /lateral/ growth. rounding out skills and powers and backing it up with superhuman physiques.

And the Drow are ineffective for two main reasons that we know of. One is that they're located in what must be one of the shittiest pieces of real estates out there:

#+begin_quote
  The only people who knew their locations for sure were the drow who still used them, sending roving bands of raiders and slavers to the surface.

  Those enterprising souls were not known for having a lot of success in those depredations. Ages ago, before the Golden Bloom had been seized by the elves, the now-broken kingdom of the Deoraithe had occasionally been troubled by them. Now, though? The surface paths led them into three dead ends: the Kingdom of the Dead, the Golden Bloom and the Chain of Hunger. None of these were known to be welcoming locales to outsiders. Once every few decades it was said a cunning and careful warband managed to slip through dwarven tunnels or other secret paths to reach northern Procer -- or much more rarely, northern Callow -- but even fewer of those who made it there succeeding at returning home.
#+end_quote

They get one chance every few decades to sneak out into the world - not a whole lot of oppurtinty to showcase there. And the one's heading out are the dregs of society, who are going to have a hard time getting the ball rolling, this is because of Reason Two:

On a societal level, they're turned endlessly inwards, because that's how Sve has built the society. the actual movers and shakers, the one's who could start the ball rolling, spend their time murdering each other and treating their lessers like Cattle. Remeber, Ivah and co. were sent out into the Burning Lands only after they have lost power.

#+begin_quote
  “None of us are drow, Lately Queen,” it said. “Had we returned in glory, perhaps once more, but this is disgrace heaped upon disgrace.”

  .....

  “That lot outside is bottom-feeders, Diabolist,” I murmured. “And still they were capable of a trick most Named wouldn't sneer at. There's something wrong here. If their lower ranks are this strong there's no way they'd be a ruin of an empire as they supposedly are.” “Unless,” Akua said calmly, “that very power is the cause of ruin.”

  My brow rose. That was possible, yes. Were they all fighting of this Night so ferociously they'd broken their own realm?
#+end_quote

So there's not much opportunity to collect power, and no-one in a position to do it. Notably, turning them into an army and putting them on Callow fixes these issues.

All that said, we do know that some Drow sent out into the world become Mighty - going out and killing non-Drow works. That's what was going on with Ivah's band when we first met them. They'd been sent out into the Burning Land with an opportunity to rise up from nothing and gain power. That they failed doesn't mean it's an impossibility, but that they tried means they think it can work. And everything since then points in the same direction.

The Drow's civilisation is set to play catch up incredibly quick. Let's be generous and say that they stop growing when they reach the level of the other players, so instead of a race of superhumans who steadily grow more and more omnicompetent, you /just/ have a power on par with Procer or Callow or what have you. Does that seem reasonable?

It's still a gigantic issue, because it's still /the Drow/ held back by /Akua/. Loyalty is not a thing in either of these two. If this is Callow's military power, then Callow is going to destroyed sooner or later..

(There are a half dozen other quotes supporting this, but I'll leave it there.)

Guess which to problems mobilising the Drow outside of the Everdark solves? But nah, we'll just /trust Akua to handle it/.

Most Mighty apparently stay in the ruins of their civilisation, killing each other and their lessers. We have no knowledge that any Mighty haven't escaped. The threat isn't that one or two get out and sow havoc, the threat is that their civilisation as a whole can play catch up incredibly quick and become a danger on or above anything else on the surface. At which point Callow's in a hell of a lot of trouble if they slip their leash and start doing what Drow do. But Akua had some really great ideas on how to make this work, so it's all going to be fine. Right?

You have it backward; read the hint from the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9o9d6p/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_63/e7vop1k/][WOG]] in this very thread

#+begin_quote
  Do you really think that Akua is not capable of slipping something in?
#+end_quote

Not when under so much scrutiny. Cat is /magically/ illiterate; she is not illiterate in Lower Miezan. And Akua wouldn't attempt a betrayal unless she is certain that it will succeeds.

#+begin_quote
  The problem is ... one part they're going to become real powerful real fast

Not really, Cat is not adding much to the Night; she is just redistributing it around.

************** I'd actually missed that WOG, thanks for pointing it out. But even taking out that specific example...

We know that Akua's extraordinarily good with legalese - on account of being Praesi and the Diabolist - and that Cat is quite inexperienced- to the point that she thought Akua might be needed to help her (remember, we've seen Cat's skillset, and a lawyer she is not).

Akua's relative advantage in manipulation and loophoes is something that's been emphasised to us.

In general I think that Akua's expertise is something better off treated as a threat rather than an opportunity when it comes to such important things as securing the military force of Callow - I can't imagine any would be overly surprised if it turned out /Akua *did/ poison this proverbial well - and that relaxing the general policy of don't-trust-Akua to the point of letting her help invent and execute policies is an issue when she's set to inevitably betray Cat based on her history, personality, and story role.

Certainly here are issues with giving her powerful seconds that she requested in order to exert more control over the faction she just helped write up oaths for, or death squads to command with a degree of autonomy.

As to adding to the Night - the mechanics of that have been described to us. Even if we say that no Night is added to during service to Cat, an incredibly bold claim, it's still a looming threat if the monstrous slave army rebels. But that never happens in stories, right? Especially when they've been secured with the help of a treacherous underling?

A big one is this - Cat wants this army as a hedge against uncertainty. If having the army (and having Akua play a big role with the army) introduces more uncertainty than it solves, you have to question whether it's serving it's purpose. Bare minimum, you have to look at other ways of going about going things.

****************** Sorry, are you suggesting that Cat's goal is to cause chaos? Citations needed.

Cat gave us her reasons for wanting the Drow:

#+begin_quote
  Procer would be occupied with the Dead King for the foreseeable future, but there was no guarantee part of the crusader host would not try Callowan borders again if it saw weakness. The Dominion still had two armies on the field, and the League's intentions were opaque to me. My instinct had been that the Tyrant of Helike and his madman of a Hierarch would be taking a swing at the Principate, but that'd been while it was still the dominant force on the board. With Keter on the march, the League might be feeling adventurous enough to aim for other territories. And that was without even considering Malicia, who sure as Hells wouldn't let me bind the wounds of Callow in peace.

  ...

  “It was one thing to put all our coin on the Army of Callow when we had the leash on the Dead King, however laughably feeble that leash was,” I replied. “It's another when Malicia's the one who let him out, on unknown terms. There will be battles, Hakram, and there's only so many Callowans of fighting fit. Only so many we can afford to lose.
#+end_quote

If you want that clarified: she's worried about the possibility of being invaded, and she can't lose too many men.

Just as a reminder, there are huge logistical issues with Praes attacking Callow, in terms of food, manpower, coin, an ongoing war with Ashur, and general Praesi dickishness. If you want to dispute this, I can probably go find the quotes later on. The Dominion and Procer have bigger fish to fry, as far as cat's concerned. And she's already admitted that she has no clue what the Tyrant is up to. So again - Hedging against the risk of losing too many men from the /possibility/ of being invaded.

#+begin_quote
  Drow army is that something.
#+end_quote

Again, there are alternatives. Again, I listed a bunch above. Again, you've ignored it.

Cat has other plenty of other options than the Drow. She's talked about them. She has plenty of options of handling the Drow in a different manner. I have lifted a narrow selection of these.

Before she left for the Everdark it was pointed out that backing herself into a corner where Akua was her only diplomacy expert was a bad idea. This was before magically binding oaths, status granting minions, and the forming of death squads was added to the mix.

#+begin_quote
  The issue is that you don't see her situation as dire, so you don't think she should be taking these risks.
#+end_quote

Not at all - Callow's fucked. I was arguing for this a while back. You and I actually discussed this at the time.

What I'm arguing is that the Drow and Akua are unlikely to make things any better.

Taking the disloyal, backstabbing society of slavers, murders and rapists with the potential for accelerated growth, making them more powerful with a magical source connected to treachery and dickishness (which you've been hesitant to use in case of story repercussions), and then trusting your traitorous underling (who's smarter than you are) to manage the situation through a combination of magical bindings, extra-powerful minions and death squads they've suggested does not seem like a strategic decision.

On the story level, the evil army bound with magic is probably going to betray you, as is the evil second. On the practical probably end badly, for obvious reasons.

If things go even slightly badly, then Callow is done for. It's not even the fun sort of chaos that Cat thrives in.

*** Akua's competent enough that she's going to end up in charge of something, purely by necessity, and arguably having her in charge of the oath-bound force, whose essential loyalties aren't necessary is less dangerous than giving her some non-oath bound contingent which she might subvert. That's assuming she hasn't managed to sneak back doors into the oaths though.

The "genteel horror" line struck me as more in-group playful ribbing than genuine taunting the monster, although of course the fact that they have such a dynamic is cause for concern.

I think her large say in Cat's decisions is mostly a function of her being who Cat has that has any interest or experience with it. I can't see Archer caring what goes into the oaths. Adjutant easily gets this much delegation and responsibility, as does arguably Thief but they aren't here.

#+end_quote

That seems like a fairly huge assumption. If we've had two things hammered into our heads, it's that Akua is master manipulator and can't be trusted. And then this chapter went out of its way to remind us that she's very good with legalese.

#+begin_quote
  the fact that they have such a dynamic is cause for concern.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that line was included more to show how literally every time Akua is brought up it's her not being taken seriously as a threat. (Except for that one time at the end, where Cat aknowledges the danger and proceeds to give Akua more tools,).

Part (a) was something of a reach, but the mistreatment of Akua is something of a trend at this point in more serious ways, and the "chained monster escapes and eats it's master" is something worth bringing up in this context anyway.

#+begin_quote
  her large say in Cat's decisions is mostly a function of her being who Cat has that has any interest or experience with it
#+end_quote

But to do this is to make the assumption that having Akua involved isn't going to be a liability - and Cat's been pretty darned clear prior to this that Akua is a liability who will inevitably stab her in the back.

If the only way to make the Drow - the race of traitorous, exponentially growing monsters - work is to /trust Akua/... it's probably not a great long term idea.

And it's not like Cat doesn't have other options, to her knowledge. Hell, she shot down a bunch of them not too long ago in large part /because Akua suggested those options/.

** The way Cat is seemingly so oblivious to Ubua manipulating all of this, and the way she's basically calling the shots AND convincing Cat into things she disapproves of, makes me wonder if shunting Winter off to Diabolist is having some unintentional and unconscious effects. As Ubua gets more Wintery, perhaps she's able to more easily influence Cat? She's becoming more of the true Sovereign of Winter than Cat is.

Either way, I think we can all agree that the oaths were a good idea in theory and a terrible idea in practice, simply because she's letting Ubua run the show.

Also, I think we can all agree that Archer is hilarious.

  Hey all,

  RL friend of ErraticErrata here. A few others and I were debating Guide characters recently, and it dawned on us that there is truly no other way of settling any debate than by the laws of Bellerophon, Peerless Jewel of Freedom.

  That's right -- we're organizing a PGTE Character Contest!

  Mostly because we're curious as to which characters The-People-Who-Can-Do-No-Wrong (that's you) prefer. Getting to hear your opinion of each character is valuable, so don't hesitate to share!

  Before you ask, we did manage to talk EE into letting us do this, and with only a minimal number of threats.

  -- The contest will start with next Monday's chapter (October 22).-- One match per chapter -- the link to the poll will be in EE's first comment in response to the chapter. We'll also publish it on PGTE's subreddit if you don't read any of the comments. Like the one you're reading right now. I'm helpful.-- It will be a series of head-to-head matches between 32 PGTE characters. Just vote for your favourite!

  We promise lies, violence, more lies, and even the clenching and unclenching of fists. Or maybe none of that and just a series of polls. We're still figuring it out.

  I'll publish the bracket on Wednesday, so stay tuned!

** shoddy oaths

#+begin_quote
  under this name and any name you will ever bear I bind you by these oaths
#+end_quote

If changing the name can affect things, why not include "and have ever bore" for completeness?

#+begin_quote
  “You will never slay nor harm nor hinder any in my service, or dwelling within Callow, save in your own defence or the pursuit of my laws,”
#+end_quote

Here she uses "me" to refer to herself but everywhere else it's Sovereign of... (SOTMN). Seems like if you are going to make a set of secure oaths that will last for a century, you should make it more reliable in this regard. For example, you could split the oath into several parts.

First, specify that Oathtaker in the text of the oath uniquely refers to Cat with two dozen identifiers so the whole set couldn't be stolen from her by someone taking her mantle, or her changing title or name or current profession, or what not. If done properly, it should make cat the "holder" of the contract no matter what kind of shenanigans happen. An example could be something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Oathtaker refers to me, Catherine Foundling, ruler of Callow at the time this contract is signed, current holder of the SOTMN title, person currently in front of the Oathgiver, previously human female, with a penchant for not checking what the hell I am doing with very powerful magic
#+end_quote

This isn't a reliable descriptor here as I am not going to spend half an hour ironing out all the details, but the point would be to specify Cat uniquely in several different ways so that if you subvert just one of those ways you still wouldn't count as the contract holder. For example, if Ubua stole SOTMN title, she still wouldn't have been the ruler of Callow at the time of contract being signed, and would either be left with inactive oaths or would need to resort to time travel.

Second, specify who is taking the oath, with a similar set of two dozen identifiers. As a hypothetical example, what happens if it's not Sekoran there in front of her, but some other drow pretending to be Sekoran? Would it even be bound /at all/ in the current set of oaths, given that their name is /not/ Sekoran?

Third, specify what the oaths are (don't kill civvies, obey liesse accords, etc). Doesn't really matter what those oaths are, as long as they aren't shoddy.

Fourth, specify how, if at all, this set of oaths can be changed. It sure seems useful to have an ability to impose conditional oaths on your soldiers when it is necessary without the whole ritual with the cup and the knife. It also seems sensible that you might want to pull back an oath which is good in general for a very specific circumstance. For example:

#+begin_quote
  “You will never slay nor harm nor hinder any in my service, or dwelling within Callow, save in your own defence or the pursuit of my laws,”
#+end_quote

Suppose that Masego (in Cat's service) goes suddenly insane from demon corruption, and starts running around towns wrecking various havoc. Switching chickens for turkeys, beating up old ladies, dropping cats into pots of milk, all sorts of stuff. You'd like to be able to say "go find whomever is doing this, break their legs and bring them here so we can ask what is up with that". We'll also specify that for whatever reason Cat can't pass a law saying "that is illegal", perhaps because each time it's a new thing, and can't fire whomever is causing havoc, perhaps because they don't know who is.

In this highly unusual circumstance it'd make sense to temporarily peel off a very good general oath in regards to this insane individual. Current set of oaths doesn't allow for it. Having a clause for how that can be done seems sensible.

However, some oaths (e.g. don't try to usurp my title) could be considered too dangerous to be allowed to be changed at all, lest a Hero exploit that, so you could specify which parts of the oathtaking could be changed and which couldn't. Similarily, you could add clauses for how Cat could temporarily cede control over the general drow management to Ubua, in a circumstance like in the Battle of the Camps where Cat was out of order for a couple days, and how much that control would be ceded.

Those are actually good points, the second in particular was something I missed when going over the chapter. Amended the text accordingly.

The rest of what you argue is a bit of stretch. First off, you're assuming that the oaths binding drow to the SOMN instead of Catherine in particular is a bug instead of a feature. It isn't. Second, you're assuming that a precaution as basic as an identity check wouldn't be taken before people are allowed to bid. Third, your entire argument about rules being amended in the future is essentially irrelevant since they're bound to take her orders regardless, something already ensured by oath. Fourth, your hypothetical with Masego is absurd since several things you describe - punching old ladies, messing with private property - would be illegal, and so covered by the last part of the same oath you quoted. I'll also point out that for it to even slightly hold up you had to nix the obvious solution (use of her authority to make things illegal) and assume she'd be enough of an idiot to not use her legal rights to imprison a threat to the kingdom. It's fine if you want to poke holes in the oaths, frankly I'm not a legal scholar of any sort so I could use the help, but at this point you're kind of making your own flaws so you can point them out.

Eh, that is fair. The idea I was getting at with the hypothetical was that someone could feasibly be doing something you don't want them doing which is nonetheless legal. How about a better hypothetical?

Say there is a Hero with mindrape-like powers a-la Speaking. You know he planted suggestions in the mind of one of your subjects in some location, but you do not know who the plant is. Plant himself is honestly unaware of being a double agent, because suggestions are subtle and aren't activated yet, so they can't even be said to be comitting treason. Suggestion is to do something perfectly legal like (e.g. light a fireplace at home at 19 hours, drink a cup of water at 8 am, eat a chicken for dinner, whatever), so even when it activates they would not be violating any laws. However, this legal action would be helping the hero in some way, perhaps by letting them activate a ritual. Now, what you /want/ is to leave an agent on the scene with an order like "look around, find out who the plant is, and then prevent them from doing whatever it is they were supposed to be doing" (we can postulate that suggestion is detectable once it activates, their eyes light up or something). However, the plant is a citizen, they won't be violating any laws, and you can't even say "lighting fireplaces at 19 o clock is illegal for the next week" because you don't know any details about what it is they have to do. So, how do you give an order here?

Callow's not a democracy, as the ruling queen Catherine can pass a royal decree and pretty much remedy that instantly. And the trade of Night-for-oaths would be much less attractive if additional oaths could be added at any time - that would, rightly, be seen as extremely easy to exploit. It's one thing to make those oaths if they're a known quantity, another if Catherine can add another at a whim. What would prevent her from just enslaving them if she felt like it? Orders for a limited timespan are much more agreeable, and for the long-term issues she has her greater oaths.

As for your last paragraph, why would she use the drow specifically in that situation? It's not like she wouldn't have other options. The oath-takers don't have to be the perfect tool for every context, just the ones she wants to use them in. Besides, even in your theoretical the order could simply be 'subdue the hero-touched plant when you see the sign'. Which assuming the hero meant to do Callow harm by using the citizen as a pawn, wouldn't break the oath as they'd be breaking the laws by cooperating, however unwillingly, with a plot against Callow.

** We've never actually seen anyone try to break an oath with a Fae before. And these drow are making oaths with cat's blood involved, I.e. winter. These oath breakers appear akin to the Peter Pettigrew style ones where the power they've borrowed turns on them when they break their oath to the source of the power.

In the stories, it seems like breaking an oath with a Fae doesn't necessarily have instant backlash and this makes sense when there are no slivers of power involved in every oath (say larat and cat's oath or even Ivah and Cat's first oath). Given the similarities between our stories and the guideverse, breaking an oath with a fairy usually gives them power over you, in the case of the drow, the slivers of power instantly kill their hosts.

I state this because I think the Pilgrim made his deal with the queen in callow and while this is not as serious as the greater oaths made with Winter, him absconding still falls on the spectrum of reneging on his deal. Which means Cat will not have absolute power over him, but the Pilgrim will be seriously nerfed in his next encounter with Cat.

Also, it seems odd that they can make oaths they don't understand. Are the accords and the meaning of the oaths explained properly to the drow? It reminds me of software TOS which might as well be in Crepescular for all I know. Given the nature of oaths, they can only be what the parties knowingly consent to. If anything, akua might have interfered with the oaths at the translation stage and the drow think they are making a different bargain
