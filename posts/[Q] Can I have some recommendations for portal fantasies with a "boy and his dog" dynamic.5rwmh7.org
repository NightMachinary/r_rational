The boy doesn't actually need to be a boy, and the dog doesn't actually have to be a dog, but it's the dynamic in general I'm looking for.

The field is probably a bit too narrow to get "rational" works, but I'd prefer that the heroes/villains be competent, or at least not morons.

(I deleted a previous version of this thread because of a typo in the title.)


** Milo and Mordenkainen from Harry Potter and the Natural 20?

But yeah, it's hard to think of a good example. This may be related to the underrepresentation of simple pleasures in fiction.

** So, you mean the protagonist has an animal sidekick, or do you mean specifically like the Ellison story?

*** Ellison story?

But "animal sidekick" works well enough.

**** I believe the post you were responding to was asking whether your original post was referring to "a boy and his dog" as a media trope, or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_and_His_Dog]["A Boy and His Dog," the 1969 science fiction story by Harlan Ellison]].

**** SPOILER WARNING: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_and_His_Dog#A_Boy_and_His_Dog]]

I really recommend you hunt up a copy and read it before you read the Wikipedia entry.

It's kinda rational, I guess.

I began to argue, then I realized which part you meant.

** It's possible that this is already what prompted the question, but the first thing I think of is the SNES RPG Secret of Evermore. Literally about a boy and his dog being transported to a strange realm and having to try to figure out what happened and how they can return home.

** Ellison is pretty brutal in that story. Protagonist sacrificing loyal ally/follower/lover is not a plot device often used. It's more of "rational evil" than simple "rational". Example I can recall which come close is Quirrell trying to kill Harry in HPMOR.

** I might be misunderstanding what "portal fantasies" means, but [[http://www.minnasundberg.fi/comic/page00.php][A Redtail's Dream]] is a webcomic about a young man and his dog on a journey through a series of dream worlds based on Finnish mythology. (Not their own dream--the worlds are basically constructed realities provided by the titular redtail.) It definitely has the dynamic you're looking for between the two of them. One thing that makes it interesting is that the "boy" isn't a traditional heroic personality. You'll see what I mean if you read it.

The story is complete, about 550 pages. The author is not a native English speaker, so there's some awkward phrasing in the early pages, but that improves as the story goes on until it's barely noticeable. The artwork is lovely and emotionally expressive, and the story is original and well-crafted.

(Caveat: The "boy" isn't exactly a moron, but he does do some stupid things. However, those actions stem from consistent personality flaws he has, and he consistently has to suffer the consequences of the stupid things he does. So when he's stupid, it's just him being stupid, not the narrative.)

*** Redtail fits! Though unfortunately, I already tried to read it a while ago and dropped it. Thanks for the attempt, though.

***** I forget, to be honest. It was a few years ago;I remember it being an ad on smbc-comics.com that I followed. I might actually have to re-check it out in case my tastes have changed in the interim.

**** Try reading it again now it's complete. Familiarity with the Kalavela may help.

I liked it so much I bought the limited edition hardcover. ^_^

** Try "The Guardians of the Flame" by Joel Rosenberg. One of the protagonists rescues a dragon chained up in the sewers as a waste disposal system.

As I recall it's even pretty rational. There's one character, a slaver, who could be argued to be evil for the lulz, but I remember him as more of a bully than a mustache-twirler.
