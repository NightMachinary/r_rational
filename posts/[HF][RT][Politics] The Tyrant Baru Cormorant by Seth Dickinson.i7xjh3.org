** So the third book in the Baru Cormorant series is out!

A quick summary by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9txzmx/hfrt_the_monster_baru_cormorant/][tvcgrid]] for people who have never read this series:

#+begin_quote
  Baru Cormorant is a young girl from nowhere who that gets economically and culturally invaded by the Empire of Masks, which is a clever, power-hungry, expansionist political entity. She has a mother and two fathers (on her island the families are often large) but to the Masquerade, with its own self-servin philosophy about "social hygiene", such practices of same-sex or poly relationships (and many other practices) are anathema. The Masquerade also has a brewing scientific culture, with new advances in chemistry leading to better sanitation, longer life times, but also crueler implements of war and control. Baru decides to fight back in a subversive way -- to gain power from within the Masquerade, a meritocratic republic, so that she can help her family and her island.

  Baru's story will see her using economics and general reasoning to develop offensive and defensive strategies, in a bid to gain power and achieve her goals.
#+end_quote

This is competence porn with political scheming upon economic scheming upon layered scheming with a heavy glob of emotions to really put it all together to get the reader invested in the story.

At it's core, this is a story about the systems of a civilization and one woman's mission to destroy an empire by hitting it where it hurts, their infrastructure.

Also, here's a review of the story by [[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/guest-post-seth-dickinson-on-building-a-better-evil-overlord/][Joel Cunningham]] which does a much better job of shilling and explaining the story than I ever could do.

*** I read the first book and I didn't really care for it. Maybe it's because I've been reading too many webnovels lately and expect everything to be a million words long, but the pacing here felt very fast. There were a lot of time-skips, and we're just /told/ what happened in between rather /shown/ it. All of the "competence" and accounting action happened offscreen and between chapters, basically. Also, I didn't really buy any of the relationships in the latter half either due to the fast pacing.

**** Agreed.

I was excited to go through the two books because it was being touted all around as hard economical/political fiction with an uber-pragmatist protagonist; but it all felt like a sham, because of exactly what you said. We're told things are clever but never really shown why or how. Ultimately, the climax of the book just fell flat and didn't lead to any kind of emotional response; which was sad because it /did/ have a lot of potential to be otherwise.

***** fwiw, I ended up enjoying Tyrant, while I felt Monster was a bit flatter and less resolved. The author seems to have grown a bunch in skill, IMO -- lots of good prose balancing showing thinking as internal dialogue vs getting the thinking across indirectly in interesting ways and with stories-within-stories and interesting real-world-adjacent callouts to concepts. Then again, IMO Traitor was similar, whereas Tyrant is deeper, so you may not enjoy Tyrant if you didn't like Traitor (book1).

*** I got confused by the link in your comment, because I thought it was Seth doing a review of his own story. This review is by Joel Cunningham.

**** I did think that it was a review by Seth. All of the comments about Seth being a handsome devil had me thinking it was Seth writing it. I didn't look closely enough at the author name.

Thanks for the correction and I edited the comment.

** I just finished this third installment recently, and I REALLY enjoyed it, compared to Monster which felt unresolved emotionally to me.

Monster and Tyrant really are very inter-linked.

Tyrant actually advanced on both of the first 2 books in major ways. I felt Baru grew a lot during Tyrant and I had so many moments when I looked back at the past and really marvelled at the growth in so many characters. Solid work for book 3 of 4, and it felt... just right.

I think one critical idea among many I really dug was the layer upon layer of plan - counterplan - countercounterplan. The depth of the planning and tactical thinking was deep, and I felt the latter parts of the story's stuff was well-earned.

We saw the work being done, and not just the "answer" to the circumstances of the universe.

Btw , it's definitely also cool to learn about CTVT too -- a thousands-of-years old transmissable tumor with stable genetics (mutation rate not like other tumors) that passes alive when dogs sex each other. An interesting and really weird thing. The backing research into the feasibility of the universe is fascinating to me, always, similar w/ Blindsight for eg.
