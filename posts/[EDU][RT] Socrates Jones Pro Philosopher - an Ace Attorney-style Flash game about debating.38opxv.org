** The game is linear and it takes a lot of time and resources to make branching paths so there's generally only one or two ways to defeat an argument, unlike in real life - that's a flaw of Ace Attorney too. But aside from that, the game does a decent job of teaching some intelligent debating techniques and how to point out flaws in someone else's and your own arguments. Though I'm not sure the argument used against Hobbes' philosophy worked perfectly.

What about it seemed flawed? I'll admit I was compelled by the argument, but I'm also a stupid libertarian so it might be my bias against "the social contract" argument.

**** Socrates's argument against it was that the contract can't be the source of morality because the sovereign is the one who enforces the contracts and there is no repercussion forcing the sovereign to not break the contract. However, a sovereign would (ideally) fear being overthrown and so would still have to keep up their responsibility of enforcing contracts fairly. Personally I disagree with Hobbes not because I don't think social contracts exist and are a major basis of society but because I think people also have morals from humans nature and upbringing and are not always selfish. Also, I'm curious what being a libertarian has to do with the social contract argument.

***** The sovereign does not fear being overthrown, because it can enforce "Do not overthrow the sovereign." It having that force is the entire point of it being sovereign, to enforce those laws. Start looking enough like you might want to do some overthrowing of a corporate oligarchy on Wall Street, and you'll be met with militarized police in riot gear with tear gas. You're not overthrowing anything, and the sovereign is not afraid.

And if the sovereign could be overthrown, you'd just be right back to your starting point. People would do it out of selfish self-interest, and set right back to breaking their own contracts until a new sovereign arose to begin the cycle anew. This "moral" system creates perpetual slaughter until a strong enough sovereign is formed, ending only in Orwell or Huxley.

****** I think that the biggest flaw in the game is that it has a conversation about which moral system is best without first addressing what morality is.

As a moral anti-realist, I obviously have to say that /Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher/ is making some unstated assumptions.

(But really, even if I thought that natural law, say, were a thing, I'd still think that the game was jumping the gun. For example, there appear to be shades of moral intuitionism in the game; it also feels like there's a non-materialist metaphysics going on, which makes sense in the context of the game's universe, where there are many afterlives, but does not make sense in the context of the game's purpose, which is to teach philosophy, and would be best-served by first establishing up front what kind of metaphysical assumptions we're working with).

******* It's cool. I believe in an objective morality that is in principle knowable though there is no guarantee we might ever attain it. Too much depends on how much of physics is knowable, and what extra tricks nature might throw at us when we go looking. So I had a few objections to the game too.

********* Regarding moral intuitionism -

We do seem to have some innate *black box* inside our head that delivers moral pronouncements. We can't unpack it directly, because it doesn't answer to that part of our mind. But we can feed it hypotheticals, and it gives us answers. These answers seem to only have the force of our own opinion, and they are based in our own knowledge and biases. But we can be presented with a situational hypothetical, and immediately there comes a sense of having weighed morality on one side or the other. This one feels right, that one feels wrong, both of these feel horrible - before we even consciously consider the implications or consequences. But this black box cannot be simply trusted, because its result changes based on learning. To an uninformed person who has no knowledge of healthcare, an open heart surgery performed by a doctor doesn't look like a great good. It looks like a horrible nightmarish assault of wickedness and depravity.

The black box wants things. We don't know exactly what it wants. It doesn't know exactly how to get them. It uses our knowledge. It informs our decisions. And if we ask the right questions, consider the right hypotheticals, feed it the best knowledge, we can get closer to figuring out what it wants by how it answers.

My best guess, is that this part of our brain understands that it is in the best interest of each of us, for all of us to be happy, healthy, productive, educated, and cooperative. I think all five are needed, and I don't know if there might be a sixth or seventh thing or more. I think the goodness of an action, if we could find a way to measure that, would depend on the consequences of that action, judged by its impact, if we could find a way to measure that, on those five criteria multiplied together. I think our efforts are best spent attempting to improve whichever of those five criteria we currently feel to be the worst, to the extent that it does not cause a decrease in the total product.

I strongly suspect the best way to achieve this is by learning more about the universe, its physics, how the particles in our bodies and heads perform biology and cognition, more about our psychology, and using that information to better inform our actions to make them less harmful and more helpful to those five criteria.

********** And that's fine. My problem with moral intuitionism is when its proponents want to say that we can derive an actual moral truth from our moral intuitions. As a TA in Ethics, I've had a number of students tell me that one of the flaws of consequentialism is that it can justify actions that we "intuitively know are wrong".

Which is just... boggling.

(And having just said that, it's possible that I'm being too hard on Socrates Jones and misunderstanding some of his statements. It sounds like he's using moral intuitionism, but maybe I'm just too traumatized by silly students).

****** True, overthrowing the sovereign is a lot harder now and will be harder in the future, but it's not impossible. The high difficulty and risk of revolution is what keeps people from doing it for no reason and causing that perpetual slaughter. I don't think social contracts are a moral system either, just one way of interpreting the social structures that exist in real life. Whether you think social contracts are good or not they seem to be one of the main things keeping some people from killing and exploiting others.

******* I don't accept that humans are inherently selfish. I have seen people give their lives to protect strangers. This makes no sense if Hobbes's assertion about the nature of humanity is correct. His basic premise is false. We can agree to work together because it benefits all of us without qualification, rather than forcing ourselves to make agreements that hurt all of us to survive each other.

Suppose an expert clothier can make every day enough cloth repairs and new clothes to sustain five people. Suppose the expert farmer can do the same for food, the carpenter for housing, etc. In this population of five, they each gain nothing with their extra produce, and if they were selfish would simply burn the excess to deny their fellow man and thus improve their own standing. But trading it benefits all, and costs them nothing. They even benefit because the others trade back. And this is without anyone giving up any rights at all.

#+end_quote

As you can see in my original comment, I don't think humans are entirely selfish and do have a natural sense of empathy. I do think humans are naturally selfish to some extent, just not as much as Hobbes thought. However, I think social contracts do play some role in morals for many people. Not everyone agrees on morals like paying society back through taxes, not beating up people who annoy them, not discriminating in the workplace, etc. even though a society where everyone acted that way would be bad for them, but social contracts discourage them from acting that way.

Also, in your example even a selfish person probably wouldn't burn the excess materials either because they took pride in producing it and want it to be of use or because trading it benefits them more than burning it. But if they could figure out some way to get the excess materials from the others without trading them something in return or suffering any other repercussions then can you say for sure that not even one person in those five would do it? In a world where some people will try to cheat their own family members out of their share of the inheritance, I wouldn't be 100% confident in that bet.

*** Yeah, the game is pretty linear so there's only one argument you can make against each presentation, which is a shame. As far as social contracts go, I'm pretty sure we're forced into them just by being born or living in a particular country. I think Thoreau argued that someone can separate themselves from society willingly but in practice that's very difficult.

Exactly my point, contracts need to fulfill a list of conditions to be valid anywhere else, including an option to say no; so either "the social contract" is not filling those requirements or the theory has been named to be intentionally misleading.

** This game is a surprisingly decent Ace Attorney-style game. It really has a lot of the same pros and cons that the series had, and the humor is pretty similar. So I'd say if you actually like the Ace Attorney gameplay, then check it out.

I'm playing it now. If the game ends with "And therefore, moral utilitarianism is the correct answer" I'm gonna be miffed. Come to think of it, if it says, "Gee, I guess there's no clear answer" I'll also be miffed, so I don't really know what I want. :/

**** Er... I haven't finished it. I got through Rousseau's part. It's not a direct condemnation of the game: I enjoyed the first Phoenix Wright, but I didn't find the gameplay to be compelling enough to play the sequels.

I adore the idea, Socrates Jones had a good amount of innovations gameplay-wise, and I found the business of picking apart arguments apart to be intellectually stimulating. Very glad I tried it out, but I don't think I'm quite the target audience.

**** Basically anything I might say will get this sub raided by [[/r/badphilosophy]]. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/38tw27/why_is_having_a_philosophy_degree_under_my_belt/][Alas, now they're attacking their own, as Scott has a philosophy degree.]]

Strong-naturalist philosophy can be useful. So far, I'm a fan of Peter Railton, the two Churchlands, and maybe I've read dribs and drabs of other stuff.

At one point I also started asking some of my friends who had more education in the humanities than I do if I'm just a dirty STEM wanker or if philosophy really just does seem to everyone like, as one friend put it, "atheistic mysticism." They said it wasn't just me. I sometimes find myself nodding along to the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/4zs/philosophy_a_diseased_discipline/][extremist]] [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/4vr/less_wrong_rationality_and_mainstream_philosophy/][anti-philosophy]] [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/tg/against_modal_logics/][articles]] on LW, which tends to freak me out since I normally find /something/ to object to in anything I read (contrarian dick by nature).

/shrug/

Edit: Actually, no, there /is/ something to object to. Many of the "extremist" articles on LW against the philosophical field, especially in relation to AI, /don't go too far enough/. Comparing philosophy and AI is a kind of bad joke, since /each/ field can accuse the /other/ of having produced nothing and completely failing to live up to its goals, and each is justified within its own framework of thinking. And yet: consciousness is implemented by the brain, and we don't have superintelligent AIs. To make a stronger statement, I think if AI and ML keep going the way they're going at the moment, we will not have superintelligent AIs any time soon. So really, I think both of them should probably get their eyes back on the ball of actual reality.

Overall, you ought to reach for the field of knowledge that best guides you in mapping the actually-existing reality around you. Be ruthless: if you can gain by reading philosophers, do so, and if you can't, don't. One thing philosophers are distinctly good at is challenging your preconceptions; the only problem is finding someone who will challenge already somewhat-accurate preconceptions in favor of /radically/ accurate preconceptions rather than in favor of even-more-nonsensical preconceptions. If you are trying to be "epistemically rational", in LWian terms, then your job is to maximize the degree to which your theories allow you to predict your experiences of the world inside and around you, /not/ to start questioning the nature of reality when it fails to suit your predictions (that's called /depression/).

Most of my interest in philosophy is in the ethical sphere. Epistemology is nice too, but my metaphysics is pretty cleanly settled (although I still like to look at odd metaphysics for the same reason that I like to read mythology: it's often damn interesting, and I might even get a good story idea out of it).
