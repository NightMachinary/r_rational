I've been reading this very obscure webcomic for years and only just realized it meets most of the criteria for rational fiction, [[http://dragondoctors.dhscomix.com/archives/comic/ch-7-page-1-last-victim][so here it is]]. It's a post-post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure about magical doctors that help people that come to their clinic, occasionally fight evil, and grow as people as they live their lives. The tone is reminiscent of Doctor Who, though with a more grounded setting and more serialized story arcs as a result.

Every character has depth to their personality and subtly develops over time, every story arc explores creative ideas and is resolved by intelligence, the setting is a well thought out mixture of sci-fi and fantasy, and the writing is the perfect blend of both light and dark. Except for the first chapter, that is. The link above leads to Ch. 7, which I think puts the comic's best foot forward before starting at the beginning and the author seems to agree.

The only caveat to this story is the artwork. It's never bad enough that you can't tell what you're looking at, but not a single line or texture is drawn smoothly and some pages aren't even colored. The update schedule is also very inconsistent because the author has clinical depression, so it's often difficult for him to write on demand. But I love literally everything else about this story, so I don't care and will happily sing the praises of this webcomic until it gets the attention it deserves.


** The art is too much of a turnoff for me. I took one look at it and just couldn't keep going.

** Cool concept. It's similar to what I'd like to write rationalist fiction about, except my story will be called Medics and Magics (referencing D&D as well as M&M, which in medical lingo refers to Morbidity and Mortality, both a CDC publication as well as a monthly conference held by doctors to talk about things that go wrong.)

[[/u/trekie140]] are you interested in medicine? If so, what are some other rational medical things do you like? What sorts of story plots would you like to see in a serial fiction? (steering away from the 'disease a week' styled serial)

{I'll read the webcomic too and post a comment below with my thoughts and reactions.}

*** This is much more of a medical /drama/ than a medical procedural, and I prefer the former. The problem I have with procedural stories is that I have no knowledge of medicine myself, so I'm completely dependent upon the characters for information. As a result, I care much more about the emotional weight of the story than realism. This comic does a very good job of making me care.

*** I read chapter 7 up to the point where the formerly petrified patient has a mana surge and the plastic surgeon transforms the crystal girl into a huggable elf. The setting seems interesting, but there's a lot of wonky weirdness too.

** The art style screams another comic I used to read but can't for the life of me remember its name. Apparently it got really, really big though.
