** Fascinating tale, would love to read others of its liking (or continuation if there will be, although it reads like a one-off)

Edit: never heard of Baccano before, didn't even realize it was based off that

*** It is. Though this isn't really my "thing", I'd been looking for a short one-off concept, as a way of giving a little back.

Unfortunately for anyone curious, there is at present no legal way to stream/view "Baccano!" in the United States.

**** [[/u/I_am_your_BRAIN]]

Hi, [[/r/Baccano]] mod here. Klein is right; there's no legal way to /stream/ Baccano!...but there /is/ for at least viewing it: if you have Netflix and live in the USA, you can still [[https://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Baccano/70204951][rent the DVDs]] via their rental service. Also never hurts to check one's local libraries.

Anyway... I found this post since I track the 'baccano' keyword on Reddit, sorry to intrude. I also write Baccano! fanfiction (I share both on AO3 and FF, though AO3 is where the fandom is more active and you're more likely to receive comments) so I'll try to leave a review soon.

*Also, a fair bit of the best/A-tier Baccano! fanfiction is /only/ on AO3, never been published to FFN. AO3's formatting is superior too, if you're looking for something less limiting.

(From a quick cursory glance-over, it sounds like this is entirely based on the anime with no knowledge of the light novels? Obviously a lot of it is a direct blow-by-blow of episode 7, quoted directly in many instances, but also: he's referring to the other alchemists -- like Elmer and Fermet -- as if he barely knows them, which doesn't make sense. Plus, the thing about his wife and child...he has a living descendant in 2001. And also "which is how I ended up on the AA in the first place..." That's simply not true.)

(Obviously it's fine if you've never read the light novels +you should though, they're great+, I'm just verifying that's the case).

***** You are welcome to cross-post it, if you think they would enjoy it. As for AO3, FF had the shortest wait time. It was about getting it up.

But you are right, it's just the show plus whatever I could glean from the wiki. When details are unclear, you have to make them up, as well as changing a few things to match the conceit of the rational genre.

I did assume that his living descendant was born after 1711. Is that not the case? (Not saying their names was a conceit both for the brevity of the format, and as a deliberate characterization choice)

****** Oh that's true; you have to wait for the invite link on AO3. Still, I'm sure everyone would be happy to see you post over there (I'd rather not copy your fic in your stead; I mean, I'd obviously have credited you, but I would rather not).

Ah, right. I'm the sysop of the Baccano! Wiki, so I do apologize where the information there is lacking; I became an admin of it about two years ago, but there's still so much that wasn't on the wiki that I still have yet to get to.

Ooh, I may have jumped the gun through inference when it came to the 'wife and child' mention (cursory glanceovers aren't great for comprehension...). Since I saw no mention of a descendant therein, I'd inferred from the fic that Szilard was meant to have no living relatives left. ("I mourned my family...")

Unfortunately I have no idea as to Szilard's family situation in the 1711s. I /can/ tell you that Bilt (his living descendant in 2001) is already an elderly man when he makes his debut. He's said to have never met Szilard, but his grandfather served as Szilard's assistant for some time in America (before returning to the home country of the Quates family).

******* I'd really like to see more Vamp! novels, but I should really finish the existing Baccano novels as well. I liked Durarara!, but the anime was enough for me in that case, and that the novel series (Durarara!) extends beyond that point seems unnecessary, albeit with a different cast. Etsusa Bridge doesn't quite catch my interest from its description, but I've never actually given it a try.

I know that Hariyama-san and the Center of the World isn't technically in the Naritaverse, but I'd like to see more of that translated as well.

If anyone unfamiliar with the Ryohgo Narita's works is reading this comment, the key fact is that 4 of his novel series all exist in the same universe. Vamp! is obviously vampire related, but with enough originality and trademark Narita craziness that it's nothing like a typical vampire series. Etsusa Bridge takes place around 2025? Durarara is early 2000s. Baccano storylines are in the early 1700s, 1930s, and 2000-2001. Character interaction is fairly limited between the different series, it's mostly just passing references.

******** Ooh, rare to encounter another Naritaverse peruser in the wild. Hello! Yes, we're all still waiting for Vamp! VI to return from the war...so I'd definitely agree you should catch up to Baccano! LN22 (not to mention, LN23 could be coming out this year).

I admit that out of the four, Durarara!! is the one I'm least invested in. I still really /like/ it, and care about it, but if I had to rank them by way of preference (something I'm normally not keen on doing), it'd go something like: Baccano!, Vamp!, Etsusa Bridge (it's more like they're tied with Vamp! having the edge), and Durarara!!. There's a good write-up a Baccano! fan did on why Baccano! appeals to her more than Drrr!! does, and I find myself agreeing with multiple points...

Oh man, you really should read Etsusa Bridge. The first volume, at minimum, because the first volume is /really dang good/. (I recommended to a fellow on the [[/r/LightNovels]] Discord server that they should start with EB or Vamp! for their Naritaverse ventures with emphasis on EB, since it's complete -- he came back and said it was the best LN they'd read yet. I was so happy!)

Oh yeah, Hariyama-san is definitely not part of the Naritaverse (a strong tell being that it has ghosts, which aren't really...a thing/addressed in the Naritaverse) but I've enjoyed what I've read of the fan-translation anyway. Read all of volume one, still patiently waiting for each volume 2 update.

(Speaking of Hariyama-san, Ginjima for Best Dad).

Etsusa Bridge is mostly 2019-2021, actually, with the beginning scene taking place in 2014. And you've got it right about Baccano!, except that the 2000s era is from 2000-2003, not 01. (For clarity, the 1700s are: 1705; 1710; 1711 | and the 1930s: 1930; 1931; 1932; 1933; 1934; 1935. 1936 if you count the second drama CD. There's also the 1927 mini-arc).

(Also, Vamp! is set 2004-05 so far).

And that's right -- there's no specific order one needs to read the series in, as they don't have dramatic influences on each other's plots. But there sure are a lot of cross-references -- and one or two of them /do/ subtly influence the other, actually. The first that comes to mind is [[#s][Durarara!!/Baccano! 2002 arc]]

I'm in too deep. I love this 'verse.
