A year or two ago I read and Au superman story where Superman tried to do good with his powers in a more "effective altruism" kind of way. The most specific example I remember was fixing satellites. I think he also took humanitarian aid to countries that others couldn't reach. I thought I found it through [[/r/rational]] but I can't seem to locate it in search. Thanks in advance!

Edit: It's Veritas! Thanks so much [[/r/rational]]!


** You might be thinking of [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][this SMBC comic]]? There's also one actual fanfic which is vaguely related, where an AU Clark Kent hears reports of Superman from another universe and decides to start trying to use his abilities to do good... but unfortunately, I don't have the link.

/Edit: It's [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16089/ShayneT+Veritas.htm][Veritas]], linked by [[/u/gbear605]] below./

** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16089/ShayneT+Veritas.htm]] may or may not be what you're looking for, but either way it's worth a read.

** If this exists I want to know about it. I always wanted a Superman story where he spends effort on space industry and terraforming and the like rather than crime fighting.

** I'm seriously tempted to read Veritas, but I'm worried that I will be turned off if it's disrespectful towards canon!Superman. I understand why a lot of people don't like him, but I do and don't want to see an indictment of the character. I'm okay with a different take on him, I was actually okay with Man of Steel's version even if I prefer others, just not one that condemns canon!Superman for his decisions based on his values and situation.

I've read about a quarter of it, and it doesn't seem to condemn cannon Sups at all. In fact, due to spoilers, at this point it's about a somewhat damaged Clark Kent with powers aspiring to be more like Sups from the comic books.
