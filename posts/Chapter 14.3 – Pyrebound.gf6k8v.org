** I loved how the memories act as a deadman's switch! You can't screw the Ensi over or the next one will know you did it, and he'll have the power of the pure to wreak his vengeance.

*** There's one unknown: it hasn't been disclosed how the pyre chooses its next candidate in a vacancy, or if it's truly random. It could, potentially, randomly pick Etana or some other diehard aristocrat. Of course, this is highly improbable, given the ratio of elite, non-castrated men to ordinary working-class schlubs. They'd have to either get really lucky or have the pyre show really perverse priorities. They do not have cause to feel lucky lately.

*** I do appreciate the continual feedback--not that I need flattery or anything, just because it gives me data to work with. Otherwise I'd be operating in a void, with no clue if the story was going off the rails.
