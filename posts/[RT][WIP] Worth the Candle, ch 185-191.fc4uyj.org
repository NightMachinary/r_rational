*** It fits with Juniper, but at the same time, it shows that he's a bit farther on his way of the murderhobo/being corrupted by power. In one of the Discworld novels Vimes thought about how killing Because The Job Demands It, and not doing a funny one-liner, made it better, and I think this is somewhat applicable here, since Onion was still a human (even if a pretty horrific one), as real as everybody else*.

Never mind shared circuitry, he might have done collateral damage to /anything/ that happened to be acting up under torture. Fear? Humility? The icky feeling of sweaty skin?

One would think he'd have found the time to undo or at least neaten his hack job on the way back to civilization, but he did have a lot on his mind.

I think his recklessness is just a fairly normal emotional response to the recent trauma he has been through. He did let himself get talked down by Amaryllis after all.

Frankly Joon's utter disrespect was a bit annoying -- this guy got his skills the hard way. Onion struck me more as a hardass (and reformed bloodknight) than a complete snake like Hyacinth, and could plausibly be convinced to play nice.

Now that Anyblade is all rusted can Joon claim the Everyblade? I mean who is going to contest him walking out with it?

Also I really agree with Joon: Hyacinth has organized a repeated, insidious and very dangerous campaign to flat out kill them, sick dragons on them, and most recently (while at truce talks) kidnapping them, murdering Solace, and torturing Joon and Pallida. Letting people like that live is just bad policy.

I am getting a bit annoyed by the power up mechanism where if Joon wants to do anything important he has to sacrifice points to amp something up to game breaking levels. It takes away from the progression fantasy for one thing. That one mechanic makes all his standard abilities kinda pointless.

What on earth was Joon's plan with letting Yarrow and Zinnia go? He knows they can kill all of them with Shia Surprise, and were seriously considering using it already.

I dunno that he had a 'plan' per se, he is just, you know, an ordinary person from earth. Those of us who aren't, like, double war criminals don't typically kill helpless prisoners.

If you want to stretch for a possible plan you can say that he knew Yarrow would come around in a while, due to the spirit work he'd done on him. He could have intended something similar for Zinnia. As far as the world and their own self image is concerned they were impressed by his nobility and magnanimity in victory.

Now that Onion is dead, his abilities well known amongst the court and Hyacinth on the ropes handing over a bunch of prisoners to say Rosemallow to either spirit away to another secret prison - a thoroughly justified comeuppance - or turn into useful assets would be easy.

This sequence of events was also really predictable as was the possibility that Onion could be convinced to side with them because it turned out he really did have layers or whatever to make the entire Anglecyn plotline go away once it was unwelcome. Joon is gambling his ethics with the DM not scheming around political entities that are likely to be gone in a decade.

I don't thikn it was a concrete plan, but more of a self-safety check. My feeling for Joon's aversion is that if you can avoid consequences of soul raping someone by killing them after the fact, it may be harder to prevent yourself from using soul magic again. In that way self-imposing consequences to acts of great evil as a way to dis-incentivize any future repeats makes sense.

Hard agree. I really like this story, I don't mind restrictions like 'no magic' coming into play, but it feels like the repercussions of sacrificing skills lives in the background at best. He has multiple abilities that he's able to dump in order to achieve these effects, let alone scraping souls for their abilities. Realistically the world is already scaled to his ability, with individual quests scaling up as needed, and the parts where he's thinking about how things could've gone differently are interesting. But when the only cost he pays is not tangible, mostly from explicitly chosen dump stats/skills that get trained offscreen, it doesn't really matter.

***** I'm not going to make the layer pun for the 19th time, but I think you are only seeing his outer... stratum. From what we know he provoked people who attacked him first, then he killed them. We don't know the details of these people or encounters, and they were a long time ago. He apparently largely reformed after surviving the cthonic exclusion zone.

Calling everyone else insects is a worrisome trait perhaps, but strikes me as in line with a warrior (who has survived the nigh impossible with guts and skill) dismissive of cringing, backstabbing politicians and panem et bloodsports observers with no personal skill. He is disgusted by them, yet forced to play their games. Now he finally met someone who can appreciate the power and art of this fight, and offers a snide remark on the bloodthirsty crowd safe in their seats. It makes for an interesting character trait, not a 'powerful monster that needed to be put down, no more, no less.'

All that isn't to say that Joon was wrong to kill him. That was clearly morally allowable, and pragmatically necessary at that point.

I wonder how good Onion would be in a real fight with unboosted Juniper. Would blood and bone magic give him the strength and speed to beat him? Does still magic beat bladebound, since it's' only pseudomagic? I assume that 'in the real world' metamages would trump even the best swordsmen, especially revision mages.

I know bones and blood are pretty good but how could he get the speed he needs? Presumably Onion has other entads. Passion, air and water aren't that useful. Stilling and unicorn magic for defence, vibration and gem magic for offence.

It all comes down to whether he can still a super-inviolable attack or not because I don't think he has the stats to fight sword to sword. Even if he did, Onion would cut straight through with 2D sharpness.

** (Just FYI, AW retconned Ring of the Broken World, so the scene scything through Harold's mooks now doesn't have to have the inconsistency with Joon being trapped under a net and by a revision mage despite his ability to teleport.)

Such good chapters. The humor was amazing, I loved the character moments, and legitimately the best fight scene in years. Well worth the wait, and it's a huge batch as well.

Kinda disappointed that they didn't get more info from Y&Z, but made up for by Joon rolling a nat 1 on his insight check on Pallida.

Joon fucking with Onion is immensely funny. "You'd be a vegetable for the rest of your life." "You're leeking." "That is a very rude way to speak to your beloved nephew who is alive." I was cracking up at these. And this is /after/ he dropped the comedy skill.

Onion using the flickerblade confirms that Amaryllis got it back after Li'o.

Gotta say that I didn't expect a marriage in this batch. Luckily, Juniper Penndraig already has a flower name, so he doesn't stand out until he opens his mouth.

  “Juniper knows everything,” said Amaryllis. This was pretty much true, with only one glaring exception that she could think of, and that one thing was interpersonal rather than being relevant in an information security context.

Kind of feels silly to mention this after talking about them literally getting married, but Amaryllis is all but confirming her attraction to Joon.

  Ring of the Broken World: Despite the weird title, it was really just a limited form of teleportation. Instead of having a set distance, it could teleport me such that I was still touching the place that I had originally been standing in, preserving my momentum. I could teleport up so that my feet were where my head had been, or I could teleport to the side so that my left hand was where my right hand had been. In other words, the maximum distance was pitifully short, but it was activated by thought, and could be used many times in rapid succession, which meant that it had combat utility.

Even with that Juniper would have died if Amaryllis hadn't denied Onion her entad at the key moment. Maybe a different entad would have made up for it, but Juniper didn't actually know all the details going into the fight about how strong Onion was or all the virtues he would have.

  The problem with the synergies in general was that Reimer didn't know all of them, and he half expected that “I” had made them up as needed for different games or just to give non-item rewards. There were a few that Reimer had been able to confirm for certain, like the blade-bound one and the monkish one....

** I had a conversation on this subreddit a while back about whether or not the "harem" or more accurately the multi-person romantic elements of WTC were a subversion or not, with me firmly on the 'not' side. The idea on the subversion side being that while it has romance elements it never really goes into romantic tropes per se, its meant to deconstruct them.

Anyway Mary just had a clone herself made so that Joon and her could make out such that it "doesn't count", while they got political-married but it totally doesn't mean anything, baka! Give me any given year of harem anime and I swear I will find both of those plots somewhere on the seasonal chart!

Which is all praise btw, I find the romantic/personal elements of WTC to be some of the best parts of the story that really set it apart (prob said this before). Ratfics have a high tendency to dehumanize the characters via focus on the plot, and perhaps adopt an over-serious tone. The best characters always have the full spectrum of human problems to tackle, and sometimes they are tackled in patently ridiculous-while-also-serious ways.

*** A lot of the harem stuff is played straight (only for incredibly discomforting results instead of wish-fulfillment ones), but I still feel like there's an element of subversion here...

- You have the "Fated Heroine" being the second choice, with every interaction between them underscored by an existential dread that they're following the plan of an eldritch god

- The "young, innocent one" starts off as /dangerously, horrifyingly/ innocent, and progresses to an opposite kind of terrifyingly hyperaware of every social interaction that makes the MC seem innocent in comparison

- There's one that was both raped by his best friend and then raped the MC in turn - which holy fuck, I can't begin to unpack, is there even precedence to compare it to in other harems?

- Grak is surprisingly the most Harem-like, with a one-sided attraction that the protagonist returns half-heartedly as a friend (but is complicated primarily by issues of non-binary gender. Not a subversion really, but fairly uncommon)

- Raven is still not fully established, but there's an odd mix of "childhood friend I wronged and want to atone to" and "a way for me to get over the thing I sort of had for the ~30 year old man when I was 12 but not really" - classic Harem tropes!

- Joon is implicitly suggested to fuck the Doe by an achievement. What the fuck. I'm hoping there's some "Spiritual Druidic Soulbonding" bullshit equivalent to that, but judging by the DM's sense of humor... probably not.

And just looking at your example in particular: The clone feels a lot like a deliberate callback to the /previous time/ Joon fell in love with an alternate, doomed version of Amaryllis. This might be the start of a strange pattern for them... I have thoughts about the marriage stuff, but suffice it to say, their relationship is a strange meta-clusterfuck.

...Then there's *Fenn.* The "Upbeat second stringer that almost never wins but makes the entire harem work by just being there" which won easily, then had their relationship get so thoroughly broken that a supersocial therapist couldn't find a conceivable fix for it, and then she immediately died.

I don't know if "subversion" or "deconstruction" are really the words for it, but this harem sure is working on some 4D parallel universe logic!

**** This is good comment! I sadly wont give it the justice it deserves, as I had a full debate on this subject in the previous thread and I feel like its good practice not to re-litigate things (I emphatically do not want to become "the harem guy"!), I just found this update hilarious in that context.

All I will say is that I totally agree that the harem elements in WtC are weird and parallel-universe-y, and in particular they are super meta, all about trope & media awareness and how it impacts the relationships. I would just separate that from a subversion - they are a weird harem, also a very adult and plot focused harem (so it doesnt look like a slice of like anime ofc), but still very much a harem, with all of them having romantic potential with Joon and his back-and-forth on the romance topics a big part of his plot.

But hey, media vocabulary is vague for sure, I think everyone has conflicting definitions of words like "subversive" or even "meta". We all will find different words that fit what we see.

** So, forget the technicalities of using undisclosed magic in a trial by combat (because as you're about to read Juniper is in FAR worse trouble because he can PROVE he didn't use other magics). Forget the insanely impressive things Juniper has done which are arguably technically possible with the right entads, no, let's focus on the important part.

Here is a list of literally impossible things that an audience of hundreds and at least a half dozen warders have witnessed Juniper do:\\
* Juniper can instantly teleport at lightning speed to avoid an undodgeable blade. He can do this repeatedly. The witnessing Warders will confirm he did this without magic or entads.\\
* Juniper can begin to dodge attacks before he should have any legitimate way of knowing an attack was coming.\\
* Juniper can deflect a bladebound's sword edge with his bare hands when it has been shown to cut through literally anything. Again, without magic or entads as Warders confirm.\\
* Juniper can strike people through armor with his fists without even needing to touch the armor. No magic, no entads.\\
* Juniper can directly kill someones soul by punching them in the head, overpowering an entad that should be able to resurrect them. With no entads, or magic.\\
* Juniper can levitate in the air and glow without magic or entads.\\
* Juniper can regenerate lost limbs. Without Magic or Entads.

This is not everything he can do, this is just the things he did during this fight for which there is no possible explanation other than "I follow different rules to regular mortals".

He's is also likely the greatest multi-mage on Aerb (confirmed in front of the General Council) and just went blow for blow with the best bladebound there was and actually got the first lethal hit on them proving he was better than them at their own specialty.

Juniper won't have to say he's Arthur reborn, everyone will already think it.

Quite of few of those people could be willing to risk a likely death for the unlikely reward of being able to hold onto their corrupt power. Especially if Joon makes it clear by his actions that he won't tolerate those kinds of people in his new order.

And it doesn't matter if Joon says he is not interested, people won't believe him.

In fact the worst issue might be people 'on his side' trying to prop him up as a new ruler and getting in the way of the quest. Joon is strong, but its too early for him to be safely famous.

I do agree that it will make things more complicated, but Juniper has no particular plans for Anglecynn. All they want is for Hyacinth's faction to stop fucking with them. Maybe in the future they will do something to stir up the desperate corrupt opposition you are predicting, but I doubt it. Based on the Cypress timeline I think its quite likely that Amaryllis will easily handle Anglecynn politics. Hell the quest text all but confirmed that no one wants to screw with them anymore.

** Commenting as I go along:

185 * having the mirror room be a mirrored room, rather than a room full of mirrors, is a nice little twist, of the sort that AW is good at. Little details are part of why I like this series so much.

- Grak's comment about Amy's family making her worse is very true. For all she frame's herself as dispassionately calculating she is a human, and these are the people who have in effect abused and manipulated her her whole life. Psychological realism yay.

- Hyacinth being emotional is interesting. I almost wonder if it's genuine and the idea that everyone here is manipulative is all in Amy's head. But unlikely. It is still worth noting that Amy almost never considers genuine emotion as an explanation for people's actions.

- Have we heard of the wiffle exclusion zone before? Or the lower cthonic?

- Onion is a fascinating character we've only had hints of previously. Could be a primary character in another story. Definitely has layers

- My first thought with the contracts is that they don't say anything about what happens if the signatories die

- Interesting to see in Hollly someone in the court who seems to actually care about the law

#+begin_quote
  He was undoubtedly the most important though, above and beyond even Solace, though that would be impolite to say out loud
#+end_quote

- interesting that Amy ranks Solace second in importance after juniper. Wonder how much that's the pseudo child thing vs her being the last druid

- releasing a rare and incredibly dangerous monster seems a level of escalation we hadn't seen before, particularly as they used non lethal means for the capture. Possibly hints that there's a third party who doesn't care about getting hyacinth killed in the process.

  Aside from the natal souls, new people in the hells were a rarity, enough that if there were sufficient levels of unification, it might be possible for them to interrogate anyone who fell within certain criteria
#+end_quote

I hadn't realised that the rates of soul collection on death were so high that they meant new souls were rare. I had assumed it was at best 50/50,with the tight time window and the number of civilisations that werent integrated into the "international community". I suppose that the deaths we see are fairly unusual, as even in a quasi medieval society more people die of disease than violence. And forms of assisted suicide are probably a common way to make sure the soul is bottled. Does raise the question of how the runic spikes are widely distributed.

So it seems like the restrictions on soul magic are less strict than we thought, if such a glaring loophole exists. At least for royalty. Would think the known presence of soul mages would provoke some paranoia.

Interesting countermeasure. Basically training themselves to respond to interrogation in a very specific way to the point that its entirely reflexive. Seems like it would be vulnerable to other ways of disrupting someone's concentration, or just waiting long enough they eventually have to do something that interacts with their values. But perhaps the idea is to just delay giving out useful information long enough. As discussed in the flashback with Arthur talking about torture

The fact that these two have seemingly been trained for so long to resist interrogation implies there's people within the court who are arranging this sort of intensive training for the young royals. Since it seems like this would take literal years of practice. Which seems very different from the relatively low responsibility lifestyle most royals seem to lead.

The soul collection rate doesn't need to be that crazy good for this to be true. Just running the numbers, if there's billions of people on Areb, an average life expectancy of 60 years, and only a 95% soul collection success rate -- which is probably a low bound -- and 5000 hells, that comes to just a couple souls per hell a day. Something that happened twice a day on earth would be a rarity if it happened near where you live.

****** Amaryllis mentioned it was 92% in On the Merits of Oblivion. The vast majority of deaths are going to be caused by illness, or generally something where you're surrounded by other people. There are about as many spikes as there are people. In addition to that, first responders will obviously carry spikes, and velocity mages are mentioned to work as first responders a lot. Revision mages can undo deaths in a large area at range, so long as the deaths aren't caused by magic. "Bottled suicide" is mentioned as being a thing, so if for example you get lost in the wilderness and think you'll starve to death, you could bottle your own soul, so long as you think to bring a spike and bottle.

*** In ch 190, we are told Joon has this virtue (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  *One-Handed Weapons 80, Diamond Blade:* */One-handed weapons you wield never break/* or dull, even if they would do so due to magic, magical effects, entads, or entad effects, though they may still suffer other conditions and effects. Your one-handed weapons do twice as much damage when they hit.
#+end_quote

But in ch 191, Joon's one-handed weapon breaks (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  I pulled a sword from Sable, completely non-magical and unbound, and parried the attacker from behind at the same time as I parried Onion in front of me. Unfortunately, the non-bonded blade wasn't infinitely sharp, and couldn't properly block the sword behind me, and I felt the bite of a blade before “dodging” ten feet away, my movement far more like teleportation than actual movement. */The sword I'd been using to parry with had been sliced in two/*, and I dropped it to the ground, with the probability blade held in front of me.
#+end_quote

How does a sword that can "never break" get "sliced in two"? Is that not a typical example of a "break"?

Or does the Diamond Blade virtue not apply to a one-handed weapon wielded in your offhand?

Or is there some inconsistency between the Diamond Blade virtue and the Grandmaster Blade-Bound virtue that is implicitly resolved in favour of the latter? (For reference, the latter provides: "Your bonded weapon is infinitely sharp ... Your bonded weapon can cut inviolable materials.")

In the case of an attack on "inviolable" armor, there is a clear corresponding exception in the Grandmaster Blade-Bound virtue ("can cut inviolable materials"). But in the case of an attack on an 'unbreakable' weapon, there is no such clear corresponding exception (eg "can break unbreakable materials"). I think that difference in language or approach is where my confusion has come from.

The significance of the precise language used in those virtues is highlighted later too (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  I saw my probability blade flicker once before materializing into a rusted, pitted sword. ... I swore at what complete bullshit it was that my sword wasn't actually inviolable like my armor was. */I had the Diamond Blade virtue, but it only said that my sword would never break/* or dull, and apparently two degrees of reasonableness wasn't enough for me to argue the point. */As I looked at the rusted out probability blade, it/* *hadn't* */actually broken/*, and the cutting edge was as sharp as ever, it was just that whatever magical effect had been applied to the blade, it had stopped it from doing its probability thing.
#+end_quote

In the first passage I raised above, the blade has actually broken.

  I was actually a /lot/ worse at swordfighting */while holding something in my offhand/*, and not just because I was really worried about the fire soaker suffering some malfunction or leak that would end up fucking me.
#+end_quote

This confused me at first, because the Off-handed virtue means there is no penalty for Joon holding items in his offhand:

#+begin_quote
  *One-Handed Weapons 60, Off-handed:* When wielding a one-handed weapon, using non-weapon items in your off-hand(s) can be done as easily as if you had both (or all) hands available, even when this is unreasonable. This applies to shields. For the purposes of this virtue, pistols and other one-handed ranged weapons are considered one-handed weapons.
#+end_quote

I think the original passage should read "while holding */a weapon/* in my offhand".

(I had initially thought the fire soaker was an item rather than a weapon, as it cannot itself inflict any damage --- it just sprays a liquid, which could be on an enemy but could also be on the ground, and the liquid so sprayed may ignite in particular circumstances, and the resulting fire may cause non-magical fire damage --- but given the properties of chlorine trifluoride I think it can reasonably be described as a ranged weapon too. And googling revealed to me that flamethrower weapons are apparently a thing in D&D anyway.)

An epic level vibration mage doesn't have any real defense against being shot, other than to break the gun or the person holding the gun before being shot. An air mage could suffocate a grandmaster still mage at range, despite being otherwise fairly weak. Void has been noted to bypass a ton of defences, and still and gold mages don't have any real defense against them. Revision mages don't have much innate offense, but could probably outlast a bunch of other mages, forcing a stalemate.

  Onion was the kind of man who there were always rumors about, which made it hard to separate fact from fiction. It was said that he'd parried a car once, using his blade to sweep it aside. During his time in the Golden Cete, he'd reportedly killed fifty men single handedly when his company's position had been overrun. His blade was supposedly so pseudomagically sharp that it could slice clean through a person in full plate without so much as slowing down.
#+end_quote

Can I just comment on how bullshit Onion's own life must have been, from his perspective?

Like, at first the guy starts murdering people, and they send him to a deadly wasteland in what other countries consider a particularly barbaric form of execution. He survives that, starts murdering people again, then gets sent to a deadlier wasteland.

And then, through the process of escaping /that/, he becomes so good at killing things that it's considered legally impossible to arrest him, and physically impossible to kill him.

Like, seriously, look at the virtues Juniper lists, and consider that he probably has most of them.

He can /parry cars with a sword/.

He can parry bullets shot by a sniper from behind him /even if he has no awareness of the sniper/, and his sword is sheathed when the sniper pulls the trigger.

This is a guy who has lived his full life with the power available to a late campaign player character, and who acts exactly the part. His analysis of Juniper was amazing.

And then, despite his lifetime of training, despite the fact that he brings one of the most overpowered entads his country has to offer, he gets punched to death by an asshole in underwear.

Too bad, I liked him.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm afraid that's not the offer,” said Hyacinth. “You agreed to my terms once, then went to Rosemallow and decided on renegotiating. I'm not going to let you leave here so that you can use this meeting as leverage.” There was an unspoken ‘again'. Amaryllis had used Hyacinth as leverage over Rosemallow.
#+end_quote

It seems a little strange that Amaryllis doesn't even consider checking in with Grak and Juniper, considering what she said earlier about them being stakeholder. That was a really easy trap to avoid.

On the other hand, maybe it's the kind of mistake that's a lot easier to see in hindsight, since we already know what happened to Juniper.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm with child,” said Hyacinth, placing a hand against her stomach. “My little boy will grow up not knowing his father.” She shook her head, and a real, actual tear slid down her face. Crying on command was, Amaryllis knew, difficult, though easier if you were drawing on actual emotions. Who knew whether the pregnancy was real. It was never a lie you could call someone on, and if there were no baby, then she could simply claim a miscarriage. “I know that what Larkspur did was wrong. I said as much to him. If you killed him in self-defense --- all I want to know is what happened.”
#+end_quote

It's interesting that the thought that Hyacinth may be sincerely grieving doesn't even occur to Mary.

On the one hand, given what we know about Hyacinth, her previous actions, the fact that she's very much in the process of screwing Mary over, and what we generally know about how deceptive Penndraig can get, it seems very likely that this was a bait on some level.

On the other hand, Mary watches a woman cry about her dead husband and their unborn child, and the only thought that comes to her is "Okay, so what kind of game is this?"

I can kind of see what she said about her family making her a worse person.

#+begin_quote

  “Yes,” replied Amaryllis, almost as soon as the question was out of my mouth. “Per the Decency Acts, Juniper and I have been cohabiting for the past three months and qualify to waive the wait time. I need a witness to vouch.”

  “I --- I vouch,” said Lisi from her place on the council.

  [...] Phlox called out, “Silence them.”

  I wasn't good enough at vibration magic to out-compete both of the vibration mages at the same time, though I sure gave it my damnedest. Fortunately, Amaryllis was prepared, because she started rapidly signing in Gimb.

Well, hello there, Juniper's hubris. You're showing up more and more often lately.

  I ran forward to attack this work in progress, and was brought to my knees by a glow of green magic that shrieked in my skull. It didn't stop until Onion was back together, gasping within his armor, whole once more, even the fingers that I'd cut off back on his hand.

#+begin_quote

If I were Onion, I would have added some decorative bit over the life-counter gems. That way, even if my opponent managed to kill me, they'd assume I was immortal and probably lose some morale and/or try something reckless instead of wearing me down.

On the other hand, Onion really wasn't expecting Juniper to kill him even once, so that's an understandable mistake.

#+end_quote

Okay, so I looked for videos about chlorine trifluoride on Youtube, and holy shit this stuff is bad. It can kill you on contact even if you wash it away /and also amputate the affected limb/.

#+end_quote

No, the wards stop you from using most magics.

What the referee told Juniper was basically "If you manage to find a loophole and use magic anyway, we're executing you".

Although, really, if he'd been desperate enough to break the rules anyway, he could have pulled additional entads out of Sable to kill Onion, and then bailed with another entad. The arena seemed kind of unprepared for that possibility.

They could have warded the area against teleportation keys, but 1 that doesn't work against other random transport entads, 2 they clearly didn't since Mary managed to teleport out. Prior to the skin exclusion, they could have given Juniper a Fool's Choker, assuming the wards could be tuned to stop him from using skin magic without disabling the choker (and even then, that doesn't work if Juniper teleports to a place with a ward against skin magic).

I think the assumption was that warders would check that the contestants only brought two entads, and that none of the entads were teleportation related, but that obviously doesn't work with Sable since it can be used to smuggle additional entads.

Yeah, when you think about it, the opsec of this duel was kind of terrible. There wasn't much stopping either contestant from bailing if they thought they would lose, save for the fact that both of them completely expected to win and made no effort to prepare the other eventuality.

#+begin_quote

This seems like when people complained about Superman losing the fight at the end of /The Metropolitan Man/. Like, yeah, okay, the character made some really poor decisions, but I can kind of buy that after a lifetime of being completely, utterly unconcerned about any kind of physical harm, he'd just get into the habit of assuming he's going to win any fight he gets in.

(although, yeah, some kind of line where he goes "Oh shit, you might be Uther's successor after all; I might be fucked" would have been nice)

I was more annoyed about the dragon lady explicitly recognizing that Joon was like Uther, explicitly saying that Uther kept slaughtering his enemies no matter how much they prepared for him, and she still thinks it's a good idea to blackmail him.

When June was tempting Fate continuously just before the fight proper - man. He's the protagonist, so a part of me was sure he was going to come through the fight fine, but he could not have racked up the Overconfident-Idiot flags any faster or harder.

Not sure how I feel about the romance. It's well written, no qualms there, and true to their characters. Still, the parts of WTC that get heavily focused on relationship dynamics are the low water mark, for me, and I sort of hope this doesn't foreshadow a shift towards that narrative paradigm.

*** In the last batch, the party went to Anglecynn to resolve Amaryllis' issues with her family (her "cousin" Hyacinth sent the Dragonic Confedaracy at her and Miunun). While Amaryllis negotiated (in Chapter 185), Juniper, Pallida and Solace were captured by Allies of Hyacinth and brought to the Anglecynn black site, from which Juniper fought his way out. Edit: with the help of Solace.

Edit2: There also was a chapter showing what Val and Bethel are up to, which seems to be talking, manning a sweets shop, and local gang-busting/-reassignment.

Its a reference to this. They are talking about potentially making their relationship romantic instead of platonic. Ideally they are identifying potential issues before they come up between Juniper and Primaryllis. There is also the fact that they are married now so they are trying to figure out where they stand with each other. If the conversation goes poorly they would likely keep things platonic. If things go well, they might move things toward the romantic.

There's no tension or excitement in the fight, Joon is going to win because he has access to impossible powers.

My main gripe was a total lack of using Sable creatively. Once Joon was backed into a corner, he shouldn't have just had another backup set of OP combat stats. It would have been compelling if he were just pulling all the tricks out of the Glove, throwing bizarre shit at this oncoming deadly force while unarmed and dodging frantically. The godlike "punch him to death" finish doesn't really allow for much tension or growth.

Maybe the final win comes from Monkish Ascendant, which he thought would be useless - he fills the arena with acidic cloud/vapor, but his Inviolable body renders him immune while he holds his breath with Body Statis.

*** I think this is one of my few major gripes with this story overall: his min-maxing so often ends up feeling pointless because no matter what he does, when it's him fighting directly, he consistently makes it out on a sliver that amounts to a lucky dice roll, regardless of where the natural odds of the situation should lie. Correspondingly, this takes away from the times he does lose things, as it generally feels like merely a forced choice of the narrative.

But in this case I was fine with it. This fight didn't need to have tension, because it's his violent stress relief from a stressful arc, and I would expect the hypocrisy is there fully intentionally. It is certainly at home with the wider narrative.
