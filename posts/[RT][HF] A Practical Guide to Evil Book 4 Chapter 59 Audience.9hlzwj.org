All this time... equal enmity to /all/ surface dwellers, whether good or evil... most prominent Empire on the continent... insanely proud... never involved in surface affairs... never aligned to any story...

The dwarves were the True Neutrals all along!

And /of course/ they'd be annoyed that their world was run by insane gods and would want to fix it...

****** It was more a commentary on how angels in this universe are, from our perspective, evil deontologists. They have principles and rules they cannot break, but those rules don't align with human needs at all. They're just as willing to cause mass slaughter and misery as the Gods Below. So when a being called "The King of the Dead" rises, slaughtering his whole kingdom in a ritual to make him immortal and rend a permanent hole in the fabric of reality, what do the angels do? Brainwash thousands of people and have them march to their deaths at the hands of the monster. The angels are worse than useless because they only ever meddle in human affairs by destroying people and leading what remains to its doom. It's what happened to the seventh crusade, it's what happened to William, it's what's in the process of happening to the White Knight, and it's what would have happened to Liesse if our hero hadn't intervened.

Almost every death in every conflict since the beginning of this story can be placed squarely on the shoulders of Above. Malicia would have been perfectly content to reform Praes in peace, eliminating the most abominable elements and overall improving the conditions for everyone in the so-called evil empire. If she'd been left to her own devices, if Above had been content to just watch and see where she was going with all these ideas of hers, none of the conflicts on the surface of Calernia would be happening right now. But they didn't. So, instead, Malicia felt the need to quietly sponsor the creation of the ultimate superweapon. If Above hadn't pushed Procer into war or had convinced them to clean their own house for a few decades, Cat would have remained a competent and unoppressive sovereign rather than forcing her into the corner with no good options.

To put it another way, Above created the Wandering Bard before Below sponsored the Dead King. We know that the terms of the game that is creation allow each side to only use power in proportion to that which the other uses, so we know that Above knew their choice to create an immortal, unstoppable force with the power to manipulate an entire continent at once would have consequences. They did it anyway. Below responded in kind, as was their right, and obliterated a Kingdom. Above is and always has been ham-fisted and brash, acting without thinking of consequences and only coming out ahead by escalating every conflict they meddle in before Below reacts in kind. Below responds by gaining more institutional power, every time. Praes has been invaded countless times by armies led by the Scions of the Heavens themselves, and though they have caused regime change on occasion, they have never eliminated Praes or made any other substantive, long-term gain. They manage to win every battle and lose every war, in the long run. They always fail, and when they fail, they always proceed to make everything worse.

The angels are useless against the Dead King because he and his patrons are smarter and better at using power than all of them combined. That is something that you don't see outside the Guideverse.

******* The efficacy of Choirs fighting the Dead King is irrelevant to the question in this thread, which is: Who or what are the "Gods" the Herald is referring to?

And you seem to have forgotten that the Bard bats for both teams. There is no indication that the Above is solely responsible for the Bard, and even less of an indication that the Below created the Dead King as an equalizer:

Book 4, Chapter 30:

  “You were companion to Nasseh the Great, when he fought for the submission of the twelve cities,” Trismegistus idly said. “You were at Queen Sadassa's side as well, during the worst of the Wars of the Rat. *Fortune and misfortune both* draw you like carrion.”

The Bard pre-dates the Dead King by a long shot, and intercedes on both sides.

Maybe "double entendre" is the wrong term, as neither intended meaning is indecent, but I can't think of something better to mean "a phrase intended to have two different but equally valid meanings."

******* That takes me back.

I was in Grade 9 English, and my teacher, knowing my taste for bad jokes, invited me to help out, as we were going to be taking about wordplay.

There were twenty of us, so the teacher took half, and I took the other half. I asked each of the other students to write down a joke ending in a pun, and put it in a hat.

After everyone had finished, I told everyone the definition of a pun: as opposed to other kinds of wordplay, a pun almost always involves a single word with multiple definitions, or two words or phrases that sound similar.

I took each slip of paper out of the Harry and read it aloud, to see if any of them met that definition, and, wouldn't you know it, no pun in ten did.

** Kinda funny, kinda terrifying seeing Archer so on her toes dealing with the dwarves. If Cat manages to swing an alliance or other arrangement that lets her make use of some of their military (the deed-seekers, perhaps?), I imagine it'll give everyone except the Dead King reason to pause and reassess.

I dunno how Akua managed to do it, but I can't imagine it's a coincidence that she's found herself speaking on behalf of Cat in what's probably a make-or-break negotiation for Callow. I hope this doesn't end with Cat and Vivi breaking ties when Cat refuses to kill Akua sometime soon-ish.

Cat's humanity continues to ebb, but it's nice that she's naturally referring to herself as the Queen of Callow without qualification or compromise.

*** "Guess you had to be there" is a common phrase for when something doesn't seem funny to you, whereas it's funny for the person speaking. It suggests situational humour for which you (the person not finding it funny) don't have the necessary context, because they weren't there.

That is subverted by Cat actually 'having been there' (in this case, the dwarfs weren't actually there), and still not finding it funny.
