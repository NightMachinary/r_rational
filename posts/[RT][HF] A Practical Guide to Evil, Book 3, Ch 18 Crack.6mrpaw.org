** What if Killian becomes full Fae, but stays with Cat? IIRC, Killian's grandmother was from the Summer Court and Cat is pretty much THE Duchess of Winter. That sounds like the foundation of a forbidden love story that somehow brings an end to the war (kinda like the Omashu love story from The Last Airbender?). Though on the other hand that seems a little too obvious to me, even for a Fae story.

*** You're right. Definitely forbidden love leading to an end to the war. It's the details that will be important.

** Prediction time: (1) they break up (2) Killian goes ahead and becomes full Fae (3) Cat isn't happy but Killian does useful things during battle (4) Killian gets captured and is about to die (5) Cat saves her and (6) they live happily ever after.

Are we reading the same story? They murder a bunch of people and then get killed by heroes sometime in the future while cackling on their way down the cliff.

**** Hahahaha. Yes, I did get carried away there. Your future is a likely description and it probably is the equivalent of a happy ending for a Villain. If Cat manages to break the story, as had been suggested by commenters during book 2, then thinks may work out better.

***** I kind of get the feeling Cat is going to pull a Terriblis "May she never return." I need to figure out why I think this, but we will see if I find epi-cycles to analyse the idea: there is a lot that has been foreshadowed. . .

****** That would be funny considering how much the superstitious behaviour bothers Cat.

** Hm, can't say I didn't see this coming a mile away. The chapters feel super short now that they're two a week but I suspect that's just a misconception. I get the feeling that he writes them well in advance anyway.

*** Someone out there is probably putting all the chapters into a database and could plot the length distribution for us so we could tell for sure. But, yes, it did seem a bit short. But complete.
