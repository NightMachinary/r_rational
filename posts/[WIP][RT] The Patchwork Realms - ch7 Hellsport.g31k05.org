** Oh, good. Hellsport is not a metaphor. It's the port that hell owns. Sounds like a lovely place. Undocumented visitors can be killed for looking at people funny, and you count as undocumented if you left it in your other pants. Lovely town.

** So, if you don't have a tag you're not protected by the laws of the city. And Athos shouldn't have got a tag because he's there as a non-sapient (all in the name of saving a few bucks).

I bet this is a Chekhov's gun waiting to be fired. With Eugene using this fact to attack / blackmail Athos?

*** As Marcus's mount / pet he's protected under the property laws. Also, he can't be challenged to a duel the way Marcus can, so there's pros and cons both ways.

** Reposting the A/N from the chapter:

This chapter is significantly shorter than the others; until now I've been averaging one chapter a week but with pretty beefy chapters. Approximate wordcounts thus far:

#+begin_example
  Chapter 1 - 2783
  Chapter 2 - 6405
  Chapter 3 - 6476
  Chapter 4 - 4757
  Chapter 5 - 5790
  Chapter 6 - 5676
  Chapter 7 - 1829
#+end_example

What do you think of the length? Shorter but ~2+ chapters per week or longer but 1 chapter every week-ish? (No preference is also an option.) I'll leave three posts below this; please upvote the one you prefer.

**** Good point; I hadn't thought about it. Still, there's an equivalent poll on the chapter itself and I suspect there won't be enough votes here to be meaningful anyway.

*** The pre-chapter 7 rate and content levels, please.

This most recent update was a single, short scene and it didn't feel like there was much progress made at all.

So far I'm loving this series, and was so excited to see this update, so much so that I thought for a minute it was a late April Fool's that it ended so early.

Please give us more of our favorite Bork Bork, we can wait a little for the big chapters.

**** I'm glad you're liking it... Honestly, I wasn't sure people were. Upvotes on the chapters have steadily plummeted and there's very little audience engagement here, or on SV, or on Royal Road. It's a passion project so I don't /need/ to stop if no one is reading, but it is still bothersome. It's especially bothersome since the first chapter was so well received.

Anyway, I'll go back to longer chapters every week-ish.
