** It's well known among archaeologists that [[https://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2014/09/09/why-archeologists-hate-indiana-jones/comment-page-1/][Indiana Jones is not one of them]]. He's a [[https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/archaeology/archaeology-grave-robbing.htm][looter, grave robber or a treasure hunter for hire at best]]. I, for one, applaud Marshall College's Committee on Promotion and Tenure decision to deny his tenure.

*** One might think that a quiet word from the right shadowy governmental figures on his behalf could clear up quite a bit of this.

Beyond that, aren't there full spans of years in between adventures where Dr. Jones seems happy with the simple pleasures of the lecture hall?

  Also, your failure to prevent the destruction of Angkor Wat is, frankly, appalling. In your own words: "Here's a quick lesson on taking down a corrupt god-king: he can't see if he doesn't have a reflection. Destroy his magical mirror, smash his enchanted chess set, and you're halfway to freedom."

This... this is amazing. If I wasn't primed for expecting little inconsistencies and absurdities due to this being computer generated, I'd say this was genuine human-written fanfiction.

Now I want to train a GPT-3 on the hundreds of thousands of My Little Pony fanfics on fimfiction.net and see if it can then write an essay on friendship from the perspective of Professor Rainbow Dash.

** I always felt that at a certain point, given his exploits, Indiana Jones would be used as a celebrity professor used purely as advertisement for their history/linguistics department.

Instead of being a teacher of a course requirement, it would be a 1 credit class pass/fail class (really just lectures whenever he feels like it) where students sign up for the possibility of bring taught by The Indiana Jones.

** This is unrealistic. Dr. Jones clearly /already/ has tenure. Who would risk their professorship by going gallivanting, unless you had tenure already?

Now, given that he's violating professional standards of archaeology left and right, there could be a very plausible hearing on /stripping/ his tenure from him, but he obviously already has it.

** I got tired of reading this after a couple paragraphs. It's not rational so much as a circlejerk of one.

Most of the really self-congratulatory burns are things that should be assumed to take place off-screen. Paperwork is one example they keep harping on. You have not one shred of evidence he owns the artifact on display, besides of course the word of the person in charge of the building where they're on display? Gasp. Have you tried checking with the records office? No, I guess he should have sharpied his name on the stuff instead. Of course the worst part of this letter is the nonprofessional tone. Anyone who's set foot in an academic lab knows you don't leave evidence of behaving less than stuffy and formal, because someone who wields a black pen for a living might think to check on you otherwise and find out what really goes on back there.
