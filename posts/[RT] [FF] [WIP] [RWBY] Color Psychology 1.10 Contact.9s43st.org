** Oh dear. That's one take on Ozpin. His "reincarnation" does look more like bodyjacking from a certain angle, with a side of manipulation to convince the new host that their gradual dissolution and replacement in their own body is a good thing.

** Whelp! Looks like mystery stranger is dying in the next chapter.

Speaking up from behind an uneasy hunter-in-training with a twitchy trigger finger and inhuman reflexes in a previously empty room is not very good for your health.

*** So here's a question: how close could you be to Ruby and she'd still have time to 1) Shoot you, 2) activate her semblance, and 3) block her shot or move you out of the way in time? And is Ruby far enough away from Pyrrha that she can use her semblance?

*** It alludes to something which is not revealed until vol 4 of RWBY.

The allusion is rather cryptic if you don't know what it is, but I'm guessing we'll be learning more about it soon in upcoming chapters.
