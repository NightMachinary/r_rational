** By god, this author is a damn writing machine. I could really get used to this one chapter a day update schedule. :)

*** Heh, that's a little ambitious. Current pace is 2700 words per day or thereabouts, and average chapter is 4500 words. It's much more likely that I will slow down, rather than go any faster.

*** Maybe it's just me, but I'd prefer a more regular x days/wk update schedule tbh.

It rarely gets enough upvotes to show up on my front page, so I have to check [[/r/rational][r/rational]] for it, plus I can't put it on a schedule to help me remember like all the other serials and comics I follow :/

**** If you sign up for an AO3 account you can get email updates, I believe. The one thing I don't like about AO3 is that they have a lot of features I consider necessary that are still in development, like RSS for individual stories, but it's the most author friendly platform. If I could automate it I would put it on a schedule, but chapters are just posted when I finish them. I worry doing otherwise would make me want to go back and revise, which would slow down the pace of updates.

** Send help, I'm addicted. I went in with the lowest expectations 'cause self-insert and litRPG tags scare me, and now I can't even decide on my favorite part. Maybe the always pithy flashbacks mediating between the past and Joon's current situation. Or rational characters with a high ratio of real talk. Or the meta-mindfuckery of Joon's situation. I don't know. Just more please.

To celebrate, I'm going on a recommendation spree. Also I noticed that the summary might be a bottleneck to new readers who aren't sure what they're getting into - especially if they're wary of SI/litRPG stories like me. I whipped up a short summary for a submission to [[http://webfictionguide.com/][Web Fiction Guide]] so everyone can start voting. More votes, more readers!

#+begin_quote
  A self-insert litRPG portal fantasy.

  A young man (the SI) suddenly finds himself falling off a plane into a new fantasy world. Being an old hand at D&D, some things seem disconcertingly familiar... but there's no time to ponder the similarities to the campaigns he used to run because there's a character sheet attached to his soul and this "game" is getting lethal real fast.

Any suggestions for improvements? Or maybe someone can come up with a better summary!

  What I really wanted was a level up, to feel that golden taste, to be refreshed in body and spirit. They didn't remove every affliction, and I was skeptical that they would take care of something as drastic as using my own bones for fuel, but just to feel it again, if only for a moment ... wasn't this a major quest? Didn't I deserve it?

Well, I'm not too humble to say "I called it", so: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6uqc8x/rtwip_worth_the_candle_chapter_21/dluq8vo/][I called it]]. What a nice deconstruction/rationalization of powergaming.

  Sitting inside were eight small gems, six of them in the colors of the rainbow, arranged in a circle on the wooden bottom of the box, and a clear diamond next to a black jewel in the center.

Now I am wondering if it is unintended reference to ponies, intended reference to ponies, or MC friend managed to smuggle ponies into Aerb.

*** Unintended, I'd like to know the reference though. It's just the color wheel plus white and black in the middle. Miraculous Ladybug uses something similar, minus a color.

** What I don't like is that it's becoming increasingly clear that game engine have some (possibly rudimentary) personality, instead of being ruled by some comprehensible logic/laws. So the story line is effectively going into direction of some deranged and/or immature overmind playing with protagonist in the "I have no mouth ..." stile. Such settings are good for short story bit less so for long novel, because it force non-natural character development, where protagonist shouldn't become smarter or mature but instead conform more and more to this overmind personality.

PS From the other hand "1984", that could be valid plot.

Not... really? I mean, Juniper has certain posed some /speculations to that effect/, but how accurate those speculations are is entirely still in the air.
