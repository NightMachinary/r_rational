I've just finished reading Radiance, which I started right after Luminosity, and, leaving aside my HUGE critique to the lack of rationality of the fiction after Bella was transformed (but that's way too long and I need to gather my thoughts before making a full write up of that), there is one specific thing that bothered me greatly through the whole story:

Why did NOBODY bring up the superiority of the species argument? Specifically, Bella, is obsessed in protecting humans, yet despite multiple references to Vampires as species, NOBODY, not even those who consider humans as only food ever brought to her the extremely simple arguments that Vampires are an evolution (=upgrade) of humans, and since they are as superior to humans as humans are to apes, and since they are the predator that predates on humans, there is no point in worrying about killing humans, aside from the fact that humans could be dangerous to vampires if fully in the known.

The "you can't transform humans who are mates to you" was really disappointing as well, since it gave more priority to the inferior species rather than the species she's part of, in a matter that's absolutely critical to a vampire's well-being.

Did I miss something, or Luminance/Radiance really has no place being compared to HPMOR or other rational stories?

** In what morality is it OK to kill something solely because you are superior to it? You mention apes specifically and there is already a large debate about whether apes should be given the rights and protections of personhood (same thing with dolphins). Even with less intelligent animals, there are people who believe killing them is morally wrong (vegetarians).

While I personally think it's ok to kill some of the less sapient animals as long as it's done humanely, any species that has sapience, regardless of how much, should not be killed unless the relative gains are enormous. Since vampires don't need to eat humans, and humans have sapience (regardless if whether or not vampires are "superior") it is obvious that the correct moral choice is to not eat them.

**** While Bella is a rational agent, I think its a stretch to say all or even any of her enemies fell into the same boat. I haven't read Luminosity in a while so bear with me, but it would seem to me that the Vulturi thought along the lines of...say...far right republicans. "We eat humans because that's what we do." The argument for eating humans seems to stem largely from instinct on the part of vampires, or tradition on their part. They eat humans because that's the way things have always been, and it seems to work well enough for them, that why try to break what clearly works? Its like the whole "marriage is between a man and a woman because that's the way it is." They make no attempt to critically or rationally address their point of view because they don't feel the need to. Animal blood was so 'obviously' inferior to them that there's no real reason for them to consider it.

Its definitely a bit of arguing by definitions instead of by sense "Vampires eat humans because that's what vampires do." Their definition of vampire includes eating humans, they don't need to argue why they eat humans, they just do. Its "Just the way things are". This is of course some fallacious logic on their part, but why bother being logical when you can just kill whoever disagrees with you? Not to invoke godwin or anything, but I doubt Hitler had a deep and logically reasoned out explanation for killing all jews that would actually give pause to a serious rationalist. Bella is able to outwit her opponents specifically because she employs rationality while the other side relies on brute force and intimidation.

What definition of "superior" are you using? Vampires are stronger, faster, and tougher, but they don't seem to think better. To the extent that we are superior to apes it's due to superior intelligence, not improved physical abilities.

On a separate subject -- it's been a long time since I read those stories, but the way I remember it is that vampires can't reproduce physically, they can only (a) convert a human or (b) have a kid with a human, and the latter is a very high-risk option that will almost certainly kill the mother and will get some of the most powerful vampires angry at you. Am I remembering that right?

[1] A few vampire also have special psychic powers, but that's supposedly a very small percentage.

While it is true that within the scope of the story they do not appear to think better, they do demonstrate superior cognitive capabilities, especially mnemonic capabilities and communication (the perfect example being them often sustaining multiple conversations at once at speeds far exceeding what humans could keep up with). From what Bella has analyzed right after being turned into a vampire (while she was still thinking rationally) it seems that for most vampires the issue is that while their mental capability increased by orders of magnitude, emotions increase by that same amount, and instincts (especially those surrounding the continuous thirst) grow as well, putting compulsions at a higher priority than rational analysis, to the extreme that a vampire in presence of an extremely tasty human (singer) stops thinking completely.

Agree on the reproduction issue, the lack of which might indeed undermine the status of "species" for vampires, though for immortal creatures reproduction itself doesn't hold that much evolutionary value I think.

**** I'm trying to think what an actual war between humans and vampires would look like. (I'm leaving the magic aside for a second and just look at the rest of it.)

Vampires are physically superior in a hand-to-hand fight and are very durable but can still be blown to pieces with blunt force trauma, so bullets and grenades and bombs oh my should work just fine on them. Flamethrowers will do them up a treat.

Vampires are easily spotted during the day and can't teleport or turn to mist, so it's possible to fort up at night.

Vampires can convert humans, but it's a long-ish process, and the newborns are useless as covert agents, only as battle chaff. Converting humans is a case of removing a human asset and turning it into a poorly aimed weapon -- some strategic advantage, but not much.

There are...a few thousand? maybe a few million?...vampires in the world, and seven billion humans.

I don't think that would be a fun fight for anyone. I'm honestly not sure who would win, but civilian populations would take a massive pounding and if the humans won it would be through genocide.

Oh, I can assure you, I have tons of qualms with those as well, especially the "Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason. " rule.

The sheer amount of scenes that happened because the plot required it (2nd time Bella was burned, Caius deciding all of a sudden to get rid of Abby, Cody's defection, etc) and Bella holding the idiot ball through situations that any rational character would have resolved or at least attempted to before they exploded (powers development [this is a HUGE one, both on Bella, who had two points at which she realized her powers could do a lot more, yet never actually worked on them except for Jasper's emotional power, and for Elspeth, who in the car just decided to STOP growing her power, completely], Irina's situation, James' hunting and many others I don't remember anymore) is ridiculous.

1. Bella tried to forcibly convert the world to vegetarianism.
2. No one verbally challenged her on this.
3. Therefore, L/R are not rational.

If that's your position...well, I'm not sure it's one that really needs a lot of debate. There seem to be perfectly reasonable responses:

- Doylist: Alicorn didn't think of one particular thing. Meh, it's not that big a deal; these characters aren't really noted for their verbal debate skills anyway. Give a pass on this one and call it a plot hole at worst.
- Watsonian: humanivore vampires lack social organization more sophisticated than "pack". It makes perfect sense that their first and only response was violence.

I guess, really my response comes to this: you said that you'd never seen this argument discussed elsewhere. You've laid it out here and I don't think anyone in the thread has found it convincing. It's possible that you're the only sane man here, but thd odds don't seem to favor it.

Even if, for the sake of argument, we grant your point, that would mean that the story was flawed, not that it suddenly became completely non-rational. I don't think you'll have any trouble at all getting people to agree with the proposition "L/R were not completely rational."

Shoot, when you look at it, HPMOR, the founding cornerstone of the genre, has some imperfections. $antagonist's (whichever name you choose) plot was ridiculously overcomplex and had at least one major plot hole that I can think of offhand, yet it's still the cornerstone of the genre and a really good story to boot.

Superiority on what terms? If you merely mean that vampires can kill humans easily, that's not an argument worth considering. It would work just as well for ebola! A century ago, it would apply to measles, and nobody's sad that we eradicated measles!

The interpretation I could agree with is that people have reasonable cause to prefer to be vampires rather than humans -- you get a better memory, you maybe become smarter (at least, you can read and type much faster, which is smarter on one axis), you don't age, you're more durable, you're stronger, and your senses are better. Plus the whole mate thing is convenient, in a way. The thirst is a nontrivial downside, naturally, and since it's slaked primarily by killing sentient beings, you might hesitate or choose not to turn.

#+begin_quote

The general thrust of your argument seems to be: people would often prefer to live as vampires than to live as humans, therefore we should let vampires kill as many humans as they want. That's a complete non sequitur. You may as well say that the uber wealthy should be able to hunt humans for sport because most humans would rather be wealthy than poor. This is the exact opposite of rationality. The two concepts are entirely unrelated.

If instead your argument were that /you/ personally didn't care about humans and you did care about vampire freedom and autonomy, therefore you are fine with vampires eating people...that is rational, but it's not compelling to any moral person.

Luminosity. Get the title right.

You missed any shred of human decency. The Golden Empire was founded on human decency (well, and killing a lot of Volturi, and being able to trap vampires in essentially a prison world).

Before that, nobody has encountered a non-human diet outside the Denali and Cullen covens. Those two covens are non-judgmental and do not proselytize. We don't see extended interaction between non-humanivore and humanivore vampires for the most part, and when we do, it's focused on defeating the Volturi. There are literally only a dozen vampires in the world who care about humans and think they're people. The thought of eating animals rather than humans is too bizarre and not well publicized enough for people to come up with objections. It's all "you can try your outlandish diet, I expect you to die from it, and I'm just going to steer clear in case it turns you into a ravening beast."

Normal people don't just hear a bizarre idea and immediately treat it seriously and try to come up with objections. And in this case, it only takes a few seconds to get to a basic value mismatch, which lets you dismiss the other person's attempts to persuade you (if they're even trying) without further debate.

However, since the books end with an authority mandating strict non-humanivore behavior with the ability to enforce that mandate, if the books continued a bit longer, we would see people petitioning the Golden Throne with bullshit arguments like the one you put forward.

I looked at your comment history. Are you sure your real objection isn't that the books were written by a woman? Considering you post in [[/r/theredpill]], plus the stuff you wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/3cz8nb/comiccon_women_tired_of_groping_geeks_and/ct0ncpv][here]], plus [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3bzlup/google_trends_reddit_alternative/csrvqvj][apparently you think even 4chan is too feminist for you]] -- that doesn't mean for certain that you'd be dismissive of a work simply because a woman wrote it, but it's pretty damning.

No, my argument is (or would be, if I had to bring it to Bella in story): Vampires are not humans, they are another species superior to humans, and their main susteinance source is human blood. They can sustain themselves on animal blood, but at the cost of strength and eating satisfaction, and with the benefit of a clearer mind.

Humans eat other animals (included dolphins, which are the 2nd smartest species on earth), and can sustain themselves on vegetables, at the cost of some long term issues (B12 deficiency is the first that comes to mind) and with the benefit of a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Thus, since humans eat both animals inferior to them and plants, why shouldn't Vampires eat both humans and animals?

Yes, there is the issue of sentience, to which I currently do not have an answer, although from what I could gather I doubt many humans would stop eating pigs even if those started to speak a little english overnight. Hell, we often attribute sentience to dogs and cats, yet asian cultures still eat them without issues.

That requires people to have time to think about the issue when it feels threatening to their way of life personally. Maggie is sympathetic to arguments that affect her on a direct emotional and practical level, and they aren't impacted by any sort of divine or natural right to eat humans. Siobhan was never banned from drinking human blood -- in the first book, it wasn't even under consideration, and in the second, she had an exemption as long as she didn't murder anyone.

  I'm starting to wonder whether Bella's shield not only protected against powers and fire, but also against entering the Vampire mindset upon turning, which left her self-identifying as a human while in the body of a vampire.
#+end_quote

Doubtful. Maggie seemed to acquire it when she started eating animals. The Cullens seem to have basic human decency, though they feel they can't impose their will on others. The Denalis likewise, though not to such a great degree.

  We did, there was that critique on the "don't forcefully turn mates" rule.

We saw one argument of moderate length. It appeared even when the ending was already slightly bogged down. How much more bogged down do you want the story to be?

You can always ask the author directly why she didn't include more discussions and objections to the no-eating-people rule. She's on twitter.

Yes, I believe every rationalist needs to read and internalize the research TRP has done into human mating strategies, no I don't believe in pushing said data on them.

So, if you want to discuss that, we can take it outside. This thread is not the right place for that discussion.

With human minds being as limited compared to vampires as apes' are compared to humans, how can you provide enough information that the consent would really be fully informed?

The increased strength, speed, intelligence, emotions, senses and communication, they cannot really be expressed in words, and even Elspeth's power would quite simply not be able to represent a Vampire's state of being to a human, who lacks the tools to understand it.

And, indeed, out of the 5 vampires who were brought back as humans, 4 wanted to be turned again, and the only one who didn't was because last time he was killed soon after turning while Aro was searching for Witches, so he didn't actually have the chance to fully experience his capabilities as a Vampire and all he remembered was basically 3 days of extreme pain and then being murdered.

Very interesting point, and indeed it might be true that the venom that transforms humans in vampires is a parasite whose purpose is to fuse with another species, elevate it and then hunt the species itself for it's own survival. Though we don't really have in-universe information on that (or any real information on what vampires or magic is, for that matter. Despite millennia of vampire society, and intelligence way above humans, there doesn't appear to have been any R&D in the origin or characteristics of the species), so it's all speculation.

Indeed, I might have misused the term "evolution", but the point remains that vampires are way above humans as far as capabilities go, AND they are human's natural predators, sitting on top of the food chain, so I'm not sure considering them as part of the human species makes much sense.

Indeed, they don't appear to think at a higher level, at least judging by how it was written, just think faster and interact with each other faster. This is probably because the author wasn't able or couldn't be bothered to model the interactions of an entire species of smarter beings, so she just went the just as smart but faster route.

Correct, but their compulsion is to drink human blood, and so is their instinct. It's true that later is found out that the thirst can be quenched by animals, but they are repulsed by it.

On top of that, if they drink animal blood they become weaker (although apparently with a clearer mind).

Not only, as long as they drink human blood they are not able to have big covens because it leads to fights continuously which means that pooling resources for research is not that easy (without Chelsea).

So, they are parasitic because they have no need to grow further, but they definitely have the potential to not be if they had to (=all of a sudden their food source disappeared).

Paintings, music, poetry, math -- do humanivore vampires actually create anything at all? I don't remember any of them doing so, but it might just be my memory.

If vampires create no art and no science, I don't feel that it's reasonable to call them a superior species. First off, they aren't really a species, since they can't reproduce on their own. Second, humanity's value (to the extent that we have any) is not in our combat capability, it's in our ability to create, to bring things into the universe that never existed before. If vampires don't do that, they are simply very efficient parasites. Not even terribly smart parasites, honestly, since most of them haven't figured out the concept of farming. There's a reason that most bacteria don't kill their host.
