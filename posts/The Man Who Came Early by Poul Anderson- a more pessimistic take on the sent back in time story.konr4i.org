** Realistic. Most past humans were farmers or hunters. Most modern knowledge isn't useful for either.

The common knowledge we do have that is useful to them, like crop rotation or boiling bandages, isn't easy to prove worthwhile in a hurry.

"Trust me, three years from now your crops will be better!" Not much of a sales pitch, is it?

If you get sent back in time, you want to get to a city or a royal court, where things like math, astronomy and world maps will have value. (Medieval Iceland, of course, had neither cities nor royalty.)

*** There's a Lord of the Rings fanfiction that has a modern girl be transported to Middle Earth, right in the middle of the story. She spends all the time confined in Rivendell, struggling to learn to speak the language and with issues such as "how the fuck do I keep clean during my cycle without pads or tampons?!?".

***** He's set up as a mary sue engineer who knows everything about manufacture, convinces them he's a magician with a fortuitous eclipse timing and winning a jousting contest with a gun, creates an entire economic and industrial revolution, reforms the political system and slavery.

the pessimistic bits are more the ignorance of people in reacting to it: he has some frustrating conversations about economics and inflation with local artisans, the knights ultimately rise up against him, and finally the ending where a magical deus-ex swings the result of a winning battle against all the chivalry.

*** I don't think it's that terrible, but lots of the knowledge wouldn't be very useful. Some metallurgy though might be applied right away; the engineer could become an ironmaker or a smith (well, if he's a man. As a woman... tough luck, probably), after suitable apprenticeship.

**** Steam engines aren't useful without cheap coal.

The first steam engine shows up around 100 BC - the aeolipile of Heron of Alexandria in Roman Egypt. It's a toy, basically. Nobody can afford to throw enough fuel into those things to do work.

What changes around 1700? The British are mining coal, lots of it, and their mines are flooding with water. So you can burn coal in the mines, to heat the water in the mines, to drive a steam engine to clear water from the mines.

TBF, if you could bring back a modern machine shop, you could build a steam engine that was efficient even without a whole coal mine's worth of coal to work with. You'd still need coal, not wood, to make it worthwhile; but there are places with surface coal deposits.

****** Chopping wood is expensive (in labor). You'd lose far more manpower in harvesting the lumber than you could make up with any plausible application of the steam engine.

There's nothing wrong with charcoal, but any situation where you have to chop down trees for fuel is one where you're better off with muscle power than steam.

*Cross-Time Engineer by Leo Frankowski*

A high-testosterone, old school isekai of a 1990s engineer being time-stranded in 1200s Europe, and realising that in 12 years the Mongols will come and slaughter his new friends.

He then goes on a berserk industrial-upgrade rampage to prepare Medieval Poland and Hungary to fend off the Mongols.

*** It goes both ways really. Our pathogens are dangerous to them and theirs are dangerous to us.

We are vaccinated against a few things, but the strains of those same diseases from a few hundred years ago would most likely be too different for the vaccine to work. People get the flu every year because it changes fast enough that last years antibodies stop working.

This is something that is never addressed in fiction most likely because it wouldn't be much of a story when everyone dies in a few days.
