** Say, it is worth reading now? I've read first book and was impressed by the first half and very dissatisfied with the second. Too much badly explained plots from too many people with the unclear motivation. Also characterisation at the start of the second book was just abhorrent, it's like no one lived through events of the first book. Did it get any better?

*** I'm a big fan, but then again that aspect with the unclear motivation is appealing to me. I quite like muddling through all the complicated and deceptive manipulators all trying to move the main character around like a chess piece.

A lot of their motivations are revealed in the second book, though.

*** I'd say so. If you feel Moody lost some edge, then he has regained it by now.

**** Moody always seems to be a bit hit AND miss. I feel like I always love some parts of what I read and hate others and never consistently the same parts
