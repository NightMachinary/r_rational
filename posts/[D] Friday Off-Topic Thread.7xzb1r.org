Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** One of the best YouTube channels I know is [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTev4RNBiu6lqtx8z1e87fQ][A Capella Science]], which makes both excellent music and excellent science. I recommend jumping in at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqReeTV_vk][Evo-Devo]], but there are more than a few good choices. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8FAJXPBdOg][The Molecular Shape of You]] is another favourite.

*** Those are two of my favorite, along with the [[https://youtu.be/gai8dMA19Sw][exoplanets songs]]. It's worth mentioning that all the videos have really excellent animation in addition to their lyrical and musical aesthetics. Bohemian Gravity, the first popular song he did, has some extremely impressive video editing. Entropic Time is rather amazing as well, since he did the whole lip syncing backwards, and it still looks good.

** So I finally got around to reading [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/taking-root-1-1/][Twig]], by Wildbow, and I have to say, I'm enjoying it a lot. Without spoiling anything, I would characterize it as both:

A) The most implicitly rationalist work he has done, with a main character whose entire "superpower" is basically in thinking things out from many angles and understanding/predicting/manipulating people, and

B) The least "grimdark." The world itself is often nightmarish, like Worm and Pact, but the feeling of an unending grind of negative events, of constantly hopping from one bad situation to a worse one, is absent, thanks to 1) more variance in the intensity of subsequent arcs and 2) a stronger sense of the MC having control over what's happening that's even better than Taylor's talismanic determination was at keeping me from noticing said "grimdarkness" while reading.

I'm still only about halfway through the story (it's massively long, as usual) so maybe that eventually changes, but as of now I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Worm or Pact but were turned off by said grimdarkness in them.

*** I remember hearing him talk that going into Twig, he wanted to improve his ability to humanize characters in peaceful moments with lightheartedness instead of in the midst of the stress, conflict, and pressure he's so accustomed to (and good at).

I've read the whole thing, and I think he succeeded greatly there. Sylvester's life isn't always nice, far from it, but you can /feel/ just how much he values those moments, how important they are to him.

It's not the magnum opus Worm was, but I can attest that Twig was better at getting me to feel emotional and connect with the /characters/ just as much as I resonated with the conflict at hand.

As for its grimdarkness, I can only assume you're referring to the world itself rather than the events? In which case yeah, it's definitely the world I'd want to live in the least of the 3, but the characters and plot are really much more up beat.

***** Worm didn't feel GrimDark at all to me until Leviathan and really the S9, after which it was pretty steadily grim.

But that was after I was already invested.

Pact felt grim from the beginning, before I was ever invested in the characters. Twig, likewise, though not as extreme as Pact.

In general I think Wildbow erred slightly on the side of GrimDark entering too quickly with his recent work. Or maybe I just happen to have a lower interest in Grimdark than most.

** Has anyone else used phenibut?

The second time I used it, I took too much (on purpose, /for science/) and it caused a weird sort of intoxication that felt somewhat like drunkenness, but I took it appropriately the first time I used it and just felt a mood boost and /focus/ and /motivation/, like, I spent two straight hours cutting up an old vocal sample that was recorded without a metronome (Stay Awake from Mary Poppins) into 28 little slices (ie every syllable in the verse) and stretching them all and reconstructing the verse to force it into maintaining a consistent tempo. I've done that sort of thing before (I'm pretty sure metronomes weren't invented until the mid '90s (/that's sarcasm/)), but it's very boring and I'd typically work on that part of the project a little bit at a time over a period of days.

It seems useful. You can only use it once every few days because tolerance builds up quickly (like, if you take the same amount three days in a row you might feel literally nothing at all the third day, so you're only supposed to take a recreational dose once a week or a therapeutic dose two or three times a week), so I'm not going to be able to take it again until Monday or Tuesday, but I'm pretty satisfied with how it affects working on music so I'm going to try working on writing the next time I take it.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6ybqCgZBs][Fixed.]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwSvkR_Co3o][What I'm doing with it]], if you're interested. I'm mostly just playing around with sounds at this point.

There's some problems with the "fixed" version.

It wasn't fitting in time properly so I tried cutting off part of the "sss" at the beginning of the first word to fix it, and the fix ended up being that that slice needed to be moved a single step backwards to just before the beginning.

Also, the last three words have a very wobbly quality to them because they were much longer than the rest of the notes but I smooshed them into being the same length as their counterparts in other lines, I'll need to re-stretch them and time them differently so the last word starts at the beginning of the next measure.

There are other little problems with it, and I'm not happy with the overall tonal quality, but it should serve to illustrate the difference. Every beat in the measure is typically the same length, and the length of the beats in the original was all over the place. I said "28 slices" the other day because that's how many slices are in the final product, but it was actually over 40 because I thought I could cut up whole words and I ended up having to re-slice every full word into its constituent syllables because it was just /that/ loose.

** Just minutes ago, one of my friends on Facebook posted [[https://youtu.be/K7Kf5NeAJ-k][a short video about Ni No Kuni 2]] by the YouTube channel [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZrxXp1reP8E353rZsB3jaA][Easy Allies]], which I had never heard of, and I want to talk about how much discovering it means to me. Btw, it's a good video and I think the game looks promising even as someone who didn't like the first Ni No Kuni.

GameTrailers.com was my introduction to gamer culture and game analysis, I followed their reviews religiously during my teens and I was heartbroken when they shut down. Now it turns out that the voice of their reviews, Brandon Jones, has been here all this time and is still doing what got me into gaming in the first place. Hearing him again is like reconnecting with an old friend.

Not only do I get to hear him review games again, with a backlog of hundreds, there is a whole community to dive into that includes podcasts about anime and tabletop gaming...so was this handcrafted specifically for me or something? It feels like I was just handed a homemade gift by someone who knows me better than I know myself. I'm still in shock.

well maybe RL is last place, but still. close.

But I can relate pretty well to that sentiment. And oh boy what a backlog you have now. i just feel like writing this stuff dont feel particularly inclined to read it

- The podcast is probably the most reliable content they produce, but it's meant to be topical (about news) so idk how much you get out of it.
- Easy Update is probably the most swingy, with some episodes being a bit dull imo (gameplays and walk&talks) with others being some of the best content they've put out imo (animal crossing, OY, the interview)
- Any of Don's videos is gold (don's discount gaming and don the beat), but there aren't many
- Hall of Greats has become a central element of the EZA mythos
- Reviews are reviews
- Brandon Plays Pokemon is a really great and unique /experience/
- Betting specials are as good as ever
- Huber +hype+syndrome was never my cup of tea, but its still enjoyable
- tabletop escapades was really good for a while in s1 but i think it dragged on a bit (just my opinion). s2 is brilliant so far.

** Okay I've decided - after being inspired by a [[https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/project-management/how-to-overcome-perfectionism][podcast of all things]] - to start posting my still-in-editing-stages supernatural romance story to this sub. I'll be posting it under an author pseudonym account, because I'd like to keep my "writings" seperate from my regular Reddit activity to avoid a Ken Bone situation.

It'll be released one chapter a month with an interlude after each chapter (so every month, a chapter; in the middle of the month, a one-page interlude). This is slow but I want to make it achievable, and if I end up finishing my editing earlier than expected I'll be able to speed up the schedule, and I'd rather do that than wait another ~year before I post anything at all. By starting to post before I've finished editing there's always a risk I'll "fade" but you know... authors have done that before and if I abandon the project altogether I can post my "passable draft" level chapters to give people some closure.

*QUESTION*: So.... where's a good website to post original fiction? Ideally I'd love a platform where you can pick up an audience passively like you can on fanfiction.net or whatever since you know, everyone loves attention. I've got an AO3 account which you can apparently post original stuff on, but I'm not sure it's the best place. Or I can pick up a free blog, or even tumblr(??? do people post serial fiction on tumblr?). Would have to be somewhere that let me retain the copyright though.

It's a romance novel with vampires, set in the 1940s, trying to write it rational (worldbuilding is very thorough, no "LET ME EXPLAIN!" moments), very little in the way of adult content - there's sex but it's the "he held his love and they kissed *** the next morning, they snuggled in bed together" sort of discretion, rather than being pornographic. I have a few pictures (one at the beginning of each chapter), but they're not required, but it'd be good to be able to insert them.

*** AO3 is great, with the exception that you can't instantly create an account, which I think limits readership to some extent. FictionPress (and the sister site, FanFiction.net) have terrible UI, weird quirks, and are generally unpleasant to use. The workflow is, simply put, bad, and the options for formatting are extremely limited.

Posting to a blog hides your work away somewhat, and probably won't have features that a lot of web fiction readers have come to know and love, meaning more work on your end to get it up and running. It can work, if you want to put in that effort, but you still don't get to tap into the larger audiences that you'd get with a big site.

Royal Road is one of the other big sites, but I don't use it, either as a reader or a writer. It's fairly big, and other people seem to like it, so ... included here for the sake of completeness (though I'm leaving a lot of the other platforms off).

Other than that, there are a few big forums like Sufficient Velocity, Space Battles, Questionable Questing, etc. where people gather to read and talk about fiction. I generally stay away from them, because I spent a decade growing to hate almost everything about how phpbb tends to work in large communities. Might be for you; cultures vary between them.

***** Hrm. That's really tough to say. My best guess is that AO3 has about half the audience that FictionPress does, based mostly on comparing "most Favorites" and "most Kudos (Original Work)", which are roughly equivalent and won't double-count users.

The more important thing is where you "advertise"; [[/r/rational]] has 8.5K subscribers, which translates to maybe 2K visitors a day, and that would probably be your primary audience intake (if you posted here), dwarfing the flow of readers that come from within either FP or AO3, especially given the biases against new works (people don't want to risk reading something crappy, so mostly gravitate toward established works).

(Just for calibration: you wouldn't actually get 2K readers from [[/r/rational]]; a *best case* scenario for a "new" work would be 1.5K people check it out, most of them don't read it, you get 20-30 upvotes, and less than 20 comments unless you say something really inflammatory or make mistakes.

******* Yeah, back cover blurb, two or three sentences, don't spoil anything too major. The first chapter you post is the most important to have that for, since that's where people have almost zero information. You can use the same synopsis every time, since it's mostly there for the undecideds that are coming to the comments for a more objective take on what the work is about and whether or not it's worth reading. You don't really need to worry /that/ much about hooking the people who have already read the first chapter.

Ideally, you get a snowball effect, and people will start reading because /other people/ are reading, there's some activity in the comments, or people have seen it posted enough times that you can finally catch them when they're bored, or they've just been exposed to the title so much that it's sticking in their brain.

*** As alexanderwales mentioned, royalroadl is quite popular, and from what I've seen has a decent publishing featureset. That being said, its readership is a very specific demographic (LN/WN fans) that might not go all-in on the paranormal-romance aspect, so YMMV.

Wattpad, on the flipside, has a readership likely to be much more receptive to your work, as they're generally fans of romance. That being said, wattpad's readership has very, /very/ low standards for quality, so it may be sort of demoralizing seeing your work lose out against "cheesy self insert wish fulfilment fantasy written for tweens #2423."

AO3 has exactly the demographic and featureset you want, although I don't think the "original work" section is frequented as much. Make sure, if you post there, to abuse their tagging so people using the search function have the highest chance of stumbling on your story.

Alternatively, you crosspost to a forum in the Sufficient Velocity/Spacebattles/Alternate History Forums/ Questionable Questing network, but keep in mind that, aside from the last one, their mods are infamously prudish, so you'd either have to self-censor to host directly on their forums, or have a thread where you post links to new chapters (as I've seen Omnicron do for their work [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/should-the-sun-not-rise-urban-fantasy-updates-sundays.41717/][Should the Sun not Rise]] and simply don't post links to chapters that would get mod attention drawn onto you. The target demographic of your work will be few and far between on those forums, but it's a relatively low-effort way to promote and get discussion for your work.

And of course, since it's your IP, you're not required to stick to one posting location. I crossposted my fanfic across AO3, fanfiction.net, and SB, with my readership split about evenly across ff.net and AO3 (favoring ff.net of course), and a readership a fifth of the size of my AO3 reading on SB.

Nah, they won't care as long as you stick to the site rules. That being said, you significantly increase the exposure of your story by having it in your sig and frequenting threads you enjoy, so people can see, "hey, what this person says is interesting, maybe I should check out their stories."

From what I've seen, LNs (and by extension, WNs) are primarily targeted towards boys. And certainly, the ones that are are the ones that get the most traction here in the west. If you go to kissmanga.com and just idly look at the covers of the "recently updated" manga, chances are, anything with "isekai" or "xianxia" in its name is a.) a light novel (or WN) adaptation and b.) clearly marketed towards young men via the character art.

From what I've seen, the female-marketed stuff tends to be korean and japanese webcomics such as can be found on [[http://www.webtoons.com/en/][webtoons]] and [[https://tapas.io/comics][tapas]].

No clue where the division came from, but I'd wager it's at least partially from the fact that there are a /lot/ of LGBT friendly and female-targeted western webcomics already (as the print comic market is/was dominated by stuff marketed towards straight males), so the stuff that gains traction here is the stuff that appealed to the preexisting webcomic readership.

LNs and WNs are often adapted into manga and anime. The point I'm making is that, if the market the adaptations cater to is representative of the market the source material caters to, then any site with lots of LN/WN readers is unlikely to be in the same demographic your story will appeal to.

On the flipside, if you can figure out where the readers of korean/japanese webcomics (and to a lesser extent, western webcomics) frequent, then they're prime targets for your story.

** I recently had the pleasure of re-reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24337][/Ella Enchanted/]], which is a very fun book. I have to say, however, that I definitely have come to view it in a new light in the decade or so since I first read it. Consider this absolutely /salacious/ passage from the very first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  My first awareness of [the curse of obedience to direct orders that the fairy Lucinda laid on me at my birth] came on my fifth birthday.[...]

  Mandy cut the cake. When she handed me my piece, she said without thinking, "Eat."

  The first bite was delicious. I finished the slice happily. When it was gone, Mandy cut another. That one was harder. When it was gone, no one gave me more, but I knew I had to keep eating. I moved my fork into the cake itself.[...]

  I felt sick, and frightened. Why couldn't I stop eating?

  Swallowing was a struggle. Each bite weighed on my tongue and felt like a sticky mass of glue as I fought to get it down. I started crying while I ate.
#+end_quote

Compare any of a zillion pieces of erotic literature that cater to the "feeding" or "stuffing" fetish* (/e.g./, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/253540][/Feedbag/]], [[http://fav.me/d9sk1u3][/Mari's Most Amazing Stuffing/]], [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/37363][/Cupcakes Redux/]], [[https://komperaklause.deviantart.com/art/Gretel-Part-1-564500523][/Gretel/]]...). If you ignore the first quoted sentence**, it's practically identical! Later chapters of the story indulge in similar [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Fetish_Fuel][fetish fuel]], in similarly-lurid detail: at various points in the story, Ella (/inter alia/) imagines being ordered to cook herself alive, is ordered by one of her future "ugly stepsisters" to starve herself, and is ordered by the fairy who cursed her to be happy about the curse.

*(at least, the ones that aren't just thinly-veiled inflation-fetish material)

**(or if you're a fan of loli hentai)

This is insufficient for any data that you really care about. RAID can make backing up to a second hard drive automatic (basically), and a disconnected portable drive makes accidental deletions rather difficult, but if you don't have an off-site backup then you are still vulnerable to fire, theft, flood, or other calamity that affects your physical location. Cloud backup services are rather popular, and if that doesn't work for you for whatever reason then you can also store a hard drive in some off-site secure location.

I'm toying with the idea of storing a hard drive in a local bank's safe deposit box, but that's still in the planning stages for me. If anyone has feedback on that, I'd love to hear it.

*** Speaking as an author who has written and published something on the order of 2,000,000 words of entertainment (most of it free) for you, this subreddit, and/or the internet at large: I find your post intensely offensive. Saying that authors "cannot be trusted" to leave work online implies that you have a /right/ to that work. You do not. We do not have an obligation to create it for you, nor to ensure that it continues being available.

I suppose I should check: Do you understand that you do not have the right to compel me, or any other author, to write free fiction for your entertainment? Given that fact, why do you feel you have the right to compel me to make fiction available online?

As if the above weren't bad enough, your insinuation that an author is 'cowardly' for taking something down borders on the delusional. It's possible that you have some specific knowledge of this particular author, but that is not implied in your post; far more likely is that you're making assumptions. You have no idea what might be happening in the life of an author that would inspire them to take a work down. Perhaps their pseudonym has been doxxed, they are applying for a job, and they don't want something embarrassing being attached to their name. Perhaps the work was something from early in their career and they don't want its poor quality to turn people off from their later works. Perhaps the story featured a clear expy of a prior sweetheart and the author's new sweetheart would prefer it not be out there. Perhaps they got a warning from the site mods for violating site policies and they don't want their account banned. Perhaps they got a take-down notice on their fanfic and don't want to be sued.

I strongly suggest you re-evaluate your feelings on this issue or, at the very least, the way you express them.

IIRC (I searched for any explanation made by the author when I noticed that the story had been deleted---though I may be misremembering what I found, since this occurred a year or three ago), the author in question (Tozette) specifically said (IIRC, on one of her multiple Tumblr accounts---though, again, I may be misremembering) that she'd deleted the story (which ends on a cliffhanger) because people were constantly demanding a continuation. Deleting /an entire story/ because of /whiny messages/ seems pretty indisputably cowardly.

The level of entitlement in your post is beyond belief.

You failed to comprehend my point: *You do not have a right to this story.* This story is not yours in any way. You have no legal rights to it, you have no moral rights to it...you have no rights to it, period. You have no stake in it and no say in what happens to it. It is not the author's obligation to create it, or to post it, or to maintain it online. If you want permanent access to it then you can download it, but you do not have the right to infringe on the author's liberty because you're too lazy to click the 'download' button.

As to the case of Tozette: no, that is not even close to cowardly. Imagine the following equivalent scenario: you walk up to Tozette on the street and say to her "Hey, I've just created this email account for you. It's going to be flooded by whining, demanding, unpleasant people every day. I insist that you sit and read this account and if you decide you'd rather not then you're a coward." That's what you're claiming here: That Tozette is a coward because she doesn't want to put up with insulting messages from the internet. And, before you claim that the messages weren't insulting: think again. Having actually published things that people wanted a continuation to, I can say with certainty that the average internet denizen does not, shall we say, make requests in a constructive fashion.

Honestly, your assertion leaves me slack-jawed. Imagine the equivalent in a sports setting: "If you +post a story online+ bring a basketball to the court so that +people can read it+ we can have a pickup game, then you have to leave the +story+ basketball on the +internet+ court permanently."

El oh el! Since when are basketballs infinitely reproducible? Let me fix that metaphor for you.\\
- Alfred has invented a new pattern of basketball skin that makes the ball easier to grip.\\
- Alfred uploads the pattern to the Internet.\\
- Various people download the pattern and use their 3D printers to enjoy using it.\\
- Some people berate Alfred for uploading the pattern in a format that's incompatible with their 3D printers.\\
- To avoid the harassment, Alfred takes down his copy of the pattern from the Internet.\\
- Beatrice notices that the pattern can't be found on the Internet, and reuploads it (still crediting Alfred as the original creator).\\
- Alfred tells Beatrice to take down the pattern.\\
- Beatrice tells Alfred to go fly a kite, because the benefit of keeping the pattern available for people to use obviously outweighs the detriment of Alfred's having to delete abusive messages from his inbox /by a vast margin/. Just because she's feeling nice, though, she deletes the attribution from her copy of the pattern, so she no longer is contributing to any annoyance that Alfred is experiencing.

******* I barely know how to respond to this post...you start off by saying that once an author releases a work he loses all rights to it, which is exactly wrong. You follow up with a metaphor that is incoherent and not related to anything we've been discussing as far as I can tell. You finish with a point about copyright, despite the fact that your entire thesis is that authors do not have the right to control distribution of their works, which is exactly what copyright is. Note that copyright even goes farther: copyright means that not only do I have the right to stop distributing my work, I have the right to tell /you/ to not redistribute it.

Just to check that there's no miscommunication:

- My understanding of your position is "authors are allowed to keep their work completely private but if they ever put it online then they lose all rights to the story and have an obligation to keep it online, for free, permanently."\\
- I think you probably understand that this is exactly opposite to how the law works.

Given the above, I guess you're making a moral argument? "I think the world should work like this because it is more in accord with my preferences for receiving free entertainment that I can enjoy whenever I want for as long as I want"?

It seems pretty relevant to me. Here's a better version (since I think I accidentally wrote an example rather than a metaphor in my previous comment):\\
- Alfred brings a basketball to the playground.\\
- Beatrice uses a replicator to make a perfect copy of that basketball.\\
- Alfred has no right to tell Beatrice to destroy her copy of the basketball. Why should he? How does Beatrice's being able to enjoy the copied basketball impair Alfred's ownership of the original basketball in any way?

See also [[https://i.imgur.com/BmvXY3j.png][this 4chan screenshot]]. It's surprisingly accurate:\\
- Beatrice makes a clone of Alfred's ten-year-old son Charlie-1, with the intent of locking Charlie-2 in her basement and torturing him.\\
- Alfred has no right to demand that Beatrice release the clone to Alfred's custody. Why should he? How does Beatrice's torturing Charlie-2 impair Alfred's ownership of Charlie-1 in any way?

They have an obligation to not take it down for the flimsiest of reasons, at least. I wouldn't say that, if FanFiction.Net deletes a story for its own arbitrary reasons, the author has to reupload it elsewhere. In that case, it's FFN's fault, not the author's, that the story was made inaccessible.

This conversation has never been about an author sending takedown notices -- you are introducing that idea, and I suspect it's in order to move the goalposts instead of engaging with the point I'm actually making. I have literally said that you should be able to go ahead and download a story. What we're talking about is your belief that /your/ preferences place some sort of obligation on /me/. I'm fine with people downloading stories, and as a general rule I disapprove of takedown notices.[1]

Ah, good. You admit that there are valid reasons to take down a story. Progress! I'm guessing, however, that you still believe that you should be the one who gets to decide whether something is "the flimsiest of reasons" or whether it's valid.

[1] Authors do /have/ the right to send takedown notices, and there are legal situations that can require sending one in order to not lose certain rights. As a general rule I think takedown notices are counterproductive and in poor taste, but I still support the author's legal right to them.

  This conversation has never been about an author sending takedown notices---you are introducing that idea, and I suspect it's in order to move the goalposts instead of engaging with the point I'm actually making.
#+end_quote

- Author removes his story from the Internet but explicitly gives permission for someone else to reupload it\\
- Author removes his story from the Internet but doesn't bother to send takedown notices when someone else reuploads the story\\
- Author removes his story from the Internet and sends takedown notices when someone else reuploads the story\\
- Author removes his story from the Internet and immediately takes legal action when someone else reuploads the story

Sure, you can represent this as moving the goalposts. It's all part of one big continuum.

Definitely. Let's consider the following hypothetical scenario:\\
- Big Yud solicits donations for HPMoR.\\
- Rowling forces him to stop with a takedown notice.\\
- Big Yud notifies people who would have donated to him that Rowling has forbidden this activity.\\
- In such a case, the fault obviously lies, not with Yudkowsky (pbuh), but with Rowling and with Congress. Expecting Big Yud to defy the law would be ridiculous, given the large penalties that he would risk.

However, this line of reasoning can only go so far. Even if people who send whining messages bear /some/ of the culpability for Tozette's removal of /Hit the Ground Running/, expecting an author to defy a bunch of whiners on the Internet---[[https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/285670822264307712][hardly any penalty at all]]---is eminently reasonable.

See, that's the problem. Your opinions are so wild that when I see that link I honestly can't tell whether you're trolling, being ironic, or really that oblivious. Eh, whichever. I'll take your linked advice.

Most subscribers in [[/r/kotakuinaction][r/kotakuinaction]] probably agree with that link, so I don't think it's particularly "wild".

Also, who said anything about "free"? I've paid many hundreds of dollars for DRM-free GURPS PDFs and GOG games that I could have pirated with ease. Contrary to what you apparently assume, I don't even know how to /use/ a torrenting application.

I probably would pay $20 to ShaperV for /Time Braid/. I /did/ pay $7 to +Big Yud+ MIRI for +HPMoR+ that e-book that so conveniently was released right after HPMoR ended.
