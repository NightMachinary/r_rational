However, Winter is stripped from Cat. She mentioned previously that the bones of her previous Name Squire was still there underneath the flesh and blood that was Winter.

Squire was a Neutral Name. Who's to say she won't transition into a Heroic Name now that she's lost Winter?

Unlikely I suppose.

Fret not though, Akua and her "Folly" is still unaccounted for...

***** Cat is something better than a Hero though. She's a protagonist. Both on a meta level for the book we're reading and on a in story level with Fate. She has too many weighty connections in every corner of Calernia to be replaced so easily. She's the Arch Nemesis of the East, the primary reason the Crusade is happening. The story would break is she died and was replaced by just another Goddess to stand with the Dead King.

********* In specific stories, in the right circumstances, but not universally. In Catherine's own words:

'There were dozens of stories about hard-headed young girls facing down gods for some cause or another, but all of them about heroes. I'd wiggled my way into that sort of role before, but only when standing for a greater cause than myself.'

- Chapter 31: High Noon.

She's used heroic stories several times by using her Role as ruler of Callow to gain an advantage over 'the hated invader', but that doesn't make her a hero.

A hero, by definition, is granted power by the Gods Above. They don't have to be devout priests or flawless Paladins, as the Lone Swordsman proved, but they do need to be aligned with the Heavens in their motives and actions. Catherine most definitely is not. She has specifically rejected the Heavens as a source of morality or authority.

'Woe on us all, but if the Gods demanded my home be ashes then the Gods would burn.'

Though not every hero has shown to be a servant of the heaven, though the once that do share a trait with Cat, they are the band leader.

***** Now I have mixed feelings about this.

While I would greatly enjoy the conversation between Black, Pilgrim and the Saint, EE said he's going to halve book 4, so the other half becomes Book 5.

Judging by the character contest we have probably 10 or so chapters left (this is a highly idealistic estimate), which won't be enough time to resolve the Black situation. So it can only end in a cliffhanger.

Now, I feel the tension for Black has ebbed slightly but a new interlude featuring him would only reopen the proverbial wound bringing the tension anew and mayhaps intensify it. All excellent from an authorial perspective but cruel torture for the readers.

Tl;dr I wanna know about Black but don't wanna know too because I know it won't satiate me and only leave me craving for more.

*** Imo, this is pretty much the worst case scenario which I didn't expect for Cat. Assuming Winter was unleashed before she lost it (which seems to be the case), I doubt her entire Drow sigil would have survived. Maybe the Mighty might have survived, but I don't expect anything below her Lords to survive Winter. So not only she loses her power equaliser against Heroes the level of SoS & GP, she loses her anti-army weapon that gave her an edge over Procer & Praes, loses control over the remaining Fae left, she doesn't get any military manpower that she originally went to the Drow for, and if Indrani is dead, Masego would be highly emotionally crippled while the Woe loses their Narrative advantage of a 5-man band. And this is all that I can list off the edge of my mind over lunch.

Oath shenanigans. Cat already won.

Was the whole 'Get everyone brawling in the middle of the city!' plan actually a plan? Was it the author deceiving the reader or was there some meta-purpose I'm missing? Would the Brawl-City plan have had a preferable outcome? Because Sve Noc combining Winter and Night, then inadvertently oath-ing every Drow seems like the best possible outcome outside of just beating literally everyone into submission.

** The whole drow arc lacks narrative weight for me. It's a side show. Even if Cat loses Winter to some z-list wannabe God, her long term goals and desires won't have been affected. Oh no, she lost something she didn't want.... And also, fights with the Drow are starting to look like the /Matrix 3/; the more powerful the fighters, the less interesting the fight. Because of all of this it's hard to feel invested in the fight or the characters.

her third aspect was supposed to be "seek", were she could basically get information she needed, but that one got corrupted by the demon so she lost it by having apprentice cutting it out permanently crippling the name of squire for her.

then she lost her name by having it stolen by the goblin before her resurrection, but by killing him she claimed it again but rather then getting the same name she had before, she got it granted anew with all 3 aspects so then she had potential for 3 aspects yet again.

then with winter making a deal with her with her heart being replaced and her nature shifted her third aspect became fall, that makes things enter the domain of winter.

*** The demon didn't steal her aspect - Masego cut it out to stave off demon corruption, along with a chunk of her soul. Interestingly it gave her something like a reverse case of phantom limb, and she walks funny because of it; in the current chapter there's a reference to her "bad leg". That's because of that.

She briefly lost the name of squire at first Liesse, and gained it back with three new and unrelated aspects. Break, Take and then she got Fall as a winter power. Only Fall stayed around, though Take morphed into that artifact thing.

** Sve Noc... two faced goddess... Cat's schtick often relies on usurping power from a superior entity via narrative... Akua has been building herself up as a "tool without personality" while Catherine has been digging into her out of curiosity about how much humanity she has left... cat's power almost always comes with a cost, but with winter, it seems like she doesn't really have anything left to lose...

But there is.

Cat's personality itself.

Half of her humanity.

What if...

Cat usurps the mantle/Name/Title of the two faced goddess...

... with her alter ego being Akua?

Then the oath with Vivienne would essentially have to be applied to herself... as Akua is a /part/ of her, a tool. Ending of the final book having Catherine/Akua face off against her former friends... the ultimate climactic fight!

Seriously, what /is/ the plan here? Cat knows that there are 200 super Drow out to get her, that Sve is about to make her move, and she's what? Driving all the Drow to the centre of the city and cause chaos? How is that even supposed to help with the issues at hand?

Assuming that these ultra badass Drow, who are the hunters of the hunters, can't see through a bit of mist is something of a risky move. I'm actually a little surprised at how well it actually does work - you'd think that a group of elite huntes who live in a place called the Everdark would have ways of dealing with visibility problems.

But that isn't a fight she needs to pick. The Elves? They're incredibly strong, but haven't really been up to much in the series this far.

And there we go. Finally, the parallels between the Priestess of the Night and the Sovereign of Moonless Nights come to a head.

  She's taken all of it.

  I was just Catherine Foundling, and might as well have been blind.

  I could feel my heart beat, my real heart. My blood flow from my veins. I had never in my life felt so vulnerable as I did then, stripped of every bit of power I'd clawed my way into owning.
#+end_quote

So Cat's human again. I wonder what Warlock would have said about this, had he been around to see it.

More importantly, Cat's lost all the godlike power she's picked up over the series, and especially over the past book or so. Honestly I hope she doesn't go back to the level where just keeping track of all her powers is a chore and the only challenging fights she can have are with individuals who could single-handedly flatten a country.

But it makes perfect sense for Cat to lose here. She's been charging towards Sve without any real plan for just about this entire arc. Hell, she's known that the Longstrides and Sve would make their plays at Strycht for a bunch of chapters and did nothing about it. She's been engaging in the sorts of moves she's always seen as morally and practically reprehensible, from slaving to handing out titles, without too much thought about it. Cat getting served here is the logical outcome of this fight.

#+begin_quote
  Choosing my words with great care, I grinned and met its gaze.

  “Take me to your leader,” I ordered.

Ok. So I've got no idea how Rumena survived here, why he would listen to Cat, or what plan she could have here (did she plan for Sve to steal her mantle before she even knew that was Sve's goal?), but I'm excited to see what happens next.

Cat mentioned somewhere in the chapter that there were no more stakes, but I disagree - for once in this Drow arc ot feels like there /are/ stakes and that's wonderful.
