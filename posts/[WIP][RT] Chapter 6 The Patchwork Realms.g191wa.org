** The Skillweb finally makes an appearance.

This was originally going to be the arrival in Hellsport, but I decided it was long enough and this was a good place to stop. Should be able to get there next chapter.

*** It's when you want to die with dignity and pass your Skills on to friends/family. First you unlock as many of the minor ones as possible and have the friends/family buy them and then you go somewhere private and commit suicide with all of he friends/family standing around you and maybe some mice to soak up any extra Skills that there aren't enough people to get.

*** I don't think we have seen anything so far, from his perspective, that would indicate anything about skills is ever a secret. We've seen people arguing in public about skills they do and don't have, have and haven't used, what they are spending attunement on, the whole "organize a caravan to get a skill", etc.

I think Athos just got super unlucky here.

  14,763 Attunement ... the 1,296 ... after the prices reset.
#+end_quote

Unless it jumped from 1300 to 15000 in one step, which the earlier text suggests not, that means there was an in between step, which means he probably spent 2-5x the regular cost on some other skill. That's unfortunate; patience would pay off a lot here. I hope he figures[/d] that out.

*** It's a bit of a balancing act writing Athos in these early chapters. He's only been a sophont for a week at this point, and he only figured out what '+' means a few days ago. I don't want him to be stupid, but at the same time he's effectively a child in a giant's body. Chasing the shinies is the believable thing, I feel. But, yes: It makes me wince at the opportunity cost he's paying.

EDIT: Also, cough cough...spreadsheets, formulas, typos, you know how it goes.

Corrected version:

#+begin_quote
  I didn't bother getting "Reduce Glare", as I had already unlocked four nodes that day, each costing more than the previous one at that rank, and a Skill that used MP to provide magical sunglasses was not worth *1,094* Attunement, even if I'd had that much. It wasn't even worth the *216* that it wanted after the prices reset the next day.
#+end_quote

Doesn't change anything about what you said.

**** Oh, thanks for calling out the change. I rarely re-read chapters unless a story goes on for years, so I'd have missed that and been confused when numbers in later chapters didn't match up. Also makes his choices a lot more reasonable.

Spending an extra 3% of his pool is a lot less of a mistake than spending over 50% at once would have been.

***** Yeah. He's still being inefficient by unlocking and buying multiple things in a day, but it's a time/"money" trade-off.
