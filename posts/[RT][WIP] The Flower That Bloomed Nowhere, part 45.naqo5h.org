Breaking my own rule about not posting two chapters in a row here, but I missed one before, so what the heck.

I think this chapter came out well, for what it is. It's an absurd thing to be saying 45 chapters deep, but I think this is the point where the story has finally completely grown past the setup stage and is focused completely on the kind of stuff I was originally hoping for. Considering how it opens, that's probably a bit of a macabre sentiment. But this /is/ a story principally about death, so it kinda goes with the territory.

If the story ever becomes popular, though, I expect the "skip to this to get to the good stuff" chapter won't be here, but a couple weeks from now.

If you're just picking up the story, it's a murder mystery about a group of trainee mages visiting a group trying to achieve immortal life.


** Ok, you made me laugh at a suicide attempt; you win.

Edit after finishing the chapter:

It seems things are really ramping up. I did not see that reveal coming.

** The opening scene was really well done.

And then we get to follow that up with some nice deducting, which of course leads to even more questions. The mysteries are stacking and stacking, just the way I like it.

** I love the world building here. The tongue isopod is obviously meant to be a mirror to the MC's situation. I wonder if the Manta Ray means anything.

Now I am really curious what the two possibilities beginning with D that Ran sees.

The start was hard to read, I just don't like living in that despairing space that the MC is in.

hm, I think it's a single 2-word phrase starting with a D. But I can't think of it either
