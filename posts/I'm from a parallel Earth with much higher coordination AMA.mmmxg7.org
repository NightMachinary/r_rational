The way Yudkowsky brushes over actual questions of economics, political authority, and human nature is just way too glib to take seriously. It just comes across as a cute, rationalist fantasy-utopia where everything works because at some point everyone on planet Earth decided to share the exact same values.

Maybe I am super biased, but the whole thing just feels very surface level? There's nothing here that really seems to engage with actual issues and problems that I can relate to or discuss. And when someone raises an important question like, 'how can a society convince the majority of people to want to work towards a greater good and a collective set of values and ideas, without relying on some form of authoritarianism or propaganda?,' Yudkowsky just ignores it. He's not interested in answering deep, thorny questions, and instead the majority of what he's writing boils down to "all of the rationalists will determine a maximally optimal solution to society's organization that happens to be remarkably similar to how I personally think the world should be organized." It's rather tiresome and at best mildly amusing, which is why I think people are responding in a similar way.

There is no dissent because the "Very Serious People" are the only ones who debate things. (And they successfully propogandized to the populace that they are the coordinators and that's ok, and they're doing a good enough job that no one's revolting) Like, the Quiet Cities sound kinda horrible actually, basically concentration camps for the 5% of people who can't contribute to society, even if they're well made. And starving people if they have kids and then become depressed?

Maybe actually read the post, instead of hallucinating an entirely separate post to dunk on? The premise is that Dath Ilan is a society that would generate Eliezer as an average person, and Eliezer, as an average person, doesn't properly understand how it formed. The post isn't Eliezer's version of the Communist manifesto, it's Eliezer roleplaying someone talking about an alternate society they come from but only sort of understand, like a randomly selected modern transported to 1650 trying to explain the modern world. It's an April Fools joke, not an instruction manual for utopia, and acting as though it's trying to be the latter instead of the former so you can point out flaws in the manual is ridiculous.

**** If it's supposed to be a joke I think some of it might have been lost in translation to a blog post (medium is the message, McCluhan-style).

You're on Facebook, you follow YD and you see this post on April 1st. You obviously get the context and that Eliezer is just up to some good old fashioned memery.

You're on Reddit, on April 8th, on a subreddit called [[/r/rational]] but really more about webnovels. You find a blog post by someone called Eliezer Yudkowsky, who you know a little bit about but not that much. The blog post is super long, about some weird rationalist utopia/dystopia and the whole thing feels shallow and nonsensical so you don't think it is worth your time.

I think that's much closer to what's going on here. I don't think people didn't read it or are "hallucinating" anything---everyone here read the same thing, I don't think it makes sense to discount reactions as anything other than honest reactions.

Frankly I don't really understand the joke myself. I get that he's role-playing as a denizen of rational-land, but however you spin it, it is pretty much just YD role-playing as himself. Maybe it would be funny if I was on facebook and I could browse through it absentmindedly, maybe asking a silly question myself, but turning it into a blog post makes it feel like I'm supposed to read the whole thing, which is rather tedious. Like the act of turning it into a blog post implies there is something to be gleaned here, so I think people were expecting more than a joke consisting of 10k+ words.

***** I understand now that there is a certain jokey-ness within the post, and already suggested that some of that intent may have been lost in translation of medium and audience. Most people here approached it as some form of speculative fiction, I think, above anything else.

What I mean by seriousness is engaging seriously with the ideas in the text. I agree that most people aren't doing that here, and are rather dismissive and /maybe/ derisive. But again, EY is not some budding writer making his first foray into an intellectual space, he is a professional author & researcher; I think that warrants different standards. You may also disagree with me here, but in my personal opinion I don't really see a problem with mocking a piece of writing that seems to imply that eugenics would be part of a rational, optimized society:

#+begin_quote
  *Yudkowsky:* One of the things I'd expect people from this world to find relatively off-putting is that dath ilan has comprehended that happiness is heritable and they teach a sight that extends over generational times and thinks ahead to the equilibrium; so it's understood that, except in very exceptional circumstances, if you're unhappy on average for any reason, it is your duty to the next generation not to have kids who might inherit this tendency.

  So the number of people who go to the Quiet Cities is more like 5% than 15%, because those who would have otherwise been the parents of people who went there did not have kids. And the rest of the world is mostly happy, because transmitting constitutions that can be happy in a civilized world is itself a solvable coordination problem.

  *Ben Pace:* (Sad react, but glad the people are able to look at sad things and take appropriate action and deal with it, and I respect those ~10% of people who do this a great deal.)
#+end_quote

If this is part of the joke I don't find it particularly funny. It makes me wonder whether EY thinks that I shouldn't be allowed to have children due to my personal struggle with happiness and mental illness. It's distasteful, and I personally have no interest in responding seriously to a text that posits that eugenics is a sad but "appropriate action" to take. It deserves to be mocked, called drivel, and generally laughed at. That is my opinion.

In fact I find it rather disturbing that the people on Facebook did find something worth to discuss here, but I guess that is just a me-thing. There is a weird contradiction here, with the Facebook discussion being quite serious, yet on Reddit people are overreacting to an April Fools joke. So is the text a joke or does it merit serious discussion? It feels like intellectual plausible deniability, an excuse for ignoring valid criticism.

I didn't read the whole thing, but I believe my criticisms are pretty specific to the portion I read. If someone calls something trash, but admits they only read a fifth of it, that is a way of indicating that the portion they read was trash. A criticism for one QnA doesn't become invalidated because you didn't read the entire QnA.

Sorry to bombard with the long comment. Just wanted to share my perspective and why I personally don't find anything disturbing about EY getting some snarky comments. You seem chill, hopefully this doesn't come across as passive aggressive, tone is hard to read sometimes. Cheers,

****** So, eugenics as it has typically been practiced over the course of human history is considered terrible for /damn good reasons/. The history of eugenics is the history of forced sterilizations and mass murder. So it makes real sense to read about something that can be described as eugenics and have alarm bells go off in your head.

On the other hand, there are plenty of things that are technically eugenics, but are also unambiguously good. Gene therapy that cures genetic disorders is eugenics. Embryo screening for debilitating genetic diseases that will kill your child before they reach ten is eugenics. If we figured out how to create pills that made people smarter, and also altered their genes so their children would be smarter, and then did everything possible to subsidize them so anyone could afford them, because it would be /wrong/ to have that kind of lifechanging technology and restrict it, that would be eugenics.

The "eugenics" in Dath Ilan consist of two pieces. The first is that they have different ideas of how well you should be positioned before it's responsible to have children, including that you shouldn't pass on genetic disorders that are going to debilitate them, which, in this version of reality, apparently is thought to include a genetic predisposition to depression. The second portion is the one and only enforcement mechanism that Dath Ilan has for this. The mechanism is that nobody has to work if they don't want to, as long as they don't have kids. Nobody is forced to do anything. Nobody is murdered. And that matters.

I have depression. It's not that bad, as far as depression goes, anymore. But there were entire years of my life that were quite literally torture. I remember on one occasion, long after my depression had gotten quite a bit better, I got a cut so deep you could see bone. It hurt. A lot. And I remember thinking about the fact that it hurt less than just existing did, during the worst years I had. My mom has it worse than I do. She spends most of her time in that kind of state. Every single one of my siblings has problems with depression. I wouldn't be shocked if more than one person in my family ended up committing suicide. The benefit of Dath Ilan's system is that fewer people suffer like I used to, and my mom still does. The cost is that once you've had kids, you don't have absolute freedom from having to work anymore. Whether that's worth it is something you can disagree with. It's not something so obviously foolish that you should greet it with ridicule and mockery.

EDIT: And the part where people here are treating it like something it's not is the bit where they criticize Eliezer for not laying out a clear sequence of steps we can take to move from here to Dath Ilan. That's ridiculous, since he's not trying to describe a system easily reached from here, and in fact he says so himself. Similarly, when people react to /the character he is roleplaying/ expressing a lack of knowledge about something, and respond as if this is /Eliezer the actual person/ failing to fill in all the details on his utopia blueprint, when he isn't trying to create a utopia blueprint at all, because this is medium-effort fucking around he did on April Fools.

I just have to leave and go to work if I want to have children.

I might face some cultural disapproval if I decided to have children, but on the other hand the condition as written is "are" unhappy, not "were" unhappy, so I'd probably be fine.

********* What is described sounds less like abortion and more like /de facto/ sterilization of a subset of population. And since this is grounded on (what I believe to be) mistaken beliefs about how depression works, I do find it hard to justify ethically.

But even if they are right, and they actually live in a universe where depression is mostly caused by hereditary biological factors, I still think they are making a mistake here. Because removing our ability to feel extreme cold is not the same as being warmer. Pain, unhappiness, are signals that something is wrong, and they are selecting the individuals that are least able to feel these.

It seems easy to /pre mortem/ this idea, especially when you are used to thinking about self-modifying intelligence.

******* I thought the logical inconsistencies in the text I quoted were relatively clear, but I may have made a mistake by neglecting to explain it fully. To be sure, the type of eugenics we are discussing here is one where individuals have their reproductive rights taken away, either by sterilization or other means. Gene therapy or embryo screenings are categorically different, I don't think it makes sense to bring these up as examples of why we shouldn't be extremely skeptical someone suggesting eugenics as a rational project.

First off, EY's principles for this program makes no sense. Happiness isn't an inheritable trait, and neither can mental illness be fully attributed to genetics. My estimate would be that any genetic disposition for happiness would be at about 50%, the other half consisting of societal and environmental factors. That is my /charitable/ estimate here. The problem is, if EY is trying to create a happier society, why would he suggest eugenics to solve something that isn't fully a genetic problem?

The second issue here is something you obliquely mentioned. "No one is forced to do anything," so what's the problem? The problem is that this is a program explicitly directed towards people who are too sick (due to any reason, whether genetic or not) to work and support themselves. Poor, mentally ill people who need state assistance. In EY's world, you don't get help until you've given up your right to have children. On some level it makes sense: the whole point here is that EY doesn't want these people to have children, so just give them the choice between starving and giving up their reproductive rights. It's also coercive and cruel. Worse, it's ineffective. Plenty of people would be shuffled through this system who don't even have genetic defects, yet would be forced to give up their reproductive rights (and I refraining from saying sterilized, though historically this has been the most effective way of enforcing this). If the aim here is to maximize happiness, I don't see how this is especially effective at anything besides manufacturing cruelty.

So in short, EY's idea builds off illogical principles to justify a "rational" eugenics program that is laughably inept and unintentionally cruel. I think that is something that we can laugh at for how ridiculously stupid it is.

But then, I would be making a crucial mistake. For I have ignored that EY was /merely roleplaying/ and I should never have taken his ideas so seriously. However, regardless of whatever veneer EY decides to coat his writing with, the point remains that EY is intending to share Good Ideas. The purpose of the post is that he is describing an "Earth with much higher coordination," ie, how Earth would look if it followed EY's personal, rational principles. You obviously agree with me here, for otherwise why would you bother to defend the merits of EY's eugenics program if it was just an elaborate form of roleplay? Trying to play both sides here (it's only a serious idea until you take it too seriously) is weak rhetoric and reeks of double-think and tribalism.

******** The thing here seems to result from a difference in understood background reality (portion of pathological unhappiness that's genetic) and, on your part, a failure to internalize that Dath Ilan /isn't Earth/. No, really, it isn't. When you read about any one factor, you shouldn't be understanding it in the context of Earth, you should be understanding it in the context of Dath Ilan.

The entire state of society is set up to help people flourish. To help them be /happy/. From plopping everyone in one city to paving the sidewalks with bouncy material so people's knees don't hurt to adding mile tall cranes and wires everywhere and making housing modular so people can live with their friends with low rents to painting those cranes and wires blue so they don't interfere with views as much to installing fucking laser bug zappers on every corner so nobody gets annoyed by mosquitos. Reading about Dath Ilan and not inventing reasons to hate it but just paying attention to what's /actually there/ reveals a society /vastly/ more conducive to happiness than ours. For fucks sake, the attractive people voluntarily veil themselves so that when people have unattractive partners they don't feel disappointed! There are hundreds of /actually different/ places a person can shop around between to find one that makes them happy, and Dath Ilan is rich enough that they can actually afford to do that, and in fact have a whole system of infrastructure set up to make moving easier! A ridiculous amount of effort has gone into making Dath Ilan a place conducive to happiness. You just ignored that so you could shout about how Yudkowsky including one particular part of that massive edifice in his hypothetical society composed of people /actually very different from Earth humans/ made him a monster.

I'd also like to mention that, if I end up married to someone else who has severe problems with depression like I do, I'm not having children. Outside that specific circumstance, I'm undecided. But you don't instantiate people who have a solid forty percent chance of experiencing existence as torture until they eventually manage to kill themselves. That's hilariously unethical.

I can adopt.

Don't invent new facts about the program to be displeased by, read about what's /actually there/ and then criticize /that/ instead of making something up. Governments in the conventional sense /don't exist/ in Dath Ilan. Nobody is being shuffled through a system they don't want to be in, here. You don't sign anything away in the future. You just, if you have children, stop getting free money. You apparently have problems with that. Well, fine. That's not unreasonable. After a few generations of actual adoption of the norms behind the plan, which you'll get in Dath Ilan but not Earth, you'll end up with vastly fewer people born who experience existence itself as roughly equivalent to being burned alive, at least in terms of what they will do to escape it. But you will also, even in Dath Ilan, be leaving some number of people to die, and be paying some number of people to not have children they would have wanted to have, on pain of having to work if they have kids.

Importantly, they all /grew up knowing this/, and reading between the lines, the stupidest of them would probably be smarter than average on Earth, and so it's already a cultural touchstone that /of course/ having kids means you don't get to opt out of civilization! You've just made a bid that what civilization needs is /more people like you/.

If you can't work /for dispositional reasons/, there are largescale charities set up which have tried to /build cities that people like that can be happy in/. But these charities don't want to result in there being a massive underclass of people who can't work for dispositional reasons, which is what happens if you give depressed people free money, build entire cities optimized for their happiness, and then, predictably, they move there, because they can't be happy in cities optimized for non-depressed people, but maybe things will be a bit better in a Quiet City. So, they say, âwe'll stop giving you free money if you have children.â

If you compare that to the way people too depressed to work get treated /on Earth/, they come out vastly ahead. You, uh, probably don't know how that is. People don't like learning about it, since it's unpleasant. But if you can't function on Earth, you're kind of fucked. If you're lucky, you'll get on disability somewhere. But getting on disability is a Kafkaesque nightmare, and it's a small enough amount of money that you might be reduced to eating beans and rice for thirty years. Or cat food. Oh, and you're literally /not allowed to save money/. If you do, they kick you off. And, crucially, our civilization is /sufficiently poor/ that it actually can't afford to be much better than that. Oh, somewhat better, sure. But not /much better/, /everywhere/. We could afford to, specifically, make it better for people on disability. And the bit where it's a nightmare to get on and we kick people off for saving money could just be removed. But we couldn't make /everything/ that much better all at once, without completely collapsing under the load. Dath Ilan maybe could, and you can argue should, that doing otherwise is a mistake. That its too coercive to be worth it, and /maybe/ it would be acceptable if everyone got enough money to be fine and you could get /more/ if you agreed not to have children. I'd actually agree with that myself; it's probably enough to get the benefits they want without leaving anyone to starve.

But, importantly, In a world with /actually different/ culture, things are going to be felt to be different amounts of coercive. Earth humans don't have a compulsive need to commit arson such that they can't be happy without burning things down, so we feel free to punish arson with jail time. However, if people /did/ feel that compulsive need for arson, jailing people for it would be inhuman. We'd have to retool all of society around allowing for it, but that's what we'd actually do. In Dath Ilan, they have an actually different culture. If you, as an individual, explicitly offered to an average depressed Dath Ilani, to /personally/ give them money in exchange for not having children while they are still receiving the money, they would be /insulted/. Not because of your condition on helping them. But because you thought they were so /irresponsible/, so /unethical/, that they might create people who had a statistically higher than normal chance of experiencing life as torture. In that cultural milieu, different things are appropriate.

That isn't Earth? You don't see a way to make Earth culture more like that? Eliezer's description of Dath Ilan is not /supposed/ to be a description of things Earth should do to be better, and he literally says that. Some parts are supposed to be things we could lift out wholesale, like non-bespoke housing specifically constructed to be modular and moveable. But he specifically signposts those. The rest of it is worldbuilding of an interesting foreign culture filled with, from our perspective, geniuses. It is more than a little disquieting, since that's how you /actually feel/ when confronted with a /genuinely/ foreign culture. This is really basic âunderstanding other culturesâ and âdoing Sci-Fi worldbuilding well.â Their different culture has had the predictable /massive/ negative consequences that follow from its specifications, and he actually discusses those himself, and even the version of himself he's roleplaying, who's /from/ Dath Ilan, thinks Dath Ilan is /too much/ like itself, and would, upon encountering Earth, predictably have a /massive blow-up/ about all the ways they'd screwed up.

Oh, and regarding the bit about roleplaying, I think you must have started writing your response before my edit, where I specify what I think about that whole thing. In short, I think Eliezer is "merely roleplaying" in the sense that this isn't an instruction manual for how to get from Earth to utopia, so criticizing it for failing to provide sufficient instructions is a mistake. Similarly, when people criticize a lack of detail in certain places. Both /would/ be appropriate if it was an instruction manual, or not medium-effort messing about. I mean, sure, there are gaps. Point out that its medium-effort messing about and so there are enough flaws in the description that things would need to be fleshed out out before people could use it as the setting of a thousand-word science fiction novel, sure. Just don't completely dismiss it as worthless drivel the author is an idiot for writing since it doesn't include an instruction manual.

Honestly, a part of my defense of this is that, as a depressed person, I read about Dath Ilan's treatment of people like me and thought "god I wish I was there instead of here." As a result, I'm somewhat annoyed when people talk about how monstrous they would be for horribly coercing me by being /vastly/ better to me than I'm damn sure the people criticizing the horrible horrible coercion would be. Most people would, at best, do just enough to satisfy their own emotional state, and then stop bothering. They might give me money out of their own pockets regardless of whether I had children, but I wouldn't bet on it. They damn well wouldn't build the people like me Quiet Cities. Maybe I'm wrong about that, and you say you've dealt with some of the same things I have, so it isn't like everyone in circumstances like mine would react like that.

But could you at least treat it as evidence that I do, and not just dismiss it as blind tribalism?

********* Most utopian projects have some sort of social critique, whether we are talking about Bacon's /New Atlantis/ or [[https://www.google.com/search?q=the+world+if+meme&sxsrf=ALeKk02slcAW8T5HIQBQJqJS2l6Uy8IONw:1618251773668&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj7-4DRqfnvAhVZGVkFHdp7DOkQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1280&bih=644&dpr=2]["The World If..." memes]]. That's how I approached this, and whether that is the intended interpretation is something we disagree upon. I do contend that the way this is framed as simply being due to "higher coordination" (an issue which EY happens to have written an entire book about, it seems), as well as being a transparent retread of EY's personal opinions ([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvA4j8pGYG4xtaTkw/i-m-from-a-parallel-earth-with-much-higher-coordination-ama?commentId=aqabziEo6vuA35Jjc][as others have pointed out]]), is what led me to that approach.

If you can read this as pure fiction, I say go for it. I think my issue was more with commenters who thought it was "disturbing" that people weren't taking the writing seriously, implying that this text held some deep value, especially when it haphazardly plays with rather disturbing ideas with little regard for external realities.

****** To complement Restinan's explanations/comments, here is my answer:

#+begin_quote
  I understand now that there is a certain jokey-ness within the post ... So is the text a joke or does it merit serious discussion?
#+end_quote

The joke is Eliezer not actually being from dath ilan, not the social practices in the text being jokes.

I feel like dath ilan maybe deserves a serious discussion in the context of dath ilan, not necessarily in the context of Earth.

#+begin_quote
  [T]he type of eugenics we are discussing here is one where individuals have their reproductive rights taken away, either by sterilization or other means.
#+end_quote

Here we'll have to agree to disagree (namely, I don't believe that not supporting someone unless they don't have kids constitutes "having their reproductive rights taken away").

#+begin_quote
  If someone calls something trash, but admits they only read a fifth of it, that is a way of indicating that the portion they read was trash.
#+end_quote

Right. And if A reads 20% of something, B reads the entire text and C says that A and B have both read the same thing, I'd consider C's statement misleading.

#+begin_quote
  So is the text a joke or does it merit serious discussion? It feels like intellectual plausible deniability, an excuse for ignoring valid criticism.
#+end_quote

I noticed two specific pieces of criticism in the comments here - the supposed eugenics (which I wouldn't counter by saying "it was a joke," so that part's fine) and the Very Serious People deciding "everything" despite having no power (that I /also/ wouldn't counter by saying it was a joke - there I think the answer might be that the people who wouldn't listen to them would find themselves on the receiving end of the rest of the society penalizing them for that, once it inevitably turned out they were right (but maybe someone else will correct me)).

#+begin_quote
  I think my issue was more with commenters who thought it was "disturbing" that people weren't taking the writing seriously, implying that this text held some deep value

  I'll just say that the proportion of content-free/low-effort/(borderline) rude comments in this thread disturbs me.

Notice the difference between your interpretation and what I actually wrote.

** E.Y. has this to say on education /"Yup! Sex Teacher is a very different concept from High-Grade Expensive Professional Sex Worker. Your sex teacher is definitely not more attractive than your average partner will be, for example."/ So ignoring all the massive, massive sociological and psychological problems with this.... if someone is doing or coaching a physical activity all day, they will probably be fairly attractive than someone that has to ride a chair for a living. What a joke.
