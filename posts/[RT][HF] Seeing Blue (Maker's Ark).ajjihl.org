** Yes, I'm still alive and writing 8-). Haven't posted anything for a while because I like my work to have a certain tone, and what I was writing wasn't fitting. But I'm happy with this story. Enjoy.

** I remember reading a few of the Doc Future series, but for the life of me I don't recall how far into it I got. Is there a list of stories in the series anywhere? Ideally with synopses?

*** [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories]] has a (not always up to date) list of the novels and most of the short stories. No synopses, but short descriptions of a few of the stories. I generally include a link to that page as the second link in the introduction to each chapter or story. Hope this helps.
