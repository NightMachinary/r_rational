I remember reading a Rat Fic about the Silmarils being recovered by the sons of Fëanor in the modern age, but I can't seem to find it and I can't remember what it's called. Can someone help me out?

**** lintamande has also written [[https://www.glowfic.com/users/34?page=8][like a million glowfics]] either set in the Silmarillion at various points in the timeline, or exploring what if the Fëanorians were born in a different setting.

(But it's glowfic, so meandering, weirdly-formatted, crossover-heavy, and very much an acquired taste. Delve into the abyss at your own peril.)

***** In fact, that's how I found this one when trying to answer the question. Searching Google for what I could remember about the story found me nothing relevant, so I finally gave in and searched for "Feanor glowfic" and lintamande's name popped up.

****** Don't try to read all of it. Even at reduced writing capacity lintamande(aka theunitofcaring) still writes it faster than you can read it.

Technically sixth in a series of thematically related snippets, but while the others are good this one is better and stands perfectly well alone - I only found the others well afterwards.

Takes place earlyish in the fourth age in Valinor, and reminds me a little of the happy ending of UNSONG. More-or-less canon-compliant, though it takes the themes in a different direction.
