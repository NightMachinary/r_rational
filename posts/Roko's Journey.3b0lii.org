*Roko's Journey*

......

*Part 1 of 2*

......

/How do you beat an enemy who is smarter than you in every way?/

/You don't. You don't try to out think them. You don't face them in their area of strength./

--------------

Roko is hidden in the shadows observing. Patiently waiting for it to come. The preparations were complete. The only thing left to do is to wait and watch the trap work or fail.

--------------

/If you have an opponent with overwhelming intelligence, you force them into a contest where intelligence doesn't matter. Forcing a battle of speed, strength, or even specialized knowledge is the first step./

--------------

The creature first arrived in a storm of fire and destruction. When it came out of its shell after three days, the area around its violent impact was just beginning to recover.

Many wanted to kill it out of fear of what it could do and numerous others saw it as a godly figure with command of powerful fires. With multiple conflicting reactions, only one thing was agreed on, it was /dangerous/.

--------------

/However, the most important thing to remember about intelligence is the fact that intelligence is/ */adaptable/*. /A truly intelligent being will be able to learn quickly and adjust for any difficulties once aware of potential handicaps./

--------------

When the most curious eaters first encountered it, there were threats of violence as the eaters attempted to test if it was edible and display their strength in a show of dominance. Within a few days, it rose to high social status in the tribe of eaters as the right-hand of the newest chieftain, Zebe, one of the first eaters it successfully approached with an offer of cooperation.

--------------

/Therefore to nullify the opponent's advantages, one must also use surprise to strike the first blow. Even the most intelligent and powerful opponent can lose to a stupid and weaker opponent with the benefit of surprise./

--------------

Whispering into Zebe's ear, it managed to push forward numerous dramatic changes to how the eaters lived. It taught them to bury seeds in the earth in intricate ways and to preserve their prey to have plentiful tasty young. With a sharply reduced focus on hunting and gathering, the eaters spent less time migrating from area to area.

--------------

/However the enemy will be aware of its weakness and be suspicious of any situations which will lure it into a position of vulnerability./

--------------

Due to the eaters switching from a nomadic lifestyle to a stationary one, they rapidly expanded their territory. With it providing unusual weapons and tactics for attacking, no sapient could stop them. Within a few years, the eaters encountered Roko's enormous clan of rippers, grazers, flyers, swimmers, and diggers.

--------------

/Therefore one needs to use bait./

--------------

It didn't take long for Roko's clan to realize the source of the eaters' strength. After capturing some of the eaters for information, the leaders quickly amassed an idea of it's motivations. They understand it to be very weak physically, but extraordinarily smart and knowledgeable. Cooperation was impossible since it wanted unrestricted access to the caves leading below the mountains. The same caves where Roko's family lived. As the leader of leaders, Roko was the one to come up with a deceptively simple plan to trap it.

......

*Part 2 of 2*

......

As Roko watched the creature dying in front of him, he asked “What were you trying to do? I could never figure out your motives. Only what you wanted the eaters to do. To get into the caves.”

Roko tilted his head, “Why did you want to get into the caves? There's nothing worthwhile other than space and fresh water. There's plenty of that elsewhere. The only thing remotely unusual about our caves was the strange silver-like metal.”

It chuckled bitterly, “Yes, you realized I wanted the [[http://www.ccnr.org/salzburg.html][/yureinum/]]. By letting my spies find out about your ‘plans' to seal off your supposingly most-vulnerable caves to deny us easy access, you also threatened to prevent me from ever reaching my fuel. It was brilliant, I panicked when I realized that my only chance of stopping you would be to keep you from unblocking the dams to flood the caves and cause a rock-slide.”

Roko nodded, “I tricked you into rushing the eaters to all attack at once when you saw some of us moving towards the dam, but I already convinced the swimmers to break the dams themselves beforehand and drowned all of your forces. I was trying to kill you outright, but you managed to survive hitting the rocks even though most of the other eaters died.”

Roko leaned forward and bared his teeth, “Although, you know that wasn't what I was asking. Don't make me repeat myself again, what did you want?”

It looked up to him with a solemn expression, “I wanted to go home.”

Roko twisted his snout in confusion, “From what I heard, you impressed them so much when you first arrived that they would have given you anything you wanted. If you wanted them to follow you instead, then helping them to gain dominance over the other animals in the area would have made them less willing to leave. If you wanted something from the clan, there were easier ways to go about it than force. What other purpose could you have for all of this?”

It responded as it shifted its broken limbs. Roko stepped back in unease at its disregard for the pain that must be affecting it.

“Home is too far away by foot. I needed them to build me the tools to build a way to transport home. Your clan blocked my access to the energy source.”

Roko narrowed his eyes and flashed his teeth, “/Where/ is your home?”

It gave an enigmatic smile as it glanced over, “Did you know that the stars are the same as your Sun?”

It took a moment for Roko to understand. He snapped his eyes to the nighttime sky above him as he gasped in surprise.

/If the tiny stars are truly same as the Sun, then that could mean they are specks of the same things which make up the Sun...No, it implied that they all are the same, which means the stars have to be very far away, so far that I would never reach them. Not for lives upon lives of walking./

He looked down with eyes of understanding, “If there was a simple way of getting home, you would have gotten the eaters to build or fetch you what you needed. But you focused on changing how they lived. By growing their food and enslaving the grazers to control how they breed and who was culled, they changed completely. You even got them to practice single-paired mating. You also needed to change how they raised their /children!?!/”

Roko felt dizzy with shock, “That only makes sense if you expected to live for generations!”

It bared its teeth in a fierce snarl, “I didn't even intend to land on this plant! It was supposed to be a simple fly-by on the way to another colony.”

Roko stumbled backwards against a tree.

This was huge. Ever since Kiki's death, Roko never believed the elders' stories about how all sapients reincarnated from generation to generation. If that was true, someone would have told others their past lives. Without any memories, you weren't the same being from life to life. When Kiki died to save the clan, everyone had cried as if she been removed from existence, not as if she was going away for a long journey.

Even as Roko became the leader, he had been depressed at the thought that everyone would die and /would never ever/ */come back!/*

Even with his unusual understanding of how the eaters, rippers, grazers, flyers, swimmers, and diggers thought differently from each other, he could only help the sapients to work together in harmony. This only helped to have a better life. It didn't help all the animals to die any less often and painfully as part of the “Circle of Life”.

The “Circle of Lies” was more like it! None of the deaths and fighting was right, but Roko couldn't think of any way to help and was nearing depression...until /it/ came.

If it was possible for one being to become immortal, then it could be possible for everyone to become immortal.

Roko looked at with narrowed eyes. It wasn't in pain and it didn't even seem very worried. As if it only had to worry about capture by hostile forces, not as if it would be dying.

“If you are immortal or very long-lived, then that means there is something unusual about your body which has a possible chance of being passed on to others. You also have shown an utter disregard for the lives of others. You will only use others for your goal of departure. You are too dangerous to be allowed to live.”

Realization and fear slowly began to dawn upon it's face.

Roko moved in to eat.

......

*Part 3 of 2*

......

For anyone who may be confused by the slang I used:

- eaters = omnivores

- rippers = carnivores

- grazers = herbivores

- swimmers = anything that spends most of its life in water

- flyers = anything that spends most of its life airborne

- diggers = anything that spends most of its life underground

- sapient = the uplifted animals refer those who can communicate as sapient

......

*Backstory and Inspiration*

......

I came up with this idea when I was watching /The Lion King/ and thought to myself; /what would it be like to be inserted into a world of talking animals?/

Thus the idea of humans who [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal][uplifted animals]] and left the planet for them alone was born. To create the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][One Man Industrial Revolution]], I had the humans lose contact with Earth and experience a collapse in space-faring technology. After they rebuilt from their space colonies, they forgot where Earth used to be. When ‘it' arrived, it had crashed landed on a plant by accident. The ‘sapient' animals refer to it as an ‘it' due to it's clear differences from them and their inability to figure out it's gender (it doesn't have one as a post-human).

It was also drastically weakened because it requires large amounts of energy which was stored on the destroy ship. It was reduced to moderately well above base-line human physical levels to conserve energy. Of course this means that many sapient animals are stronger than it.

It mainly relied on it's intelligence to convince the animals to follow it and used it's knowledge to help the eaters become powerful.

Roko is a grown-up animal Disney protagonist who went on a journey to save his clan and ended up suffering a tragic loss with the death of his female love interest, Kiki. As a result of Kiki's death, Roko went on to become the youngest leader of his clan in recent history. The sequel 'movie' is him uniting multiple animal tribes to work in harmony instead of the usual predation/fighting and becoming a leader of leaders. I left out any physical descriptions because after centuries to millennia of evolution, they would have become extremely different in appearance from modern-day animals and I wanted to leave Roko's species up to the reader's imagination.

For anyone who might have felt grossed out, morally or physically, by Roko's...er...eating it, I would like to point out the fact that he lives in a world where many animals are intelligent and he is a meat-eater (carnivore or omnivore). This means that he frequently has to hunt down prey which are sapient and can communicate well enough with him to plead for mercy. While he can empathize (a rarity for any creature to have empathy for those outside of their species), he still needs to hunt intelligent creatures for survival. Thus eating it is not an unusual idea.

Sorry if you guys were expecting a longer story due to the three parts, but I felt it was important to separate everything into three different comments due to the difference between a narrative summary and a dialogue as well as a backstory to explain any facts that I couldn't sneak inside the actual story itself. If I was a more motivated writer, I would expand this into an actual novel, but the climax scene was the only interesting part to write. The rest of it was simply set-up for the scene.

This would require a sense of altruism that would simply not come from a tribal hunter who eats sapient beings. He sustains himself by eating others, and would not be particularly disposed to bestowing immortality upon a pleasurable form of sustenance.

This would require a proper theory of mind on a level that took us hundreds of millennia to reason out. At this point you're simply dressing up rationalist tropes and dropping them into your character's mind without regard for your setting.

Short answer, no, I didn't like this.

*** Normally I don't like criticism because they usually boil down to only saying "I don't like this", but unlike most other criticism you actually provided very good and clear reasons why. Awesome.

I freely admit being rushed with this story and just shoehorned in the monologue to hint to the reader what the trap was like instead just skipping over without any mention. I'll have to put in the work to actually add in the scene without being lazy about it tomorrow.

I had taken for granted how seemingly self-evident how the size of an object shrinks with increasing distance and am really surprised by this. Do you know why it's not an obvious thing?

The memory one was definitely poorly done but I didn't even realize it since it's a concept I have known for the majority of my life.

Thanks for being a helpful Wise Reader!

It is not that foreshortening isn't obvious (it is, to the point that it's engrained in our visual cortex), but rather that the Sun simply doesn't behave like any other objects. It belongs to a separate class of object, with the moon and the stars, which don't change in (apparent) visual angle no matter how far you walk towards them (The whole round-planet thing doesn't help either, not that we could walk a recognizable distance towards the sun if it weren't). The reconciliation of this would require a more sophisticated observation, that objects farther away vary in visual angle less with the same distance traveled, and that the sun's invariance to approach (besides the fact that you're walking on a rotating ball) despite its visual angle is due to its massive size and distance.

***** A comparison of how shadows work can also be made. If I'm remembering properly, that's how the diameter of the Earth was calculated by the Greeks (or maybe Romans)

Compare the Sun and it's shadowed to a fire at night, and it's shadows. Crude understanding of light from a point source causing shadows.

*** Monologue is done very often in prisoner interrogations, explaining how law enforcement broke down the behavior of criminals, hoping for reactions or clues. Roko wants information. He's got a broken enemy in front of him. Perfect opportunity to get answers, interrogation style.

The comment about "so far away that I would never reach them" I agree with. A slightly less specific comment about how far away the sun is, because it never seems closer no matter how far one walks, and then a comparative narration where these other suns must be even farther away would be fully within the capabilities of a rational paleolithic mind. Also remember, this is a predator. Visual-based predators have extremely good concepts of distance and position. If they didn't, they wouldn't eat.

Spoken like a rational person. Not a robot. Though I would have interspersed it with thought-related activities, like pacing back and forth. Gnashing of teeth. Perhaps some inner dialog.

I agree that the idea of immortality is odd. I would think Roko would eat him because he was hungry, and the being might be shocked and reply something along the lines of "You would eat someone who speaks to you?" And then "If I did not, I would starve."

It did not take us hundreds of millennia to reason out a proper theory of mind. We didn't even try until recently. In this world, where thinking carnivores eat thinking herbivores, and they can talk to one another, there's going to be a LOT of conversations about death and existence. I could see them developing a theory of mind before they have complex tools, with that sort of prompting occurring so regularly.

I like this. It has weaknesses, but I believe them to be addressable, provided that the reader is nudged and prompted into recognizing that Roko's world is different.

#+end_quote

That first requires one to conceptualize the sun as an object in Euclidean space, with an actual distance. That is not something you can take for granted in a paleolithic environment. Before you can say the stars are like the sun, you first have to say that the sun is like any other object. You can see that this was not at all the case in even historical times, as they were deified in myth and viewed as objects of an entirely separate class. The sky itself was not seen as an expanse of unending space, but a curtain or a bowl that the tribe lived underneath. Appealing to the nature of predation doesn't work either, because we /still/ have a hard time intuitively understanding the vast distances and scales in astronomy, or even /geography./ The scales a predatory mind can think of are on the order of hundreds of miles.

#+end_quote

Why would there be? Thinking humans killed thinking humans all the time, and actual ideas of a theory of mind came from institutionalized philosophy and science. Cannibalism was and still is a thing, and there isn't any special difference between human tribes and this circumstance that would imply that there would be /any/ cerebral thinking about that arrangement, especially without the benefit of writing to build up ideas that were already thought of. Cannibalism in tribes is religiously/spiritually rationalized, if I'm not mistaken, and given the clear sense of religion Roko's clan is shown to have, it would be a rationalization waiting to happen if it hadn't already.

In paleolithic times, all anyone would be doing is duplicating information, not moving beyond the same ideas anyone else has had. Insular, tribal cultures preying on one another, focused on survival as they are, would only serve to develop religion and the idea of an afterlife, with an instinctual sense of spirituality. The sense of perspective Roko has in the story is frankly bizarre, given that he was raised in this culture and /does not have the benefit/ of past thinkers to jump off of. You say that we didn't even try, but I say we weren't able to in the first place. Everything technological, economical, and cultural plays into this. Agriculture for supporting a population larger than farmers, writing for providing past work, and a tradition of philosophical thinking, which, like it or not, developed from the status and resources bestowed upon a developing religious caste, and eventually science itself. All of these things were necessary to build the ideas we take for granted today, and as a final blow, should I mention that Roko's iconoclasm is itself the rebuttal to the scenario you have hypothesized? If they developed a theory of mind, then it would not be a departure from the traditional beliefs that were depicted in the story.

I do not find the idea of immortality odd in this setting, as it was conceptualized in myth and it comes naturally out of a fear of death. I was objecting to the idea that Roko's first thought would be making everyone immortal. The idea of eating him to obtain his power is entirely natural. Bull testicles give you strength.

***** There is one other thing to consider. A lot of your arguments are based on human interactivity with myths. What if these beings were rational, and simply rejected unprovable theories. No gods. No myths. No superstition. Plenty of mistakes and mis-attributions, certainly, but if a reason for it isn't known, they don't just make things up randomly. They assign it as unknown.

You seem to be basing a lot on an assumption that irrationality is unavoidable in a primitive society.

EDIT. Hrm, there is a mention of a circle of life. They are clearly not fully empirical. Perhaps simply more so than humans were before technology.

I am not. I simply claim that rationality in a primitive society would not manifest in the ways you are claiming, and that inferential distance precludes many of the logical leaps that Roko makes in this story. Inferential distance is actually a rational thing when you don't have a community of experts to defer to.

**** "Roko's Basilisk" was a thought experiment brought up by Roko (a once-poster on LessWrong) with potentially cognitively damaging implications. To avoid distress, Eliezer deleted the comment, with predictable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect][Streisandian]] consequences. It's a topic of some infamy around these parts.

The term "Basilisk" or "Langford Basilisk" for cognitive hazards comes from the short story [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLIT_%28short_story%29][B.L.I.T.]] by David Langford, which proposed the idea of visual patterns that could damage the brain by subverting the visual cortex.
