  When Twilight is awake, Celestia is her teacher, and she a faithful student. But when Twilight shuts her eyes, another mare approaches, who teaches her a very different lesson.

The author is a long-time participant in the rationalist community, so I think this story belongs here. Again and again, it poses the question: should one prefer the cynical truth, or ignorant happiness? In this fic, Luna represents the colder side of rationality, the temptation to say emotions don't matter, that even a child can and should be burdened with the most terrible facts of the world. Celestia, meanwhile, is an incrementalist. Their battle-by-proxy over a single person is one that shows the advantages and the downsides to both approaches.

** If you're interested in this, it should be noted that the story hasn't been updated since 2017---though the author is still active, so there's always hope.

*** I always felt the opposite. If no one has heard from an online author he might just have a writing hiatus. But if a fanfic author has moved on to multiple other stories then I have little expectation that they would return to ideas from years ago after having since much improved and found new interests and fandoms.
