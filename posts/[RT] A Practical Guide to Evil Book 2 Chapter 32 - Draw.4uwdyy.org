** Well, things turned out better than I had feared they would when Heiress made her entrance last chapter. I can't help but like Almorava. And I really want Robber to get a Name.

What is Catherine's catchphrase? I can't recall it at the moment.

Idle musing: I wonder if Villains (or the leaders in Evil) are more prone to take the words of Heroes as truth? I doubt it, unless a specific Name has to do with valuing truth... but Bard did just outright say that Heiress unleashed the demon. I wonder if that has any weight among Evil, since Bard is technically a Hero? If a morally grey and drunk one.
