*** I certainly echo your sentiment but I want to also acknowledge the fact that the author did just put out four lengthy chapters. Some of the criticism has effected output but the output is still high. I think the choice of delivering these four chapters at once, even with the longer than usual break, was the right choice too.

****** Huh. No idea how to help you with that other than maybe giving a little insigt on why some people read your whole story and then seemingly only project a superficial and negative opinion.

Personally, I'm not good at analyzing a story to explain why exactly I like it. So when a story is very good in general (as yours is) then I often just give some generic praise after reading the last chapter, if even that. Other times I just feel good about having read what I read but immediately move on to the next thing to scratch my itch.

But when something small is out of place inan otherwise perfect story/chapter it stays with me and I want to share it, either in the hope that I actually help the author improve on and perfect something that in my opinion is worth being as good as possible, or (and I'm not proud of this) to have an easy way to discuss an aspect of this thing I generally enjoy with others. And especially if the imperfection is jarring (something that never happened to me with Worth the Candle) I may become passionate in a negative way.

But all that is only possible if there is something keeping me interested in the story in question in the first place. A great thing with a (real or perceived) flaw can be much more frustrating that something that isn't worth my time.

tl:dr ~ Your story is great. Please don't stop.

****** I read through that whole thread. Man I'm sorry it's so emotionally draining to write for an on demand audience. I really like your work with wtc, It's become the highlight of my weekly reading. I think the effort you've put in has created something with great thematic integrity. Wtc has even made it onto my re-reading list alongside Dresden files.

The story just works on a lot of levels and I find my self showing up in these threads every week to make predictions and argue with my co-workers about where the plot is going.

Next on my rational reading list is likely to be metropolitan man since brodski audiobooked it. I generally don't like Superman as a rule, but I trust your ability as a writer and want to hear the story you tell.

Yeah the man presented was disturbing and sets off all kinds of alarms. I could definitely see the end game being that he is something like Anubis in Stargate - a terrifying mistake hurling towards ascension, not entirely effectively opposed by the DM - in which case Joon's true role in all of this would be to put Arthur down.

*** The popularity of your post hopefully speaks to the author of the goodwill from the bulk of us readers and that outspoken dissent is still a minority (and perhaps shouldn't be weighed as heavily!).

However, I'm with [[/u/RMcD94]] in that I'm against name-calling and this type of public shaming for people with dissenting opinions. I don't believe that fosters a healthy and fun discussion forum like [[/r/rational]] ideally is (and has always been, in my opinion). I mean, I even had a very heated discussion with a critic where the word 'stupid' may have been thrown around, but at the end of the day I hope he continues thinking about the story and offering controversial criticism because that's far preferable to a comment circlejerk where only "safe" opinions get constructive attention. There may be criticism that gets stuck in the author's mind, for better or worse, but I'd like to think this whole episode has been a learning experience for everyone. And maybe there will be less frivolous criticism now?

tldr; readers, don't get discouraged from posting criticism!

**** I think I agree with you about public shaming -- in particular, I object to the use of the word "idiots" in the original post. But I don't think it's off-base to call out aggressive, mean, or bad-faith criticism (or just unkind behavior in general). Also, I think it's worth noting that as far as I can tell, no users critical of commenters on past threads have actually mentioned them by name here -- instead, they have only been mentioned obliquely, or by their defenders! So any public shaming that's happened has been of a pretty mild sort.

That said, if [[/u/mojojo46]] feels like moderating their tone, it would certainly be consistent with the enforcement of norms of niceness.

My guess is that much of the disagreement on this thread comes from people talking past each other. It feels to me like the argument has been "this post isn't nice" vs. "you're trying to quash any and all criticism." But, at least in my view, its perfectly possible to be both nice and critical.

The norm I would advocate for is: all criticism is OK, but also all posts must be /nice/. Probably the subjectivity of that last word is where the problem lies -- it seems that my views of niceness are more rigid than some of the other commenters here, and that my sensitivity to tone is much greater.

***** It's oblique but anyone who's followed the threads knows the intended recipient of the jab. And it's fair to expect tit for tat if you're being aggressive. I did mean it as a general caution. It's easy to take "idiots with poorly formed criticism" as addressed to any critic because who's to judge what's "poorly formed" when it's only in your mind? (Bearing in mind that not everyone is introspective enough to play devil's advocate with oneself)

The subjectivity of what's critical yet nice is funny. Besides the headache of discerning tone on the internet and what our definitions of "nice" are, /nice criticism/ seems like an oxymoron. Maybe it's at the root of why criticism bothers us more than praise (as CRJ alluded to). Polite, well-meaning criticism is still an attack of sorts, which may be why it's rare to find many people who can deliver it with genuine niceness.

***** Well it's weird because you said plural idiots and "poorly formed criticism" is not a defence that I like because there's not some objective standard for criticism which means that people who write well formed criticism will never have it be called poorly formed criticism. That is to say it is very easy to say all criticism and any criticism is poorly formed if you understand me.

The author being disparaged by the works probably to me is almost worst because now everyone has to couch what they say because we're really saying here that if you enjoy this story at all, or think there's any net positive then to avoid the chance of a comment leading to the author stopping one should leave no feedback that could ever be in anyway remotely viewed as negative or not in good wait, and yes that includes completely genuine and helpful constructive criticism.

There's no (good) solution here, because an author might genuinely feel that way (even about good criticism). Motivation, especially for creative works, is hardly under conscious control so the solution is that nobody leaves any criticism (for is the author likely to admit constructive criticism kills their motivation due to the social pressure) or for the author not to read the comments (again problematic if that is how they are motivated to begin with).

Being polite and charitable isn't a slippery slope. In 99% of situations you can be direct and to the point and not an hypocrite, and still be kind and charitable and respect the fact that you may be missing something in your criticism. Even saying stuff like "I know it's a small detail, but I wanted to point it out" can make criticism less unpleasant to read. (I mean, I'm not in the author head, this is just general etiquette)

  "people are disparaged for criticism" and "one should leave no feedback that could ever be in anyway remotely viewed as negative" is not thinking more on a subject, it's demagogy.
#+end_quote

It wasn't a demagogy, it was a thought experiment. I took the initial thought (criticism impacting production) and followed it through as anyone here is more than capable of doing. It was, what I thought, the beginning of an interesting discussion on how the feedback of a community relates to a creative work but apparently [[/r/rational]] has become opposed to such things.

This kind of discussion is the whole reason I enjoy this subreddit, and indeed it wouldn't shock me if the deconstructionist main character we're reading ends up talking about the DM's motivation or something at some point.

#+begin_quote
  I am not saying you are overreacting because of your overall theme, I even agree with you that people shouldn't hold their constructive criticism back. I'm saying you are overreacting because of the OP strawmanning and slippery slope arguments you are making.
#+end_quote

You can't agree with me on that because I didn't take that position. I'm also not making any argument so trying to fallacy of fallacy me doesn't do anything since who exactly do you think I'm arguing with?

Edit: To be honest I should have realised the subreddit was different when the top comment is referring to completely to the nebulous "them" and having read the previous comment thread at the time and again after that comment I've still yet to see anything that could be called "mean", written by "idiots" or "poorly formed".

I think its position as the top post and rating are the result of readers being worried that this long delay was caused by vocal criticism and trying to reassure the author in the same /sentiment/ as the OP, rather than just trying to create a divide between "us" and "them"/"idiots". I'd optimistically take it as a gushy welcome back and encouragement for the author.

About the old threads, I don't think it was directly mean or idiotic, but it was definitely poorly formed and many points of critique did lack a charity in interpretation.

Re: your second paragraph, my diagnosis is that this isn't what's happening.

I naively assumed that something that apparently is such a big deal as to be damaging the potential of this story's continuation would be at the top.

#+begin_quote
  I still think Dragons were added as an after thought, because the party needed to be on a train, cause story would not work on an airplane. Every chapter prior to train showed 0 evidence that dragons were somehow a problem with flight transportation\use, in fact helicopters\airplanes were used pretty freely. If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.
#+end_quote

This is the "idiots" (again singular case!) which the OP is referring to? Even though the dragon thing doesn't bother me at all, I don't look at that person's comments and think "wow what poorly formed criticism".

Who not only then goes on to immediately clarify that:

#+begin_quote
  I never tried to insult you personally or say that you are incompetent or dumb, even if i hated the story i would not do that. You do great work writing and creating your world.
#+end_quote

If anything this completely reinforces my thought experiment as being not far fetched at all.

And by poorly formed criticism this is probably one of the only pieces of criticism this story gets, skimming over this chapter's comment thread I don't see a single piece of criticism, excluding my own minor nitpick (which is downvoted at the bottom of the thread, because that's how people use votes in this subreddit). So it seems I was in fact ignorant in my preceding comments, it's already the case that people don't review things critically on this subreddit. A collective decision on my thought problem was reached before I even posited it.

This is true of almost every single story posted here, criticism is never found in snippets, only en masse. Perhaps it's a reddit thing, perhaps it's a human thing, but if you look at MoL you won't see any criticism and then suddenly one chapter gets a lot of criticism.

Also you completely misrepresented that person by saying they were giving critiques in bad faith when clearly they do actually have a problem with dragons they are not making up an issue just to give criticism.

Edit: Seriously, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8bhjwe/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_8889_solitudeface/dxitghb/]] How can you think he wasn't making comments in good faith?

I prefer discussion over non-discussion and since my original comment that sparked this furious debate (my meandering thoughts on the moral obligations of commentary) which was apparently insulting (unintentionally so) then apparently there is a perverse incentive for me.

I can't say I would spark much of a discussion with something less insulting like this comment: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8fxixb/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_9093_headopenshadesbottle/dy7dgg1/]]

**************** Can we not argue all the time? At this point, it's just arguing for the sake of argument...and that never goes anywhere. I think Gilgalad7 already summed up the morals of the day:

- we shouldn't criticize others for offering criticisms
- it's only fair that critics should expect criticism of their criticism, but not in an insulting or derogatory way
- in the same vein, both sides shouldn't marginalize or generalize. You worry that [[/r/rational]] is lumping any critic into the "idiots" group, but you're also generalizing all of us as people who think that way.

Also, I responded above with my thoughts on why the top comment is so popular.

Really glad that they are taking the isolation seriously now after Amaryllis jumping in on her own at first. Her having a session with each of the others gives a good opportunity for character development.

This was actually addressed in the chapter: They know that the locus is dying, they don't know how much time they have to save it, and they know it's not a lot of time.

#+begin_quote
  “You're talking about adding another day on, minimum,” said Amaryllis. “I didn't come out here to retread that point, we don't know whether we have a day to spare. If there's a five percent chance that adding an extra day on causes the locus to die, that's not a risk I'm willing to take.” She was speaking fast, more emphatic than she usually was.

** Very nicely resolved all the critiques I had on Amaryllis going in alone being a stupid plan.

Also, I'm rooting on Amaryllis taking over the world. She feels like the natural protagonist, for quite some time: Where Joon, Fenn and Grak are mostly going with the flow, she actually has an endgame she is working for. And handing the world-breaking super-powers not to her directly but rather to a companion, who is also the narrator, is pure genius.

edit: With this, I mean that Amaryllis is the character with most agency in all of the story, so far. Adding in that she knows that she and her personal history were retro-causally created for the sole purpose of appealing to Joon makes it even better, since she copes pretty well with this potential existential crisis.

** Wow. I was hoping for a new chapter soon, but wasn't expecting to get 4 at once.

A lot of information about Arthur in this update. We have had hints that Arthur may not be as perfect as Joon sees him for a while now, but this really doesn't paint him in the best light.

It sounds like Arthur had been extremely worn down by the constant conflict during his time on Aerb. Given what had happened to him and his family during that time, I think that seems fair enough. What most stuck out to me here was that Arthur apparently didn't know his children that well. It honestly gives me the impression that he still didn't consider his time on Aerb to be his "real" life; especially when combined with the Groundhog Day discussion and his willingness to just arbitrarily spend a few months exploring the pit.

Also, unrelated note but Amaryllis development of technology during that time is to be honest kind of terrifying. They are going to absolutely destroy the economy if they introduce all of this stuff at the same time.

Edit: Also, important question but what happened to all the Cats that Amaryllis creates every-time she reads a book? Is there a tidal wave of cats every time the time chamber opens?

** I bet that despite Amaryllis' statement that she would kill Fenn if they spent a month together alone in a small room, she and Fenn will likely attempt doing so for at least one of the remaining months if only because Fenn doesn't want Amaryllis to spend more time with Juniper.

I also have to comment on how Juniper comes off as a teenager in the last chapter during the conversation with Amaryllis rather than the young adult he's been earlier in the story. There's nothing too obvious, but it feels like he's having trouble dealing with the emotionally charged issues in a way that feels very teenager-like rather than adult-like and I have no idea why I have this impression. Something, something about not being very good at keeping things at an emotional distance?

As a general impression, Juniper has seemed fairly mature and competent when in dangerous situations and dealing with the game-quests. However, he has often fallen short and frequently stumbles when dealing with the social aspects of interactions which is only partially mitigated by the rest of the group being older, more worldly, and are aware that he's trying. I'd be curious to hear if anyone has a different understanding of his character.

I actually tried it both ways, and when said aloud, "sentient square mile" sounded too alliterative - like it's almost, but not quite, a tongue twister.

I've changed it to "square mile of sentient forest", which reads better, since you're technically correct (the best kind of correct).

I really do appreciate the typo corrections, it's just one of those things that I would automate away if I could, because it's basically data entry. (Well, maybe 90% data entry for the stuff that's obviously wrong when it's pointed out to me, and 10% mildly fun stuff like learning new language rules or searching out etymology/usage.)

For example, the form of the idiom "worse for the wear". I can find cites for it both ways (though mine is definitely less common), so I'll probably keep it, since I don't want to just scrub out absolutely all of my idiolect. (Funny enough, you can see [[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=the+worse+for+the+wear%2C+worse+for+wear&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cthe%20worse%20for%20the%20wear%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cworse%20for%20wear%3B%2Cc0][one winning out over the other]] in Google's n-gram viewer back in the 1820s.)

***** I've always wondered about making a web site for authors specifically looking for typo feedback.

Say something that works like google docs. The author would paste their chapter and it would be open to the public to look through. They would find typos and be able to fix them as they go. On the main document that the author sees, the typo's people found would be highlighted in red and their suggestions would be highlighted in green. UI could be tweaked in any way to make this optimal, but basically a few key points: A way for the author to see the before-after of (multiple?) solutions people presented and the paragraph for context. Then clicking the suggested fix that the author likes best (Or pass if they all suck.) and the program skips over to the next typo found without scrolling or treasure hunting. Maybe even allow users to add details on why they picked that suggestion if it's some grammar involved.

Never sure if it would be worth the cand- effort to make though. Immediate problem would be trolls abusing this but there's plenty of solutions to that. Could be fixed by either implementing a vote system or giving permission keys to people the author trusts. It seems like a good idea for fanfic writers, although I'm 80% sure there's a reason I can't think of on why this idea wouldn't be practical.

** The character interaction in these four chapters was really enjoyable; characters becoming aware of their problems due to introspection, and then facing them, is probable the greatest impact this story will have on me personally.

For something completely different: As someone who worked for a long time as a part-time projectionist in movie theatres, I want to point out that these devices are /loud/. Modern digital projectors are loud due to the many fans and ventilation required to keep the projector cool, and analogue projectors are loud for to the mechanical interactions; shutter, sprockets, wheels, and simply the clatter of jerking through the reel. Due to the slack before and after the aperture the preceding and following reel is moving at constant speeds, but around the aperture it's start-stopping 24 times per second. On the other hand, my experience is biased towards professional big screen projectors, I never had to deal with small, home-scale projectors likely used here.

** Oh wow, what a couple of chapters! A few thoughts:

- Wow, Arthur is messed up. He's clearly in a bad place, and has done wrong by both his wife and Zona. The DM said that Arthur would be changed. I think we're starting to see the scope of that. As [[/u/NoYouTryAnother][u/NoYouTryAnother]] said, it's quickly looking like Arthur is going to be the final boss. Since he's been gone for the last 500 years, it seems like their first priority should be *not looking for arthur* in fear of waking him up. This principle applies to all of the nasty exclusion zones -- they're not getting worse and they're not going anywhere, so it's a good time to power up before taking them on!
- Speaking of which, we just learned a bit about how entads bind to owners -- it looks like you have to be in their presence...or something... in the first time period after it is created, and it will be yours forevermore. So it's not, say, that the maker owns it or something. That makes sense, I guess
- Related, I wonder what will happen when Arthur comes back? All of those entads which are held by Amaryliss might become his! They would be well-advised to prepare for this eventuality, and do some research into what might happen.
- Don't see a way for them to get out of this keeping the anyblade. Hopefully they can convinze zona to come along -- she would be a huge asset if she got a bit more socialized.
- On a related note, it's super important to be defensive of Ropey. Although feeding him to zona is tempting, it's definitely in their best interest to convince zona that entads are people and have rights. Feeding another sentient entad to her is a good way to lose trust.
- That said, there's a great partnership between Zona and the crew. They already have plenty of entads for zona from the Prentiss saga. I think they all have Zona's name on them. You could trade her hanging out with them for a slow but steady flow of entads! That would likely be more than worth the loss of the Anyblade, I suspect.
- I bet you a flying fortress would make travel through the Glassy Fields exclusion zone much easier. I bet dragons are not inclined to patrol that area, and I wouldn't be surprised if a fortress-turned-ring could travel by teleport key (or by bulk teleport?)
- I still think that most of the magics should still be extremely easy to unlock. A sufficient bribe to a revision mage, combined with the promise that it's not THAT much knowledge, would probably convince the mage to give a tip or two, all you really need to unlock the magic. With such a huge world, they only need to find one mage who is desparate for money and they'll be good to go. In the case of Skin Magic, Joon didn't even need a tutorial to unlock. It sounds like a brief description from a book was enough for gem magic. The bar for most magics should be very low indeed.
- I agree with amaryliss. The social and magical skills are much harder to come by, and pushing those to the teammates has considerable advantage. Also, who would expect you to be a mage 14 times over, all with ~level 30 skill potential. That would be a powerful element of surprise
- In a real sense, writing rational characters just got somewhat harder for our fearless author. Now that Amaryllis has spent nearly a year in the time chamber planning, every contingency and every concieveable plan should be pretty much figured out. This sets the bar very high!
- I'm pretty surprised that the technology gap is so large on Aerb, now that I think about it. All these dream-skewered, they should have picked up an engineer or five. One in 100 or so americans are engineers, and there were 1000 or so skewered individuals. If they're all from america, we'll get 10 engineers or so (but probably somewhat less if we sample from the whole world). That should be enough for the academics to jump-start modern technology.

*** Kinseys research was mainly based not on surveys, but on a huge body of interviews, which is both good - in that the lizardman constant is a lot lower when giving bullshit replies means you have to lie to a well trained interviewer to their face, and bad in that it put a lot of selection pressure on his data.

By the nature of the process, he got information about the sexual habits of people willing to sit down and tell a grad student about their sexuality, which is.. probably not a very representative sample of the population as a whole.

It also has not been replicated much, but that is mostly because people doing follow-up research just did not generally have the funds or the disciples to do in-person interviews by the thousands. So they used surveys instead.

What this means is that Kinseys numbers on how common various things are, are almost certainly wrong, due to sample bias.

That is not what Amarylis used his research for, however, and on things like "These are types of human sexuality that exists" Kinsey is a magnificent source. Because, well, he and his grad students talked to one heck of a lot of people.

Note that there /are/ no good data on how common various sexualities or kinks are - We have a hard lower bound (1.3 %) based on the rate of same sex marriages in jurisdictions where it has been legal for a long time - marrying someone of the same sex is a statement that says "I am queer" with a whole lot more credibility than any survey, and the numbers from year 10 though 15 after legalization sampling the entire population fairly without any "we have been living together for 20 years and it is legal now" effects.

However that number is unlikely to be even close to the real prevalance, because it only gets those members of the queer community who settle down into long-term monogamy and want to make that a legal commitment, which given the subcultures, uhm, yhea.

Surveys return answers all over the map, depending on how they are phrased. The highest numbers come from surveys that simply ask what gender your last sex partner was. These are the ones that sneak into double-digit percentages. Apparently there are a whole lot of people having same-sex sex without considering themselves anything other than straight.

If there aren't, why not use it for periods of a day (or two), alternating companions each day? From the perspective of everyone but Amaryllis they'd be spending ~3 months straight cooped up with her, though that's easily solved by having each of them spend a day in the chamber alone every so often to recuperate (Amaryllis, meanwhile, would have to wait for 1-2 minutes outside; you could occasionally even pair up e.g. Fenn and Juniper for a day, I doubt they'd mind the opportunity). The transitions could be dialed in to reduce friction and unless the chamber needs substantial real-world time to start, it doesn't seem like it would delay them substantially.

From "Face of the Place"

Using it for a day at a time would give you a little less than 4 days per hour if you don't spend any time at all swapping people. Drastically worse than their current average of over 30 days per hour, although we don't know the precise amount of time spent when Amaryllis is outside the chamber. It's not an efficient use of time comparatively. I would say that using it for a week at a time is the lowest you should go for effective use.

I don't think that they need to be super strict about swapping in order to avoid interpersonal conflict. Anyone can end the time dilation at any time from the inside, so it's best to just keep it running until there's a problem. The only reason to limit it to a month at a time is to do check ups.

At ~4 days per hour you get the 40 week pregnancy done with in ~70 hours (or 280*(1+15)/60 = 74.7 hours, with no friction) -- too bad they're on such a time crunch or this might have been more easily manageable, and bought each of them several months of R&R too. A weekly rotation puts them at 40*(7+15)/60 = 14.7 h, vs the 10*(28+15)/60 = 7.2 h it's taking them now. Though I suppose they might need several years if the dryad emerges altricial (which would further cramp the chamber if companions tag along).

I wonder if the time dilation chamber works on the locus/bottle? Could help with their limited space problems in the future if so (or if there are other, generalized magics that could shrink them or expand space). Also, can the time dilation chamber slow time for its contents? They might have considered chucking the bottle in if so and buggering off on other quests, though that would not have been without risks.

I guess it depends on whether the space inside the bottle counts as additional area for the time dilation chamber. It seems like it's limited by volume, otherwise it would have been made bigger, but it's kind of unknown at this point. They can't test it until they have Solace back either, because the whole point is that the Locus is dying quickly.

I rather doubt that it can make things go more slowly in addition to the function we see here. It seems too powerful for a single thing to do both. In addition, I don't think it would be a good idea to do that even if they could. So far, they've had one party member killed and a few nearly so in the course of a few months. It isn't likely that Amaryllis could carry a baby to term even if the Locus wasn't a concern.

You'll have to clean up a few of those, they're scattered around the rooms, which is another point in favor of my having permanent residents again, I suppose.”
#+end_quote

The more Zona talks about the people she killed, the more I wonder: did she let anyone leave? I don't know how many adventurers made their way in the fortress, if she was taking her time and being dramatic, there must have been at least a few who tried begging for their life or negotiating? Someone could have offered to fetch an entad for her in exchange for the release of a hostage, or something similar. I don't think that's likely, because if people had survived Kuum Doona, then they would have spread the word, unless Zona had some way to swear them to secrecy.

It's interesting that the group is considering the possibility of living in Kuum Doona, even though the fortress has shown both the ability and the willingness to kill them all at any moment. It draws a lot of parallels with Fallatehr, who they were unwilling to have such an arrangement with. I wonder how much of it is the insidiousness of soul magic, how much of that is that Kuum Doona already had an opportunity to kill them and didn't take it, and how much is that Zona looks like a cute girl.

He gave the man just enough funds to build his fortress, went there once and used it mostly as an underage sex slave, then proceeded to never talk about it to anyone ever again. The End.

But seriously, did Omar Antoun even get any money out of his deal with Uther? The chapter only mentions materials and workers. Presumably he was at least fed during the building process, and he probably got a reputation boost to his business (assuming he got it back) afterwards, but still. Poor guy.

We still don't know why Mary had bad intel about Kuum Doona not being sentient; but it looks like the answer boils down to "Uther was ashamed of it", which would be why the place was abandoned in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Things flowed more smoothly once Uther joined in the work; the King of Anglecynn and Secretary General of the First Empire did menial labor on the orders of a man most people thought was insane.
#+end_quote

"Secretary General"? Wow, Mary was not kidding about Uther stealing a ton of stuff from Earth culture. Which... makes sense, honestly, because if you have this immense comparative advantage, why not exploit it? But it suggests that Uther wasn't a very imaginative person; or at least, that he didn't feel the need to stretch his imagination muscles. Also, we know that he wrote a few books on literary theory, so maybe he was more of an "analysis" kind of guy?

#+begin_quote
  It was one of his spare weapons, one of many, the Butterfly Knife, capable of creating butterflies as it swept through the air.
#+end_quote

"Never did they realize the true power of the Butterfly Knife, which was that it could kill anyone, anything, in one stab, provided you stabbed the person in the back while they were looking away from you." Nice pun though!

And I really like the picture this paints of Uther, of this guy who spent so long adventuring, and has collected so many items, he's basically treating most of them like trash by now. He has a dozen magic knives and swords, what's one more or less?

#+begin_quote
  “We could make this place mobile,” said Vervain. “Feed it the portal ring?” asked Raven.
#+end_quote

I assume they did give it some teleporting item, probably the ring. So why is it stuck in the Boundless Pit? Is it because the fortress was built in the pit and is fundamentally tied there? If so, I wonder if they could give it some sort of remote hologram projector to interact with the outside world.

#+begin_quote
  "Uther had solved that problem in the space of a free afternoon by coercing the senators into temporarily reinstating the monarchy with supreme power vested in prisoner set to be executed, a task which he accomplished while the ink on the law was still wet".
#+end_quote

That must have been an interesting afternoon for the citizens of Palmain. Also, you kind of have to wonder what kind of life Uther lived that he found time to do stuff like this, but none to talk with his wife or children.

The magic sword had limited intelligence, while Zona became smarter over time. I wonder if this is a result of her expanding the effects of the magic items she eats, or if she had to eat multiple sentient items to get there.

#+begin_quote
  “I met with Omar Antoun, my creator, a few years after Uther had abandoned me,”

#+begin_quote
  “But with every passing day, I care less about how the truth pains you.”

  <I am a house,> replied Kuum Doona. <For living in.> Uther kept looking at his book, not deigning to respond to that.

#+end_quote

Okay, I wanna give Uther the benefit of the doubt, but wow. If the narration is accurate (and it would be kind of a cheat if it weren't), then the guy became really callous after all these years of adventuring.

  Uther returned after a month in the Pit. His portal opened in the study, blasting wind, and he collapsed to one knee as soon as he was through it. He was bloodied and gasping for air, but eventually found his feet.

That's an interesting point, and something they usually don't consider when writing time-travel stories. I remember reading a summary of a game session of a time-travel RPG; and at one point, one character needed gun skills for a combat encounter, so she time-travelled out of the fight, spent two weeks on a range learning how to use a gun, then time-travelled back to the fight scene. I remember being really... I don't know, amused by this scene, and the fact that these two weeks were treated as a ten-seconds parenthesis and "now you have combat skills!". One of the players told me "well, that's the principle of the game, you can leverage your time powers", but I'm not sure he really got it; and that he got how /long/ two weeks are. Like, after the fight scene, the character would probably have forgotten any conversation they were having, would probably be a little hazy on the progress of their quest, they'd probably be dressed differently, etc.

That it's a single grain of sand on the beach, that the further we probe, the more we're going to see, and I'm going to find that he was destroyed by this place, back from the dead but then scrubbed away.” I swallowed. “Or, maybe, something worse. I don't know.”
#+end_quote

You know, I feel kind of weird speculating about Uther. My understanding is that, this being a SI story, Uther is at least somewhat based on a deceased childhood friend of the author. It's mostly fictional and all, but it's still kind of awkward to say "This guy is callous" or "This guy will probably turn out to be the villain" or comment on the stuff he ripped off from Earth culture, knowing that at least some of the personality I'm commenting on is based from a real person.

Also, I'm not sure what to say about the "Uther had sex with Zona" part that isn't obvious. It's... a creative way to introduce sexual exploitation in a story, I guess. Bleh.

--------------

Moving on, one thing I really like about this story is how big the world is.

Alot of fantasy and science fiction revolves around one community, usually a reintepretation of some aspect of American society that inspired the author. In Demolition Man, the world is Los Angeles; in 1984, the world is made of three variations of an uniform totalitarian dystopia; in DC and Marvel (and if we're honest, Worm), the world in changed by the rise of superheroes, 95% of which are American; in Stargate, every planet only has one town of relevance, within walking distance of its gate.

And that's fine, because all these works want to deliver their message or their escapism, and it's easier to do that with a narrow scope; but it also feels like something is lost on aggregation, like writers are collectively saying that the world is simple, and there's only ever one aspect of it that matters. Which makes me wish for works that say "no, the world is diverse and complicated, and you can't make broad statements about it because different places have different cultures".

I think this is something alexanderwales really nails in his works, and this one in particular; the cultures feel varied, which is reflect both in the exposition, and the fact that the protagonists can spend months going in a new country every week, and still remain continents away from the Empire that's after them.

I never called it incredibly poor writing, nor was I even being sarcastic at him explaining. I simply pointed out that you're stretching a character's knowledge (how many random people that I quiz in the street will have a heard of gift economy, and the intellectual capacity of this world has meant to have been sapped by the alternative routes of magic) and then doing it needlessly on top of it.

If there's no point in having her know what the gift economy is, have her say no to the answer.

I didn't point out his explanation as being an absurd part of his character, I pointed it out as being pointless for the story that she knows that. If she did know it and he didn't explain it at least he would have saved some lines of text.

How many adventurers and magic users study economics in this world? And then even how many economic classes actually go into gift economies (in my degree in Economics I never spoke or heard the words once for example).

What's the purpose of the character knowing that? Are there economic implications we're meant to take away from the general knowledge of economics being much better known in this world?

If you really think the comment is aggressive then I don't really think the problem lies with the precise details of what /personally/ broke my immersion.

I generally assume everyone is ignorant of gift economies. A dungeon master has an explicit reason not to be, but even then I would imagine a survey of dungeon masters would make it rare, but my suspension of disbelief is fine with stretching that far.

I don't know how to objectively analyze the tone of your comments, but yes, that's how you are coming across to me: aggressive.

I don't see how multiple questions can be aggressive, that's how things work, it's not like I just have one question and move on to the next one, maybe if we were having a real time chat. What alternative is there? See that's another question in this comment, I am still not intentionally being aggressive.

I don't think a complaint no matter how nitpicky can be called aggressive. At least not because it is a complaint. What part of complaining about something small makes something aggressive? Can you define what you mean by aggressive because I don't think we can possibly be operating under the same definition? If in reading a chapter the only problem I had was with a single line then if anything that seems complimentary.

And finally I don't know about demanding but yes any information in the story reveals more information about the world than explicitly said. There are a number of possibilities, perhaps the entire medieval world was educated in Economics etc
