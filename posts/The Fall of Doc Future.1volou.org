** Quoting the introduction:

#+begin_quote
  This is the first chapter of a novel I wrote, The Fall of Doc Future, set in a world similar to the present day, except with metahumans. I consider it Science Fiction or â€˜Hard Fantasy'---there are unusual abilities, but I try to treat the consequences seriously and consistently. The main characters are Doc Future, the smartest man in the world, currently having issues with insomnia; his adopted daughter Flicker, a speedster and high functioning autistic; her best friend, Dr. Stella Reinhart, a mind control researcher who does a few other things as well; and Donner, a metahuman rock musician with an unusual voice. It's about 170k words. I will be publishing a cleaned up ebook version at some point, so watch this site if you are interested. Follow the previous and next links at the top and bottom of each chapter to read in chronological order. Enjoy! - WDR

** So, I'm not through yet, but this is basically a realistic superhero sexfic. Um. Okay. :)

[edit] So I've gained a better idea of the plot, and my updated appraisal is "smart, beautiful, competent people with superpowers resolve their childhood traumas by fucking like rabbits." Fun read!
