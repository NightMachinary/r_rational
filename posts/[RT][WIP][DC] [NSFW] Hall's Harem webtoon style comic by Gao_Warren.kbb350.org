I'm putting myself out here a bit by sharing this, but here goes. (Also there really needs to be a flair for NSFW content. Fingers crossed I don't get banned) This is for anyone who wants something in the same vein as The Erogamer now that it's ended (nowhere near the same level, but in the same genre at least (sort of)).

Tw: death, sex, hell, and others that would be spoilers, but if you don't like things that push the boundaries of what exactly "consent" entails you might want to skip this one

[[https://www.lezhin.com/en/comic/hellsharem][Hell's Harem]]

A fairly new story, only started a few months ago.

A Korean man named Han with a /legendary/ devotion to his porn collection installs a *commercial grade server stack* to house and run his collection and promptly electrocutes himself. He gets picked up by a reaper, but his time of death is missing from his file, which throws the afterlife into an uproar. They can't resurrect him, because No Body Could Have Survived That *(tm)*, but he doesn't want to get sent to the hells for breaking so many of the underworld's archaic, outdated laws while he was alive. As a compromise, he has to serve a sentence of a full year at a special underworld hotel.

Here's (some of) the NSFW: every (real) person whose image he has masturbated to (108 in total) gets soul-copied from the moment said image was captured, and for every time he masturbated to their image, he has to have sex with them.

Here's where it gets */Rational/*. They are all staying in the hotel with him /at the same time/. Some of these women have "quotas" of over a *hundred*. The women all come from different years, from early 2000s to late 2010s, so they have no knowledge of any event that took place /after/ the image was taken. Some of them "know" each other (from both being in the porn industry) but are from different points in time. Some are just from random magazine articles or cover photos that Han "liked". Some are foreigners who normally wouldn't be able to communicate, but the afterlife has taken care of that by making everyone able to read and speak "Korean" as if it was their original language (I read it translated into English so meh).

As an incentive, the administrator of the hotel offers any woman that completes her quota in the given time frame will be allowed to go back to ANY time period during her life with *full knowledge of everything that happened in the hotel*. Women that don't succeed will simply be returned to the time they were picked up with no memory of what happened. To keep them happy in the interim, practically all necessities are taken care of, free of charge, with amenities rivaling the best 5 star hotels on earth.

Here's the catch: anyone that tries to leave the hotel gets immediately killed by flying invisible blades of wind, and forfeit their right to return. (They're only copies so this doesn't affect the real world in any way). Also, the quota system doesn't explicitly state */what does, and does NOT, count as sex/*. Furthermore, Han, the protagonist is still working with a /normal human's/ libido, stamina, and bodily functions/needs (as are all the women for that matter). He still needs to sleep, eat, excrete, and he can still be hurt and feel pain. He can only ejaculate so many times a day. He still has limits on what sex things he's willing/able to do, and still has all his preferences.

Hopefully you can start to see how the logistics of this are going to become monumentally difficult, and it's all played /straight/. The women form alliances, try to figure out what counts as "sex" to the quota system, make plans for when they go back, and try to game the hotel, it's manager, and especially Han at every opportunity.

There are currently only 12 chapters out right now, and it looks like it updates Wednesdays in America. The link I shared is for the official release, but for anyone that would like the chance to read it without the hassle of having to make an account to verify their age or earn coins to get past the first 2 free chapters, here is a random sequence of 6 numbers that I'm sharing for no particular reason:

Enjoy!

** One question I have that didn't seem immediately answered was how did it choose which time to take when he masturbated multiple times to the same individual? Like if he watched three videos of someone and came to each one surely that would not mean three versions?

Would it be the last one he masturbated to (so perhaps they don't remember), or the most recent picture of them? If it's the girl in the water I'd be surprised if he never masturbated to a more recent version of her if he was really into her for that many years after this photo.

Similarly applies to when during the shooting they were brought through, seems like most of them were still dressed which surprises me if it's moment of orgasm

I'm going to keep reading to see if gets brought up or if I missed something in the intro video that explains it

I guess it will address the question of what counts as having sex for the purpose of reducing the counter

Also it's a good thing he only started masturbating to people who are over 18 but there should be a line about that like "I had a genetic disorder so I couldn't jerk off until I was 18", ezpz

**** The distinction OP is asking about is "what happens if the protagonist masturbated to different pictures of the same girl".

Does he get duplicate copies of the same girl? Seems not

***** Ah sorry my fault for not reading closer. As you say they haven't really addressed that (yet?). My best guesses would be a toss up between most "used" image and first ever "used" image for each woman. Otherwise it'd be unfair to the other women, since the same woman could potentially get sent to 2 or more time periods.

But that makes me wonder, do any of them come from the exact same source, and if so how would that work? Would they have to both be involved or it doesn't count? Would they share a quota? Would they split "uses" between them or both have the full amount? I guess we'll know more when they figure out what the exact criteria is

Would it be advantageous to her though? I think it would suffice to send the most recent and knowledgeable version of yourself (or the one with the least quota, after sharing all knowledge which might be useful) to the earliest time period to get all the advantage you can, and just forget about quotas of all the other versions. Actually, radically minimizing your quota in this way would be the real advantage here.

******* Hmmm. The thing that would really determine the utility of multiple revisits is whether the histories of the women still in the afterlife would get "updated" once someone goes back. If so, then multiple revisits would give a person multiple chances to "get things right", if something went wrong or changing the timeline had unforeseen negative consequences. However, that's assuming that they're being sent back to the "main" timeline, and not just some 1:1 scale simulation. They're all "copies" after all.

Unfortunately, as far as we know, multiple versions of the same person haven't shown up, so this is all probably moot.

On further thought though, while it's possible that they won't be sent back to the main timeline, there's no reason that all the women won't get sent back to the *same* timeline. If this is the case, that would up the stakes and make the lower quotas even more important, since you could end up in active competition with another time traveler, especially if they share a goal that requires a monopolistic approach to accomplish.

Hm, that's a good thought, I didn't think about the iterative approach :)

Yup, that's how I was imagining it (as a single timeline in the living world + a place outside space and time where the story is set), unless there will be some contradictions suggesting a more complex model. I'd say the quotas wouldn't be as important in that case as returning to an earlier point in time: as long as you fulfill your quota, it doesn't matter how long did it take.

Another possible variant: facing possible competition, a good winning strategy could involve cooperation between a woman with a low quota and a woman with a quota so high that her hopes to fulfill it are low (or she doesn't want to do it at all). The first one gets out ASAP and cooperates with the other one in the living world, sharing profits, and the other one keeps competitors from fulfilling their quotas using whatever means she can :)

********* And then there's also a winning strategy for the protagonist... 1) He can't possibly hope to win by playing by the rules as intended, and 2) dead women apparently don't count anymore => he can win by killing them all (or at least the ones with unreasonably high quotas).
