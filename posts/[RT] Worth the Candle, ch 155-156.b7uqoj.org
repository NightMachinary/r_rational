*** question/comment.

in chapter 68, juniper uses the idiom “earth-shattering.” this is relevant because he's talking to pre-twinned souls valencia, who is possessed, and so (as juniper says later in 68) he avoids all references to earth during their conversation. but not quite!

it's a neat little slip, and it's almost kind of fun given the line it directly follows, maybe even intentional?

but in theory devils who are aware of the dream-skewered, and have maybe heard the word “earth” etc etc could catch on. and that could have had bad consequences, though valencia almost immediately leveled up and took control.

Well, this resolution appears to have been granted by an evil genie. I assumed the intent was to publish chapters more frequently going forward. Instead we are looking at the second month with no updates at all (unless you release some chapters /right now/), only unlike the last time you skipped a month of updates, your progress log shows you've written a little over half as much.

...Did the IRS repossess your muse? I mean the fact April 15 coincides with the release date timeframe you were hoping for does point to a governmental conspiracy!

** Fucking fantastic chapters. Best fight scene I've read in forever. Bethel really shows her stuff, and I love the line "This creature has affronted me." Companions getting still magic is great, burning Money Rath's bones to fight it using blood magic is fantastic, Still Magic 100 for at least a day is great and potentially longer is amazing. These were totally worth all the build up.

I love the idea that Amaryllis is better at climbing than Joon is at anything.

Payoff for the Claret Spear was amazing. Still magic seems exactly as amazing as it seemed to be from the start, and future utilization will be neat.

Only minor gripe is that he probably should have used vibration magic pulses to fight the bats and rats, since it's an AoE attack that doesn't need much aiming.

Amaryllis is probably fine, as she has still magic and the Immobility Plate. Raven is likely fine, as I doubt that she adventured with Uther for years without a way of surviving large falls. Pallida may be out for a while if she dies and needs to be aged up with the time change.

Still Magic 100 probably makes Glassy Fields achievable, since they were reasonably confident in their success when Joon was much weaker than he is now.

Love this line mentioned in the early birds chat:

  [I'll check,] she said. [We're on our way up. Don't do anything rash.]

  I had reached the leg that was sticking through the building and was staring straight up. Mome Rath was enormous, maybe the biggest thing that I had ever seen in person, and I was just going to, what, stab it in the face until it died?

  Yeah, that seemed like what I was going to do.

Not to mention the BIG corpse of BIG BONES ripe for the picking. I wouldn't be surprised if some stat has a secondary effect of letting him stay awake longer.

Even better, if he does take a detour to get Kenner's eye, couldn't he just make its “no sleep required” duration last forever? This could very well be the moment he starts to snowball into godhood.

I'm kind of expecting Joon to get /something/ excluded at some point in the story, just because it's an interesting mechanic and seeing it from the inside will explore another part of the world. Breaking the game and spiraling up into trivializing the rest of the story seems like a candidate for that.

****** My assumption is that as soon as Amyrillis hears what the still magic 100 perk is, she's going to hop into the time chamber, expecting to come out with a build optimized to exploit it to the fullest (my first instinct was "sacrifice woodworking to 100 and build a nanofactory or friendly general AI or copies of entads or whatever the most gamebreaking thing you can do before it unstills is"). What she'll actually come out with is a lot of caution about how easily Jun could get all his best tricks excluded if he isn't careful. Come on, there's no way woodworking 100 in particular isn't exclusion bait. Build ANYTHING out of wood indeed. And we already know that mundane skills can lead to exclusion (farming).

1. Use bone magic to drain/burn his bones for stat bonuses

2. Meta stilling keeps the stat bonus from expiring

3. Use essentialism to copy and paste undrained bones to replace his drained ones

4. Repeat as necessary.

Since previously we've seen that draining multiple bones imparts a higher stat gain, those gains must stack in magnitude, not duration. Therefore, doing this cycle enough times should give him arbitrarily high stats in everything but luck.

Some people on the discord though have argued since there's been no mention of an in-game timer for bone magic buffs meta stilling wouldn't be able to affect it, so who knows if it'd actually work like that.

*** That fight was orgasmic and it read like a fun DND encounter in a nutshell. It did remind me to ask: does anyone else have any particular mood music for WTC? Just like DND campaigns are improved with fitting BGM, I've always liked reading long fantasy works with a complementary playlist that I come to associate with the story. Not in the sense of Pavlovian conditioning (because it was the music I was listening to while reading), but rather like a music director would choose fitting music for media.

For reference, I thought [[https://youtu.be/JYFU_RiefKk][this track was a great accompaniment to the MR fight]]. (edit: plus this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma-WJUidpRU][track from the same OST]]) I haven't found a /just-right/ playlist for WTC in general, but I do often listen to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EWYk854uIs][this dungeon music compilation]].

P.S. I also like the metaphorical implication of Amaryllis being so good at climbing. I never thought about it before Joon put a number to her Skill, but she really is a model workaholic. Glass ceiling, get fucked.

** Ok, more thought out comment! I enjoyed that the core resolution of the "puzzle" of Mome Rath didnt actually depend on still or vibration magic. They helped him get up there and survive the consequences, no question, so the quest goals clearly connected to the (sub)Boss Fight. Yet the actual key was the blood spear and bloodlines powers, which he picked up this arc by...making friends. I appreciate how its these smaller and personal connections that continually make the actual difference - those points being put into social were probably well spent, and it might continue to be a good investment.

On a wider level, its very frequent for Mary to resent Joon for going off "impulsively", and thinking that he has no plan, and I feel like that misunderstands how thinking can work some time. Joon certainly did not have the "suck-bone-to-power-bloodlines" plan in mind when he first started climbing the leg, but he had all the parts in his mind - he knows he has multiple magics, that they will synergize *somehow*, and he just has to figure out the right way. This improvisational approach is often how plans in combat are going to have to work, given that its combat. I think its something she thinks can be "solved" with proper planning, but it actually cant, and going into a situation without a plan - but with the knowledge that you have enough pieces to devise one in the moment - is not in fact a bad play all the time.

*** To be fair to Mary, all climbing the leg got him was two burned unicorn bones and a few levels in Still Magic. If he had waited for an actual plan (rather than “start climbing, and hope I figure out something along the way”), he might've been in a better situation once he got up top.

On the other hand, maybe he wouldn't have been able to reach Still Magic 100 without those levels he got by killing bats.

******* I looked through the full story a while ago with ctrl+F. Funny thing, the same thing happened with Aumann before: "Aumann defeated, level up, quest complete, level up".

In both cases, the enemy defeat finished up a level that was partially complete to some unknown degree (possibly right at the threshold of the next one). Before Aumann, Joon had been complaining about a lack of level ups for a while. Both enemies were decently out-of-depth for them at the time, and the quest objective was to deal with that specific enemy. In that case, the kills might be well-rewarded, with the bulk of the XP still coming from the quest completion - this would be my preferred anti-cheese strat if I were the DM.

Joon's DM would probably also add extra complications to the fight if he tried to repeat it. So even if Joon /really/ needed the bones, I wouldn't expect it to work more than once more without getting horrendously difficult.

Or, wait, the quest completed text said the corpse stands as evidence, implying that the effect is broken, and people can know about it. But evidently, if one /had/ been killed before, the species in general was still unknowable. ...So if the antimeme extends through external references, including Joon's own metaknowledge, where does it actually originate? Would the potential existence of future Momes Rath cause the party to forget this entire encounter anyway after a certain time or distance, independently of this guy's demise?

The obvious solution, narratively, would be that defeating Harold breaks the effect more thoroughly/permanently, possibly revealing a few Mome bodies at certain disaster sites, but, still. I think the information we have contradicts Arthur killing one, and it's about as likely that the conversation with Juniper was one of the last things he remembered from Earth.

But Arthur knew more than just the name:

#+begin_quote
  “So movie two is all about the Mome Rath, this giant, skyscraper-sized beast, one that no one can think of unless he's there.”

  “Wait, memetic?” asked Arthur.

  “Antimemetic,” I said. “Totally different. He's got hair like fingers, he's got --”

  “What the fuck are you even on about with hair like fingers?” asked Arthur with a laugh. He could be loud. Previews hadn't started yet, and some people looked at us. “Prehensile hair?”

  “No,” I said. I held up a finger. “Okay, picture this finger as three links of a chain. Extrapolate that out for like, ten yards, then multiply it by a thousand. He's got a full head of hair, like fingers.” I stopped for a moment as a thought caught up to me. “But like, randomly rotating the angle of each knuckle in his finger-hair, I guess, so that it doesn't all go one direction.”
#+end_quote

Admittedly, Joon, having built the creature up to the point where it has stats and an ecology, would have more knowledge than Arthur, and it's certainly a possibility that Joon is over the threshold of "knows enough about what Mome Rath is to trigger the antimemetic effects" and Arthur isn't, but my personal feeling is that it seems, from just the above, like Arthur has plenty enough knowledge to trigger the effects.

** Amaryllis, Pallida, Raven.

#+begin_quote
  I was blown from Mome Rath's back, my body twisted by the blast just to the point of being mildly uncomfortable and no more. I was twirling so quickly that my brain would probably have been smeared around the inside of my skull, had Prince's Invulnerability not protected against that. I couldn't see anything but blinding white until I was well clear of Mome Rath, and even then, everything was whipping around so fast that I couldn't make sense of it until I'd applied still magic to stop my rapid rotation.
#+end_quote

Let's take votes for who dies and who lives, and how they live.

Amaryllis has the immobility plate. All she has to do is activate it before Prince's Invulnerability runs out and she stops the spin, then can just float down. Her not responding on Parson's Voice means she's either dead, unconscious or out of range of "Parson's Voice, would work on the scale of miles". Which is not impossible, but seems unlikely. If she wasn't able to activate the plate before the invulnerability ran out the spin would have rendered her unconscious and the fall would likely have killed her. She could theoretically have used half of Junipers still magic to stop the spin while still flying away, but that seems unlikely when she could activate the armor with just a thought.

The other two I'm less sure about. As far as I could tell, neither have an obvious method to stop the spin in 6 seconds, which honestly would likely kill them straight out as soon as their weren't invulnerable. And if not, it would at least knock them unconscious. I also don't think we know of any methods they have to stop long falls, but it seems likely that they both have something hidden away, which may or may not work with them unconscious.

So most likely case from a narrative point of view, they all get blown miles away but end up being fine and just take a while to get back. That lets us worry about them while Juniper is fighting Harold, but not overusing the "companion dies when you fight a big bad" narrative too much.

Small chance Pallida or Raven die, much smaller chance Amaryllis does.

*** Nah, Amyrillis won't die, the story just can't let her, I see it as far more likely that she was punted into some wards that stop her replying with Parson's voice. I can also see her being separated from Joon for awhile, she needs some time to develop as a character away from him, she got some when the soul mage hijacked, and that was great for her character development and progression, I can see her possibly having been captured and having to break her way out without Joon's help, this would challenge her over reliance on narrative, as the idea of her breaking free on her own is counter to the idea that this is solely Joon's story, and also give her some time to think about June from a less objective and more emotional perspective.

All of that and I will also be /supremely/ pissed if she dies, like, dropping the book level pissed, Fenn's death was tragic but had obvious benefits story wise, in teaching Joon how to healthily deal with grief and changing the dynamic between him and quite a few party members, Amyrillis' death would serve little purpose but to halt the stories progression until Joon found a new motivator, as she is more or less the driving force of the party, the person with ambition and foresight, even if Joon is nominally the leader.

#+begin_quote
  “Impact factor analysis. It's part of entad studies at Speculation and Scrutiny. ‘Once the metric has been applied to a sample population of entads, it becomes clear that i-factor follows a power law, with high i-factor entads being more and more rare as i-factor increases. <...> However, this difference is not accounted for by distribution of effects alone, and in fact appears to only be fully explained by a combination of usage restrictions, timing restrictions, and identity restrictions. These restrictions occur in various entads at exactly the rates necessary to ensure rough adherence to the power law, despite the distribution of raw effects following its own quixotic pattern.' Translated, there's some apparent force at work which limits entads such that they can't be too strong, and it's /not/ along the lines you would expect.”

*** In Ch 156, is Joon missing the "Double Overcapped" affliction for Still Magic?

#+begin_quote
  There were very few game effects with durations, at least so far as the revealed text went, and I would have to touch base with Reimer to see whether there was anything he'd failed to mention, but there were at least two that I was currently under: the Skilled Trade and Overcapped afflictions were reducing my bonus to Still Magic.
#+end_quote

In Ch 78, Juniper explained that for "The Sacrifice" for Essentialism 100, he intended to move points from PHY and SOC to KNO and WIS "for a cap of 70 on Essentialism", although it seems like he never actually did that, so his actual soft cap on Essentialism at that time was less than 70. Then in Ch 80, when he scraped out Fallatehr's Essentialism skill and "was up in the 180s for Essentialism", he became subject to a further affliction called "Double Overcapped":

#+begin_quote
  Scaphism came with another affliction as well, a point lost every ten minutes until they were gone, which meant that I had four afflictions eating away at my points at once, Skilled Trade, Overcapped, Double Overcapped (a larger penalty for being more than twice the cap), and Scaphism. I'd still have hours of time above 100, thanks to Fallatehr.
#+end_quote

If skills are "capped at three times primary or five times secondary, whichever is lower" (per Reimer in Ch 144), and Joon's highest primary attribute is MEN at about 13 (or anything less than 17) and highest secondary attribute is CUN/KNO/WIS at about 10, then he should have a soft cap of 39 to 50 on Still Magic. (Those figures based on stats reported in Ch 105 and a quick but not thorough skim through subsequent chapters.)

In Ch 156, he started with Still Magic 21+ and funnelled 81 points into it, plus whatever skill increases he had during unicorn time, so unless his soft cap on Still Magic is over 50 for some reason it seems like he should also be afflicted by Double Overcapped (which would in turn also be stilled by Instinctive Halting and Meta Stilling).

I can think of a couple potential solutions, or maybe parts of solutions. As you mentioned, turning Mome Rath's weaponry or ecology upon itself, which they do in-story, sort of. Or managing to completely evade its notice, only killing the Bats and Rats; avoiding the red acid pores; and maybe something a next level up in terms of difficulty in the finger-hair until they find some sort of secret weak spot (although typing that out it sounds very video-gamey). Then Mome Rath isn't so much a boss in-itself but a living dungeon with a different more level-appropriate challenge awaiting at the end.

**** Imagine its hair fingers interlocking against each other in a growing clump that closes down the beast. Do some handwavy tie in to the hairy ball theorem too. You find a badly "combed" point and work from there, extending the knot outwards, finger chains interlocking to shut down whatever those hair fingers are doing for the body or it's ecology. Maybe somehow paralyzing the thing. The monster isn't topologically a sphere, but maybe its holes are where other party members come into play.

I like this because to me "outgrabe" has four weak connotations that work well with this victory condition. First, it makes me think of grabbing, which implies the fingers should be relevant. Second, "out-" makes me think of words like "outsmarted" or "outplayed", the implication being that you've beaten the monster at its own game in some respect, extending one of its qualities beyond the norm. Third, "grabe" reminds me of "groove", eg carving or combing. Fourth, the poem says that in the beginning when everything is good and nice and mimsy, the Mome Raths are "outgrabe". Not "defeated", or "dead", or "non-existent", or anything straightforward like the Jabberwocky having its head cut through and through, but some more specific technical term indicating they are no threat. It's most tempting to see that as implying total incapacitation.

The only other route I can see, if not utilizing either the fingers or ecology or both, would be some kind of self-powered memetic attack. Tricking the monster into forgetting what it's doing, or some such. But there aren't any obvious hooks for that.

*** I don't think there's a canonical answer. If I was running a game like this, where I've got some very creative players with a massive grab bag of very flexible abilities, I'd just throw something crazy at them without any kind of plan at all.... after throwing at least the basic ways to fuck up player's plans (aka, mooks, etc).

MR is a giant whatsit. Clearly the first thing you need to do is get onto it, and you're going to try climbing it, so put some obstacles there. Then, through some unknown-to-me-means, you're now on it, so, throw some more obstacles there. Finally, once you start doing anything that'll work and dealt with everything else, explosion eye beam to break THAT plan. Although I might have gone with a dog shake, or flesh that flakes off, but whatevs.

Basically, instead of thinking up a solution and guiding players to that, block every solution you can think of and then hand your players abilities that let them out-creative you. Best way to GM, IMHO.

The effect of Mome Rath doesn't seem to be as powerful, at least not how it's written. Grey's effect is powerful enough even after your dead and he's long gone, people won't notice the dead bodies (the logistics of this confuse me though).

But for Mome, people will still see the aftermath of his presence, the destruction and death. Even if something is scrubbing itself from your memory, if you see a destroyed city but no evidence to what caused it, you should be able to puzzle things out, like the rats and the sword, you can tell by inference.

If the effect only covers itself and not anything tangentially related, then messages not about it should work, such as a signal fire, or the flames of a burning city, or simply saying "come here."

If the effect covers everything within the 1 mile range and propagates with outbound information, for instance people don't notice phones ringing, letters sent, entads used or see the smoldering ruins of a destroyed city from a distance, then this description stops making sense because this functionally means infinite range which means it should work like Grey or the one in the later story that covers the whole world. Mome slowly wiping out city after city with no evidence of anyone or anything lost until Joon finally defeated it right now.

But if /that's/ the case, the world stops making sense. Wiping out cities would result in huge chunks of reality being jibberish. Books, maps, so many things would have chunks missing from it.

You go sit down and read an article about the top 5 most iconic American cities but there are only 4 listed, strange you wonder. Several hours later you suddenly remember New York is a thing as well as the people there. There are tens of millions of people with similar stories of suddenly forgetting things that would be impossible to forget during a time frame in which New York was destroyed by some unknown force. It becomes easy to figure out what the threat is on Aerb and now you even have a way of detecting attacks; by tracking the blank spots.

If Mome's antimemetic ability is too powerful, it truly doesn't work. It has to be a low intensity antimeme backed up by some kind of communication blocker, but even in that case, a response by the government should be possible since there are so many workarounds and loopholes.

I'm really just arguing for the sake of the interesting thought at this point. I don't mind at all and really enjoyed the chapter.

******* Hm. I'm thinking it's not just antimemetic, but... /anticognitive/.

With antimemes, given sufficient secondary evidence, you could figure out what they do: if you see a trail of destroyed cities, you would be able to infer the existence of an antimemetic monster.

But what if Mome Rath's deal is that not only does it erase memories of concepts, it /prevents you from figuring them out/? In that case:

All references to the affected city/people would be suppressed, and people outside would pick /any/ explanation for the inconsistency except the true one. You grabbed a blank paper by accident, the article's title contains a typo, you've never had a brother so you must have been thinking of your childhood friend instead, and so on.

Nobody outside would ever determine that a monster is on the loose. No effective response would be possible: first of all, because you won't be able to figure out that a threat even exists; second, because nobody would notice a blind spot if they encountered one (except post-factum, which is largely useless).

I'm sure /some/ kind of response would still be possible, by a sufficiently competent government, but I don't think the text states otherwise? Said response certainly wouldn't be /reliable/, and several cities would be destroyed for sure before even a pattern would be noticed.

But dude, this just goes back to my point of reality no longer making sense. If you can't infer it, then that functionally means wiping whole cities out from history, memories, everything. And if you do that, then... then... I can't even.

Seriously, I don't know how to convey how insane that is. Imagine if every iota of information pointing to the existence of New York suddenly vanished. Plane routes, gas mains, pipe lines, internet cables, established infrastructure, roads, political structure, all of it just has to vanish from not only perception but also acknowledgement. Reality no longer makes sense at that point, no alternative explanation is sufficient. Inference of Mome has to happen, at which point the person realizing gets swallowed up by the effect too until everything is forgotten.

************ The main reason I'm going down this path of rejecting this version of Mome non inference is because it spawns more questions than answers. I'm thinking Occams Razor has to apply and something simple is the right explanation.

See, I don't think it's a false dichotomy because the second part can't be a thing, or if it somehow is, that just makes this harder to make sense of.

1) A permanent anti-cognitive effect/no inference possible theory means cutting off hundreds of billions thoughts when they stray in a certain direction every day since every thought that concludes Mome/A thought preventing monster's existence has to be cut. Entire branches of logic must be prevented. This must be an all powerful, universal effect that leaves no trace and cannot be discovered.

How does this level of power match with his displayed level of power?

2) The effect must be this powerful because if people /remember/ not remembering, then the obvious conclusion is something took your memory. Everyone will reach this conclusion constantly. Even if it is simply /impossible/ to conceive of Mome/Any monster that prevents thinking about it, you should /still/ be able to conclude your thoughts are compromised, unless your saying the anti cognitive effect extends to the concept of thought tampering, which just makes Mome even more absurdly powerful.

It should be impossible to destroy a city, leave evidence of memory tampering in the entire world among every individual, and prevent the conclusion of 'something did that'. And if it somehow is possible to do that. Then there's no winning.

Edit: I just realized, logically you have to extend the power to include preventing the concept of thought tampering because if you're allowed to realize that something tampered with your memories, then that itself is inference of Mome's existence.

E. g.: Maybe Mome Rath doesn't need to manually edit every thought process; maybe thought processes are connected to/informed by some universal "space of ideas", and what Mome Rath does is blocking certain areas within that space, thereby achieving a universal effect by "local" interference.

I think it's functionally the same thing as inferring Mome's existence, which breaks down the logic of it all. You recognize that a phenomenon is compromising your thoughts, and that this phenomenon surrounds a small area and leaves physical destruction consistent with a large physical being smashing a city. Even if the two ideas are separate, used together they work to identify Mome and then it all breaks.

B-but there is! The world stops making sense.

OK so let's take the power to it's absolute extreme. Mome attacks and destroys a city. Your dad was one of the killed. When you look at family photos, not only can you not see him, but you glaze over the fact that there seems to be an invisible force holding you up. Payroll at work, his car, everything tangentially related to him is just glazed over and goes unnoticed even if you physically bump into it. No one ever asks about your father because that would spawn the thought "I have a dad obviously, why don't I remember him?" which leads to 'something took my memory of him'. Everyone that gets close to the ruins of the city is swallowed up by the effect and forgotten too. No one even notices the forest fires spreading from the city because that would lead to inference and all burnt land becomes more antimemetic deadzone. Any and all information pointing to Mome's existence is truly and utterly glazed over.

This is what /has/ to happen if it's not possible to infer Mome's existence.

If Mome is this powerful, why the heck is he turning /down/ his power when he gets into a city? Does he just have a really sporting attitude? He just wants to give the little guys a chance for once?

Could intelligently rewrite memories to make sense. In the scp grey story everyone elses memories changed to fit a new narrative of the guy not existing, but the narrative had some holes of unlikely things happening, like the complex being massively undermanned. When Mome enters a city, people just look at it from a far(hear phone calls etc) and see business as usual, then your memory changes to your dad dying from an earthquake when Mome moves on and leaves the bodies behind. And there's no need to entirely erase people from existence to maintain the effect.

Direct presence has the opposite effect? With the fact that Mome is summoned from somewhere, I'm guessing that the antimemetic effect is just part of their natural "biology" suited for a bizarre environment. Motives don't have to make sense here either, it's from bizzaro world.

If it intelligently rewrites memories to make sense, that means it has control over it's own power and how that power is exercised, so it would be a choice to turn the effect down rather than a byproduct of it's biology.

Also, evidence of an earthquake is very easy to recognize. It would be impossible to mistake the damage of a large multi legged creature striding through a city, impaling buildings and smashing it's way through in a specific path for earthquake damage. In fact, I'm struggling to come up with a memory it could rewrite that /wouldn't/ point to a large monster.

The reason I thought the person has to be swallowed up by the effect is because that person would become too thoroughly infested by nonsense that they would become inferant information. A person that visits a city destroyed by something that could only be a large monster who later leaves would have a gap in his memory, because he has to forget what he saw. If he has a gap in his memory, people put it together and we can't have that.

This is what I imagined when you said "It was very legitimately a possible end of world scenario, with the world making less sense and nobody noticing." An antimemetic threat that keeps swallowing up reality piece by piece whenever evidence of it spreads. It just keeps spreading because people can't help but notice and that's when it gets them.

A) Could be memory of /another/ large monster, though arguably that is itself information about Mome, as you are narrowing down possibilities - this is kinda where logic breaks down you're right.

B) When Mome leaves people behind it, they have a fake memory (or memory hole) and suddenly find themselves in a ruined city with no idea of how it happened, with the happy city in one direction morphing into the ruined city before their eyes as Mome moves away.

The antimemetic effect works on induction as well. It might not literally block communication, but it prevents anyone from outside it's zone from thinking about it even in the abstract. You call someone, talk to them, describe Mome Rath only as a large creature that needs to be fought, and the person ends the call with absolutely no recollection of what happened or even the ability to deduce that there was something strange happening. The other person might even forget what you're saying as you're speaking, so they end the call because they think it's just silence on the other end, the words you're saying not even able to make into short term memory.

If what I'm thinking Joon is implying is correct, it's a ludicrously powerful effect, but that's fitting.

That's why he's glad that the Mome Rats have a much weaker effect. He can't notice them, but he can deduce where they are based on where he was hit from and where his weapon takes on a static form. If they had Mome Rath's full ability with no minimum range to the effect, he would be completely unable to think that there was anything off about his health points steadily dropping lower.

*** Still Magic 100 is definitely a game-changer (literally). This virtue and its force-multiplying synergy with Essentialism 20 was the axle needed to catapult him in power to match the coming challenges because otherwise he was never going to get enough levels to reach his caps naturally, with how fast threat levels have been escalating. It's almost certainly exclusion-worthy, were it anyone but Joon to unlock it (not that it'd be easy without a GUI), but I'm guessing narrative armor protects him from this.

Harold's the one whose infected mindslaves summoned MR ("chorus is ripe"). Finch obviously didn't know about the antimemetic MR, but judging by Lartin showing up, he already knew or suspected that Harold was active in Li'o and Lartin was Uniquities' agent on the ground.

***** Thank you. Normally, I'd say that it is a ridiculous idea that the GM would slap down in an instant. However, Reimer did say that there was a massive argument as a result, implying that it was a massive breaking of the system, so there is precedent to it.

The downside is that Joon removed Woodworking back in his first foray into his soul, so he'll need to put it back in order to put any points to it. It looks like this should be possible by using Partial Stilling to freeze only some portions of his soul while editing the others.

I wonder how that would be excluded though. Exclusions always seem to target specific powers or magics. Breaking the game using the still magic virtue involves several different game mechanics. What would be excluded? The simplest way to disallow it would be to just change the level 100 virtue, but, nothing like that has actually ever happened before for Juniper, he's never been penalized for exploiting the rules by the rules being changed. The only times the rules changed were when his mind was being overidden. Other than that, he's been allowed to do what he wants with the game layer.

** Regarding meta stilling, I think its application is much more constrained than we're thinking: it refers to "game effects", and I think that must be something specific, rather than "anything that has a duration in-universe".

Otherwise, Joon would be glowing from prince's invulnerability, the unicorn bone magic would still be active, and some of his demigod capabilities from Mome Rath's bones would still be there (he didn't spend it all against him, since he was still super fast when going for Valencia and the connection was already lost).

My guess is "game effects" refers to anything that has a duration specific to the game layer and which is only applicable to Joon and his companions.

​

I read the entire Mome Rath fight with some Shadow of the Colossus OST playing in the background and it was glorious. I'd recommend any reader to try it as well to really enhance the atmosphere! Speaking of which, I want to believe that Mome Rath also had some Colossus-like weak point somewhere along his upper surface- most likely on the back of the head or perhaps on the nape of the neck, if it's more Titan-inspired.

​

I'm happy that you included another Arthur flashback scene- those have really been getting rare lately and I love them so much, so I really hope we'll be getting more of those as the story goes on.

​

[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen][u/cthulhuraejepsen]] A question I've been meaning to ask for a while is: it occurred to me while re-reading the first chapters that critical hits and critical failures used to be a much, much more common occurrence than they are now. Is there a reason for that? Were the tutorial mechanics just different or is the game layer simply omitting them because they are less relevant as the power creep happens? I kinda miss them..

​

Finally, here's the tentative Joon Companion Power Level Tier List:

​

(in a standard fighting situation with little to no prep time)

​

S Tier: Bethel

A Tier: Raven

B Tier: Valencia, Solace (as representative of the 6E-Doe)

C Tier: Amaryllis, Fenn (as of her last appearance)

D Tier: Grak (sorry, our favorite warder would be much higher under a "with prep time" scenario)

​

This is of course just some fun speculation and doesn't take my personal like or dislike of each companion into account! I'd welcome any further discussion on the matter.

*** Game messages have been slowly phased out in general, for a few reasons.

1. On a Watsonian level, Juniper has more or less gotten used to them, so they're phased out within the narrative because they're simply less noteworthy. They're much more likely to be mentioned in passing, rather than big and bold, as a way of reflecting that. They're part of Juniper's life, and less worth noticing, in the same way that, say, a commoner who got thrust into the position of a noble might start out remarking on all the fine clothes and fancy meals, but gradually start seeing them as background.
2. On a Doyalist level, game messages can get really stale and wear out their welcome, which would especially be the case if every single one of them were printed out for the reader. They're best used sparingly, IMO, as part of the texture of the story, rather than as a literal (and constant) output of the story's game system.
3. Game messages interrupt the flow of a story. /Sometimes/ they can be used to heighten a particular passage or amplify the preceding paragraph, but I think it's somewhat rare, and can overstay its welcome. Part of the problem is the original formatting I chose; if I had to do it over, game messages would be italicized but not bold, so as to be less intrusive, which is something people have complained about. Another part of the problem is that game messages are typically on their own line, with in-line messages being exceptions rather than the rule, which means that any game message will usually come between paragraphs, rather than in the middle of one ... and an action paragraph probably shouldn't be broken up by one.
4. As time goes on, there are more systems in play, more complex action scenes, more moving parts, and more things to be tracked. Juniper has a ton of virtues, entads, abilities, and applicable skills to bring to any given encounter. Since part of the prose function of game messages is to bring spice/flavor to encounters, that means that they're functionally replaced in some aspects, or that continuing to have direct output of all notifications would risk overwhelming things or making them even harder to conceptually track.

However, the way you used them in this chapter to name Mome Bats and Rats was pretty neat, and then of course it always feels very satisfying to receive the notification of a boss's defeat.

As regards to magical entities, I disagree. In Aerb anyone could be described as a magical entity except for non-anima etc. If a magical entity can throw someone to create a velocity mage, then anyone with sufficient magic or entads could make more velocity mages.

Maybe there's an extra clause to it, something like "Magical assistance, in this case, is defined as any active or passive magical effect". So then sufficiently strong non-magical beings could launch people into velocity magedom (they have latent magic, but if they're not using active or passive magic (i.e. phys buffs or entads) then it satisfies the clause and they can create velocity mages).

** I quite like the idea of author-based cinematic universes, although Joon is on kind of the wrong track imo. Or maybe the right track, if he's trying to come up with the dumbest possible. I think you could get a successful one by using an author where 1) no one individual work completely outshines the rest (scrapping Rowling and Lewis), 2) there is at least some consistency in atmosphere and genre, and 3) there is some element of magic/the supernatural (imagine a Miss Marple/Hercule Poirot crossover. Oh god.)

Stephen King would be more or less perfect if he weren't so meta about it himself, as Arthur points out. The SKCU would just be the back half of The Dark Tower but Carrie and Mother Abigail are there. Actually, that sounds awesome. I imagine Neil Gaiman might be good? I haven't read enough of him to say for sure.

However, if you ask me, what we really need is a Roald Dahl Cinematic Universe. I mean, you'd need to spice up Charlie Bucket a lot, he's a pretty bland dude, and Sophie from BFG needs some real character too, but Matilda, Danny(, the Champion of the World), George('s Marvellous Medicine) and Mr. Fox all squeezed into Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as they fight off The Witches?

****** I've known a sociopath though and it was awful. I couldn't stand to be around a mass murderer who didn't care about my feelings or privacy, and even if she liked me treated my friends like garbage.

What about her interests you?

******* She is rapidly improving. She started with /almost/ murdering the group on the spot, moved to the poison thing, and fast forward a book and look where we are.

She does have that one hot button, but other than the Uther issue she's getting better. Maybe she will get over that one too in a feat of amazing growth (or if Uther is Fel Seed, that will wrap up nicely).

*** Agreed. She's kind of a pain in the ass.

** Am I wrong in remembering that level ups refill Joon with blood? It happened in the sewers under Silmar city I believe.

Seems like either he didnt really level up in the temple and something else happened, the spirit thing fucked with the level up effect more severely than it seemed, hypertension is considered extra blood that doesnt get restored by lvls, or a mistake was made and he should have popped like a blood balloon when his blood pressure was suddenly doubled under the effects of blood magic wards.

*** His maximum blood is probably reduced to half while the effect of the Hypertension virtue is being blocked by the ward. So in order to explode, he would have to level up outside the temple (like he just did), then enter it again.
