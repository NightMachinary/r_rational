***** Catherine never murdered anyone?

That's a... bold position to take.

How about the Praesi noble whose soul she ripped out out at the end of Book 2, purely to make a point? And he wasn't a mage, so he had no part in summoning anything. He just happened to be on the wrong side.

Or the smuggler who Catherine forced to kill herself around the start of Book 3, for the grave crime of talking back?

Or the countless people who have died due to her actions or inaction throughout the story?

Letting the Lone Swordsman go at Summerholm, giving Akua governorship of Liesse for political expediency, enslaving the drow and using them to force even more of them into her service...

The list goes on.

Catherine is a sympathetic character and our protagonist, but it's not exactly hard to see why someone would be appalled by her.

***** I can see the case that many of this those murders would fall under the category of "executions."

I can't seem to remember any trials to accompany them, though, so, yes. Murder.

I personally disagree with the supposition that there's a moral distinction between the State killing someone who has been given due process, and a fair trial, and then convicted of heinous crimes, and any other flavour of non-defensive intentional killing. But in that case, I can acknowledge there's an argument to be made that I'm wrong.

On the other hand, I can't see any real argument that Judge Dredd style, on-the-spot execution, where the only legal opinion that matters is the executioner's, can be considered anything but murder. And Catherine's done a fair amount of that.

For truce-breaking, didn't she take out the Exiled Prince under flag of truce?

I'll grant you that the apotheosis is something they don't know about.

If she hadn't given her allegiance to Below, Below wouldn't have Named her.

And while I agree that Cat was left with little choice /but/ to serve the Empress, I'm not sure that the Pilgrim and Saint would see it the same way.

Don't get me wrong, I think the Grand Alliance definitely has a warped view of Cat, but I think some readers are a bit too quick to label it all lies and slander. Cat has truly done some nasty things. Now, whether or not those nasty deeds were justified is another matter entirely, but either way it's perfectly reasonable for people to have serious reservations about the Black Queen.

******* I'm not sure how much of it Tariq knew. From his PoV in "Queen's gambit: declined" we only know that he figured out Black would force the heroes to expect him in Iserre, concluded that the only way the Legions could keep running around were the ships left in Saudant, and came up with a killing stroke that would work /no matter what Amadeus would do after entering the city/.

He may not have known how many legionaries Black Knight would take with him. He couldn't be sure whether they would just raze the place, quietly steal the boats in the night or subdue the locals. He barely was able to estimate when they would even come, because that would depend on the amount of juice left in Amadeus and his willingness to spend it. All Grey Pilgrim was certain of was that the Black Knight would come to that one town while the rest of his forces "sieged" Iserre, and he figured out a way to capitalize on that certainty.

A plague to ensure that they would die no matter the next step of the plan, even if the ship trick itself was another bait. A ten days incubation period, to account for the timeframe for the legions' arrival and to prevent Amadeus from noticing it. A small town, one where the sickness would have the minimal chance to spread and one the heroes would be actually able to purge afterwards. An ugly solution, sure, but with the information availiable to Tariq it made more sense than, say, charging a Black Knight with unknown tricks up his sleeves.

For the record, the conversation you're referring to (the end of [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/25/interlude-kaleidoscope-ii/][Kaleidoscope II]]) doesn't have anything on the amount of times a party can lead a war - only that it's not yet the time to assemble one and that someone would have to die for Evil to retreat for good.

I don't think the party can assemble only for one mission: both villainious examples we have took part in multiple conflict, and the current one can't be declared over until the Dead King calls back his troops anyway. the narrative weight, so far, was more of a rough measurement of what did it take for a given Named to get to the current stage of their story, rather than some expression of "audience's boredom".

“It is going to be a long war,” Tariq whispered, the weight of the years heavy on his shoulders.

“Longer for us than most,” Laurence replied, barking out a laugh. “We'll be part of the five, old friend. You can be sure of it. I already feel the pull.”

The Pilgrim looked up at mockingly sunny skies. There would be a time, after the war turned here and the Red Flower Vales broke, where the Heavens would assemble their sharpest blade. The ancient forms would be observed. Five heroes, sent into the breach to quell the howling dark. Young Hanno would lead them, for the Seraphim had shaped him to the duty. As for the faces of the others, they could only guess. That charming young Valiant Champion was likely, as she'd followed the White Knight before. And there would have to be a practitioner. The most powerful of these was the Witch of the Woods, should she survive her confrontation with the Warlock. /And the two of us/, the Pilgrim added silently. /Relics of an age already past, dusted off one last time./ There was always a price to pay, to end the rise of Evil. Tariq hoped it was the two of them instead of young lives cut down before their prime.\\

***** 'Tariq took the hard path so many times for his vision of one Procer'--remember that Tariq is of Levant, and though he's been striving for the Grand Alliance, what form Procer itself takes is of lesser importance to him, though I imagine he would have issues with the suffering of innocent lives in the turmoil.

** So, I take it nobody managed to take and spread the recipes of the Salutary Alchemist when he was put down for extorting people with his monopoly?

How do you tell which Names are non-Chosen? Has every Salutary Alchemist been doing the work of Below (in the same sort of way or not, and if in the same way then why didn'r the Chosen have records of what to be on guard against?), or was just this one not a Chosen without being able to switch over for some reason?

(The solution to an operating system monopoly is not 'smash all computers', the solution to a tea monopoly is not 'dump all tea into the sea', the solution to a medicine monopoly is not 'burn all the medicine'... Tariq especially seems alarmingly unruffled by the fate of the medicines' recipes and the Saint's presumed culpability, given the extreme relevance for unnecessary suffering.)

((I also find myself wondering /why/ all those non-Chosen went against their own interests instead of even one being a bit more cowardly/cautious. Compulsion from their Name/Role, from Below, from the Story? Or the inflexibility of each Named being the frozen moment of when they took on that name, Vivienne's Name-loss notwithstanding? What does this say for Cat, who has the power of a Named without a concrete Name? A rare free agent while the other pieces are on tracks..?))

*** It sure is funny how the Saint of Swords is so very old and yet in such perfect health, isn't it?

She was willing to kill the King, what makes you think that killing the Alchemist would be past her? People remember the first, and as far as she's concerned, that's probably a good thing. The second's stockpile had to go /somewhere/, after all.

**** 'what makes you think that killing the Alchemist would be past her': I don't think I implied I thought that..? *confusion* Rather, my understanding was that she killed them both, without extracting a recipe first.

A good thought, regarding what happened to the stockpile! From her nature, I unfortunately imagine that she destroyed it, but if so I'd like to know Tariq's thoughts on that.

“I'm your successor,” I finally said.

“You are,” he agreed.

“I've wondered why you have one of those at all,” I said. “The Empress has a theory but I don't think it fits anymore. If it ever did.”

Black rested his chin on the top of his hand, draped over his chair.

“I have been doing this for a very long time,” he said.

“Villains live until they die,” I said.

“Yes,” he said softly. “Until they die. Over the length of my career, I have myself killed twenty-three heroes and heroines. I've orchestrated or otherwise ordered the death of easily thrice that.”

He shrugged indifferently.

“I'll meet someone better, eventually. Or they'll get lucky: it only needs to happen once. It might be today, it might be next month, it might be decades from now -- but they'll get me.”

** /"So..."/, says Cat, in her slow drawl, /"I'd like the peanut gallery that's been standing here the whole time to realize what */I** have been willing to give up for you. That I was willing to kill off the leader of my own band of evil Fae, to create and then challenge a god and slay--at great risk to me and mine--all so that *you* could have a magical highway and avoid getting turned into the Dead King's minions. When it came down to it, I was *not* the one establishing terms or conditions, merely trying to save all your asses."*

** Assuming that Cat still has a trick to pull... Would Black be a possible candidate for the one? Conveniently, the Rogue Sorceror is carrying his soul (I assume he's keeping it on his person, since hiding it is too dangerous), and it seems like the sort of surprise Cat would pull.

Black effectively ruled Callow for a while, to the extent that Catherine was able to use that to pull the sword out of the stone in Liesse.

It depends a bit on how literal the sacrifice needs to be though; Cat probably wouldn't like to lose Black completely. The wording doesn't specify anyone needs to die, so it could be okay (the fact that Cat let the seven listen in suggests she expects them to live).
