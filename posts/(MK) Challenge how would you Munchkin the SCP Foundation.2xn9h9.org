You're not just acting to Secure, Contain, and Protect; you can utilize SCP artifacts however you'd like.


** SCP-verse is too chaotic. Simply can't be done as written.

[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-231][Unspeakable rituals stave off the apocalypse]]. Seriously, don't click that. Try [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1348][this one instead]]. Those were just the first two I came up with. There is [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/ritual#pages][an entire category]] for that shit. [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-093][Every power is double-edged]] or it wouldn't be allowed on the site.

Anyone trying to cook some exploit up /now/ is up against almost a decade of thousands of nerds arguing. Low hanging fruit is already vaporized, and there are entries that actually sweep the problem space. Entires exist defining out things like immortality and ascension paths by having [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-349][direct blocks to any immortals]] and things that [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076][hunt and kill anyone who gets too powerful]]...plus organizations like the SCP Foundation itself. Also, there are certain parts of future history /almost completely/ set in stone that don't include your munchkining.

To top it off, the SCP Foundation is not stupid. That's sort of their thing, in fact. How to /successfully/ contain the items. If there was an easy out, some way to give even a single person an advantage over the onslaught of chaos, it wouldn't have been allowed in the communal fiction space. [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682][There are problems in that 'verse that are almost /definitionally/ unsolvable by using SCPs]]. Things you'd have to solve, definitionally, without SCPs.

In fact, according to some entries, the SCP Foundation has lost several times because of various things like when [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite their huge store of artifacts, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000][this still resulted in the destruction of the entire human species]]. Several times. And the Earth. And the universe. Multiple times. Find more entries like that yourself. I'm worn out linking. Just remember, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-152][it is implied that those problems haven't gone away]], just stalled for a bit. It takes a Foundation to solve* these issues because they're too big for one person to juggle fast enough to avoid /losing/. Almost instantly. And badly. Like SCP Foundation's [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest][more mundane Earthly foes]] do over and over again.

*** This is a great summary of the problem space, and the reason as far as I can figure the best approach is not to do any of those things, but to create in isolation as much utility as possible in finite time and finite space.

My best idea for how to do this is to somehow create a Zeno hypercomputer or similar object that can preform infinite computation, then upload a seed for a civilization and do a variant of a Permutation City style launch.

Exactly how to do this is tricky, but I'd start by messing around with/examining [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-914][SCP-914]] (the most powerful and usefull SCP by far), [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-079][SCP-079]] (just change the utility function, somehow), [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-119][SCP-119]] (to put everything into once done and started up), [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-117]] , [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-155]] (Somone already did this! Also explains the concept. Sadly, it's not sufficient for my purposes, but it's worth examining), [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-158]] (might be of help for uploading?), [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-191]] (Worth asking her for help with some things, if she's cooperative), [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-291]] (to extract brains, useful for later uploading maybe?),

**** Absolutely not. At least, not that I know of. They are also HIGHLY internally hyperlinked and use a lot of HTML tricks for presentation. Sorry.

I would suggest, however, following links to other SCPs when you find an interesting one, as those will usually be of high quality and similar focus. 682 and 076 are classics and a good place to work from, in my opinion.

If you want to make sure not to miss one, simply read them in numerical order (possibly while also following the links). Most of the first <1000 are older than the later 1000-3000 series, and thus mostly a lot better.

There are also some story fics that link off of the entries, but those are usually written for people who already know a lot about the 'verse. Still, read them. They're all by people with good entries in already completed.

**** You have a point. I was extrapolating a little. Let me explain my reasons for choosing this above, say, [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096][SCP-096]], which has a 100% kill record once triggered.

SCP-076 is used at various times by the SCP Foundation to hunt high-level threats (see [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076-2][MOBILE TASK FORCE OMEGA-7]]). He wakes up to fight at unpredictable and unstoppable times and no one knows why he activates when he does, but his behavior is suggestive.

When he does awaken after being destroyed, he kills anyone he sees. Most of the time. What is known is that he hates and despises human beings in general -- specifically, for being weak and cowardly. His only pleasure is fighting the strongest possible opponents in hopes that it'll be a good fight. A rising demigod is the sort of thing Able is thematically designed for.

Remember, SCPs are presented from an already contained perspective most of the time. What was Able "for" before capture, if he was in fact simply a Biblical killing machine? As the Foundation naming suggests, I hold he is a Sumerian weapon of last resort. It's just that the control device is missing, so he isn't aimable the way he was designed, but he still has related goals and personal objectives.

** The SCP universe isn't coherent enough to munchkin. Too much stuff changes from one article to the next.

Sometimes the Foundation casually sacrifices thousands of D-class to one of their charges, or mindwipes entire continents. Sometimes they're a tiny, overworked facility that employs a few hundred people. Some SCPs are contained with advanced technology that ought to cost trillions if the Foundation actually paid for them. Others are just kept in a room with a locked door and no cameras, even though lives are at stake. Some things have been stable for decades or centuries, while others are constantly days from a containment breach that just... never... happens.

The simple fact is that most of the writers haven't read the entire archive, or even the majority of it. There's no Universe Bible, nothing that is universally accepted about the Foundation, so writers pretty much have free rein to make up background details and not worry about contradicting each other. In fact, such contradictions would be obvious if SCP articles referred to each other, which is why "crosstesting" is forbidden.

The only way to read it that makes sense is for the Foundation to be set in a multiverse. We're reading articles collected from different versions of the Foundation, with no rhyme or reason to the numbering scheme. It's not that strange an idea, considering the sheer number of parallel universes and alternate timelines that are mentioned. Some SCPs will be shared among them - 628, in-universe, is explicitly immune to being erased from history, so it will persist across timeline resets. (Out-of-universe, 628 is one of the oldest and most well-established SCPs, so it predates the "no crosstesting" rule, and also it's funny to test every new supernatural weapon on it.)

And since there's no knowledge of which SCPs belong to which universe, nor of how these universes connect to each other, it's hard to say what we'll have available to munchkin.

In short, there is insufficient data for a meaningful answer.

No, that wouldn't... How about... No...

Huh, just about the only SCP you could use without endangering yourself would be SCP-███, or maybe SCP-███. To do that, you would have to [DATA EXPUNGED] limited by the extremely small number of SCPs that have any useful effects whatsoever. To use the classic example, SCP-173 is just a homicidal statue that exudes filth and pauses when under scrutiny. What possible use does it serve that I can't do more safely with regular weapons?

On the other hand, there is at least one tale regarding the munchkining of SCP-914, although I can't find it.
