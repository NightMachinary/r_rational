Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have a machine with the ability to take a cubic meter of any solid material and sort its atoms into a stack of square-meter layers of pure substance, over the course of 24 hours.

Gaseous and liquid layers are collected into individual containers. This includes anything that evaporates quickly in a vacuum, such as metallic calcium. The rest of the substances are layered with each other in an order that does not place anything next to something it is particularly reactive with.

The form of each layer tends to be pure but not monocrystalline, for example carbon forms as graphite rather than diamond, and the silicon metal is polysillicon.

The machine requires energy to operate, since it has to break chemical bonds and does not break CoE, but is highly efficient in that it produces only about 100 watts of waste heat. It can be powered by electricity.

Edit to add:

The device is magic so it cannot be replicated by science, however it was provided by a genie which has agreed to provide you with an additional one for every 1 billion dollars in either cash or equal market value of materials, electricity, or goods as can be delivered within a 24 hour period. (Delivery is done by drawing a magic circle around a spot and transferring things into it)

The device does separate isotopes.

*** What about isotopes? Can it be used to separate out U235 from U238?

If it doesn't violate CoE, it can be used to bootstrap a electricity-hydrogen ecosystem that is truly clean "wells to wheels". Pump hydroelectric power to spilt up ice into H2 + O2, that can power IC engines.

**** Yes, it works on isotopes. So you could use it to separate C-14 from C-13 molecules, U-238 from U-258, and so on.

Using it to turn water to hydrogen fuel efficiently would work, but would take a while to pay for itself. A ton of water only contains about 100 kg of hydrogen (it's mostly oxygen by mass), so it might be worth around $300, but your profit is reduced by the amount of energy you have to invest to get there. Also there would be the cost of storing and transporting the hydrogen.

**** Having the option to get more of them makes it more interesting, whereas turning it over scientific study would probably just mean making up technobabble since this is fiction... Let's say the device is a magic blackbox impervious to study or functional modification, with the dimensions 3x3x3 meters, which you can purchase from a friendly genie for 1 billion dollars (apart from the first unit, which it gave you for free).

In addition to money, the genie also accepts equivalent exchange at market value in electricity, raw materials, or manufactured goods. However, any credit you build with the genie by trading it stuff disappears after 24 hours, so you can't conveniently use it in lieu of storage.

If you had access to a mine of uranium ore, maybe. Otherwise, according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust][this chart]], uranium is present in the crust at about 2 ppm. Assuming 5 tons of materials per cubic meter, and given that natural uranium sells for something like 5 cents per gram, you would make something like 25 cents per cubic meter from the uranium content of random rock/dirt from your back yard. That at least pays for the thermal losses.

Yeah, that's what I meant about higher up front capital investment. You don't need your own though - you can rent it out to someone else.

Even with a uranium mine it's not really worth the billion dollar price tag though. Optimistically, you can fit about 9000kg of pitchblende in the box, which gives you say about 8000kg of uranium, which nets you about $440k / day at current uranium prices. Which isn't a bad revenue, but will take you about two millenia to see a good rate of return.

That's probably an upper bound on the rate of return you can see with this box directly - there are plenty of more valuable elements, but the rest are mostly made valuable by their scarcity.

It's a bit of a boring solution, but I think the most profitable thing to do with this box is auction it off. There are plenty of eccentric billionaires who'd want it, and the big mining and chemical companies are both loaded and better placed to use it than I am, both in terms of expertise and existing infrastructure. Also they'll want to study it, regardless of any claims as to the futility of doing so.

So, do whatever to bootstrap enough money for a marketing campaign if you don't already have it (recycling of dead electronics is almost certainly valuable enough to net you a couple grand a day, so do this for a few months. You won't be loaded, but you'll now have a nice nest egg of a few hundred k). Now do a big public demonstration showing this cool thing you have.

Once people are aware and interested, set up an auction with a reserve price comfortably over a billion, then use the proceeds to buy a new box. Repeat once a week until you stop getting takers.

You'd make a billion dollars every 6 years at that rate. Which implies that you'd get 1024 machines in 60 years, ~1 million in 120 years, etc.

Also, bear in mind that it comes out isotopically sorted, and the price of uranium is known to [[http://www.activistpost.com/2010/11/highly-enriched-uranium-has-spot-price.html][vary]] by isotope.

Ah, you have chosen the Molech scenario. /Evil laugh/

To keep it consistent with the von Neumann machine metaphor, we can say the genie contract is also attached to the box, so it will do business with whoever owns it.

Suppose the first one goes for 100 billion dollars. The winner of the auction (a member of a trillionaire family, with access to plenty of credit) borrows an additional 100 billion from the bank, buys 100 of these things from the genie, and auctions them off, netting an average of 10 billion each. That lets them pay back the 200 billion they borrowed to begin with and keep 800 billion for themselves. As Donald Trump would say -- smart!

Many of the buyers realize they have just a short time to compete against each other, so they borrow whatever they can and make as many machines as they can, each fueling various special projects to produce rare stuff and electricity. They end up selling much of the stuff to pay back the bank, crashing the market for these things (and doing untold good for humanity in the process -- or harm, in some cases).

Three months later, all the countries of the world seem to have mysteriously obtained fissile nuclear materials, and the going rate to buy a new box is down to 1 million dollars. Weird, why would anyone...

In other news, Congress is getting ready to pass a bill to hyperinflate the US currency at the behest of some very powerful lobbies that seem to have sprung up all of a sudden.

*** If you put less than a cubic meter in, does it still take 24 hours to process? If processing time is proportional to mass, you could have a very efficient way of creating otherwise tricky-to-layer substances, which could result in revolutionary new technologies, e.g. [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150814122850.htm]]

Or at least the very fast exploration of different possibilities, which could then be engineered through more conventional means. Even if it takes a full 24h for any amount of materials.

It would be very worth exploring what structures the pure materials produced, have, in case it gets to something tricky, as well as whether that structure could be manipulated via the "does not place anything next to something it is particularly reactive with" (e.g. if the default structure is really unstable next to some other material, then put two of them in and see if the former will go for a different structure). This could potentially result in exciting new metamaterials if there's some highly nonreactive theoretical structure possible.

How finicky is the genie about the "1 billion dollars in... cash" thing? Do they punish attempts at subversion? Can I give them counterfeit dollars, non-US dollars, etc.? Can I collude with the US (or other) Gov't to somehow devalue the dollar and buy up a bunch? If the "market value of... goods" is just how much someone (or ones) is willing to pay for something, can I conspire with some billionaire individuals or organizations to buy my [[https://i.imgur.com/Qdk3vOw.png][fantastic artwork]], recently valued at $1B?

I imagine that the best course of action, as with most prompts, would be to appeal to the relevant experts (material engineers/scientists, etc.) to come up with experiments, and work with the appropriate powers for funding to buy more machines, at least until I can work out a proper monetization strategy. Though "ask for help" is not a very fun answer lol.

*** Isotopically enriched silicon is useful in quantum computing (also very expensive).

The Processing of nuclear waste is both very difficult and very sensitive to isotopic poisoning so the ability to separate 1m3 of waste in 1 day would be of high value.

Ultra-pure metals have industrial applications, and high cost, so this would allow easy production.

The reprocessing of chemical weapons in a safe manner would likely have significant value. As would the destruction of other chemical waste. (after the removal of high volume components).

**** One way to munchkin this would be to produce calcium 48, this has a market cost of about $250k/g and an isotopic abundance of 0.2%. Calcium Carbonate has a market price of about $500/tonne, and a density of 2.7Tonne/m^{3.} This gives us about 5kg of isotopically enriched calcium 48/day. The sale of this on the open market would of course depress the value of the material but if we were to use this instead use it to buy more devices you would be able to get exponential growth. (Just so long as none of the material leaked). This would then reduce the price of one of these machines to about $2000, which might just make it commercially useful for other ventures.

********* Good point. It's basically a private off-books economy that ends up outperforming the global one because its incestuousness ends up being to its advantage. I sort of think there could be a similar economic hack in real life.

If you were to make a small scale factory that mostly replicates its own construction requirements (using relatively small-scale methods with minimized complexity/specialization to avoid labor costs), it seems that each individual step in the industrial chain would /appear/ much more expensive than buying it on the open market from a specialized firm that does it at large scale. You would at each point be able to argue that it is energetically inefficient, slower than it needs to be, and so on. (One of those components could be the solar panels needed to gather energy, which again could, naively, be sold for more than the cost to make the new units of the factory.)

But given the fact that you don't have to sell outputs to obtain the results, the sticker price is misleading; it's kind of like you are buying it from yourself. Each time you decide to replicate the factory, you auto-generate /demand/ for all of its components, and the profit goes to the seller who happens to be the buyer. That means you can afford to just keep turning the crank until you crowd the available environment, which is something a normal business can't do because it has to worry about flooding the markets, the costs of what it needs going up, and other inherently hard to control factors.

An extreme case of this would be a self replicating space factory. You can't easily sell the products of such a factory, which naively makes it look like a bad idea. But you could funnel the outputs to new factories over and over until you have enough that the cost to ship stuff back to earth is a relative pittance not worth worrying about.

*** The main problem with the box I think is that it's too expensive to be useful for producing materials, because refining is something we can already do pretty well for orders of magnitude less money.

What I think is probably the main /interesting/ application of it it: You can use it to produce ridiculously high purity materials, which is a niche but potentially high value market for use in scientific instruments etc. You start with having done the first pass of refinement elsewhere, you shove a cubic meter of 99% pure material into the box, and then once you take it out of the box you chop off the 1% that was solid and isn't your desired material. With a bit of wastage (which you can reclaim later by running the discarded material through the box again) you now have 100% purity.

I don't have a good sense of how high value the market is, so this may still not be worth it, but it's probably the only thing the box allows you to do that we can't currently do very well.

Edit: BTW I'm assuming for the sake of avoiding the obvious boring munchkin that it also preserves all the other relevant conservation laws. You've moved the centre of mass when shuffling things around, but I'm assuming it does that just by bracing against its surrounding environment and exerting force or something.

Well, if you can produce 1 ton of anything worth $1000/gram or more, you can replicate the device in a day. So yes, this is a great idea. (I'd consider anything faster than 1 replication per month a smashing success, and one per year isn't at all bad.)

There are, but $1 billion / box is quite a lot, and a cubic meter per day isn't really on an industrial scale. Also energy is (for the moment) fairly cheap and the history of getting people to pay more to reduce environmental costs isn't very successful.

Don't get me wrong, the boxes would be super useful, it's just that for bulk production you need a /lot/ of them to really make an impact, which given the high cost limits their utility for most applications.
