ISOT stands for Island In A Sea Of Time, and as a genre generally refers to a story about a settled land mass and its people being transported from a more advanced era/world to a less advanced era/world, and the consequences thereof.

What I wish for are recommendations of such stories that would appeal to fans of this here subreddit.

An example would be the be "1632" by Eric Flint, though it does exalt US government ideals a bit to much for the situation they're in IMO.


** I'm quite a fan of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/tzedek-tzedek-tirdoof.50490/][Tzedek, Tzedek, Tirdoof]], which ISOTs all of Israel and Palestine back to year zero of the Jewish calendar, that is, to September 7th, 3761 BCE.

*** It sure is a fun premise. But does it ever become a story or is all of it just fictional timelines?

**** The vignettes near the end are self-contained short stories, but it is mostly a fictional timeline. Some are more story-like than others though, especially the polities that are less straightforward, so to speak.

It takes it very much over the top with modern japan being transplanted into medieval/magical world.

*** Just started reading it. It doesn't seem all so promising, but I'll stick with it some more. Boob plate and magical lack of a language barrier aren't too harsh, but a complete moron being the foreign minister under an otherwise intelligent chancellor is rather annoying.

Moron politicians being given roles for the sake of filling in chairs with someone from your own party aren't that uncommon. Unless Japan is magically better at representative democracy than the rest of the world.

****** There's still politics in those kinds of situations too. Maybe the idiot is the son of an important vassal who needs to be appeased. It's not always just "I'm the King, I'll do whatever I want!" - that usually tends to end in a new King.

******** Nah, I haven't read the manga. I just said that in general ridiculously stupid politicians, while something that one would /hope/ are too irrational to happen in real life, can sadly be a real thing. Though comic relief levels of stupidity are usually just unrealistic as a whole, as in, actual stupid people aren't that /entertainingly/ stupid.

** Would Jerry Pournelle's Janissaries series count? He'll never finish it now, obviously--I've no idea what will happen to the mostly-done draft of book four--but it's midway between what you've described here and an isekai story. A group of American soldiers get kidnapped and transported to another planet where aliens have been taking humans for thousands of years to grow drugs for them. The world is developmentally backwards, so the soldiers are a little outpost of modernity in a medieval society, trying to use their knowledge (and a very limited supply of modern weapons) to get a grip on power. It's sometimes silly, but good fun.

** The "Guardians of the Flame" series maybe counts. A group of college students get portaled into the world of their RPG and become their characters. They have adventures and eventually grab some land and start a settlement where they develop modern technology -- mostly guns, which they use to combat the slave trade. That's not really the focus though.

*** Isn't that more of an Isekai than an ISOT? More on the lines of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court][A Connecticut Yankee]] than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_in_the_Sea_of_Time][Island on the Sea of Time]]? While ISOTs can include no land, see every one where a ship is transported back, portaled to the past is a slightly different genre, I think.

** Destiny's Crucible by Olan Thorensen

Definitely a good read. About a modern chemical engineer who gets sent to an AU with 1600's tech equivalent. The story isn't just purely plot (heres plans for a steam engine, now go revolt against the empire), but shows little nuances and interactions of elements, such as language, customs, culture, and even morality which makes its setting ever more realistic.
