This post is borderline ranty, so my apologies for that.

Sex and relationships play a huge role in the lives of people, and I think it's great to bring in those elements to flesh out characters and the world they live in.

However, I can't help but notice a tendency for writers to write that stuff in a such a way that breaks suspension of disbelief... that I've gone from the intriguing world I was exploring to someone's personal sex fantasy.

If every named female character is sexy (and half of them end up getting involved with your protagonist)? Masturbatory fantasy.

If the MC has an uncommon sexuality, and yet has no shortage of viable partners whatsoever? Probably a masturbatory fantasy.

Now, masturbatory fantasy is fine and all, but if I'm not on [[/r/rational]] rather than literotica, it's not what I'm looking for.

So, writers, what do you do to keep your writing from devolving into masturbatory fantasy?


** IMO a couple of things can help avoid this:

1. Avoid making the MC a thinly-veiled Self-Insert of yourself. Either make them an actual self-insert or make them their own character. Give them a disposition, upbringing, and backstory different from your own which results in them naturally reacting differently than you would to many given situations.

2. Don't have 90% of the opposite gender characters in the story be attracted to your protagonist. This is unrealistic not only for the obvious reasons but also because in real life more than half of the people I know are already in relationships. When the group consists of the main character, one token male character who acts as comic relief, and multiple women who are both single and attracted to the main character I just roll my eyes.

3. Have characters other than the MC be in relationships. "Beta couples" can help you avoid number 2.

Seriously you're not going to escape the accusation of self-indulgence no matter what. Peoples turn-offs are arbitrary and so specific that anything you make will set off someone's warning bells about how you're crafting a contrived scenario to satisfy your preconceptions about reality. They'll probably be right about that.

**** Again not sure if that's really possible to do consistently. I mean it's one thing to try to dodge the bullet entirely and avoid the topic but it's not really a question of execution. There isn't anything more absurd happening than say a genius detective getting stranded in an isolated location where a murder happens. It's just that sex and romance are divisive.

You can put a lot of effort into making your vampire romance novel show realistic human depth but people are still going to call you out on writing vampire romance because it's seen as sleazy and what makes it sleazy seems more about fashion than anything. So for example the most vanilla of vanilla romcoms "Love Actually" gets a similarly bad rap these days for all the unremarkable tropes that have become hot button social issues since it was first released. I also remember when harem anime first became a thing it was mostly slapstick comedy: love interest #1 walks in on love interest #2 and the protagonist in a compromising position -> protagonist gets slapped into the next room where love interest #3 is undressing-> continue until commercial break. Not exactly high brow but it seems to have become viewed as even less savory somehow.

So even if your careful to try to avoid cringe as much as possible by navigating all the pitfalls of what your audience considers over the line there not much you can do in terms of future proofing. (I'm oh so eagerly anticipating the day when the Attack on Titan fanbase realises that the giant naked women crushing tiny people in their beloved series are not entirely...I want to say innocent but then again murder).

So the only real option seems to bite the bullet and actually present what you think ought to happen in the story you're writing and accept you won't please everybody.

** I've repeatedly observed this same phenomenon even from professional writers, from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time in which women are constantly getting stripped naked and birched, paddled, spanked with a hair brush, and whipped, or threatened with same; to A Song of Fire and Ice, in which (in my opinion) George R. R. Martin has a bit of a fixation on castration; a fixation shared by Iain Banks who always seems to include at least one sexual organ removal scene in each of his books, and had one book (The Wasp Factory) in which that was a primary plot point rather than just being a mandatory scene; to Jack L. Chalker whose books always include multiple transgender transformations and scenes of identity death.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIdentityMatrix]]

#+begin_quote
  Victor Gonser, Ph. D. is a middle-aged college professor backpacking in Alaska when he finds his consciousness inexplicably transferred into the body of a 13 year old Tlingit Indian girl. Later he swaps bodies with a stunningly beautiful Canadian college student named Dorian "Dory" Tomlinson. Taken into custody by a secret U.S. government agency, Victor learns that the Earth has become the battlefield in a skirmish between two highly advanced and implacably opposed interstellar cultures who view human beings as little more than animals and use body-swapping as an infiltration tactic. Worse, the aliens had killed his old body. There could be no going back.

  Permanently cut off from their old lives, Victor and Dory have little choice but to volunteer as both researchers and test subjects at the Identity Matrix Center, a secret underground facility outside Las Vegas where a secret government task force is engaged in desperate efforts to unravel the aliens' body-swapping technology and determine which of the two alien sides offers the best chance for humanity's survival, all while "Vickie" learns the ins and outs of being a woman. But when Dory stumbles across evidence that IMC may be playing a deeper game things suddenly take a more sinister turn, because while IMC's understanding of Identity Matrices may not yet be advanced enough to transfer minds between bodies it's certainly advanced enough to make two troublesome girls disappear. One false move later and Dory and Victor's memories and personalities are replaced by those of Delores Eagle Feather (a Navajo orphan) and Misty Ann Carpenter, an extraordinarily enthusiastic (and extraordinarily well-endowed) stripper and prostitute.

  That's when things really start to get interesting...

  One of the best novels by the speculative fiction writer Jack Chalker, The Identity Matrix was written early in his career when Chalker was better known more for his plots than for Author Appeal and remains one of the better examples of the "Earth as a battlefield between two alien cultures" subgenre. Out of print but well worth reading if you can find a copy.

Characters should be their own people with roles in the plot outside of their relationships to other characters.

My general rule of thumb is that no relationship can last forever. Even the strongest most loving relationships will probably start to fade after a few thousand years, if given the chance to play out for that long.

**** No. My response is "rigorously applied common sense" and "human nature". Basically, if you spend enough time doing the same activities or hanging around the same people, eventually your brain will become habituated to them and you will get bored and want to try something new and meet new people.

Also, people change over time. There's value drift, people's interests change, and what they need from relationships changes over time too. Fall in love with someone at year 1, year 5000 they're a totally different person and you're a totally different person, and the feelings have faded away. Experience brings people together and it can also bring them apart. Almost no one stays with their highschool sweetheart for very long at all after getting out of high school.

Probably the reason most people don't understand all this is because they can't imagine life trajectories that last thousands or millions of years or more, nor can they imagine how the dating/relationship markets will be impacted by astronomically large transhumanist population size.

Thing is, humans are more compatible with more people than they typically realize. Statistically speaking, if the chances of finding a compatible romantic partner were 1/(Total Human Population), then there would be basically zero chance of anyone ever finding a compatible romantic partner. It would be like looking for a yellow needle in a haystack. Maybe worse. So barring divine intervention, people have to have a lot more than just one potential partner out there.

In the distant post-scarcity transhumanist future, the human population would be a LOT bigger, which means there would be LOT more available romantic partners. One would probably have compatibility with many more potential partners than one could have romantic relationships with at a time.

Bottom line is, forever is a REALLY long time, and a lot can change in a billion years. You might think you've found your one true love that will last for all time. More than likely you will break up after your first millenium, and possibly even sooner than that. I'm quite certain that's what all the sensible dating experts will say within a few million years if humanity survives this century. And then I am going to tell everyone "I told you so."

**** To be fair wether it's strictly true or not doesn't really affect whether it's good advice for writing about relationships. More relationships fall apart than last 'till death, even over human lifespans, and a sizable subset of relationships that do last a lifetime are coasting on a variant of the sunk cost fallacy or "cheat" by starting late in life or at least one partner dying early.

​

So "no relationship last forever, consider how the relationship breaks up before you start writing about it" can be a solid guideline for writing realistic relationships even if relationships can last forever juts because most won't.

** My first thought would be to simply reduce the amount of detail you include when describing sex and the physical descriptions of characters.

As an example if you need to comunicate that your narrator is very attracted to some woman because that's going to impact the plot consider phrasing it more like:

She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

vs

She was about 5'6", fiery red hair, and curves in all the right places.

​

​

There's a similar phenomenon at work here to how saying "I love children" isn't creepy but saying "I love 12 year old boys" is. Or the weird assumptions D&D players can make based on the DM's description of random scenery. Where the choice of what details to include implies things about their importance that make it easy to read implications into them whether they were intended or not.

** If you think it's hot, save it for your private stash. Doesn't matter if it's for totally innocent reasons or whatever.

A rule of thumb is that a character's sexual side should be implied, or hinted at, and otherwise left out of the story & up to the readers' imaginations.

Unless you're writing porn in which case it should be used to tease and back off, tease and back off, until the climax of the story.

** I personally think any sex ruins an intellectial narrative, i.e. if the story contains sex, then the entire story must be mired in and based in some kind of carnal theme, which is itself a kind of pornographic excercise. Sex should be the main thrust of a story, (intended) or be treated as a "background" character with no lines.

A rational story should /end/ when the protagonist secures mating rights/marries or whatever. Its less a matter of creative skill on the part of the author than the reader's unpredictable response to the material that makes "mixing" sexually and cognitively stimulating threads a bad move.

You'd really have to know your (very specific... possibly one person,) audience to avoid derailing a reader by making them uncomfortable or /too/ comfortable with the handling of such a tricky element.

However, it is an interesting exercise to see how close you can get to being sexually explicit without losing the reader by making it too "____" (insert any number of possible ways you could alienate a plethora of sexualities...)

I have seen it described entirely with obscure euphemisms, if that counts. I don't recall where.
