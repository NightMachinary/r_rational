*** Yeah it is AO3 doing me rotten. I don't know what to do about it, if I use a text editor to remove the HTML it throws them back in. Thank you for editing though.

**** I /think/ that the problem is caused by AO3's auto-formatting, which will render italics like this:

#+begin_example
  He had</span>
   <span><em>malicious intent</em></span>
   <span>, that
#+end_example

And the interpreter sees those spaces that it put in there before the =<span>= there and thinks "oh, there's a space between those words and that comma. To fix this, you can collapse the HTML down, like so:

#+begin_example
  He had</span><span><em>malicious intent</em></span><span>, that
#+end_example

Which usually fixes the problem, as there's no longer a space there.

*** Edits done. Hopefully my find-and-replace macro has solved the spacing issues.
