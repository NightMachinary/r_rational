Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

**** Sure. It's mostly not specific to rational fiction though. (Actually, on second thought I'll wait until I have it up on my website, rather than my old blogger account, should be later tonight.)

** Got a postdoc offer yesterday! At least a verbal one via zoom, nothing in writing yet, though I also got a follow-up email that HR had approved / confirmed funding availability and was preparing the official paperwork. Very excited! It's at the school my wife matched to for her residency (Stanford) and we'll be working in literally adjacent buildings. First person I reached out to, too, and the #1 recommendation of a former postdoc alum from the school (as a really impactful lab with an absurdly nice, life-work-balance-y PI). Also a bit of a pivot from my PhD focus (in Anthropology -- postdoc is in Pathology + Computer Science, doing computational multiomics methods development in a Bayesian, neural framework); chatting with lab members they were all "why yes I have but a Master's in high-dimensional tensor calculus, only a few dozen papers published, really looking forward to taking advantage of your expertise" lol, but they were not dissuaded by my disclamations. Guess I won't be going into industry after all (though the lab has outstanding industry placement). Should be a lot of fun!

Otherwise this week has been pretty solid! Monday we came home from our evening walk to $40 of misdelivered steaming hot takeout for two -- called the restaurant up and they said to keep it. Coincidentally also vegan! On the same day I received a lens (Sony 24-105 f4) for the camera I just upgraded to (a7iii) -- gave it [[https://i.redd.it/o8zbc0own4051.jpg][a quick spin]] and am looking forward to really putting it through its paces. Sold my old camera gear to friends on FB pretty much instantaneously. And a non-centered reparameterization of a model that'd been giving me lots of trouble increased my sampling efficiency by three orders of magnitude.

edit: also realized that this upcoming Monday is Memorial Day! So I don't need to prep lecture! Ooh, and I think y'all would like [[https://i.imgur.com/lJyWCe4.png][this image]] I tossed together for a talk. Still gotta smooth out the lines on the face, but quite like how it turned out!

**** Depends on when you saw a demo build. I kept posting them pretty far into the game's development. The endgame is two technologies that allow you to win the game and a congratulations screen with scoring. There are two more powerful logistics technologies past the endgame ones for people who want to push the tech that far.

I think the versions most people here saw had four "weird things in space" and now there are nine of them.

The last things I worked on were a tutorial and a complete overhaul of the way research works.

My plans for post-launch content additions are one more victory tech, one more regular tech, several more "weird things in space," and some balance changes.

** I'm a fan of mobile games, but most of the market is garbage. I only play games that have a one-time fee to remove ads/play. Anything trying to sell me bonus lives has bad incentives. I also like games that allow me to stare off into space between moves, which cuts down on the relevant possibility space.

A few games I like:

1. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magmafortress.hoplite][Hoplite]]: Turn-based strategy
2. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.aifactory.backgammon][Backgammon]]: The option to put in dice rolls yourself helped while I was learning to not feel like it was cheating me on rolls
3. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grapefrukt.games.bore][Holedown]]: There's a million brick-breaker type games on android and this is the only one that doesn't keep trying to sell me extra lives
4. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand][Underhand]]: Neat little card based Cult Simulator.
5. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roguetemple.hyperroid][Hyperrogue]]: Roguelike with hyperbolic geometry. Very little of the traditional looter-stabber mechanics of traditional roguelikes, but the gimmick is real cool.

*** Here's a bunch I like (may or may not have ads in them):

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.The717pixels.DungeonCards&hl=en][Dungeon Cards]], a turn-based grid-based roguelike puzzle dungeon crawl.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitrome.rustbucket&hl=en][Rustbucket]], also turn-based, and a puzzle adventure. Nice graphics.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.homecookedgames.dungeontales&hl=en][Dungeon Tales]], a card-based roguelike dungeon crawl. Like Slay the Spire, if you've played that.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.sharklab.rogueadventure&hl=en][Rogue Adventure]], a card-based roguelike dungeon crawl. Also like Slay the Spire.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.midjiwan.polytopia&hl=en][The Battle of Polytopia]], a turn-based strategy nation-building game. Sort of like Civilization.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groundcontrol.zhed&hl=en][Zhed]], an abstract puzzle game in 2d space.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemachine.calculator2&hl=en][Calculator 2: The Game]], a puzzle game based on combining numbers using different functions.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cinqmarsmedia.devilscalc&hl=en][The Devil's Calculator]], a puzzle game based on inferring sequences of numbers. More mathy than the above.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevinbradford.games.axiom&hl=en][The Guides Axiom]], a puzzle game where you're given images and things to interact with and have to figure out hidden secrets and answers. Probably the hardest out of any on this list.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olympus.assemblyline&hl=en][Assembly Line]], an assembly-based game of efficiently placing machines to create products. Sort of like Factorio, but only the machines.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anuke.mindustry&hl=en][Mindustry]], an assembly-based game of efficiently placing machines and defending a base. Basically Factorio.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.game.android&hl=en][That Level Again]] (and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.thatlevelagain2.android][2]] and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.thatlevelagain3][3]] and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.tla4][4]]), a series of puzzle games with out-of-the-box solutions.

**** I leave them on, but I'm pretty quick to turn it off for any given subreddit. It's nice when they're just a banner, flares, and maybe a unique color scheme. But a lot of subreddits rearrange navigation elements, break functionality, or even somehow manage to make the page lag. So those get turned off.

I just set up a subreddit with heavily themed CSS and while it's not that hard, it is pretty annoying. Reddit's default CSS has a lot of elaborate selectors that do the same thing. And I still haven't really made sense of the extra CSS that RES adds.

One thing I like to see in custom CSSs is the big vertical collapsible under the upvote buttons. It's way better UX than the reddit's default tiny [-] collapsible. If we do custom css, I would like to see that one implemented.

** I'm writing a serialized fanfiction, which I intend to begin to publish on AO3 after I at least complete the first arc.

Most of my chapters are currently ranging from 10 to 15 pages (4-6k words) in length, but there's one chapter which is shaping to be a long-ass monstrosity (currently it's sitting at 11k words, but I haven't finished writing out a few vital scenes).

I plan to publish a chapter weekly until I run out of the backlog. How should I approach this large chapter with such a schedule? On the one hand, it's twice+ more content than usual. On the other hand, it doesn't sound fair to promise a chapter weekly and then just drop ~a half of it. What should my approach be?
