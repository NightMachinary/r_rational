--------------

Those of you who have been following on the Discord know this already, but for everyone else:

For a number of reasons, I am dissatisfied with Sufficient Velocity. I am also not particularly thrilled with the other popular forum sites. Due to a lack of better options, and also considering that the vast majority of my audience is here to begin with, I plan to continue the quest here on Reddit now that the hiatus has come to an end.

Going forward, chapters will be published to the website and then linked here. "Official" discussion should take place in the latest reddit thread -- though as always, the Discord is an alternative. Once a new chapter is published, I ask everyone to move all new discussion to the latest thread. Replies to older comments should likewise be continued in the newest thread. I don't publish more than once per week, so no worries about violating the subreddit rules. :)

A few more points to touch on:

- There has been a minor-to-moderate rewrite/retcon of the existing story to remove the player-created character of "Legacy." Although elements of this were cool and interesting, ultimately it resulted in significant technical frustrations and clunkier writing than I would have liked, with updates often having to start with "Fi tells the PCs to do things," and them being more or less puppets rather than acting according to their own agency. There are a few consequences to this that will impact how the story plays out. I encourage players to reread at some point to prevent confusion (or at least comb through the discord posts, search for "Currently working on copyediting and propagating edits from SV to the website" and read forward).

- Likewise, the amorphous-player-entity-thing will essentially not exist in-universe except as an abstract concept (Hylia contacted /something/ in the first chapter). The quest will instead move in a more traditional direction with player input informing characters' actions directly.

- The role of Void Power (now known as "Divine Power" to Zelda and Link since Legacy never spilled the beans) will be mostly unchanged. Marks, etc., also unchanged. Players will still need to manage this resource, and Fi still has all the same abilities she had previously. I am however still figuring out the best way to present this information, so the current VP ledger and timeline for the latest chapter is TBD.

- Most pertinently, all rules pertaining to "plans" and "voting" are hereby rescinded and not replaced with anything. There are no rules. Chaos shall reign supreme, and we will figure it out as we go. Up to y'all to self-organize and figure it out. The key takeaway here is that the quest will be just as simulationist, rational, etc., as before, and I will still look to player input just as much as before, but I am making no commitments about and setting no guidelines for how this works.

- There is a new QM. They have collaborated with me on the latest chapter, but have thus far opted to remain anonymous. Radvic is still around and may pop in from time to time, but quite a bit has changed for him in the past few months, and he can no longer reliably commit as much time as he did before.

- Final note: As of now, I will mostly not engage with players pertaining to the story except via updates. Despite Radvic's consistent and very sound advice, I previously allowed myself to slip further and further down this very slippery slope with every passing day. I don't know what happened there, except that it was a gradual boil, and the place I wound up in a mere dozen updates in was not anywhere near where I intended to be at the start. Practically what this means is that there will be no more OOC answering questions or clarifying anything story-related. What you see is what you get. Fi posts however may stick around in some capacity just because they're fun to do.

...And that's all! My apologies for the extended hiatus. I hope you're all doing okay and staying safe, and I'm looking forward to getting this going again. I will make a final post momentarily on the SV thread to inform those there of the news.

Cheers,

Vecht


** So wait, if plans and voting aren't a thing, are we just supposed to say +clever+ hopefully clever things in reddit comments that we think various characters might do? And then hope that one of the QMs notices?

Interesting. I kind of like it? It should prevent youthsuit and killboxes except when appropriate from the perspective of a simulation.

****** And, from context, it sounds like one was involved in an epic fail of some kind. I tried to Google the youthsuit incident and it seems like what happened was that a joke option won the voting, the QM wrote a chapter in which the protagonist took the action because he had suddenly gone insane, and then the audience revolted?

** I sort of just want to focus every power up we get on Link and have him stab bad guys until all our problems go away. It works in most of the games, right? I'm sure with a good enough sword he can stab shards too. It'll be fineee.

And Hyrule Warrors Link could totally handle an army- he's like a human blender in those games.

Zelda doesn't seem to have started her physical conditioning yet, which I would very much like to pursue. Does anyone have objections to that?

Update: Not today. Tomorrow. Looks to be about 10-11k words total.

Was hoping to have it out sooner but I couldn't resist dropping an April Fool's chapter given the timing. ;)
