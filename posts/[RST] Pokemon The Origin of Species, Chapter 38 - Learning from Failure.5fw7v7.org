  His hands move out among his collected pokeballs, straightening each one into a uniform pattern, enjoying the sight of all of them. It's a bit hard to believe how many he got. Hearing the other two talk about their struggles to catch the awake abra showed how being Dark has its advantages, but now that the catching is over and he listens to the other two discuss how they'll train their abra, all the great uses they'll have for them, Blue feels the warm glow of contentment fading away. He always wanted an abra when he was younger. The idea of being able to teleport, or share the thoughts of one of his pokemon, always seemed so cool. The deepest bond you could share with one of your own pokemon.

  But he'll never have that, no matter how many abra he catches.

  Blue's jaw sets as he picks one of his abra's balls up. "I'm going to keep one too," he says, interrupting their discussion.

** I do like how you portrayed Red's newfound heightened sensitivity to psychic minds. I especially look forward to when he progresses to the point where he can sense non-psychic minds as well, even if it will probably start with basic empathy instead of telepathy.

It will be incredibly interesting to read a rational story where the main character can actually sense what is going wrong in peoples heads when they behave irrationally :)

Also, a question; would it be a good idea for Red to bring the Abra he keeps to one of his sessions with the psychic lady whose name I forgot, so that she could actually see how his mind looks/feels when the partition is down? I feel like that could give her, or any kind of clinical psychic, relevant information when it comes to fixing the problem.

** Well, I guess accumulating way more money than they need /would/ be pretty much in line with what happens in the games :D.

Say, with all of these Pokemon being psychic, would it be possible in theory for all of them to link minds and be directable more or less as one unit? If so, forget keeping /one/ Abra, keep half a dozen of them and train them into a squad. Couldn't use it in trainer battles, of course, but they could really go to town on anything you want to catch.

In theory I suppose any group of Pokemon could be given a single verbal command, but I'd think psychics would have notable advantages in that kind of thing. You can more easily communicate an /intent/ to all of them at once; they won't get in each other's way as physical attackers might; they might even be able to reinforce each other.

A few general thoughts, questions and critiques:

1. I'm a little surprised and intrigued by your decision to make all Pokemon only as intelligent as a typical animal. Making Alakazam, the creature that /"has a thorough memory of everything that has occurred in the world"/ and whose brain /"can outperform a super-computer"/ able to... "solve puzzles with the capability of a three-year-old" just seems insulting! There are already non-fantastical animals in real life, like apes, dolphins, some corvids, and arguably octopuses as well that can outperform ten-year-olds in complex tasks. Keeping pokemon a little more intelligent would, in my opinion, only make the moral implications of using these creatures as tools and storing them in stasis even more interesting in a fleshed-out world like yours.

2. My biggest petty gripe is with the occasional non-subtle real-world references, especially to characters or people that are still living. Nothing takes me faster out of my suspension of disbelief in a fictional world than seeing "Professor Dawkins" or "Renekton". The entire Bill and the AI sideplot was unique, but not really my cup of tea when I'd like to learn more about this fictional world and its characters rather than contemporary issues that seem sort of wedged into the plot.

3. Do you, the writer, dislike bug pokemon (or real-life insects), or is it only a characteristic of Red? I ask because there seem to be many hints here.

   - Wild Scyther killed Red's father and all his pokemon
   - Red is unnerved by his spinarak beyond the Night Shade incident
   - The "Insect Plate" in the Arceus cartoon is one of the evil forces, despite insects generally being depicted as courageous superheroes in Japanese culture
   - Red refuses to use a captured Beedrill
   - Red seems to have a general aversion to bug-like pokemon or creatures with chitinous bodies
   - Red blames the "stupid insects" Paras for killing his Rattata, but no similar insult was directed towards the Pikachu that fried his Noctowl

4. Are Blue, Red, and Leaf in some way meant to evoke Peter, Ender, and Valentine?

That's all I have off the top of my head but I'd love to discuss the series more if you're not busy with real life issues or writing.

The pokedex is full of crazy and ridiculously impossible stuff, so I pretty much chuck a lot of it out the window. If Alakazam were as smart as they're said to be, I think the pokemon world would look very different.

But as for why the 3 years old comparison... that's actually as smart as chimps are, in terms of complex tasks and problem solving. I'm not sure what you mean by animals outperforming 10-year-olds... do you have any research papers you can point me to?

References like Renekton mostly just come from me being /really/ bad at coming up with names in my stories, so I do apologize for that, but as for the references to the real world, a lot of it has to do with the idea of teaching "real world science." If I want to reference research done by someone, I don't want to make up some scientist who did the Skinner Box experiments: I'd rather just have Skinner exist in the pokemon world and do them. I get that this can be immersion-breaking for people who live in our present time and react to seeing modern day, living people referenced in a fanfiction, but in the future, when people like Dawkins and others are dead, there's really no reason to distinguish between real-world scientists who are referenced.

#+end_quote

It's a characteristic of Red :) I'm pretty neutral on insects, but I liked the idea of Red (being a psychic) to actually be afraid of Bugs even before he found out he was Psychic. I didn't really consider the idea that in Japanese culture insects are considered brave heroes though, so thanks for pointing that out: I may go back and swap that Plate. But in general a lot of Bug pokemon tend to be very sinister looking, so I figured it worked that way.

I was heavily influenced by the Ender saga ever since I read it at the age of 14ish, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was some subtle or subconscious connection.

I'm always happy to chat about the story, though responses might sometimes be slow if I've got other stuff going on. I normally don't plug my patreon, but since you're new to the story I thought I'd mention that the $5 reward is a monthly skype chat, so if you do decide to contribute that's one of the best ways to regularly discuss any thoughts on the story you might have.

And finally if you don't mind my asking, how did you come across the story? Are you a regular on [[/r/rational]], or did you find it through fanfiction?

In any case, thanks for reading, and looking forward to more questions/feedback for future chapters!

That's fair enough, and it is your world, after all. Stuff like Slugma being 18,000 degrees F, multiple pokemon running faster than the speed of sound, Alakazam having an IQ of 5,000 - these are just ridiculous and prime sources for the "Pokedex entries are written by children" meme.

If it were up to me, I'd probably have the baseline wild Pokemon intelligence be around the level of a border collie, less so for first or second evolutionary stages, but their intellect could increase greatly with training. Special attackers in general would be a little more intelligent across the board, and psychic pokemon would have the highest average intelligence of all.

The way I look at it, in most Pokemon games the wild creatures cap out around level 55, yet the actual cap is level 100. Even a fully evolved creature caught on the Victory Road is just at 50% of its ultimate potential. Many pokemon undergo huge physical changes over their "evolutionary" development and even afterwards as they "level up", and I see no reason why increased mental prowess can't accompany these processes. An average fully-trained pokemon might be at the level of a typical ten-year-old child, similar to the anime - able to understand human speech, possess a typical range of complex emotions and perform a variety of different strategies - but basic algebra would probably be beyond all the non-psychic types.

In my headcanon, many of the ethical issues surrounding Pokemon also stem from this quality. Sure, a wild Fearow may seem like a normal game animal to be hunted and eaten, but if almost every Pokemon has the /potential/ to become far more intelligent, shouldn't eating Pokemon be outlawed entirely?

Do Pokemon have a right to be trained, and thus become smarter and stronger? Should deliberately keeping your companion "underleveled" by coddling it (I just want a pond full of beautiful Magikarp - I don't want to be responsible for multiple Gyarados! / A Liepard is big enough to harm me if it wanted! I'll keep my Purrloin just the way it is) be considered morally wrong, as it stunts the creature's capacity to develop?

I think overall, a ten-year-old human is objectively more intelligent than any of the animals I mentioned. In addition, it's very difficult to get a true metric of comparison to humans by age. Still, there are several papers with points like "this animal mastered a concept that most 8-year-olds struggle with", though they may not be of sufficient scope or sample size to convince you.

Fair enough. It's definitely less obtrusive for me if I just imagine the Pokemon world as an alternative to our own, that still has many of the same scientists and discoveries, rather than something completely separate. I really like what you do with the more modern quotes, as you tend to attribute these to unnamed or entirely original characters even if the quotes are recognizable. So you could have something like:

This is actually about what I imagine, yeah :) Most pokemon are about as smart as smart dogs, to be capable of being trained they way they are.

The question of pokemon intelligence if it approaches sapience is definitely an interesting one, especially since in the anime it absolutely does show pokemon to be fully sapient and even capable of communicating with humans. The ethical ramifications of pokemon training is the least of it, honestly: with that level of intellect, the idea that humans were able to survive and flourish at all is honestly rather hard to believe. But I'd definitely be interested in reading a fanfic that goes into all those questions... I'm just not particularly interested in writing it, since it would massively derail the story toward addressing those questions, rather than the ones I'm more interested in.

Overall the reason I decided to base it on the games rather than the anime is because that level of intelligence just seems more realistic given the pokemon world as we know it. It also allows for exploring issues of animal wellbeing more akin to our world, where animals aren't sapient.

Oh, yes, in very specialized circumstances and particular aspects of problem solving, many animals exceed children's capabilities. Similarly, pokemon are able to remember and interpret battle commands to a far better degree than human children can, and many possess unique intelligence properties that far exceed children's. But as an overall metric of "general intelligence," not just logical thinking but also learning capability and broad problem solving. What makes human intelligence so unique is the ability to learn a wide range of techniques and applications of intelligence, from visual-spacial to pattern recognition to mathematic to memorization. Some animals are much better than kids, or even adults, at one or two of those things, but in general I think the smartest pokemon wouldn't go much further than the smartest animal in general intelligence.

I should probably edit the story to clarify that point a bit better and be more precise with it though, instead of just a single line about Alakazam and 3 year olds :) Thanks for the feedback!

There's something I wanted to mention when I was reading the thread for the first chapter, where you mentioned having limited ideas for character surnames. The author of another Pokémon fanfic I follow (Olivine Romance by Snowden; not /that/ Snowden), when in need of a surname for a canon character, typically uses the Japanese name of said character. E.g., Jasmine Mikan, Misty Kasumi, etc. Thought it was worth mentioning, at least.

Also, looong after the fact now, but you mentioned on that same thread how Bulbasaur was your favourite Kanto starter? Same! Personally, I always interpreted Bulbasaur as the most 'canonical' choice for Red out of the three, not only because of the Pokémon Adventures manga, but because it's the starter Red has in much of the early promotional artwork for Red and Green.

I've always been a fan of Grass types and personally think Bulbasaur is the cutest of the three starters :) But since I started playing the games when Red and Blue hit the USA, the game canon for me has always been that Red starts with Charmander (since that's the mascot starter for Red) while Blue the rival obviously chooses Squirtle to counter him. I broke what I considered canon because I was disappointed by the lack of Green version and I wasn't going to let that stop me from getting a badass plant dinosaur, but I really should read the Adventures manga one of these days!

****** Maybe I should have said that Bulbasaur has /become/ my favourite; pretty sure when I first played the games I choose Charmander like most people xD

I loved the Red & Blue, and Yellow Sagas of the Adventures manga, but haven't read further than that. Lots of the ideas were really fun, like different breeds of Arbok having unique traits (e.g. healing factors) and "psychics"(?) able to heal and understand Pokemon via touch. Not much in the way of explanations, though.... I could probably go on about every cool thing that happened in those parts of the manga, but maybe here isn't the time and place.

Paleontologically speaking, I favour the description of Bulbasaur as a dicynodont -- warm-blooded reptile-like animal related to the ancestors of mammals. But there is a lot of room for interpretation there.

Makes sense. I always saw bulbasaur as more of a frog, or just some amphibian/lizard, with a plant growing in its back, the higher evolutions, certainly.

Should be "penetrates".

Not in italics like the surrounding paragraphs.

  Red scowled. "You can't just emphasize a word and repeat the question as if that changes the answer."
#+end_quote

Same as above.

Actually, on looking more carefully it seems to be intentional. A lot of Red's actions in that flashback section are unitalicised. Since they're also in past tense, it creates a confusing effect (flashback tense but present lack-of-italics).

I'd suggest moving them all into the present tense and italicising the hallucinated/remembered dialogue and actions.
