** This has some good bits, but overall I can't agree with the methods of the post... at all. This is pure guesswork not based on any conclusive evidence, and (in)conveniently not explaining some critical issues. For example, why is Tetra deemed a smokescreen and Abnazia the culprit? There is no solid evidence for ruling out the former.

Similarly,

#+begin_quote
  It is pretty clear that imperial artifact was used
#+end_quote

No, it's not. It could be a function of the marker, that RR had the know-how to use. Then, it could be another artifact, since we have 2 more unknown to us. But that's nitpicking.

The real issue is that this theory ignores a major factor: divinity. The gate and the 5 relics are divine artifacts made by the gods themselves, and later most likely entrusted to the angels. Evidence for that? Apart from being a mythical feat of magic on its own (recreating the world and running it for thousands months), we know now that the gate is feeding on the power of a primordial. Only the gods had the power to transform their foe's body (so to speak), into something really useful.

This brings us to the /purpose/ of the gate. It is not, as you may think, to train lucky individuals. The gods get a lot of shit in the story, portrayed as capricious and fickle, but if you look at their major accomplishments, they are clearly on the good side: created the habitable world out of initial chaos (whether the Dragon below is a mythical allegory or was an actual being is not really relevant), then proceeded to eliminate extinction threats until none was left (the primordials). Now, we know that these accomplishments can be undone. Primordials can be released back. So it is probable that gods also knew this and tried to devise mechanisms to prevent such major fuck-ups. Enter Sovereign Gate. Yeah, it can be activated only once in 400 years. Not a coincidence that the primordial jailbreak window /also/ happens once in 400 years.

Why the loop controller is a human? That's trivial! The spirit realm doesn't work in the gate, duh! Also if the gods foresaw their silence, double duh. In order to /prevent/ the jailbreak the gods have to choose a champion, put him in the gate and enjoy their champion getting buffed AF and never letting the catastrophe happen. Any benefits the champion has afterwards are, well, a proper reward for saving literally millions.

The divine factor is confirmed by the latest chapter. Zach has a divine blessing. Zach's family was in possession of the Gate. I can not agree that some rando shmuck activated the gate nilly-willy for his personal *destructive* goal. The gate was activated for Zach, by a (largely) benevolent divine force. Zorian and RR are unexpected noise in the system.

*** I feel the same way. The gate (and its required artifacts) seem like an automatic failsafe to prevent Primordial incursions. The royal family had no clue how to activate the gate, and it hasn't been activated since Shutur-Tarana founded the Ikosian empire, which was at least 2000 years ago.

There have been multiple planar convergences since then, but no godlike mages.

#+begin_quote
  "The Controller is marked by the Key, by the Maker, or by its agents," the Guardian said. "I am not aware of what criteria were used in choosing any particular Controller. It is ultimately irrelevant to my purpose to know such things."

  "But the Key is lost," Zach said, frowning. "Scattered across vast distances. And if the Maker is a god like you suspect he is, well... the gods have been silent for centuries. That only leaves his agents. Who would that be?"
#+end_quote

The maker has to be a god (given the gate was made out of a primordial), the key was separated and unusable before the time loop, and the agents are likely angels.

I'm pretty sure it looks into the future before a convergence, detects whether someone will try to release a primordial, then picks someone who has several traits.

1) Large mana reserves (which it then amplifies), which the time loop provides enough time to gain more control of. (but a divine blessing likely helps with control, as well.)

2) General good nature (unlikely to want the world ended, anyway.) Zach tried to get to know almost everyone at the Cyorian mage college, and generally hates being alone.

3) Locally based (so they know where to start looking, and have more reason to prevent the primordial being released.)

The major problem with this theory is that the gate triggered early, resulting in fewer loops. That was confirmed by the Guardian of the Threshold. If it's designed to detect and prevent a primordial being released, why would it be designed to trigger on the actual day of the planar convergence? That leaves too little time to loop, especially as the biggest expenditure involved is ending and restarting a loop, not keeping it going.

I guess that could be due to an angel trying to do the work of a god, and messing up. The max time the gate can operate at is capped at a month (due to ethical reasons), so I suppose the gate could copy the state of the world a month before the planar convergence, and use that state when triggering later, but maybe that requires a god to do, and the gate/angels are more limited?

**** Yup, pretty hit the nail on the head here about divining what happens during upcoming planar alignment and activating the gate if something suspicious shows up.

The premature activation may be not a mistake but intentional instead. Sure, it cuts down on the number of available restarts (how much, by the way?) but on the other hand it allows the controller to be buffed as early as possible. Suppose the gate was activated 1 day before the aligment. Sure, Zach now has, let's say, 10,000 months inside the loop. But he has *one day* to fight the invasion in the real world, and that is all that matters. One day is simply not enough to persuade and mobilize anybody, to craft golems and steal whatever artifacts you want for the mission and so on. It is clearly sub-optimal to activate the gate that late. Given the choice I would definitely take the option with less restarts, but more time to prepare in the one timeline that /actually matters/.

Except the main expenditure of the gate is recreating the world. The thirty day limit is purely for moral reasons, not anything else.

#+begin_quote
  "Wait," frowned Zorian. "So the time loop spends power per iteration, not according to how much time passes?" "Yes," the Guardian confirmed.
#+end_quote

The total amount of time in the loop is based on the *number of restarts.*

Having a one day loop would result in far less time available in the loop. A two day loop would be slightly better, a three day loop better than it, and so on.

So it doesn't make sense that the loop was activated "early" if it's intended to stop the primordial. "Early" is the only way you'll have time to do anything!

But the Guardian of the Threshold *said* it was activated early. The *intended* time was the planar convergence.

#+begin_quote
  "The time loop is normally supposed to be initiated at the peak of planetary alignment," the Guardian explained. "Unfortunately, something seems to have gone wrong and the time loop has been activated one month prior to it. This made everything more costly, causing the time loop to degrade far more rapidly than it is supposed to."
#+end_quote

Given what we know of the gate's mechanics, that makes no sense if its function is to stop primordials being released.

Which means one of three things to me:

1) The gate isn't meant to stop Primordials.

2) The main function is just to "create an uber mage" to whoever activates the gate (likely with the full set of keys), and the automatic "stop primordials" feature is just backup. The guardian is too stupid (or designed not to give away info, as we've seen), so it doesn't mention this.

3) The gods used to be able to copy the state of the world 30 days before the time loop, then wait until near the convergence to activate the loop using the saved state. The angels can't do this, so they activated the loop early.

The problem with this idea is that it would leave almost no time to prepare once the looper left the loop--they'd leave near the time the primordial was being released.

****** Good point, but there are more possible scenarios:

4) The efficiency of the loop rises quicker than the amount of days left until convergence drops, so the number of days spent may still rise. Maybe the loop is capable of millions of restarts at its peak.

5) The simulation is not technically bound to end with the primordial release, so the controller can train after the release. Inconvenient but doable and the inconvenience may be worth extra 700 years of training for some controllers.

#+begin_quote
  The intended time was the planar convergence.
#+end_quote

The gate is a tool. The intended time of activation is when the Maker decides it serves the purpose best, and the guardian specifically stated that he has no clue as to what the purpose is. That is "between the Maker and the Controller".

******* I would also focus on the why of the Gate's existence. Maybe the Gods created the Gate to periodically drain the energy of the Primordial who was turned into the parallel world. The fact that the Gate creates an ubermage could be a honeytrap to ensure the Primordial stays weak. An interesting feature is that all Primordial prisons are connected to the parallel world. Maybe this means that all the restarts are doing is draining all the Primordials of energy. I mean resetting an entire Universe several millions of times would take an enormous amount of energy.

This assumes that skipping a few Gate activations is fine as the last one must have been 4-5 missed ones before this. Although the last ubermage stayed inside 11 lifetimes which would turn a lot of people insane. Maybe the the last few branded individuals only stayed 1-2 lifetimes. As QI is 1000 years old (about 11 lifetimes at 85 years per lifetime) and still only a demigod means that there are some diminishing returns on molding exercises/spell research.

I agree that someone with access to the Sovereign Gate in the real world is needed so that Zach could have initially entered the Gate. But that could just be the entity that gave Zach the blessing sneaking him in.

***** Your argument is a wishful thinking/assumption as much as is mine. We know for sure, that 400 year alignment is the best time for both summoning and both activating the gate. You base your argument on assumption that primordials can escape dimension permanently? It hold less ground if primordials at best can escape jail temporary during the time then dimension walls/anchor/whatever is holding them least, but they are back in jail. If the gods bothered enough them to jail, they might have as well bothered to jail them permanently so they don't have to do the same stuff ever again.

Also, as very well pulled a lot of the relevant facts by SpeculativeFiction: gate can be activated by controller who either:

has full key (which is impossible) is either marked by maker (god) or its agents - angels. Marking here is the divine blessing. Yes, Zach has got that blessing, but he had it already when he started at academy - so it quite a long time ago. Saying that divine agents forecasted/divined this situation couple years ago and chose Zach as one of the agents is.... thin. The counter argument might be that they blessed couple people just in case in advance might hold some water, but is very thin as well. According to the QI, pretty much the only people with divine blessings are the high tier priests/etc. If there's divine intervention, why put some immature boy, why not put high profile priest with huge weight to remediate situation during the loop?

When gate is activated, controller gets soul marker and is put into loop.

It is my argument why Zach was used as an anchor because the conspirator prince was lacking the key, he was not sure he would be able to manipulate any other high priest after getting him into starting the gate - Zach was a very convenient solution for his problem.

Not true.

Or rather it can be true, but you can't have data on this. Mana magnitude is measured in magic missiles. Zach (and Zorian) did not measure their mana before their first class in battle magic (or whatever that class where they got to fire magic missile rod was). Zorian did not know his mana reserves before chapter 2, and there is no indication Zach did, especially considering his lack of academic success.

Why does it matter if the controller has 1000 restarts (80 years!) to mature in the loop. Unless you throw in an old geezer, the time within the loop outweighs all prior experience. And that's not to say that Zach is nobody. High nobility, wealthy, high natural mana reserves, not evil or corrupt, friendly and outgoing. He was a shitty mage, but that's exactly the flaw the loop can eliminate.

******* chapter 62, exact quote: "Ha. Well, it's not just that," Zach said. "The fact I was able to keep up with the academy curriculum at all, even before the time loop, pretty much shuts down the theory I'm just lucky. I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too... convenient to be natural."

if the SG is started at correct time, most likely it would have 10000 restarts. This, of course would help mature. But it's like hoping that each and every child would mature in nice manner (especially within environment with no consequences).

And you are telling that (im)mature child has better chances to overthrow conspiracy than high respected priest according to divine intervention? I'm not much impressed by such conjecture. What the child lacks (which is very well illustrated why they use Xvim to get knowledge from other mages) is weight and he can never get it during one month.

He was a magnitude 25 before the loop, so his shaping ability is consistent. His mana reserves were unknown at that time. Once discovered this presented a mystery how he was able to shape like magnitude 25 while being mag 50, but it was possible either way, with a blessing given before the loop and without one.

********** Sigh.

There are two components here. Mana shaping ability and mana reserves, that are the inverse of each other. Zach's mana shaping ability is always a constant, corresponding to his natural level, mag25. The question here when his mana reserves were discovered, and when it became obvious that there is a *discrepancy* between his shaping level and his mana actual reserves.

Consider these two scenarios: Zach is given the blessing at birth and Zach is given the blessing at the start of this school year. This quote fits perfectly both scenarios. In both he is shaping on par with mag25 and in both he discovers his real mana reserves while already in the loop.

Therefore you can not assert that Zach was given the blessing at birth and not when the gate was activated.

And the leaflet Zorian picked up suggest that average mages can fire of 8-12 missiles before running out of mana. People at talking about magnitude, but I can't recall anyone capacity test just to measure capacity. And it seems your assumption is that because combat training starts at year 3 Zach never had an opportunity to measure his mana pool.

When zorian made some puzzles for Kirille, he taught her how to use her mana and she ran on some occasions out of mana IIRC. So I'm pretty sure there were some tests done on the first years which would drain one's mana and would measure capacity. It's just we didn't see any. But I'd laugh if anyone seriously told me that neither academy nor students themselves were not interested in one's capacity until the third year.

I'd say this is pretty good indication that Zach actually knew about his pool size and thus he knows what he's talking about.

**** We know very little about primordials. If I'd state that gods bounded primordials to their dimensional prisons with a similar spell like anchored teleport Zorian is using I can be as right or as wrong as you are.

If the kids (humanity or whatnot) feels like they want to take on primordial for some time, gods are not interfering with that - it will be pulled back into prison with that anchor anyway after some period of time.

It is very unlikely that people didn't attempt to free primordials from their prisons before (look at the shifters and their usage of primordial essence) and you don't see any wandering primordials - they are all tucked into prisons.

The priests in Cyoria [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26/Mother-of-Learning][told]] Zorian that primordials, when released, do not eventually get unsummoned, because they're native to the plane.

#+begin_quote
  "But wait," Zorian said. "If primordials are not spirits, but some kind of strange magical creature, how are the attackers planning to summon one?" asked Zorian.

  They don't," Batak said. "I didn't want to interrupt you while you were talking, but you almost certainly misunderstood something there. Primordials can't be summoned, since they're down here with us already. Bound, forced into sleep and locked away, but still with us. What they can be is set loose." Zorian felt a shiver run down his spine. *The primordial wouldn't disappear, he realized. The Ibasan invaders thought they were summoning a fancy demon to go romp over their enemies, but that thing was never going back to its home plane on its own.* It didn't have one.
#+end_quote

If their prisons had an automatic teleport anchor to pull back the primordials (Such a spell has never been demonstrated in the story, BTW.), why wouldn't it activate immediately? I doubt such a thing would work anyway. They primordials are tiny universes. Once they're free, they're free.

The primordials were put in prisons by the gods because killing them was *too hard* for them. Each primordial just broke into smaller primordials around them, causing massive devastation. So they sealed them up in prisons at the far corners of the world, of which Cyoria was one until recently.

#+begin_quote
  The unholy cross between scorpion, dragonfly and a centipede was clearly Hynth, the Locust Lord, whose bronze carapace was impervious to just about everything but divinely-forged weaponry and whose four pincers could tear steel like paper. The ability to release clouds of biting, devouring insects from pores on his body that devastated the countryside for kilometers around the thing, all while the primordial tackled anyone strong enough to stop them completed the image of a living natural disaster. The cluster of wings hanging above Hynth was probably Ghatess, who was allegedly a ball made out of multicolored bird wings -- and only bird wings -- and created storms and tornadoes wherever it went, funneling matter into the center of its sphere where it seemed to just disappear without a trace. The boar/crocodile/porcupine thing was Ushkechko, a beast made out of indestructible black glass that poisoned anyone who so much as scratched themselves on one of its numerous bladed protrusions and could fire said protrusions like arrows at opponents.
#+end_quote

Mages shaping abilities used to be far worse in the past--there were dozens spells for each color of light, for instance, whereas now there is only one. Many spells had to be long rituals. I find it unlikely that humans would have dealt well with primordials after the god's left. They would have at least caused an apocalyptic event like the desertification of the other continent, but there are zero mentions.

Shifters are likely from back when the gods were still around.

****** The topic about primordials is... mostly speculation. The quote you've provided is relevant to the context explaining difference between demon summoning and primordial releasing. However the panic thought is produced by Zorian and he is definately not an expert on primordials at that point of time. Silverlake is interested in them a lot, but the focus of her studies it not clear - she's clearly interested in dimensional pockets.

Sudomir (the owner of soul well) seems like a knowledgeable person. When he confronts Sudomir about primordial release, he's taking a leap of faith that rampaging primordial issue should be solveable. He's might be a bit more informed or might as well not give a damn.

I hope that there are some safeguards within those prisons. Primordials are pretty impressive and forced sleep should expire at some point of time at least part of them. It was easier for Zorian to kill Suldomir instead of knocking him out. I'm pretty sure primordials have their hard resistances vs knock outs. But, of course, it's the gods we are talking about.

My hope here is that primordials are tied to their cages - if we are talking about real world - it's like japanese shows where person is tied up with rubber rope and tries to reach some point. There are various strategies - like involving helpers, but pretty much everyone is dragged back by the rope. I like to think that gods were pissed off enough at primordials that they jailed them in a fashion which can provide amusement for them by seeing them trying escape those jails and failing/being dragged back. (just like SG is very likely to be a punishment to some primordial).

*** Tetra is not united. It already has two factions which do not agree (merchants vs unificators). So it is much less likely to succeed. One has workout internal factors first to attempt global influence. Too much internal drag otherwise.

In the similar fashion I'd like to ask you - what is the purpose of the world building site? Author stated that it is to provide some more background information which is relevant, interesting, but there's a hard way to put into the story (it does not fit). The particular link I've quoted and QI tells in chapter 81 is about the same - another round of splinter wars is inevitable.

Abnazia is not a culprit. Abnazia is the site where this ambitious prince wants to start unification from. Read the article. The consensus was that to re-unificate continent one of the approaches is to unificate the most central part (valley there 3 big players are) and the rest would be easy. However they are all too strong and this is failing. So this prince is attempting another approach - unificate the rest of the continent first and then conquer the central part. It may even work. But the big three are preventing Abnazia from starting the process. Chaos, which would start after Ibasa invasion/summoning of primordial/wraith bombings/etc. would give the opportunity to start unification plan. And it seems that this had been in works for some time. This worldbuilding article and chapter 81 complement each other very much (in my opinion).

As for your other arguments, they can also be explained. We didn't see any other divine artifact in use yet besides orb. The suspected uses are: dagger - in soul kill episode and crown in temporary marker. There's also totally unproven theory about knowledge of using soul marker to achieve those purposes. The latter could be somewhat disproved by Zorians increasing soul awariness. He pretty much discovered all the purposes of switches and so far he didn't find any. All 5 switches related to those functions to be broken is very unlikely.

Now as for divine artifact usage, this prince is much better explanation. The gate was put into mana hole under guise - to investigate it. It needs to be there most likely due to mana requirements. This happened by initiative of Royal family, our prince fits well. He has access to the dagger and the QI brags that no one recognises the crown so he's pretty relaxed. Even Kayle was able to create soul banishing item, RR should be capable of doing that as well. He's interacting with QI, so he fits into using those artifacts well.

As for the purpose, I'm more partial to the notion QI and silverlake shared about gods being whimsical creatures, sovereign gate being a punishment to primordial. The guardian is not primary purpose artifact.

The divine blessing explains why RR used Zach as an archor, not himself. Apparently pre-requisit to use the SG is to possess divine blessing. RR is lacking one, so he used him as an archor and conveniently piggybacked via temporary marker and mindraped zach as to express his gratitude.

#+end_quote

So, a culprit. How does that work, anyway? An Eldemarian prince shows up in that competing state, takes over and conquers his former homelans? Why? Why does the local elite allow him to take over and not, well, kill him? Hell, why bother with this complexity. Wraith bomb every opponent and order the glorious Eldemarian army to take over the smoldering remains. Use the time loop to figure out how to assassinate any relative that gets in the way. Here, a much more straightforward and reliable plan for an evil prince made up in one minute.

#+begin_quote
  The suspected uses are: dagger - in soul kill episode and crown in temporary marker.
#+end_quote

Actually, no, I've just checked the relevant chapter (55). It says the controller has this ability, as in, the marker can do it with know-how.

#+begin_quote
  He pretty much discovered all the purposes of switches and so far he didn't find any.
#+end_quote

And this one is definitely not true. He has figured out just two functions: the emergency restart and the convo with the guardian. His marker is damaged and its very risky to research the marker by trial and error, because the first error means the end.

#+begin_quote
  Apparently pre-requisit to use the SG is to possess divine blessing.
#+end_quote

This is an ad hoc explanation. Tell me, why does Zach have the blessing in the first place?

***** This is about interpretation of the words, in some fashion a way to guess some of the authors designs. We are discussing this because we are enjoying the story.

For me, the story contains enough twists, surprises. However at the same time a lot (some) clues were provided prior, so author is very keen on foreshadowing.

Another interpretation of the authors words on the site, some of the plot information cannot be put into plot directly because Zorian does not touch it without great layer of indirection. My assumption here is that Zorian contains no link to Abnazia so there is no easy way to put this information into story. However if you describe Abnazia alone in the article, it will be too suspicious. Write about another a bit relevant state (has some weight) and here you are - a foreshadowing not obvious at the first glance, but in my eyes it is very sneaky foreshadow attempt. It made a lot less sense for me prior chapter 81.

Your plan about cleaning up a competition has some valid points, however your suggested plan is very close to "just slaughter everyone who is against you and you'll unite the rest". The necromancers took the hard stance and now they are nesting in small cold island with close to zero resources. There's a recent proof that such hard action does not work.

I'm not saying the prince is evil. If you want to unite the continent, there's a lot of blood to be shed. This man does have a plan (and it seems like a pretty good plan). He's got ambition, plan and he's making it happen. Does it make him evil? Well, a lot of innocent people will die. Does that make him evil? Yes. Is he aware? Of course. But there's a lot more innocent blood shed during splinter wars and it will continue unless someone makes sure continent is united and bloodshed will stop.

The statement "controller has this ability" could also be interpreted as "only person with soul marker can invoke ability (if he has relevant item)". The orb has memory storage function and I'm damn sure there's no such function in the soul marker (as the rest of the functions). Zorian detected some other functions (like how many loops are remaining until SG runs out of power). Author did not describe any other.

In my opinion Zorian just have to avoid switch which initiates restart and he's safe to play with any other button. And it seems for it he does that to understand the function of the button.

Zach divine blessing remains a mystery for now. Even QI did not elaborate how he got it exactly. It sounds like he got it from random god on some rare chance, but it was never specified. And this blessing is totally irrelevant to the point I'm trying to prove. The only relevance is that Zach was used as anchor to start SG, but how he got it holds no relevance to my conspiracy theory.

I'm not telling I've got answers to everything. I've got some ideas I wanted to share - chapters are too rare and I kinda hope this warranted a separate discussion.

Absolutely, yes. Unification achieves nothing except ego stroking. Example: the Splinter states. They /were/ unified once, look how well that worked out.

But that's all rather philosophical. I was calling the prince evil initially simply out of convenience.

This is bad storytelling though. While nobody103 is not a professional writer (as far as I know), but this is /basics/, he has to know this much. Don't put any crucial info in the addendum or worse, on an external resource.

There were significant infodumps woven into the story that became relevant later. The fact that Abnazia was not treated similarly is a strong indication that it won't be relevant.

I mean, one of the worldbuilding posts writes about yetis. Does this mean that this prince is secretly a yeti overlord? Look, a confirmation!

#+begin_quote
  There are also persistent rumors of hidden cities in the deep wilderness, populated by yetis that are far more technologically and magically advanced than their common brethren. These rumors remain just that for now, but they occur with sufficient regularity that most scholars think there may be something to them.
#+end_quote

Guess who is pushing exploration of the northern wilderness? Eldemar!

They are threatening the secret yeti kingdom!

Oh, they are *SO GOING DOWN*.

Yeti conspiracy!

Yeti conspiracy!

I cannot find exact quote, but he was asked about why he does not write the story from multiple points of view. He replied that he limits himself to Zorian only because otherwise the progress of the story would slow down a lot. So that's why this information might have ended up in wiki as foreshadow. You see it as random fact, I'm saying it's at the heart of the story. I'm pretty sure (if there is) such conspiracy, it will be fully revealed by the author.

It seems this is the discussion where the opposite parties are even more sure about their own opinion. I'm pretty sure there won't be more like 10 chapters of the story left so we will learn soon enough

Like I said, various infodumps happened without breaking this rule. Zorian just found the right person and had a talk with them (Vani, his classmates, that businessman dude in Sudomir's town, etc etc etc). Sometimes the infodumps are just there, the most recent being about that flying ship. All Zorian has to do, is to find a person who rants at him about politics, and voila, it's woven into the story. Such person is not hard to find, as Zorian is surrounded by nobles, influential priests and mages.

Sorry, I'm not buying this wiki as last resort to clue us in. It would be trivial to infodump Abnazia if there was even the slightest need.

** I guess I'll post my own dumb theory again. I'll copy/paste, because I'm lazy, so my apologies in advance for that. *SPOILERS*, obviously:

#+begin_quote
  Well, I guess it's time for my pet theory. I don't think it's Veyers the fire-guy. He was, by all accounts, an underachieving twat and he had no obvious connection to the whole loop business. We also haven't met him at all, so if in the end it's him going "HA HA! IT'S ME, GUY YOU'VE NEVER MET" it's going to be fairly mediocre storytelling - and the author, so far, has been really good at this shit. Also, he's the guy who's been propped up as the most obvious suspect, so by unspoken rules of mystery writing, he's the red herring.

  No, I think it's Zach. Wait, no, sorry. Let me try again.

  He's a Zach simulacrum gone rogue.

  Evidence:

  We got a lot of foreshadowing about how simulacra can go rogue after a while if their originator isn't especially responsible and moral, and so far Zorian I believe has had his copies running for more or less the entirety of the loop with nothing worse than them pulling pranks on him. Zach is a nice dude but he also strikes me as someone with less resolve and self-control than Zorian and that foreshadowing, I feel, is more than just something to keep us on our toes. EDIT: Since I wrote this, Zach has actually learned to make them (again?) and they're already showing signs of this.

  Then, Zach mentions there is an odd discrepancy between his abilities and his mana supply. You know what does that? Having a simulacrum out there. Admittedly, he mentions he has MORE mana than his 'magnitude' would entail, which is definitely not how we've been told it works, but once we're in weird self-empowered simulacrum territory, who knows what fuckery has happened? The anomaly doesn't match anything we've been told, but it's still a very suspicious anomaly in that specific area.

  Zach doesn't know the simulacrum spell, sure. But he's also been thoroughly mind-scrubbed and, if my theory is true, that would be the number one thing to edit out. And, y'know, Zach might not be a huge-ass nerd like Zorian, but he's still someone who's spent his decades in Zero-Responsibility Groundhog Month Land grinding obscure powerful magic instead of just kicking back and pounding pussy for thirty years, including getting pretty good (if not as good as Zorian who kinda had to by necessity) at the boring ass Xvim-style shit just for the fuck of it, and him going "oh I guess I don't have a prereq to learn this incredibly powerful and useful spell, guess I'll just throw it away and never bother with it again" strikes me a bit off, if not entirely out of character.

  I also got a vibe that Red Robe's relationship with Zach went beyond "ah, the other loop guy."

  The main blow against this theory is the minor inconvenient fact that, according to what the characters been told so far, simulacra should disappear after the reset. (Although, have we actually seen Zorian keep one going up to the point of reset and then verify that?) Thing is, in stories like this, which hinge on an ever expanding ruleset for the magic, there is always room for a later reveal of an 'except' when it's time for all the pieces to finally fall into place:

  Simulacra don't persist after the reset... except if they're made by the guy with the original super-marker. Except if they manage to survive the reset by taking over/riding in/doing other soul magic fuckery on someone else's body. (Poor Veyers, perhaps?) Except if, in last ditch effort, they try waiting the reset out in the Guardian's room. Except if they bind themselves to a phylactery by doing what liches use the simulacrum spell for.

  The rules are open enough that, if I had to take over the story as a writer, I could come up with half a dozen ideas more. Have I figured it out? I dunno, man. Probably not. But until I'm proven wrong, I'm sticking to this theory, because it's fun.

*** I had this theory for a while. As soon as we heard about simulacrum going rogue, and Zach being entirely uninterested in the idea of simulacrums, despite his reserves making them perfect for him, it seemed like a good fit. Especially as Zach could easily have developed into an entirely different, bitter, hateful person with his origin.

It has three HUGE flaws though.

1) Creating a simulacrum requires immense shaping and soul magic ability.

2) He'd have to have created the simulacrum fairly early in the loop.

3) Zach has spent years with Zorian and Alanic developing his shaping and soul control enough to create a simulacrum, and he can barely do it now.

Red Robe's mind magic is crude, and can barely work on Zach anyway. I don't even think Zorian could remove someone's shaping/soul control on a regular person (without killing them), so there's no way Red Robe could manage it on someone with Zach's protections.

Edit: Also, Red Robe created a simulacrum of his own during the fight against the Aranea.

i think a simulcrum villain would be the far better story than the never mentioned ex class mate. the class mate wouldn't care about the others coming out too (except if he wants to release the primordial), the simulcrum would want to be zach in reality and they would fight for it.

** It could be partway of the explanation of how Zorian ended up with a marker as well. Either RR modified the way the temporary marker works at the start, or modified Zachs such that soul merges produce jailbroken markers. Or RR spent most of his time trying to jailbreak his own marker, and that change is permanent, creating markers like Zorian's.

** I'll rehash/summarize my original statement to reflect some of the discussions were made.

The goal of continental re-unification is to stop wasting various resources (human and material) on wars. However the crux of problem is Eldemar - it is now the main problem standing in re-unification due to hard stance (all states must re-submit or smth like that). There are a lot of people who don't like this and Abnazia is the gathering state where another approach for re-unification is focused on. The plan is to unite the western (more bare) part of the continent and then integrate the problematic big three. Who is driving this - hard to tell, but a lot of people must acknowledge the problem. It is possible that even mysterious organizations like "immortal 11" is backing this up.

Unfortunately, it seems the things need to get worse before it gets better. Eldemar (and possibly Sudomir/Falknea) need to be destroyed so the unification effort will start - those states won't interfere with unification of the west.

Pro-unification members are very influential and are high ranking members of various organizations (cults, royal family, mages). They are aware of the plot Ibasa is trying to pull and providing their own support to impede Big 3 states.

As part of ransacking Nevada estate, member of this pro-unification, royal prince also known as RedRobe in the series, identified SG as artifact donated to royal treasury and made measures to start the loop 30 days before planar alignment to make sure invasion of Ibasa is successful. He spends great effort to guide invaders, also builds up his own skills during looping business. The full key is missing, the other option is person with divine blessing. Zach Nevada has such, so he's used as anchor person to start loop (there aren't many other people with divine blessings and most of them are high ranking priests). RR piggybacked on Zach to prepare for successful invasion so the re-unification of Continent can finally start from Abnazia.
