***** A lot of that character progression happened during the time skip. Masego let a lot of himself turn into Hierophant. Notably, only spending time with other people when Indrani literally smacked him until he stopped ignoring her. He had mild obsessions and fantasies with miracles when he was first introduced, and being constantly in contact with them really brought it out.

***** I have a vague feeling Masego might have to choose between saving Cat or saving his father and he ends up choosing Cat, if only because she doesn't keep him in a gilded cage and allowed him to truly *Witness* creation. I mean, he would have never become Hierophant if Cat hadn't met him.

EDIT: Masego making the choice is also the only way he'd grow as a character and also the only way for and Cat to remain friends. If she murders his father, that bridge is burned

*** I mean all of the Woe are fairly terrible people if you take a step back and look at them. We just get to see them making jokes amongst each other and justifying their actions. But none of them are people you'd really want to have near you.

Same with the Calamities - people like Black, for instance, because he's cool and funny and is putting himself against the world with nothing but his wit and his will. But he's still a guy who's butchered and oppressed many thousands of people. (Although people seem to like him and the rest of the Calamities less, naturally, the more he opposes Cat).

Really it's the same with most of the Evil side. I guess that's why they're evil?

Also, I wonder what Warlock could /possibly/ need his son for, so badly? Have we heard anything about Thalassina up until this point? Could it have to do with the Witch of the Woods, perhaps? (I would imagine so - their fight was the most recent thing of import that happened to Warlock, so short of something out of left field, it would have to be about the Witch.)

Also, the next update is gonna be an Extra Chapter (or would that be the update on the 3rd?). I'd love to read about Ratface and co. getting offscreened, but EE has said that the second Cordelia interlude is to follow.

** I'm not really sure what Malicia's plan is here. I get that she wants to keep Cat on her back foot so she doesn't strike back, but I thought she was also trying to be “practical” and allow for a fruitful alliance eventually as well. Even though Cat no longer trusts her a bit, she would be content to leave the place alone if she could be assured Callow got a bit of breathing room, and she doesnt have the same limitations as the first prince there.

This pretty much assures that Cat will have to go for her throat eventually, and I don't think Praes has the same heroic protection against the “Bonfire” plan. If Cat decides to point it there, it will create a lot more mess than just working with her.

*** Bonfire was a plan to draw the Crusade's conscripted forces away from the border by applying political pressure. It works because of internal faultlines in the command structure - split loyalties among the leaders who would want to pull their forces back to defend their personal turf.

The Legions of Terror, on the other hand, don't answer to the cities. Its leaders won't much care about civilian deaths behind the lines. Hells, Malicia would likely be happy to see some of her rivals put to the sword without having to lift a finger. Add to that the fact that Praesi cities are forces unto themselves, with their own private army defending much more massive fortifications. And if you break through them, they loose chained horrors. There are no quick, clean sieges letting Cat fade away to the next target.

Bonfire is a strategy for a specific foe, and doesn't work as well applied to the Wasteland.

*** Malicia's and cat's end game are not compatible eachother.

Cat wants an independent callow free from procer and praes both.

Malicia needs callow beneath her because she needs callow's food to keep her country alive.

This both need to weaken the other for if they are both alive by the end of the crusade and zombie epidemy they can kill the other with impunity. But they can not weaken the other too much or allow herselves to be weakened or the dead king/crusade will kill them piecemeal.

**** I don't think Cat prioritizes Callow being free. She wants it free of influences that will abuse her people, but Praes has shown they can avoid that for the most part.

A large part of why Cat pursues the highest powers was because of abusive nobles- Malicia has culled them. If she could convince Cat that long term, Callow will be well treated I think Cat would agree. Cat's biggest issue before would be worrying about Callow after her death, but as a fae immortal she could safeguard it both during and possibly after Malicia's reign (and ready to swoop in if evil starts getting stupid with her country)

On the other end, prior to the end of book 3 Malicia seemed ok with the idea of a free Callow that gave favorable trading with Praes. This is not as optimal, but so long as Callow has an evil ruler Malicia doesn't have to worry as much about all the food going to the other countries that refuse to deal with evil.

I'm honestly kind of annoyed with this direction of the story; since it seems counter to many of the earlier principles. I would expect them to not trust each other one bit but be open to these mutually beneficial relationships.

My suspicion (especially given the recent quote) is this is that heroic redemption story in affect forcing the idiot ball on them- that's the only in universe logic I can think of justifying this, in which case I hope for a reversal soon

That is exactly the thing that Cat cannot trust, the empress already was the final cause that liesse died (she enabled akua to succeed) and even if the calamities could be trusted not to fuck up callow they are the exception not the rule. They cannot die of old age, but someone will inevitably knife them and they will die. (Or so cat believes) the next emperor will most likely be a loonie, because most are, and because THAT guy is why Cat ultimately fights.

Is almost the same reason real absolute monarquies are out of vogue, the guy right now might be ok but the next guy might not.

And Cat fought with that concept in the previous books. She is always thinking of how to ensure that Callow will be ok after she and the calamities are out of the board.

*** I'm not sure about Malicia's inner thoughts, but I'm suspecting she'll be out of her depth by the end of this book, if she's not already. What we're seeing is merely the first steps in her plan (the ones guaranteed for success).

I think Malicia is, sort of, drunk on her victory over the Truebloods, her brilliant planning shattering the Praesi aristocracy that many Emperors/Empresses failed to take down. What she fails to recognize is the fact is that it took the 8 most powerful/skillful villains (9 if we count Scribe) and a good part of the best army in Calernia working together to clean up her loose ends. And she now commands /none/ of them.

She is somehow trying to replicate that same success against Procer, using Black, Dead King, and (I suspect, for north/south symmetry) the Tyrant. However, this is probably going to bite her, because Dead King, Tyrant, or Cat will be coming after her once they're done with Procer. And Malicia lacks the narrative weight or the raw power to deal with any of the three. She's been safe from her own schemes because Black has been clever, but Black will be outmatched by the Dead King or the Tyrant and is vulnerable in narrative to Cat (contingent on if, after all this, he still sides with Malicia/Malicia hasn't betrayed him).

And if the Heroes win? A Hanno who been tempered against the Dead King, Tyrant, Black Knight, and Cat is going to be extremely powerful and have terrifying narrative skill. Malicia /will/ lose.

If this "Warlock" that left a message for Masego is Assassin on Malicia's orders, setting a trap in cooperation with Tyrant (or even if Warlock is clean and Malicia is "just" setting a trap with Tyrant)... Malicia might have shot herself in the foot for when the Woe comes for revenge. With the Woe maturing, the Calamities (who aren't really fans of her in the first place) are either narratively vulnerable to their successors in a mentor-pupil story or will be utterly livid at Malicia (cough, Warlock, cough). It goes without saying that Tyrant /will/ betray her, and he just might be a better schemer than her.

#+end_quote

So there's more confirmation of the massive issues Callow's facing. Sounds a bit grim, especially with the context around why those issues are so hard to solve (moreso than typical complex socio-economic problems, even). No trade, no allies, the destruction of the second largest city and the surrounding countryside. Riots and rebellions ready to go off at any moment. And those are just some of the /internal/ factors.

#+begin_quote
  There will be battles, Hakram, and there's only so many Callowans of fighting fit. Only so many we can afford to lose. We need someone to share the casualties with, or it won't matter that we have good farmland: there won't be enough people left to till it.
#+end_quote

And population issues are also a concern. I figure there's also the issue that if they can't afford to /lose/ people, then /recruiting/ them is also a problem - whether they're dead or enlisted, there's one less person farming.

Maybe they can pull manpower from those refugees? Although I don't think Malicia would just lob them a softball like that. She's got too much experience with destabilising foreign powers to accidentally just up and give them a solution to their problems.

#+begin_quote
  Procer would be occupied with the Dead King for the foreseeable future, but there was no guarantee part of the crusader host would not try Callowan borders again if it saw weakness. The Dominion still had two armies on the field, and the League's intentions were opaque to me. My instinct had been that the Tyrant of Helike and his madman of a Hierarch would be taking a swing at the Principate, but that'd been while it was still the dominant force on the board. With Keter on the march, the League might be feeling adventurous enough to aim for other territories. And that was without even considering Malicia, who sure as Hells wouldn't let me bind the wounds of Callow in peace.
#+end_quote

Yep, and everything outside of Callow is exploding. That doesn't strike me as good.

I've got to say, Thief and Hakram have their work cut out for them. Thief with outmanoeuvring Malica, who's maybe the best person at these shadow games on the continent and has decades of experience, and Hakram with everything else. Callow's been on the brink for a book or two now, and sooner or later I think something has to give.

Meanwhile, Cat and Archer are off to do diplomacy with the Drow, with the Diabolist as their foreign policy expert. That can only end well.

I figure things are going to get very interesting for Callow from here on out.
