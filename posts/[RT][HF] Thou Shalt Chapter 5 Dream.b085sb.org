** While I enjoy the possibilities unfolding, I would really like to see some meaningful decisions or actions. in the next few chapters. It feels that aside from Celeste's thing we've just got background info for 5 chapters straight at this point.

*** I appreciate the constant feedback, Sonder! It's really helpful, and good motivation to keep writing and getting better.

I started this project to work on my writing chops, but it's become a whole world to me. I'm hoping to get to a point where I can successfully share that with all of you in a compelling fashion, and the comments and critiques are all incredibly helpful for that goal.

**** I'm glad that my feedback is adding to your writing experience. I know that feedback can sometimes be too much though so please do let me know if you prefer more support rather than suggestions. The world is really fascinating and I look forward to where you go with it.

*** Did the attack on the caravan not count?

**** I /think/, though I could be wrong, that what *Sonderjye* is getting at is that Learn is what you would call a "passive protagonist".

He's not actively choosing to go out and do something for a specific purpose, things are just sort of happening to him and he's "along for the ride".

We find that he's left his clan, but that's all in the backstory bits. In theory, we know he left, but not specifically why or what motivation. He's travelling with the caravan because it happens to be going in the same direction he is. He fights not out of any urge to protect people or prove himself, but just because he happens to be among the group of people being attacked. He finds out that he goal he's set for himself might not be attainable after all, at least not without a lot of extra work, but it doesn't really bother him or motivate him to try harder. He lets another character form a powerful bond between the two of them because he sees no real reason to say 'no', but more importantly he is actually sort of tricked into letting this happen but also doesn't seem to care after it's been done.

In this installment, he finally comes up to the point where he has to make a life-altering choice, where he /actively/ has to make a choice for himself... but he doesn't really seem to care either way and doesn't know what to pick. He even says that in the past he just sort of follows his gut to make decisions and doesn't really think about them much, and now that he doesn't have that, he just does... nothing.

The only reason we, as readers, have any interest in him is because of the backstory of him and his world, we're still learning things (Ha, pun) about it and figuring out the 'rules' of this setting. Sure, he's the designated main character, but we don't have any real reason to /care/. He certainly doesn't. There's no real emotion behind it. He left his tribe, now he wants to go to a place of learning. OK... but why should /we/ be invested in that? It's not like he's decided he wants to go out and prove his dad wrong by learning some epic ways to fight or become a master strategist or prove himself to his /people/ and thus break out from the shadow of his father or something, but he also doesn't want to, say, prove them wrong by becoming something different from what they are and shunning them the way they have shunned him, to prove to the world that an Orc can be something other than a bloodthirsty murder-machine. He just wants to Learn stuff cause that's his job, or something.

In short, I guess what I'm saying is that... if your main character doesn't really care or have any strong emotions about what he's doing, why should we care or have any strong emotions about the designated main character?

***** Thank you, that's a great explanation. Hopefully we'll see Learn show a bit more initiative.

**** No. There were no stakes and no meaningful decisions were taken. It was just a random attack that served to showcase the ability of the group.

***** What counts as a stake? Was there no danger? No possibility of injury, death or robbery?

****** There wasn't any real narrative danger. Neither Learn nor Celeste was in any real danger of dying after being introduced so early and the rest are just named goons to me until I get to know them better. There's going to be stakes involved when Learn tries to get to that school of learning since we know that it's basically his dream and we know that there's a very real chance that he will be denied that.

******* Ok, so you're not talking about stakes for the characters as they might see it, but as perceived by you, the reader, with your perception of the narrative structure?
