** I'm not sure what Harry is playing at, setting up a story here. Or really, /why/ he's setting up a story. Voldemort is dead. The Death Eaters are dead. Dumbledore is stuck in time. Hermione has been returned to life. Harry has the Philosopher's Stone.

So what's the purpose of putting on this big, elaborate lie? To hide the Philosopher's Stone from those who would want to take it from him? To hide the fact that he's a murderer (even if it's justifiable)? To hide the fact that he's at least partly Tom Riddle?

He does all of this without really having an internal monologue of /why/ he's doing it. And if this weren't so close to the end of the story, this is the sort of thing that I would expect to backfire horribly.

Yes, and yes. The authorities would definitely want to take the philosopher's stone from him, and the dead death-eaters had friends and family that will want vengeance. Taking credit would hurt more than it would help.

"Voldemort, whilst experimenting with dark and terrible magics with Hermione, forgot to consider one important thing- love. She exploded him and his death eaters, ending his terrible threat.

Also, to give Tom a chance to grow up normal. If the Wizarding World knew that V wasn't really dead and this other guy is a mindwiped V, they'd try for vengeance, kill him themselves or otherwise treat him in such a way that he'd go Dark due to a lack of other options.

I think a portrait contains the memories of a deceased person but they can't acquire new long-term memories. Harry once said ghosts are "like accidental portraits".

Also, when Harry was asking for directions, the portraits could remember the instructions of "the gamemaster", but one of the portraits said that it was nice knowing Harry but it was pity that she wouldn't remember him for long.
