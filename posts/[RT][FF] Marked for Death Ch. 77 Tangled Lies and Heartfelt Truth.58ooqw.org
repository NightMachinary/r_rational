The latest chapter by the inestimable [[/u/Velorien][u/Velorien]] is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1139#post-7102048][here.]]

Today, the team's attempts at diplomacy continue! Will they be able to talk their way out of their confrontation with the antagonistic clan ninja?

Marked for Death is a play-by-post RPG-style story, where all participants vote to control the actions of a single player character, set in a rational reimagining of the world of the Naruto manga and anime. The world functions on consistent rules, every character is pursuing their own agenda, and narrative tropes take a back seat to exploring the logical consequences of your choices.

The premise: you are part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at you with no resources, no backup, and a standing capture/kill order in every ninja village on the continent.

They (along with [[/u/Augsphere][u/Augsphere]] and [[/u/FuguofAnotherWorld][u/FuguofAnotherWorld]] (Jackercracks on SV)) have done their best to try and make the world as realistic as you can while dealing with crazy ninjas.

The story updates every Thursday (Velorien) and Sunday (EagleJarl). Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja!
