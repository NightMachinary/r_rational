** Short fiction. About 4000 words. Read time ~10 minutes.

It was inspired by a lot of rationalist stuff I have been reading. Especially from Robin Hanson's Great Filter and Brain Emulations and SlateStarCodex's take on it.

Would love feedback.

Thanks and enjoy.

(Just want to say: I read almost everything posted here (and much of what is recommended). This is definitely my favorite sub-reddit. Thanks for all of you that write for me...)

*** I love this story and I am so glad that this subreddit inspired you to write it. I love love *love* stories that take weird scientific takes on concepts. "Time travel is basically a thing that happens all the time, naturally" is something that I haven't come across before. It's fresh.

I have some technical-type critiques, if you'd be interested in them, but the story overall is pretty good.

I have now tagged you with "not-so-secret time traveler fighting the apocalypse" (I also have a weakness for stories that claim to be real accounts just masquerading as fiction for one purpose or another).

** Honestly the only solution I can come up with for this problem is to develop a GAI, they are the only entities with enough power to ensure their civilization never develops time travel if it's so easy.

Of course the problem is that given it's supposed to be much harder to develop than time travel I can't imagine it would be easy to ensure GAI comes first. So how would you control tech development to that degree?\\
I suspect any answer would have to involve massive unstable conspiracies or world domination, and you can't rush development because normal AI safety problems still exist.

** Thank you for writing this, but I find the moral positions in this story silly, for the most part (immortal twin is accurate). That said, the "random walk" model is actually really compelling.

Temporally looped information is, near as I can imagine, experimentally identical to a Boltzman Brain situation. So there's no reason to believe you killed an entire universe of anything, and even if you did, you should also believe that you /created/ an entire universe of that same anything. Mork's not born, Gork is, and it's a push.

As for the model... there /is/ the third terminus state: Invent, but not use, time travel. This seems to me to imminently reasonable, given sane time taveller: First thing you do is create a looped failsafe: If extinct, send time traveler; now the bottom line loops just like the first, and over infinite iterations, the walk will progress as a balance.

An interesting side effect is that we'd expect to see dead alien civilizations where exactly the wrong thing happened; basically, the opposite of this: [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3994]]

** Hmmm.

The desired terminus state is /given/ as "time travel is not invented", but that's not quite right. The /actual/ desired terminus state is "intelligent life continues to exist". In order for this to happen, it is necessary that humanity develop sufficient, independent off-Earth colonies /before/ time travel is invented, and then no-one ever travels back to before that time. (As noted in the story, once you have enough colonies, even with a high probability of a given colony dying off, stellar expansion becomes a near-certainty).

It's easy to push for the /discovery/ of a given technology, given time travel as presented in the story (and assuming you're sufficiently ruthless). You simply do the research, calculate when-and-where you want it to be discovered, pick a person who's in the right place at the write time, time-travel back into his head and produce the required scientific paper. When you need funding directed to a specific place, overwrite Bill Gates in the past and direct it as needed. (Or overwrite some random person, but bring with you memories of the performance of the stock market after that date. Or the next winning lottery numbers.) So, it should be relatively straightforward to arrange for the discovery and funding of space travel. It shouldn't be hard to arrange for it to be done, either - not when you can have the loudest denigrators of the project suddenly and inexplicably drop any and all objections pretty much on command.

Then, once you have (say) a dozen planets colonised, you just need to find some way of preventing anyone from travelling back to /before/ that time, whether or not they figure out time travel...

*** Star travel won't work to solve this because you remain vulnerable to someone going back to before it happened. You need humanity to /leave the lightcone defined by the birth of the first hominid advanced enough to be overwritten/. That is a much higher bar to clear. And since FTL is time travel..

Basically, you need to leave this universe for one in which time travel is not possible. Whoo-hoo. Doozy of a problem.\\
But at least this setting does provide a compelling reason for entire civilizations to abandon this reality - any remnants they leave eventually get retconned out of existence, so "Abandon ship" isn't ruled out as a solve by fermi.

No, it means that anyone else who did time travel must have changed history in such a way as to prevent their own time travel. Or time travelled from a far earlier timeline, far in your future. While it is true that they won't time travel without a causal chain of events that leads back to your own actions, there's no telling which action (or lack of action) on your part might trigger that causal chain of events.

And then, of course, there's the point that you would have to time travel before your previous-loop-self, or you might end up trapping the universe in a steady-state infinite loop...

***** That's a fascinating idea! But what determines the behavior of the pieces that the player hasn't controlled yet? I mean how will those pieces move? Because it feels as if that is a fairly arbitrary decision to make which could completely shape the entire game.

****** For the first prototype the answer is they don't move beyond player action.

As I expand the system there will be more and more forms of 'AI' in place by default that give things a default behavior that you can later end up changing.

** I think there's an inconsistency in your proposal. The Drake equation asks why we do not now see more signs of alien life. You propose that time travel resets technological progress. But, the reset is universal (you talk about killing all of the aliens when resetting the time back to the mid 21st century).

This does not answer why we don't see any evidence of aliens as of the date of your reset. Any aliens have been reset to where they were, leaving the question of the Great Filter unresolved. As I see it, this proposal would require that either we are the first developed species, or that aliens have all fallen to the Great filter. That is, the same situation before introducing time travel.

*** It is a proposal for why every alien would fall to this great filter. And that the great filter is time travel.

Effectively it proposes time travel is so much easier to discover then interstellar travel.

And it has universe spanning reach to reset a species.

So the end state of the universe is that time travel deletes civilizations eventually, and doing so makes it like they never were interstellar in the first place.

*** It's about timing. The reason the Drake equation / Fermi Paradox results in a high probability of aliens in that you need to believe the average lifespan of aliens able to communicate will be very high.

If you assume the average lifespan of communicative aliens is say 200 years before they go extinct then the rest of the assumptions can be reasonable and you can assume you are the only living intelligent species in the galaxy.

The re-set just makes it highly likely that species will not last anything close to 200 years in the "final" timeline.

(The chances that two species are close to inventing time travel at exactly the same time is very very small, but it doesn't really change things - just makes the modeling much more complicated)

No.

The reset is /more influential than that/. The reset says that the time state of the universe will not count past the first species to develop the ability to time travel. The reset of state is painted as universal; a time-reset in Alpha Centauri resets the entire universe. So the universal time clock wont pass the first development of time travel (we'd keep getting sent back to the earliest time-traveller's reversion point).

But based on the anthropic principle, earth exists and so we know the universe counts at least 13 billion years from the big bang. Thus, we can conclude that one of the following is true:

1. Earth is the first place time-travel develops
2. Earth's development happens within the time-loop of some other civilization.

As far as I can tell, the story has an additional unstated assumption that every sapient technological civilization will develop time travel ("easier than space flight").

Now, option (1) seems to fall within the already stated boundaries of the Fermi Paradox: Why is earth the first place to develop sapient life?

Option (2) is more interesting, but seems to require that all other civilizations have roughly equivalent technological progress to us: their time-resets happen after ours.

***** You are half-way correct.

The first species develops time travel and keeps re-setting until they don't use time travel (likely due to an extinction event before the invention of time travel), then THAT timeline continues until the next species develops time travel. And it repeats.

So the reason we don't see any space-faring civilizations is the final timeline we exist in they have all destroyed themselves (If they haven't it's not the final timeline)

***** No, he's saying that any time there is a time reset there is a 0.0001% chance the civilization will die before inventing time travel.

Ergo, every civilization destroys itself, then no one can travel back in time, and the universe progresses. If humanity explored the entire galaxy they would find millions of civilizations who died at some point before time travel

****** But all you need for there to be evidence of aliens is that enough civilizations go extinct before time travel but /after/ the radio. If the chance for that is large enough then the universe should be filled with alien radio signals.
