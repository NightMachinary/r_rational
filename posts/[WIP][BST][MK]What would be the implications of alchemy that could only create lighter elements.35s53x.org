tldr: Magically harmless fission lets you create lighter elements from heavier with few restrictions. On an industrial scale. What can we do with that?

Long version:

I'm starting to hammer down the mechanisms harnessed during my world's industrial revolution (Which in about 60 years took them from Rome to WW2, technology wise), and as there is a magical world war involved, magic and technology have kinda been blossoming together.

My actual book is about a group of seemingly random but suspiciously skill-wise complimentary people who end up in the ruins of Evil Capitol. Evil Capitol was a multi-million people city in and around a mountain, and as Evil Capitol was largely destroyed in a Final Battle 300 years ago, it's mostly ruins and rust. My characters will salvage and rebuild, however. And I want to make sure that what they find and rebuild around is as realistic and interesting as possible. So while I have a lot of it thought out, with things from ever-rearranging mazes that break 3D space to an under-mountain harbour to lots of plot things, I feel like the implications of industrial scale alchemy should be /really/ far reaching, and I probably haven't realized how powerful it is. So while it's going to be broken in the book, the ruins of the infrastructure will still be there.

And that's where you come in. You were incredibly helpful when it came to munchkining my Oath magic and my Place Where You Can't Deliberately Lie. I'm hoping you'll be similarly inventive when it comes to industrial scale alchemy.

The rules: You can only create lighter elements than what you start out with. You can go from Helium to Hydrogen. You can go from Uranium to anything from Hydrogen to Protactinium. Smaller steps are easier. You can't create any unusual isotopes because I'm not dealing with subatomic particles. As a consequence, there is no radiation other than light and magic. The magic gained this way is not useful or dangerous (low quantity produced), but the light of course is heat. The heat can be harnessed, and though people don't know it now that they are in a second dark age, magicians 'creating heat' is mostly them alchemically breaking down the matter in the air.

On a larger scale of production, the heat is a problem. Back when Evil Capitol was still running, magic was stronger and they cheated by having chimneys deep within the mountain leading to magic extradimensional vaccuum space where it doesn't bother anyone ^{^{^{^{until}}}} ^{^{^{^{Team}}}} ^{^{^{^{Good}}}} ^{^{^{^{figures}}}} ^{^{^{^{out}}}} ^{^{^{^{you}}}} ^{^{^{^{can}}}} ^{^{^{^{use}}}} ^{^{^{^{the}}}} ^{^{^{^{chimneys}}}} ^{^{^{^{as}}}} ^{^{^{^{points}}}} ^{^{^{^{of}}}} ^{^{^{^{entry.}}}} The characters in the book will not benefit from this, but then they won't start out with magic at all, so alchemy isn't going to be experienced by point of view characters for a while yet.

Because the people deciding where to build Evil Capitol were strategic, they put it in and around a mountain that was very rich in ore and coal, and by the time they had mined it out technology and magic were powerful enough that they were able to pull magma out of the mantle and mine that. There is no core because my world is not a spheroid, but /never mind that/.

Evil Capitol were able to mine some amounts of almost every element, but mostly the yields were in line with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust][Natural Abundance of the elements on Earth]], with a few valuable deposits of heavier elements.

So. Listing the notables, lots of iron and coal (Not a pure element but still a useful resource), some tungsten (Heaviest moderately common element), a little bit of lead and silver, and a tiny bit of Uranium. Uranium in my world was /incredibly/ valuable when alchemy was understood, because it could be used to make anything. My version of aluminum tableware for the king, if you will.

So. Munckining it. I am not a material physicist or a chemist, and I'm gonna miss things. But I may miss /fewer/ things if you can think of any interesting exploits I would not. Is Titanium so much more useful than iron that conventional steel would not be a thing and my 300 year old Ruin City would be rust free? Is there some rare light weight element that would revolutionize weapons manufacturing or long distance communications if they were more commonly available? Is Radon the best gas ever except for the bit where on Earth it decays and gives you lung cancer?

Chemistry works as normal, and alchemically produced matter can be used to make alloys and compounds as normal. Fine control during the conversion can allow you to change only part of an 'object', but you aren't going to get a 100% conversion rate, so usually you want to be able to separate the product from any waster or unconverted material at the end of the conversion. You could convert something that is inside something else, however, if you don't mind a little impurity and a lot of extra effort.

Also no atom bombs. No subatomic physics, remember.

I have some ideas, and I will certainly think of more, but I want to see in which direction you guys go running off with the concept. Mundane technology peaked somewhere equivalent to 1950ish in my world, but that's flexible, and magic brought sci-fi levels of technology to a few select areas.

Thank you for your time.

***** tldr: ceiling, walls.

There are no stars in the conventional sense, and atoms were made by my version of gods. The 'planet' is flat on top, (But with mountains, oceans, etc) and extends in a half sphere down to where the "Soul of Creation" is. Which is basically the sun. The energy pouring out of the SoC does keep the planet's innards hot akin to Earth's, but most of the heat and magic is swept away by a magical storm of soul destroying black fire which functions as the walls of reality. The storm flows along the world from below, and then breaks through where the world ends. Where there are oceans. So the oceans flow over the edge and are carried up by the extreme, world-surrounding storm, and are lifted high into the sky. Most of the water is expelled within a kilometer or twenty from the edge, where it falls in an enormous, never ceasing, very deadly, almost boiling waterfall. Most of the water that flows into the storm falls close to the edge and is among the water that flows over the edge again, but some is carried away back into the world as clouds, so surrounding water /is/ pulled toward the edge. The edge of the world is not a safe place, and there is nothing that lives close to it for long. The extreme forces involved crush any normal creatures that come too close, and anything that actually reaches the storm is subjected to the soul destroying black fire. Though it's possible to fly close and study it, if you can keep the flight going and avoid the falling water. Sailors that go close enough to get caught in the pull don't survive.

The storm continues upwards and converges in a slightly egg shaped form. All the energy from the Soul of Creation that remains after travelling to the top of the world is destroyed, creating light and magic. This is visible, and looks like the sun does from Earth, though it is smaller and closer and not made of gas but of burning soul stuff. The point where the storm converges changes in a 24 hour cycle, which looks like day and night does on Earth. The interior of the planet also receives a lot more heat during the night. From above the planet looks like a flat circle, but the 'equator' if you will is considerably to the south of the middle, as a result of the sun never passing through the Soul of Creation but some distance away from it.

The Soul of Creation itself is a portal to the place where souls come from and where they go upon death. It's also where the gods came from, although at this point they are all dead. If you somehow survived the trip you could travel to other worlds from there, but there are easier ways and while my universe does have multiple worlds, there are only as many of them as the gods created, and almost all of them were destroyed or left lifeless before my book begins. A few remain, but are not important to the story other than as history. There are not infinite worlds or parallel realities.

The 'moon' is one of these limited worlds, sort of. It was made by one of the gods, who designed it to withstand the soul destroying fire of the storm, and set it drifting. From inside the world it looks like our moon does, though without craters and with long, enormous lines instead, carved by the wind of the storm over millennia.

The year is 365 days long, divided into 13 lunar months. Every new year's is a new moon and every midsummer is a full moon. So that's 12 months with 28 days and one in the middle with 29, to make the moon and sun synch up perfectly.

Gravity pulls towards the soul of creation, ie down, but only from within the world. Think of it like magnetism. The force pulls into the SoC from above, but then throws things out into the storm, away from it in every direction. Or imagine an egg. At the top of the egg, gravity pulls down. Near the bottom, gravity folds out like the shell of the egg. Because magic.

My characters are never going to traverse the storm itself, but they are going to weaponize it towards the end, because what could possibly go wrong.

****** Interesting world design, but it raises one question for me: where does all that heat go? In other words, why is the world not an oven?

We have a world that is heated from above by a sun, below by this SoC thing and surrounded on all sides by a rain of boiling water. Using magic creates more heat. So far there are only heat inputs with nothing to pull the energy back out. Do you have plans for where the heat goes?

One idea I had was that when a living being dies its soul pulls all of the heat energy out of the body it is inhabiting. This heat energy then is freed when the soul goes through the SoC, powering the soul destroying black fire. This would provide a sort of control loop to keep the world from overheating. I'm entirely sure what this would do to the climate as that depends on how much of the heat is delivered via the sun vs through the ground and walls. If the majority of the heat comes from the sun, you would end up with a world that is relatively temperate in the center and fairly tropical near the edges.

Of course that doesn't do anything about the heat created through magic. One possibility is that the energy released by the SoC actually pushes the world away from it. As more of the heat that had been released through magic returns to the SoC, the force of the energy pushes the world farther away. This additional distance could be roughly balanced so that the heat energy added matches the energy flux through the additional transit volume. That is to say that since they're farther apart there is more energy in flight between them and the extra energy in flight needed for that farther distance matches the heat released through magic, so the world's heat balance is unchanged. I don't think this would be perfectly stable, so magic use may eventually lead to or hasten the end of the world.

Interestingly this heat model would mean that gravity and temperature of the world would fluctuate for a few years after large massacres or large releases of magic. With much death the world becomes colder and the SoC pushes it farther away (higher gravity) with more energy. The energy warms the world up leading to a time of plenty (normal gravity) so the natural death rate declines. The decline in death reduces the energy from the SoC so the world falls back down (lower gravity). Lower energy causes famine, increasing the death rate, etc. These oscillations will continue, but should eventually dampen out so that the world reaches equilibrium again.

#+end_quote

I should have included that in my comment above, sorry. Your suggestion is interesting, and I'll see if I can do anything with it, but the main mechanism that keeps the world from overheating is that same storm of black fire. The incoming energy is all from the SoC, which is carried by the storm, some of it transferring to the water that is swept up (which is what causes it to boil), some of it reaching the top and becoming the 'sun' phenomenon, and some of it being consumed by the black fire. But while energy is added to the mantle, the boiling water and the sun, the rest of the sky bordering the storm is cooled by the black fire, which destroys energy. Magic can break thermodynamics left and right in my world, and while the black fire is not capable of containing all the energy spat out by the SoC, it does in total consume about as much, keeping the world relatively stable. Remember, the shape of the 'planet' may be a half sphere, but the shape of the storm is more egglike, so there is a lot of atmosphere bordering on the storm.

Souls pulling energy with them could be really interesting, however, and I will think about it. Would give a whole new meaning to 'cold as death', and also give a morbid utility to killing people for cold when you need a sudden temperature drop. Plus, battlefields would be full of deadly cold as well as the firestorms I've planned. An interesting idea for sure, and I'll think about if it works. Thank you!

** Simple list of possible/cheap things:

- Aluminum everything. It's a pretty great metal that can replace wood, stone, plastic, and porcelain in many cases. Fissioning it from silicon in the dirt makes for an endless supply.

- Titanium everything. Iron is harder to get than dirt, but titanium's advantages over aluminum make it worthwhile.

- Rare metals that are good for alloying things. Beryllium, vanadium, and all the rest of the good ones make high quality alloys much cheaper and easier.

- Alkali metals. Throw flaming chunks of sodium at your enemies! (Phosphorus can do a similar job)

- Fluorine. It's really nasty.

- Probably not relevant yet, but tungsten is much more common than the rare earth metals.

Can it make extremely pressurized gasses? Iron would convert atom-by-atom to a gas at about 3000 atmospheres of pressure if I ran the numbers right. Simply get a cannonball and change the middle of it into chlorine for an amazingly effective chemical weapon.

Yes, though it's harder and more demanding than converting pure elements. Recycling ash by cracking the oxygen sounds like a good idea.

Would high quality alloys lead to many things not succumbing to rust over the course of 300 years? Not everything will be rust proof, of course, but I have some difficulty figuring out whether anything at all would last that long, and if so what kinds of metals would last.

I'm not sure what would rust away and what would stay. As a reasonable benchmark, a copper roof has a lifespan of about 100 years (presumably without leaking). Good quality stainless steel is both more corrosion resistant and stronger, so I could see it lasting 300+ years in the weather. I /think/ that titanium is better than stainless steel, but I'm not sure. Aluminum is somewhere in the middle, possibly just having surface oxidation after that time.

EDIT: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_%28chemistry%29][Passivation]] is something worth looking at. It seems like good alloys/metals could last practically forever out in the open.

** You mentioned that it is easier to convert heavy elements into slightly less heavy elements than than converting them into moderately less heavy elements. Does that mean that the elements aren't actually split apart? As in, if you convert Iron into Titanium you only get Titanium with no byproduct of Bervilium or smaller?

If that is the case then do converted materials actually become lighter, thus effectively destroying matter in a closed system with just some amount of light and heat as a byproduct? Or do 100g Iron somehow convert into 100g Titanium?

Second law of thermodynamics does not apply, however, and energy can also be created, though not in a way that any of the characters will be in a position to munchkin.

My original idea was to have the conversion only produce slightly lighter materials, but thinking on it more closely, I realize it should be permissable to split the atom into more than one smaller piece, as with normal fission.

I'm also assuming you can't control the structure of the element you get (Can't turn a ring into diamonds by transforming the iron into carbon. But then, do you keep the old atomic structure or something random? What happens if you turn the all carbon in Benzene into more hydrogen?)

Supposing I could make enough of anything...

What natural resources are important because of the structure of the elements, rather than the elements themselves? Diamonds are still rare, while gold and silver aren't (Although, given their "Height" on the table of elements, they may still have industrial value)

It should be an easy trick in a desert for a mage with two bottles to turn some sand into oxygen, then turn some air into hydrogen, then combine to make water. Anything else that requires pure elements but otherwise has simple reactions should also work.

As for ratios, think of it as forcing fission, just without any subatomic particles. You change each atom independently, although you do so with many atoms at a time. Mass decreases, total energy decreases (Magic can break thermodynamics in both directions, the creating bit just isn't munchkinable).

You can't control the structure you get. As in reality, when an atom in a molecule splits, the molecule is almost definitely toast. Though the atom might still be stuck inside an otherwise unbroken crystal.

Good point, and one which I should have mentioned. In my world they don't have the technology to make diamonds, so diamonds are valuable. Though they don't have the artificial scarcity thing going for them, so valuable but not as much as in reality.

A lone mage couldn't make enough water that way, but he could survive by pulling water vapour out of the air with unrelated magic. In a factory setting, similar strategies could definitely work, however.

This really is the main problem. I have lots of ideas, but a city of millions would have many times more. The people in this thread have already given me several great ideas that my characters would have thought of but which I the author had not.

I like Zeppelins, but while my world will include them it will mostly be as a historical curiosity. From the invention of them until the end of high-tech there is a world war, and shooting down zeppelins is much easier than would allow them to be practical.

Rockets, however, will be present and dialed up to 11. I've been internally thinking of the genre of my world as High Fantasy/Diesel punk.

For most of my history magic is extremely restricted, because once you know how to use it you kinda walk around with flame throwers and rocket launchers for the rest of your life. In Evil Capitol everyone could use magic and it was used all the time everywhere, but this is not the norm. Using magic is more tiring than jogging (depending on how much you use), so while you have great incentives to train your magic muscles, you can't keep it going all day. Most non-human creatures don't use it, but some do. Magical genetic engineering also creates a few monstrosities that use magic a lot. By the time of the actual books (300 years after the technological high point), one and a half continent are uninhabitable due to magical creatures that don't play nice, and the oceans are home to basically midgard serpents.

#+end_quote

Yes. This breaks up the molecule just like the decaying of a Carbon-14 atom would in real life.

** [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements]]

Barium is a highly abundant element with a mass of 56. The poor man's uranium.

Silver is a natural antibiotic. With barium you can make a lot of this extremely valuable and useful element.

*** Yep. Barium is high on the list, and will be used as raw material for much. I didn't know about silver's antibiotic properties, but I've read up on it now, and it's definitely interesting. The characters will find some texts that have survived, and something about silver used in medicine could make for a good opportunity to introduce alchemy to the reader. Thanks!

** Steel is easy to work with, titanium is hard.

Can you partially convert materials to make alloys? If so, you have a two step process of make it from easy to work materials then convert to final alloy.

How much control is there? Can you make optics by turning unwanted material to helium?

#+end_quote

Reading up on what an alloy actually /is/, the answer is yes, but only as solid solutions. You can't make them chemically bonded during the alchemical process. This is interesting, and I'll have to read up on useful alloys and determine which would be candidates for this. Thanks!

Control varies with skill, but among the best and on a small scale, yes, you could smooth out or sculpt surfaces better than with any tools their non-,magical technology would allow. On an industrial scale, no. To do a lot of work many magician have to work together, which decreases precision.

** Skilled mages can make perfect lenses of nigh-arbitrary size and arbitrarily sharp edges on blades. You can make things inside of things so the outer things have no seams.

Surgery and optics are now easy.

You can get a heat "laser" from the optics. Your lathes are arbitrarily sharp so require less energy than normal.

Steam engines are trivial, so you have railroads.

Microphones are easy.

You can make arbitrarily small things, like circuit boards. That will require additional knowledge of course.

Hm. Magnets, maybe? If you produce iron slowly, inside an existing but weak magnetic field, I think all the magnetic domains would align, giving you a stronger magnet. Jumpstart the process with a natural chunk of magnetite and you're good to go. With strong magnets available, electrical generation becomes easy.

How do you figure? A perfect lens will only help so much if you don't have a perfect point source.

***** It gets really hard to aim after a while. You're better off with a bunch of little ones that you control individually. And using mirrors instead of lenses. And if the mirrors are small enough or aiming at something far enough, curving them won't matter much.

*** Trains are indeed a thing, and one of the things my characters will eventually manage to replicate.

I'm not familiar with how microphones work, and had planned communications technology to be roughly in line with other 40s technology, with a few exceptions through magic means. Are microphones 'low hanging fruit' if you can carve precise shapes?

Magnets will be a thing. Circuit boards no. By the fall of the city they will have enormous 50s computers, but nothing smaller.
