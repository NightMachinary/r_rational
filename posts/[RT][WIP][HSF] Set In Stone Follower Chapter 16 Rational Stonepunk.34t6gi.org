** So, Allen, Brad, Fobi and Rickardare being used like Psycho-Pass [[http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Enforcers][Enforcers]]? In regards to Allen, he knows that Albert knows that he knows already - why not say "Albert has forbidden speaking of it" or some such?

*** I don't know that anime, so I really can't say for sure, but based on the link, I'd say no. They are being used as a focus group.

There might have been a better solution to the scenario, but Allen was in no state of mind to determine what that might have been, being caught between authority figures on the one side and the patriarch of his fianc√©'s family on the other.

**** Oh, well - Psycho-Pass is one of my favourites. But there's more to it than you think (that link isn't easy to understand without context). Psycho-Pass' society criminalises people not on what they've done, but on their state of mind - a violent, tempermental person would find themselves in mandatory therapy, for example. Enforcers are those that have a high Crime Coefficient (chance of committing crime based on the above), but are useful to the police nonetheless.

***** Now I can see some similarities, yes. I'd put it closer to some sort of "using thieves as security consultants" trope rather than active law enforcement. Psycho-Pass looks interesting. I might poke at a couple episodes in Hulu if they are available.

** This is rapidly becoming one of my new favorite rational serials. It almost reminds me of The Invention of Lying, in so far as violence is a foreign concept to practically everyone.

** Please let me know if the idiot ball hit Allen too hard. It was only meant to be a glancing blow.
