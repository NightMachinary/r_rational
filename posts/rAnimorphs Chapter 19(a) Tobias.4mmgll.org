** I don't think that Tobias's strategy up to this point was a good one. Jumping at every shadow and refusing to move until you have 100% confidence it's not going to backfire is a textbook case of over-optimization. This is the same trade-off the yeerks face: being cautious means you reduce the risk of making mistakes or leaving weaknesses for your enemy to exploit, but it also means giving your enemy more time to prepare and plan and exploit the few weaknesses you leave.

Spending weeks doing background checks and looking for spies is a waste of time; Tobias could have started with recruiting intelligence agents right away, with the fastest process that was still reasonably safe; something like: find identity of agent, morph them, read their mind, unlock the morph and simulate the conversation a first time, if it goes well, do the actual conversation, ask them for the identity of superiors and better placed agents, maybe give them the morphing power, rinse and repeat.

Anyway, really liked this update. I'm not sure how to describe it (other than "it's well written"), but you have this thing were things I would expect to work easily are hard and painful, and things I would expect to be hard and challenging work very smoothly, and it makes a lot of sense in retrospect.

That's kind of the opposite of the canon "Animorphs talk to army people" scenes. The canon authority figures are ridiculously overskeptical, and dismissive of the main characters, like that scene where Jake tries to talk to General Doubleday and gets thrown in a cell three or four times, and nobody bothers to monitor it to learn how he escapes, or wonder the point of putting away someone who proved he couldn't be contained, or think that a fly transforming into a teenager is super weird and important and maybe we should listen to what he wants to say. On the other hand, as soon as the adults learn Earth is being invaded, they immediately become complacent and ready to accept the authority and tactical acumen of a group of ragtag teenagers. "Oh, so you want me to send a platoon to their deaths to distract the mothership for, like, five minutes while you execute your commando mission that I haven't approved or even been briefed on? Sure, go ahead."

Anyway, I'm not used to authority figures as compelling characters, but you're doing a good job on that point. Jeremiah is both suitably open minded and willing to listen, and reasonably cautious. He makes good points too, about the "we don't know who's the bad guy" thing.

*** What I did find compelling while reading though is that Tobias is not Marco. Marco would be able to know or work out the best strategy by trial and error, quick thinking and if necessary, improvisation. Tobias is more likely to know his own limitations and thus be overly cautious. It's good to see the canon characters powered-up (logicked-up?) but not /too/ OP.

*** "Oh, so you want me to send a platoon to their deaths to distract the mothership for, like, five minutes while you execute your commando mission that I haven't approved or even been briefed on? Sure, go ahead."

Actually, general doubleday was able to put together a full battalion for his diversionary attack. As far as fictional battles go, that one was pretty interesting. After the animorphs blew up the yeerk pool, they torched the entire city and landed the pool ship on its ashs. This fact made doubledays mission alot harder because even if he launched the attack from los padres forrest, his troops would have needed to cross at least 2 miles of open ground. Terrain that was completely devoid of cover, and crawling with thousands of yeerk soldiers. Never mind the not inconsequential fact that the pool ship itself was shooting at them!

Another interesting fact: The pool ship was so enormous that no human weapon could conceivably destroy it. If it had the same dimensions and density as the [[http://www.st-v-sw.net/STSWvolumetrics.html#mozTocId697772][borg sphere]] (that is to say, 600 meters in diameter, and built like tin foil), it would have a mass of 126 to 489 MILLION tons. Considering the inability of [[http://warships1discussionboards.yuku.com/topic/8838/Battleship-durability-vs-antiship-missiles#.V1X1ueTSR1E][anti-ship missiles]] like the harpoon or exocet to threaten even a 50,000 ton battleship, there is no possibility that they could damage something that is larger by 3 orders of magnitude, and probably built of far stronger materials than ordinary steel. (A valid assumption, considering the pool ship doesn't collapse in an earth gravity well)

**** Yeah, canon Animorphs handled the power disparities between modern and space-faring militaries pretty realistically. On the other hand, the Animorphs's effectiveness was super buffed, with a Batman-like tendency to go through perimeters, security measures, guards and fortifications like they're not even there. It helps that the yeerks never seemed to use passwords, security booths, surveillance cameras, satellite tracking, or any form of security more complex than locked doors and "shoot at the good guys when you see them".

** @[[/u/TheJamesRocket][u/TheJamesRocket]] has a pretty amazing analysis of the link between canon locations and real life, available [[http://kesler12-jamesrocket.blogspot.ca/2016/03/animorphs-scenery.html][here]]; I'm adopting this for r!Animorphs going forward, as demonstrated in this chapter.

It's only half! I fell prey to planning fallacy again. I'll post the second half (hopefully) within the week, and then combine them back into a single entry later (at which point I'll also post on ao3).

Because it's being posted in the middle of being written, it's particularly ripe for your critical feedback; if you've had negative things to say about the story thus far and have been holding back, well---I'm literally asking for it.

** I love your story, and I'm starting to think I'm getting a bit too invested. This is because I really wish I'd had either a bit more or a bit less information about when the update was coming (I'm bitter because I was so looking forward to the update that I spent half of yesterday refreshing ff.net, but eventually had to give up and go to sleep before the update). Not complaining- I realize that's my own problem and will be taking steps not to feel that way again, but I also wouldn't be surprised if others felt the same. Take it as a weird kind of achievement maybe? Your fans have graduated to "clamouring" status!

***** Apparently this created huge issues for him though, and he sees it as a mistake.\\
IIRC, he talked about how as he approached "7pm" he'd end up rushing through the end of the chapter, with the aim of getting it up that day. Alternately, he'd end up finishing, then have to sit there and wait to post, sometimes for an hour, sometimes for a lot longer. I can't remember the exact issues he said this led to, but he attributes this method as one of the reasons that the writing of HPMOR slowed down.\\
The bottom line was that he ended up thinking that that inflexibility was a Bad Idea.

****** I'm going to guess not by changing anything physical /inside/ the true bodies, but rather just overwhelming the signal between the true body and the yeerk tissue. Since it's not too energy-intensive to create radio waves, it's probably also not too Expensive to create the special Z-waves or whatever. The seeming teleportation would be practically free then.

I'm still having a hard time figuring out the rules, though, because the haggling etc that the animorphs did, along with Ellimist/Crayak needing Cassie to willingly sacrifice herself as her own idea, doesn't fit into what I'd expect if the rules were as simple as he says they are. I'm looking forward to clarification on that front.
