Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I think the life of uploads in a simulation provides great potential for storytelling, but I have yet to find a justification for why everyone wouldn't have the ability to teleport anywhere, conjure items, and contact anyone the majority of the time. Is there a way to place this restriction on the setting without making it take place in a school or prison of some kind?

EDIT: I finally figured out how to explain it after posting the same question on [[/r/eclipsephase][r/eclipsephase]] as an example of what could happen in the setting: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/eclipsephase/comments/7akt8t/advice_for_simulspace_habitat/dpbl1iqhttps://www.reddit.com/r/eclipsephase/comments/7akt8t/advice_for_simulspace_habitat/dpbl1iq]]

*** Maybe they've bought into the idea of artificial scarcity as a way of making things and places more meaningful. Take a look at the variety of Minecraft servers to maybe get some ideas about what people find fun or worthwhile. Maybe this is a reaction against insane levels of interconnectedness and a glut of content.

**** This is the best suggestion I've heard, but I have trouble buying into the idea of artificial scarcity. I guess having the characters live in an unjust social order makes for good stories, but it's hard not to view this society as one that explicitly believes that an economic underclass should exist or people should be denied access to information when resources are not actually limited. As much as I fear living in Brave New World, this scenario makes me think of a Objectivist-flavored 1984 where people revere “hard work” for its own sake and that's used to rationalize power over others.

***** Well, I've sucked the joy out of more than a few games by cheating at them. Single player web games especially are generally very easy to cheat at, and in my experience, that robs them of their entertainment value faster than anything else. It's not so much about valuing hard work by itself, it's that hard work brings meaning to acquisition, relationships, and experiences, in a way that just typing in a console command does not (and I say this as someone who has typed in a lot of console commands in my time).

That's not to say that scarcity within the simulation has to be like scarcity in real life. You could, for example, establish a baseline of living (and/or information) that people would get for "free". Things can be "scarce" without being zero-sum, and you could structure rewards such that they're /only/ valuable because they were worked for, meaning that if I gave you a diamond that I trawled through a cave and fought off zombies for, you would just be getting a worthless chunk of carbon, while I still had the bragging rights and lived experience.

My guess is that without any restrictions on the simulation, a fair number of people would do this on their own, because people /like/ the meaning that effort brings to things. People playing videogames will often set restrictions for themselves like "no fast travel" or "no magic" /even in the absence of the game acknowledging that/.

****** This does make sense. When people have their needs taken care of they often create work for themselves to stave off boredom, though I have trouble seeing the benefits of restricting local teleportation and telepathy when that means people can physically restrain others and couldn't call for help.

My original motive with this idea is to rationalize visually surreal adventures like anime from Studio Trigger. Space is a malleable construct and the right code can do anything so things get weird fast. Criminals use illegal code to break the rules and the police can warp reality to stop them.

The problem is that there seem to be logical safety features for users that altruistic admins would include that make it difficult to create narrative tension in traditional ways. I dislike the trope of characters having their fantastic abilities taken away, so I need to explain why people wouldn't have them to begin with.

I could put this idea into Eclipse Phase, which has interesting potential conflicts in a setting where everyone's brain is always connected to the internet, but it treats simulations as if they're just like reality with customizable physics without going into detail about how specific rules can work or why they are put into place.

**** [[http://localroger.com/casodycs.html][A short spinoff]] from /The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect/ addresses this.

#+begin_quote
  Born before the Change he and his friends crafted a vision of how the casino experience could be perpetuated in a world where anybody could have anything just for asking.

  Their answer was simplicity itself; their casinos are their worlds and while you are visiting them you can't have anything you want from Prime Intellect. You must buy everything with Bugsies. It is naturally considered a great privilege to live in such an environment for any length of time. There were of course other casinos; you could even have Prime Intellect build you one just for asking, but that didn't mean you could get people to visit.

  --------------

  Orville Piazza was the biggest, most corpulently unhealthful and all around ugly person I'd ever met. My own people eschew what the elders call "big magic" but most of us slow and eventually stop our ageing. Some of us will get a little older and then regress, a few even back to adolescence. But why would anyone allow themselves to get fat, slovenly, balding, and have badly aligned stained teeth? Much less smoke cigars, when there were much more efficient and pleasant means of self-stimulation?

  "You are shocked at my appearance," he said, and while his voice scolded his eyes twinkled.

  "It's a bit startling. Is there a reason?"

  "My own rules, Galan. Casinos are about decadence and corruption. I have never liked casino hosts with perfect smiles and measured patter. I want a man who will gamble with me. Come, let me show you around."

***** I don't get the appeal of the casino restrictions when people can go anywhere else for the same experience without restrictions. I guess it makes sense as a temporary indulgence, but why would anyone want to indulge in “corruption” instead of just being decadent in private? Anyone who sees nonconsensual control over other people as a desirable state of affairs, aside from as punishment, has a mental illness that prevents then from feeling empathy.

I think you are significantly underestimating the amount of people who evaluate and cherish their privileges (e.g. the amount of wealth, political power, etc) only because they are able to see those privileges in the frame of reference made out of the relevant poverty and suffering of others. I don't know where to look for accurate data for proving either of us wrong on this though.

That was the point of the first quoted paragraph in my previous comment: in a utopian society where almost everything is abundant for everyone, the lack of restrictions itself becomes a restriction for those who value it for one reason or another. If you treat the limitation of resources as a resource itself, then this newly-defined kind of resource becomes very scarce in a post-utopian society (especially in one where various human rights are guaranteed), and whoever has demand for it will only become more desperate in “getting” it for themselves.

*** How about etiquette?

Let's assume the world is broken up into realms. Each realm has some curators who are responsible for the look-and-feel of the place.

This week, /s/rational is set up like a fantasy pub. There's heavy wood tables, a surly bartender, and NPCs glowering at us from corners. We decide to drop in.

#+begin_quote
  Teleport Anywhere
#+end_quote

We teleport into /s/rational. When we do, we end up in an "entryway" / "cloakroom." The door has a "parchment" with the sim's rules tacked on it. One of the standard rules is that we're supposed to wear theme-appropriate costumes.

You point out that my Zardoz outfit, while extremely accurate, doesn't quite meet the theme. So, we summon appropriate costumes and go in to look for the normal Wednesday group.

The /s/rational mods are pretty chill, so the code doesn't actually prevent teleportation within the simulation. In practice, teleportation is seen as pretty obnoxious. It's similar to slipping into a friend's house without knocking. You might be welcome, but no one wants someone appearing behind them when they're watching the TV.

Other simulations are stricter. Using teleportation in /s/EarthPorn is like using a bike in the Chicago Marathon. You could probably do it. But anyone who notices is going to be pissed. And you're going to get banned.

#+begin_quote
  Conjure Items
#+end_quote

You're welcome to conjure anything you want when you're in your personal sandbox. But these private sandboxes look like eclectic piles of junk. We picked /s/rational because we like theme. And so we're not supposed to summon things unless they're thematically appropriate.

Again, some sims are stricter than others. You could summon a Chevrolet Camaro in the middle of someone's Renaissance sim. But it would be about as popular as bringing your own boombox to a jazz bar. You might get away with it for a couple minutes. But everyone's going to be annoyed, and you'll get kicked.

Some curators probably use an AutoMod variant to manage bans. So, being obnoxious in one sim might get you kicked from a bunch of others, too.

#+begin_quote
  Contact Anything
#+end_quote

This is the easiest one. You can send anyone a message. But they might not see it for a while.

It's extremely rude to check "invisible" messages when you're near people. Doing that conveys that they're so boring that you'd rather play minesweeper than talk to them. And, it makes them suspect that you're not really paying attention in any future interaction.

The easiest thing is to just turn off all messages until I'm ready to read them in bulk.

*** Try thinking about the physical constraints of the simulation environment. Suppose the environment is a matryoshka brain of some sort. Communication from one side to another could take quite some time (dependent on radius). If uploads experience an accelerated existence relative to meat-forms, the delay could be significant. One might actually have to "travel" to get to interesting places.

Or you might think beyond the simulation environment. Instead of sending meat-people to distant stars, they might send uploads. Someone has to go, right?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You probably aren't welcome on every random server you might find.

#+begin_quote
  conjure items
#+end_quote

You'd have to imagine it, and define it first. Then again, what is an item to a sim? A subroutine that does something?

#+begin_quote
  contact anyone

*** It's an inefficient use of computing resources.

Imagine a specific supercomputer, built of a array of 1m^{3} cubes. Each cube has enough processing capacity to simulate a 1 km cube of virtual space at 1 000 000x speed, and can communicate with its (physical) neighbors with a ping time of ~6e-9 seconds, or 1% of the speed of light.

The raw physical constraints of such a system means that at least 99.9999999999999% of physical detail is lost (which is fine, nobody cares about a specific iron atom in one dust speck), but also that the speed of long-range causality in the simulation can't be higher than 3 km/s, because neighboring realms can only communicate so quickly. Much like not simulating a specific iron atom in one dust speck, not simulating an accurate speed of light is a worthwhile tradeoff that allows for literally thousands of times as much utility as the alternatives.

At that speed, it would take over an hour to reach the other side of the Earth traveling straight through the core. It's likely that all of the useless empty space would be filled, but that's still a hard limit on travel.

*** Latency. Interacting with people not on your local server cluster means delays, which will matter a lot more if you are in a virtuality. Imagine all your reflexes and responses having different timings to them depending who you are talking to in a gathering? Easy to ignore if you are text chatting, not so easy to ignore for full-fidelity sex or "Medieval Melee Tourney Reenactment society 4000"\\
This applies in spades if the clockrate is high, tough I would not expect it to be if the people inside interact with the non-uploaded much.

Also, information security. If you live in the cloud, malware is not a joke, so it is entirely possible moving from one server to another involves an extremely exaustive review of the code that is you.

Also, dedicated game-worlds within the upload community will as a matter of course have entirely arbitrary restrictions.

*** You're wondering why simulations are so limiting compared to what's possible? Basically, a life without limitations fucks with human-level psyches too much. The first sim they made was a glorious paradise with every environment imaginable, complete user control, and a instant communication system that ran off of the registry - everything we thought people would want. But all of these things led to problems.

Sims with instant travel quickly develop two user patterns. The first group of people jump around for the first couple weeks, soaking up experiences they never had before, then they get homesick and go somewhere like home. After that, they don't actually travel again - the potential to go anywhere at any time is more rewarding than actually going. The other group of people /never/ settle down. They jump day to day or even faster, always worried that there's some amazing experience they're not getting, and their stress levels are through the roof.

Both of these patterns cause problems with a human's need for social interactions. Much like how minority groups in meatspace want to be part of their community in contrast to the majority, uploads want to be part of an upload community. Obviously they don't mind interacting with the real world or with AI, but it's not as satisfying long-term. So the nomads are obviously lacking on those long-term relationships - sure they get buddies who are in Point A and also going to Point B, but then one person wants to go to C and someone else wants to go to G and they split and rejoin again, but they can't break their patterns long enough to form long-term companionship /even though/ they can contact each other at any time. There's no physicality.

Meanwhile, the people who settle down form communities just like you see in meatspace. Except they can teleport at any time and contact each other at any time. Stalking and harassment go through the roof and privacy plummets. People start mass-blocking each other or hiding in their personal user spaces like prisoners. They become ghosts, bound to one place and unable to interact with anyone around them. The folks who get the hell out of these collapsing communities either become really miserable nomads or try to settle somewhere that hasn't undergone that same collapse yet - often destabilizing the social circles and /causing/ its collapse.

By this point, huge swathes of the population are miserable (not everyone, of course - never /everyone/). A few of the clever ones try to bring the whole thing crashing down with them, and they typically do it by spawning as much memory-consuming crap as they can. They never succeed, of course, but they can stress out local areas of a simulation.

So these days, sims avoid all that. There might be teleportation options, but they're set locations. Travel inherently takes time and often requires traveling intervening spaces. This cuts down on nomads, who now have incentive to slow down and enjoy things because few people want to spend their whole life on a train or what have you, and cuts down on the inherent reward enough that the settlers actually need to go places to really enjoy the potential of the sim. You also ensure that you can have private spaces in common areas, instead of having to worry about some creep always finding you. Conjuring is usually limited to special places as well, to cut down on griefers and keep the sim a little simpler and cheaper. And communication is designed around meat analogs, like post or phones. This way the users aren't overwhelmed and it's harder to harass each other. Happiness is /way/ higher with all of these adjustments made.
