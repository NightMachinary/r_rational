Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

For instance, I just don't have much visceral reaction to the idea of death anymore; in fact, it sounds pretty chill most of the time. But I anticipate that I will strongly prefer to be alive in the future.

I believe that my conscious experience will continue, if not improve, after my death. Perhaps this allows my to perceive death as an acceptable part of existence rather than an obstacle to be overcome, but I can't know for sure since I can't cease to follow my belief system.

So that argument doesnt hold up. HPMOR also argued that its motivated reasoning to deal with the terribe reality that is death, IIRC, which strikes me as the much more reasonable explanation.

I admire HJPEV's goals and his resolve in pursuing them, but I have accepted death as inevitable and sometimes even admirable even if I support the extension of life.

In his sequences, Yudkowsky talked about how rationalists shouldn't think of religious or spiritual ideas any differently from the scientific and material world, but I think atheists don't understand religious belief because they've never felt it. I've heard of evidence that (a)theism may be genetic, and I am inclined to believe that is the case.

I mean, God being God, He could find some very evidentially clear way to make Himself heard /if he really wanted to/, so I continue to range my religious opinion between "there are no gods" and "the gods are mysterian dickwad philosophy sophomores who deliberately spite our everyday reasoning about evidence and likelihood".

****** I am currently an atheist, but I was raised Christian and considered myself a rational Christian from the age 8 (when I decided to identify of my own volition instead of by default) to 16 (when I deconverted).

I had had what I, at the time, thought of as religious experiences. It was only when those experiences abruptly stopped once I started questioning my faith that I realised the atheistic explanation (that I had only ever felt what I'd expected to feel and had misattributed the cause) was far more probable.

Perhaps atheism is genetic, but if so it seems odd that its rise would be so quick. The timescale suggests a cultural explanation.

In my case, the cause was increasing education and the ensuing scrutiny of my religious beliefs. That broke the feedback loop of "religious experiences → confirmation of beliefs → religious experiences", which led naturally to atheism (and eventually to "hard" atheism, i.e. "there are almost certainly no gods").

******* My personal theory is that atheism always existed, but wasn't publicly accepted in western culture until recently so those who didn't believe kept quiet. I'm curious about atheists who can claim to have once believed, but no longer do, since it was my hypothesis that they never actually believed. It was because of rationality, and it's preponderance of atheists, that I adopted such a belief since I frequently got the impression that atheists didn't understand faith and probably couldn't. If that is false, then I'd definitely like to know.

In my case, education did not impact my religious experiences, it simply defied my mental model that explained them. As a practitioner of New Age, I was distraught when I discovered how many of my beliefs were based on bad science, paranormal hoaxes, and the statements of people who were more likely to be deceptive than earnest. However, none of that stopped my religious experiences from occurring, it just left me very confused as to how and why they were.

******** I think there are two distinct groups of atheists here, which may be causing some confusion.

One group, who you see a lot of on the internet, are often people who have always been atheists. They have never had religious experiences or felt the touch or voice of God, for the most part. Some never have any spiritual experiences. When they do have spiritual experiences, they don't attribute it to God. We all know this group.

Another group, who you may see on the internet as well, were once theists and believed in God. Some former theists haven't ever felt the voice of God, and so basically belong in the group above. However, many of them have had religious experiences, or felt the grace or voice of God. For example, the youtuber Evid3nc3 details his experience going from being very religious to being an atheist, and talks about hearing the voice of God in his autobiographical videos [[https://youtu.be/V-q8WZ1Ibso?t=1m20s][(link)]]. I have some friends who fall into this group, who spoke in tongues and felt the touch of the Lord on their souls, and still became atheists later, even if they felt these religious experiences from time to time.

Believe it or not, there are many formerly religious people who are like this; they tell stories about past religious experiences that sound /quite a bit/ like the stories about religious experiences that religious people tell. It's hard to say that all these formerly religious atheists are lying when they tell stories about religious experiences that sound the exact same as what religious people say. Although there are tons of atheists who don't understand faith, many others spent quite a lot of their lives being earnestly and truly religious. I also know former theists who never /really/ believed-- often because they never had religious experiences or felt the voice of God--but this is not true for all atheist converts, perhaps not even for most.

I do agree that in the past, people who became atheist, whether they had once felt God or not, would be unlikely to say they were atheist out loud compared to today.

********* I think a part of the answer there is that there is a category we might call "mystical experiences" that are a function of neurochemistry/mindstate, and that many religious rituals like prayer or meditation are conducive to putting a person in that mindstate.

And I suspect that many converted atheists are reluctant to be blatant about it because they are all too aware that they were already wrong at least once, and have a degree of sympathy for those who still hold to their religious beliefs. That latter part will vary depending on how much pressure they experience as a result of their (de)conversion.

#+end_quote

I really don't think that HPMoR "showed" anything of the kind. It talked about the subject, but that's just talk. And really not all that much talk.

If one of my immediate family was offered their dream job, and would therefore be permanently moving overseas to a scenic and culturally rich location, sadly without phone or internet access - I'd be happy for them having the opportunity, but I'd still miss them.

The Longbottoms' case is simple enough to answer. They're neither dead nor mindless. Very injured, yes; but without far greater understanding of the mind, it's really not possible to say what degree of consciousness and free will they retain. And /with/ that understanding - it might be possible to cure them. My own opinion is, as long as someone still has the potential of /thinking/ and /making decisions/ - not a vegetable, in other words - their life has value. The Longbottoms' potential is too hard to judge, so I would err on the side of keeping them alive - the reversible decision, in other words, rather than the irreversible one. Besides which, if I really had to judge it based on such limited knowledge, I'd say that they're still thinking. If you decided to euthanise them and approached from the front with a knife, I expect that they would react and try to run or defend themselves.

  Why do people say they don't want to live forever?
#+end_quote

When people talk about why they don't want to live /a long time/, the answer seems to be the fear of aging, enfeeblement, senility. Now it's probably not likely that most people think "live /forever/" means "re-enact the myth of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonus][Tithonus]]" but there's certainly the imagined stress or boredom of ages wearing down on one---even Christianity has to posit a world absolutely free of suffering to go along with its immortal future existence, and that's a much harder problem than just making humans immortal.

To put it another way... it seems they'd rather have the fifty years of torture than the 3^^^3 specks of dust.

Only semi-related, but I'm also left baffled by how many people value their autonomy in choosing whether to die more than they value not dying. I think someone can only really have the thought "well sure, I'd like to live indefinitely if possible, but I'd want the means to end it if I change my mind" if they've literally never experienced a suicidal urge. Anyone who has ever wanted to die and currently doesn't want to die is implicitly better off for having not gotten their earlier wish. Your self a million years in the future who's totally happy with their life is much better off for your self a hundred years in the future being unable to kill themselves.

You aren't really imagining the worst case scenario... what if human minds partially break down after thousands of years of usage for reasons that are deeply and intrinsically a part of them (as in not just the neurons, but the algorithms the neuron implement, so that even brain uploading can't prevent this). You then continue to exist till the heat death of the universe in a state with just enough awareness and cognitive ability to suffer but not enough to do anything enjoyable or meaningful.

That is a very particular scenario, but there are a lot of intermediate scenarios that are similar if not quite as bad. There should be some kind of escape mechanism to allow you a way out of scenarios like that. As the question about immorality is posed to people, they often think of a magical absolute condition, so they are rightly cautious of scenarios like I posed. For something more plausible considering real world physics, consider mind uploading implemented by an AI that always views human existence as a net positive and wouldn't let you die, even if you own internal perspective was continuous suffering for internal reasons related to your mind operation that the AI wasn't allowed to modify.

I am not saying the suicide switch should be easy, just that there should be some way out.

** A random discussion with a friend of mine resulted in the question: What are good measures for "Real costs" of things as money is more abstract?

We didn't come up with a particularly good answer, but one suggestion was energy.

We're not photosynthetic, nor do we have star trek replicators where you can input energy and output objects, but I'd imagine it's likely a component of any measure of real cost.

Which lead to the discussion of post-energy scarcity. Renewable are the only thing that don't inherently require us to expend X to get energy, though they do require the production and maintenance of things that allow us to do so.

Which led me to wonder if something like a solar panel ultimately produces more energy over it's life time than is invested in creating it, and if it and other renewables are net gains in "real cost," whatever that is.

My googlefoo failed me on checking energy investment vs. energy returns on solar panels, though.

This is kinda a rambly post, but there's a lot of stuff here I'm interested in seeing discussion from in this community.

I can imagine trying to handwave local issues, purchasing power, costs (or benefits) to third parties... but economists call that "ideal prices" (mostly) and it's a lot more abstract.

For googlefoo, look up "embodied energy solar panels" - it depends on the exact technology and location, but typically it takes 1-4 years to return all energy used in production and they have a life of ~10 times that afterwards.

It would be meaningfully useful to distinguish it from "price cost" since they're measuring different things. "Total energy cost" would be something like the raw expenditure of effort required to bring some good into usable existence, whereas "price cost" subsumes "total energy cost" into a desirability/opportunity cost analysis.

*** I will say that I've never noticed any major problem with the Hugos. Looking back, reading the novel that won (and often winners of other categories) has almost always satisfied me. Here is what I recall from the past few years of reading:

I enjoyed /Redshirts: A Novel with Three Codas/ from 2013, and consider it one of the best "portal fantasy" novels (and one of the few "reverse portal fantasy" novels) ever. I highly recommend it for any reader of sci-fi, and anyone who finds portal fantasy interesting. It's not really a deconstruction of portal fantasy, but it's more like, before /Redshirts/, I thought I had many good portal fantasy stories. Afterward, I realized I never had before. Although it didn't win the award, /Immersion/ by Aliette De Bodard was very good, especially to anyone who has anti-establishment ideas.

In 2014, /Ancillary Justice/ was great, and I really liked the ideas of artificial intelligence and collective identity / group intelligence that it explored. It wasn't quite as strong as the 2013 and 2015 novels, which is why I think people complain about gender stuff in /Ancillary Justice/. I didn't notice the gender stuff until people brought my attention to it after I finished the novel. While reading, just figured "oh these people have an unusual culture" and never thought about it deeply; my friends who excitedly brought this novel to my attention later seemed to find a lot more meaning in this than I did. /The Water that Falls on You from Nowhere/ is one of my favorites as well. It involves a gay couple, which I guess upset some people?

In 2015, /The Three Body Problem/ was astonishingly good. I think it has even been posted in this subreddit. As with /Redshirts/, this is literally one of the greatest novels I've read. It got several of my friends who aren't big sci-fi readers into sci-fi; my parents, who have been reading sci-fi for ages, like it. I like it. I think it's one of those really enduring sci fi novels. I can't really comment on the winners of the other categories; it seems like "No Award" won a lot.

I haven't read /The Fifth Season/, the 2016 novel winner yet, but given how good my experiences have always been reading Hugo award winners, I see no reason not to use the Hugos. Most of the time, they line up with the Nebula awards anyways. For example, /Ancillary Justice/, which I suspect is what people are complaining about, /won/ the Nebula in its year. Other winners got through the nomination problem, too; /The Three-Body Problem/ was nominated, as was /The Fifth Season/. The fact that Scalzi's /Redshirts/ didn't get nominated for a Nebula in 2013 mostly makes me think that the Nebula people dropped the ball there. /Redshirts/ is great. I read /Binti/ recently and enjoyed it as well. It's good to see it got some recognition. This one seemed to directly address themes related to race, species, power, and war, so I could see how people might dislike it, but it's also just a great sci fi novella, definitely worth a read.

Edit: given how good /Redshirts/ was and the fact it doesn't address themes of race or gender, I'm surprised people are getting up in Scalzi's business. It seems there are more explicitly leftist works to critique.

The primary criticism was that the speculative elements were almost entirely superfluous, leaving many with the impression that it won as a means of giving an award to a gay!PoC!story, even if that story only qualified for a /Hugo/ by a generous fig leaf. Personally, I liked the story well enough as a character piece, I just thought it wasn't really SF/F.

Imagine if 50 Shades of Gray had been a slightly different story. In the actual book, the protagonist meets Gray because her roommate got sick. If she met Gray because her roommate came down sick with /lycanthropy/, and that was the only remotely plot-relevant instance of lycanthropy, or any kind of sci-fi or fantasy element, or any exploration of that phenomenon beyond some trite social class signalling, then, irrespective of any arguments about quality, would you accept the story even qualified as SF/F to begin with?

The water has no purpose in the story beyond stripping the protagonist of agency, and a cheap shot at "frat guys", and it spawns a thousand actually interesting questions that are never brought up at all.

***** Oh, interesting, I hadn't thought about it that way. Although I personally found the story interesting (as opposed to 50 Shadows of Gray), I could see how someone who was much a sci-fi purist might dislike that it got an award. As someone of Asian descent, I don't usually find it sticks out when there are Asian characters in a story, but I see how it could for others. I'm willing to let in most borderline things to count as sci-fi even if the ideas aren't fully explored, but I can see how a purist might not like the central conceit in that short story.

Still, it seems like the point I made holds true for novels (which are the biggest awards), and the anti-Scalzi stuff in the top-level post of this thread doesn't make sense at all. /Redshirts/ doesn't feature gay people or people of color, and like the other winners it was at least nominated for the Nebula (which Ancillary Justice /won/). And, whatever you might say about /The Water/, it's still a good piece and nominally a sci-fi piece. People talk about the Hugos like they're a joke, but the awarded stories seem uniformly good reads. There's always some sort of bias with any award, especially one determined by voting.

I didn't mind the conceit that much in itself. I was /really/ bothered that absolutely no one had a comment or thought about the end of water scarcity, the implications for conservation of mass and energy, societal implications of /always-on perfect truth-detecting/, etc. Instead we just get a cliched bit about LOLStupidFratGuys, and I can't help but suspect that if the butts of that joke had been hipsters or hippies, it would never have won.

Haven't read Scalzi or Justice, so I can't comment. As I understand it, the complaint from the Sads had always been primarily about /cliquishness/ with a veneer of political snobishness, and that the issue hadn't been so much about the broader culture wars until Vox and the Rabids starting setting out military grade SJW bait. Scalzi was emphatically part of the clique. I think it was for a different con/award, but I just saw a SS of tweets from Stephen King where he claimed that a con insider had told him that if he came, and /sat at the right table/, he could be guaranteed an award. That sort of thing was the heart of the accusations against Scalzi. He paid his dues, and sat at the right tables, so he got his awards. That the (primarily white/straight/progressive) people at those tables were the sort to judge each other by conspicuous displays of interest in diversity was the spark that was fanned into the current clusterfuck.

I hadn't paid attention to the Hugos before the drama. I was just vaguely aware that it was a thing sometimes mentioned on a cover. My main takeaway from spending too much time reading about all this is that in many categories, over many years, the number of nominations submitted in total was so pathetically small as to render the whole notion of The Fan Award meaningless. It was little better than a SurveyMonkey poll organized by an insular book club. And now that there are actually sizable numbers of nominators/voters involved, the whole thing has devolved into a politicized disaster, complete with vote-buying schemes.

I'll stick to picking personal recommendations, or going by cover blurbs, I think.

*** That short story was nominated but didn't win (obviously)...

It's been my experience that discounting anything from people using the term SJW is a good heuristic to have, so I have difficulty believing their claims that the Hugo were gamed before and I'd need a non-biased source for me to consider it.

That said, over the years, I've read quite a few novels who won the Hugo awards and I've found them to be consistently above average although admittedly I've read much more novels from more than 20 years ago so it speaks more of the quality of the Hugo awards in the past...

Of recent novels, I agree with blazinghand's assessment of the best novels awards from the past 3 years:

- Redshirts was a very good reverse portal fantasy.. It's not hard SF which is what I prefer but it's the best example of reverse portal fantasy I've read
- The Three-Body Problem is really good and a must read
- China Miéville The City and The City is a cool concept

Ok, now we really need a yearly rational award. One that judges:

- the best rationalist original story
- the best rational original story
- the best rationalist fanfiction
- the best rational fanfiction
- the best almost-rational novel

It'd be fun to vote for this every year :-)

Well, they aren't lying about last year seeing more No Award results than the whole previous history of the awards, right? I think the obvious conclusion is that any award that's influenced by politics to such a degree is going to be shit as an unbiased indicator of popularity.

In my opinion, it doesn't really matter who started it, what the sides are, and what kinds of terms are being thrown around, the simple fact that the results are very significantly influenced by politics is undeniable.

***** I don't consider No Award results as a sign that the award is influenced by politics.

For example, if you look at this [[https://voxday.blogspot.ca/2015/06/if-you-were-award-my-love.html]] which has been nominated for Best Short Story, there's no way any judge with integrity would give an award to this because it's just not worthy of an award not because of political reason but because it's of extremely poor quality and not a SF Short Story.

I haven't taken the time to look at the Best Related Work submissions but if you just look at some of the titles "SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police", "Safe Space as Rape Room", I think they're probably not deserving of an award regardless of the political content.

What I do agree with and that Sad Puppies/Rabbid Puppies have demonstrated is that the nomination process is heavily gameable but I don't think they've proven anything else.

Every bit of decision power exerted in service of politics is a bit not serving the actual purpose of the awards. The actual final results would have been very different if no politics were involved, ergo the results were influenced and have turned into something they weren't supposed to be. They are no longer a good indicator of what fandom likes. Puppies nominate stuff which the old guard doesn't want to win, so the old guard votes No Award rather than voting for the stuff the actually like. Each No Award represents a deserving work not being honoured due to politics. If that's not politics influencing the results, then I don't know what is.

This is a bit uncharitable, but it looks to me you are motivated more by desire to oppose people using the "SJW" term, rather than desire to be factually correct here.

******* Well, what I meant is that I've looked at the results in 2016. There were two categories that received No Awards and since I haven't read the works, I do not know if the nominated works should have gotten an award. But for example, in the case of the short story I linked to, then yes, a no award is absolutely better than that short story since it's clearly trash and should have been nominated in the first place (did you read it? there's no way that this could be called a deserving work).

Now, I've looked at the 2015 results since I made the previous answer and I do see more categories that received "No award" and it looks a lot weirder in that the titles that have been passed over don't seem to be trash (like that vox short story). I haven't read any of the works that have been passed over so I do not know if they are good and I would need to read them to form an opinion... Do you have any specific stories or novels that have been passed over that you can recommend?

Regardless, if the system can be gamed so that trash can be nominated, then there's a real problem. The no award is either a consequence of that or it's people voting against things for political reasons, I cannot know that until I've read the work (which I would have done if I were voting).

That's what I was getting at from the very beginning. I don't know why you're so fixated at the final voting stage (although I have an uncharitable suspicion again). If the worthy candidates fail to even get through to the final voting stage (and thus the voters feel there is no choice but to vote No Award), then obviously the system is fucked. And the reasons for the system being fucked are clearly political. That's it, there is no need to take sides or anything, it's a simple observation that the correspondence of the awards to the quality/popularity of the works has been compromised.

I do not disagree with what you are saying. However, to alleviate your confusion, I would note that there is a common saying in the rationalist community that that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][politics]] is [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kkp/politics_is_hard_mode/][spiders]]. This is easy to forget!

It's very easy to say "ah, right, politics is spiders" when you're not talking about politics. It's hard to actually remember politics is spiders when you're covered in +spiders+ politics. I suspect the reason there seems to be a lot of point count fluctuations in this thread are the politics-spider attacks. I've given everyone below +1 an upvote to try to smooth things out a bit, since I don't think anyone is actually negatively contributing to the discussion.

In any case, if you discuss something related to politics, even if you're making a super benign observation, don't be surprised when spiders show up.

********* I did say in my second message that the nomination stage has been blatantly gamed in the past few years.

So, either we have a situation that is created by the Sad/Rabbid puppies crowd by gaming the nominations but that is corrected by the final voting stage. In that case, the puppies crowd which is complaining is the one at fault. And the Hugo award for the years before the Puppies started is a useful indicator of what fans like.

Or, we have a situation where the puppies are right, they nominate good quality work and that work is passed over because the rest of the voters vote against it regardless of the quality of the work (and without reading the work in question according to the puppies group). In the second case, the award then amounts to nothing and is suspect even in the years before the puppies came to scene.

I believe that it's more likely that it's the first situation (and this is due to my bias against groups using the SJW term) and that would mean that the award is still useful as long as any trash that gets nominated gets a no award and awards are still delivered to quality work. So, in that case, the question is if the no award system saves the quality of the award which is why I'm fixated in the second part of the voting. As an example, in 2015, the three body problem got the votes despite the sad puppies campaign and having read that novel, I think it clearly deserves it and having 'no awards' compared to awards given to work that doesn't deserve it means that while the hugo awards are less useful than if the nominations weren't gamed, they still are useful.

If, however, we're in the second situation and the puppies are right, then the hugo awards have been useless for years and a better award system would be good.

I cannot determine for sure if we're in the first situation or in the second situation until I've read works that were in categories where "No award" was voted and see if they are really good quality work that deserve to be voted (and that would still be rather subjective). This is why I asked if you knew any good quality work that got passed over? I would then read them and form an opinion.

So, I think we've kind of been talking past each other. For me, my concern was against or not what the puppies say is true or not. That's what I meant by what you first quoted. I'm just skeptical of the puppies claims and motivations for trying to destroy the award.

I also agree there's a problem. I never said that nominations have not been gamed. And I see the No Awards given to categories as the group as a whole fighting back against bad nominations.

I think I disagree on this (almost technical) point. Not that the nominations are being influenced (which they clearly are), but the fact that the final voting stage corrects them. See, if there were no political shenanigans, then the nominee list would be different and people would be free to actually vote for what they like, instead of strategic voting, which is taking place. The final results would be different from what is actually happening. Since the results differ from the counterfactual results in hypothetical politics-free hugo, I can't really say that the votes correct anything when the shortlists are bad. The old-timers are fighting back against "bad" nominations, but if the best they can do is No Award, then we may as well just stop running the awards altogether.

Well, that's exactly where we really differ. I used the Hugo awards to decide which books to read in the past but mostly for awards in the distant past. Knowing if the awards given before the whole puppies thing started could be useful in finding good books is what I'm interested in.

I'll read Totaled and report back here... It will be a good test.

EDIT: I've read Totaled. It's not bad at all and it's certainly not trash. It's not a very original concept but the execution is good. I haven't read as many short stories that received hugo awards compared to novels, so I don't have as much of a frame of reference. Of the few I read, it's definitely not as memorable and original as Flowers for Algernon, Exhalation, Robbie and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream but execution is good.

So the claims that it didn't receive a reward for political reasons at least have a chance of not being nonsense. Not the definitive evidence it would have been if something on the level of Exhalation was passed up, but then again, you don't see something like that every year.

In the end, I don't think this is a reliable way to judge the quality of the awards before the puppies started their campaign. Totaled was nominated when the politically motivated voting was at the all time high, after all.

If you're interested in more works that the sad puppies thought were deserving you can check their 2016 list [[http://file770.com/?p=28038][here]]. I'm not sure I could honestly imagine anyone who was protesting that list of nominations as being motivated by anything other than politics. I mean, when rabid puppies nominate stuff like space raptor butt invasion they are definitely up to no good, but it looks to me like sad puppies are actually interested in submitting worthy works, SJW usage and media smear campaigns notwithstanding. Not like it's going to matter: people who were interested in trying to reform the awards peacefully have pretty much given up at this point, it looks like.

************ Just a small update. I've been reading the rants some more (it's a bit of a guilty pleasure for me) and have upon more works that should/shouldn't have won according to Vox:

- Pierce Brown apparently didn't even get nominated. Might be worth checking out.

- According to Vox, /The Fifth Season/ is undeserving of the award it received. Another opportunity for you to read a (hopefully) decent book and see if the claims of people giving out undeserved awards hold any water.

This is less relevant, but apparently they also refused to give an award to Jim Butcher last year, although they relented this year.
