Thanks to all who participated and voted in the Secret Krampus contest! The week is up, and it's time to announce the winners, based on whose story and prompt were top of their respective threads when they came out of contest mode. (Story thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jduvv6/secret_krampus_story_voting/][here]], prompt thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jdvlgd/secret_krampus_prompt_voting/][here]].)

First, congratulations to this year's prompt contest winner, [[/u/ExiledQuixoticMage]]! Their prompt: "A genre savvy crew assemble for a mission. The problem? They all think they're in a different genre."

In fact, it was this very prompt that inspired this year's story contest winner. Congratulations to [[/u/Pandomy]] for their story [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27093310][Differing Perspectives]]! This is a very fun story that deftly ties together something like five different genres, and I hope anyone who hasn't yet will check it out.

Both first-place winners will receive Reddit Platinum. I'd also like to shout out our runners-up, who will receive Reddit Gold: [[/u/ExiledQuixoticMage][u/ExiledQuixoticMage]] with [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3iWPgp-msE5rllAyLT2toN8WJNx8qCd8a-5SkTBxns/edit?usp=sharing][The World in His Hands]], a creative and richly textured story that gave me big feelings, and [[/u/honoredb]] with "How do you negotiate with a meme?", a clever prompt that unfortunately didn't get a story written for it.

I hope everyone had fun reading and writing, and thanks again to [[/u/xamueljones]] for coming up with the idea for this contest and running it last year. Maybe someone will pick up the mantle next year and we can make it a tradition!


** I'd like to thank the academy.

** Thank you for running this contest. And congratulations to ExiledQuixoticMage and Pandomy!

I had a lot of fun participating in this. I'm one of those people who always wants to write, but never gets around to it. Having an actual deadline helped a lot.

** Pandomy, I'mma be totally up-front here, when I read your story I couldn't even vote for /my own story/ in good conscience, yours was too much better.

Well done, and I tip my hat to you.
