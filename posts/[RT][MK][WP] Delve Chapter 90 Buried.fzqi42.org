** I've enjoyed the story progressing the plot and all, but I'm glad that we're finally back to the core of the Delve story: Rain sitting down, doing math, and grinding stats. (kidding, I actually like this part)

It seems weird that Rain's trying to math out and get strong to move some boulders. Getting caught in a cave in is a regular story trope that happens, and I don't think I've ever seen "grind stats" so you can move the rocks. It feels like he could leverage... well anything else.

Like, wouldn't just trying to dig out the rocks all day, give you the stat that helps most for moving the rocks. Or doing anything with infinite water and freezing/heating that. Or arguably Purify has that /conceptual thing/ where it can dissolve nonstandard targets so it could consider the rocks as really big dirt.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if this were any story but Delve, I feel like "sitting down and grinding stats" would be the wrong answer.

*** Even more than that, those rocks are rubble, so it's not like it's entirely out of purify's wheelhouse of getting rid of unwanted trash. It can dissolve bodies, so it's not an issue of mass or size. I feel liked doing anything before even trying to purify his problem away is the wrong answer in this situation.

**** I don't know how far he could stretch "Purify poison, corruption, and contamination", but I suspect that calling a boulder "contamination" is a step too far.

(This part is related, just bear with me.) The difference between wrought iron (which is very soft, weak, and malleable) and steel (which is hard, strong, and may be malleable or brittle) is the inclusion of carbon and sometimes other impurities. If it wasn't for the mana-absorbing properties of metal, then Rain might be able to turn steel into iron and weaken objects that way.

I'm not familiar enough with geology or the interaction of mana and stone to say if it would work, but removing the impurities from the stones themselves might be worth a try.

***** Rain also purifies dirt that gets on clothes, and presumably little rocks and other debris that come in when people track them in from the outside since he makes areas spotless with normal cleaning.

Conceptually, he has leeway if he spends effort on it. He can stretch 'poison' to mean alcohol. It's not unreasonable to think he can stretch 'little rocks that dirty up a place' to 'big rocks that dirty up a place'.

That's not true. In just this chapter he mentioned his UI clock, and mentioned considering trying to make it give him a /calendar/.

***** True. But bodies aren't poison, corruption, or contamination, so there's already interpretation being done behind the scenes. I can see it happening as an accident of the transitive property, where dead flesh is bad news so it can clear it by default and bodies happen to be composed entirely of dead flesh, and that itself has interesting applications. But by that logic, rubble is both made of dirt and isn't any different from the normal grunge on the walls he delights in scouring away from the adventuring guild and everywhere else.

But that kind of rules lawyering isn't really necessary because we know that the class system is super fucking weird already and what rain is seeing is just a human friendly version of whatever's really happening behind the scenes, and that whatever he sees is just a translation that's magically provided by the system with zero guarantees as to accuracy. Even beyond that, bashing reality with your soul until it breaks is a HUGE part of how the system works. "There is no spoon" and all that jazz. He's demonstrated the ability to alter how purify works before, and this shouldn't be any different.

/You/ could leverage anything else, but Rain has a blindspot and considers "bigger numbers, more power" as the solution to all of his problems.

*** This is a bit of a spoiler from me being a Patreon supporter, but this comes up in the next chapter. To answer your question of why Rain is trying to math his way out instead of leveraging anything else:

Rain has a bit of a blind spot to try increasing his stats first, but in the next chapter, he'll try other ideas first that he thought of while he trains his Strength stat.

*** Yeah, idk. Rain is supposedly worried about the ceiling collapsing. He has a lot of experience as an engineer on projects where the ceiling collapses (his hobo hut), so I trust his judgement here.

I thought maybe he could try pinging people on the surface by rapidly alternating by two friendly max range auras (e.g. purify/essence well), but

#+begin_quote
  " He received scattered signals coming from above, plus a few from his own level. "
#+end_quote

I think the room he's in is actually deeper than the room where the fight took place, so idk if his range reaches the true surface.

** Oooh, so Mlem knows about Majistraal artifacts. I'm betting Rain has a nice talk with him at some point.

Still no resolution for the fight between Lavarro and Westbridge. That's going to be the major plot changer. If he dies, it's up to Rain to turn the barrier off since no one else will be able to get in. We still don't know Westbridge's motives, but I'm leaning towards him just wanting to toughen up Velika rather than betraying her to the empire or something. And that would mean his silence in response to her yelling might actually mean he's dead.

*** Him being too busy fighting Lavarro (or, y'know, being dead) might explain why he's not picking up for Velika.

That or she's just a schmuck and he's over there laughing at her rage. Either way.

***** I think I remember a scene where he tried to get Purify to do something by redefining what he thought of as 'clean'. I guess in this case he could do something like that for pee, redefining cleaning pee to be making it into water, rather than making it disappear.

It's a moot point now he has water though. Still, the extend to which Purify can be modified to your liking may lead to some interesting munchkinning.

*** I wonder if someone will get Fall to help solve that. Assuming the unlock requirement is "have Spring, Summer, and Winter unlocked", then one of the new guards could get that + Extend Aura.

Unfortunately, it would take at least 5-6 days to level the skill to level 2 (not counting the boosted rate from metamagic), never mind getting it to level 10.
