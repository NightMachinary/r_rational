** I would imagine that fourier transformations would be essential for helping filter in high background noise magical environments. Even if you only need to cast basic acoustic amplification spells. Someday she will realize she should have payed attention in class... Someday.

*** Looking forward to the next chapter, take your time sorting things out. I haven't seen much of MLP but I love this story. I really like your characterization of Twilight - the way she processes things, her interactions with everypony. Relating especially being an social anxiety prone person myself with a lot of avoidant tendencies.. It's also been great to see the consequences of an eternal night being handled realistically. Can't wait to see where this story goes.
