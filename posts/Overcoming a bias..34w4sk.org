** It's an interesting concept but the consistent misuse of the term cognitive bias detracts from the video. This isn't "understanding", it's just muscle memory.

*** i dont think thats necessarily fair, plenty of things that we think of as "conscious", like doing math, actually have a lot of muscle memory techniques. The LW types have a precise definition of cognitive bias, and thats is generally good, but i think it has a sort of "common" meaning that includes this use, and not in a way thats contradictory to the LW meaning

** I had the same experience when I switched keyboard layouts from QWERTY to colemak. Learning it wasn't that difficult, but then I realised I couldn't use a qwerty layout any more, it wasn't just slow or something, I couldn't type at all. Years and years of typing using QWERTY and it's just gone in a month.

*** So, I've used QWERTY, but I never touch typed with it (I wasn't particularly slow, though). I then, a year ago or so, taught myself to touch type on dvorak, and it basically didn't affect my ability to to use QWERTY at all (apart from the fact that I'm a little out of practice now because I usually use dvorak). I wonder if that's only because I didn't touch type with QWERTY or if it's simply different from person to person.

*** What's colemak? I taught myself dvorak a few years ago but I've forgotten it by now.

**** Another keyboard layout, that doesn't move ZXCV and comes with an [[http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1858][easier learning method]].

*** The vid suggests the knowledge is not lost; perhaps you could try typing QWERTY for 20 minutes and see if a similar brain switch is flipped. Maybe the switch itself can be trained.

It definitely can.

*** I noticed that the more often you switch between any two systems the easier the switch gets and in turn the longer ago it was that you last switched the harder it is to make the next switch.

This has been true for me at least with both languages (I speak 4) and keyboard layouts.

** I'd be really interested to try this, I used to be pretty into dinghy sailing, in which the steering is "naturally backwards".

*** It might be more difficult than you'd think, dinghies steer from the rear of the vessel, the opposite of bicycles. You might have a better sense of direction, but the method of steering could throw you off.

** An example of how ingrained certain patterns are in our brain.

Learning how to ride this "backwards-bicycle" might not be the same as changing your beliefs but I think it provides an insight on how deep these things are embedded in us, and how difficult it is to change our way of thinking.

*** That's not a way of thinking, it's just motor skills.

If you want a real challenge, try to learn to write with your feet. I doubt it's possible unless you start from a very young age though.
