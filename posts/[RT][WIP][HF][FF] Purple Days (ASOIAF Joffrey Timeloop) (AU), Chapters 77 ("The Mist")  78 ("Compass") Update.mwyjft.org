** I've read this so long ago, I barely remember where I left it. I like this story, it's pretty fun for a timeloop story, has its own twists and worldbuilding expansion (somewhat reminiscent of time braid in this regard, the fact it expands on existing cannon). I hope to see a notification for epilogue one day, so I could do a proper reread.

** Never seen this before. Anyone up for giving a more detailed summary than 'Joffrey Timeloop'? How long does Joffrey take to stop being utterly awful? In what sense is it relevantly an AU on top of a time loop?

#+end_quote

After Joffrey dies at the Purple Wedding (spoilers for /A Storm of Swords//"The Lion and the Rose") he wakes up back at his apartments in the Red Keep, three days after the death of Jon Arryn. The same thing keeps happening each time he croaks. Now he must decide what to do with this power, whether that means trying to win the game of thrones, finding some way to give meaning to his endless existence, or perhaps even learning why all this is happening to him in the first place...

#+end_quote

Chapter 7 is when Joffrey hits rock bottom and starts reforming himself. The chapters before might be a bit of a slog because Joffrey starts out as his charming canon self and reading about his stupidities can get old really quick.

#+end_quote

Joffrey eventually discovers things about his world that contradict the established lore of /Game of Thrones/ and will almost certainly contradict whatever the ending of /A Song of Ice and Fire/ ends up being.

**** It isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed reading it. A variety of *deeply* satisfying moments right in Westeros and in far-off, unknown corners of the world. I can think of two that are straight-up cathartic. And not measly “successful revenge” cathartic, like... character redemption catharsis.

Don't take chapter 1/the prologue too seriously though.

Another thing: if you do not appreciate martial training, building renown among one's troops, and moments of glory in war then multiple arcs will feel like a slog to you.

Yup. It's got the Gurren Lagann problem. It starts with a flash-forward that doesn't /quite/ wind up connecting with the rest of the story.

****** I think the author said somewhere he's got to rewrite the prologue eventually because, even if the themes fit, the exact details ended up pretty off from how the plot ended up

I never read the prologue at all, which I honestly recommend until the Author does his rewrite.

There's also some exploration of parts of the world where Martin hasn't gone, like the ruins of Valyria and an extremely prolonged arc in Yi Ti. The arc is necessary, as Joffrey learns a lot of things that he needs to know there, but it goes on a lot longer than I think it needs to.

This story is remarkable in that it takes the loathsome Joffrey right out of the show, right at the end where he had done all of the evil things that have caused so much havoc for his actor, Jack Gleeson, from people who can't distinguish fiction from reality, and actually puts him on a believable journey towards redemption.

***** The Yi Ti arc was a slog in the moment, but looking back at it as a reflection of how demanding (creative adjective to avoid spoilers) the plot is at that point for Joffrey does make it connect a bit better.

**** I personally liked the initial chapters. The ways that Joffrey gets broken down feel pretty believable for the character to me.

Though Baurus' writing skills were definitely less refined in those early chapters. Fortunately things get way better in that regard as the story progresses.

**** That's very helpful, thanks. One follow-up question: How dramatic is the AU compared to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown][Wearing Robert's Crown]]? I liked that fic (SI with knowledge of the series replaces Robert Baratheon's mind during the tail end of Robert's Rebellion, depicted entirely from other people's viewpoints), but it got /extremely/ AU around the time of Robert's death and I couldn't actually stand it. The most ridiculous thing was The Night's King or whatever term they used just... waved a hand and made the *entire Wall* contract to an ice palace in the middle of its prior length. Like the Wall had always been his own creation rather than a wall designed specifically to /keep him out/, and he could have destroyed it any time he liked.

***** Yes, it does delve into AU territory. It's hard to say the details without getting spoilery, but you know the saying about how if you give Frodo a lightsaber then you also need to give Sauron a Death Star? That principle is in play in this fic, though it takes some time for the how and why of that to become evident.

But I would say that the AU-ness is done way better than what you described in that other fic. The story takes its time building Joffrey up after breaking him down, and any victories and advantages that he gets feel /earned/. And the obstacles that he has to face are interesting and satisfying to overcome too. Honestly, the best thing I can say about the story is that replaced the original canon for me in the same way that that HPMOR and Animorphs: The Reckoning replaced the originals in my mind too.

*** It actually does a good job redeeming him, not to quick but not too slow either. It, really fleshes out the world in a way that can only happen in a time loop. It's really good and something I'd definitely recommend

** Just got caught up on this. All in all, pretty enjoyable. Some of the arcs made my eyes glaze over a little, but my attention span is pretty damaged recently for unrelated reasons, so ymmv. I'm guilty of having skimmed a few of the chapters, but as others have noted, some of the big cathartic moments are pretty top-tier stuff.
