Hello! I started this web serial recently, and a friend of mine suggested it might be received well here. Like the title says, it's a murder mystery story that I'm writing with reader solvability as the highest concern, as a kind of puzzle. To be honest, I wasn't familiar with rational fic's as a discrete thing until about a month ago, but it seems it fit pretty well - the main characters are all intended to be relatively rational actors working towards particular goals, and the setting is intended to follow a discrete set of rules that also factor into the mystery, with a relatively big emphasis on how seemingly supernatural phenomena can be perceived differently depending on who's looking at it.

Anyway, I don't want to say too much. [[https://yettherearedandelions.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/prologue-unwanted-guests/][Here's the start if that sounds interesting to you.]] If anyone decides to try it out, let me know what you think.

** It sounds interesting, but the text is gray on dark gray. Would you consider switching to a higher-contrast option?

I'll personally give it a shot still, but low-contrast text is difficult to read. There are people who would take one look and close the tab.

Your monitor is probably also not calibrated. Use tools for this sort of thing, not intuition and random senses/hardware.

** Feel free to be blunt with any impressions! Because the nature of the story as one where even the very minor details are important, I've ended up rewriting the early parts several times as I've tried to strike a good balance between being entertaining enough to hook and conveying all the important information, while still coming across as organic. It's at the point where it's tough for me to read objectively, so I'm not above going back to parts just yet if it fails to be intriguing on one level or another.

*** I think the writing is pretty high-quality, and the beginning is hooking enough. That said, you need either a proofreader, or pay more attention to certain types of typos.

1. Unnecessary capitalization after hyphens, colons, and semicolons.

   #+begin_quote
     But, if you asked someone who didn't know him too well, but still sort of did -- *A* casual acquaintance, perhaps
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_quote
     You know: *You're* rooting about in the garden and wander too close to their hive
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_quote
     You feel somewhat assured; *Surely*, if you wait there, things will become clear
   #+end_quote

   "A", "you're", and "surely" respectively do not need to be capitalized.

2. When using, or failing to properly use, ='s= to show possession.

- 

  #+begin_quote
    After all, a tool, however pretty, had no dignity when deprived of *it's* proper job.
  #+end_quote

  * its

- 

  #+begin_quote
    The distinct way each of them operated, the ways the gears were organized and linked, and what that said about the *creators* mindset
  #+end_quote

  * creators'

- 

  #+begin_quote
    Don't let yourself get wrapped to much in other *peoples* narratives
  #+end_quote

  * people's

I noticed that these mistakes appear frequently in the text, which is all the more off-putting considering the (high) quality of the rest of it.

**** Ah, yeah. I'll admit I make a lot of those sorts of mistakes, especially in the earliest chapters, which were written a while ago now. Since I'm an English speaker, it's nothing but pure laziness on my part; I need to make more thorough editing passes.

I'll go back and fix at least the earlier examples some time later today.

** Sounds very cool, and I will take a look. It looks like 6 chapters released, can you give an idea of how long it will be before the case can be solved?

*** Thanks for your interest!

Without spoiling anything, the story is sort of structured such that there's an overarching greater mystery, and a bunch of smaller "cases" along the way. Expect each of those to last something in the realm of 10-20 chapters, of course being internally solvable, and offering some catharsis. The first nine or ten chapters are sort of introductory, though, so I wouldn't quite count them in that regard.

The length of the entire thing is harder to say. I've sort of set up the story so elements can be stripped or wrapped up quickly should I want to change plans along the way, and my update schedule could potentially speed up or slow down based on my circumstances. But it will probably go on for at the very least well over a year.
