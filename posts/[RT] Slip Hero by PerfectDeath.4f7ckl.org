** I like the focus on a traditionally supporting character who nonetheless have a sizable impact on their surrounding, especially through application of the scientific methods and experimentation.

That being said, I haven't saw much struggle in the way our heroes came up with stuff.

** Slipping into another world, a normal hospital lab worker is reborn into a fantasy world; monsters, magic, and loot are in ample supply. However, the reincarnation has stripped the hero of his memories, leaving only a degree of comprehension about his past knowledge and interests. Soon, into his new life he begins experimenting with magic and training his skills. Will he be able to revolutionize this new world with his creativity?
