I am a professional narrator currently releasing Mother of Learning as a free audiobook via podcast and YouTube. What other web serials would you like to see an audio version of?


** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Mother of Learning]] is a good choice. I'd love to hear [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] as well, but it is extremely long.

The Waves Arisen would be good, if you wanted to do fanfiction, but Wertifloke disappeared off the face of the planet after publishing it, and definitely wasn't Eliezer Yudkowsky the entire time.

**** I'm guessing here, but I think it's because they have a release format which rewards continual output over conciseness. It's more important to consistently get out content than it is to sit back and ask "Do I really need to add in the events of this arc/chapter in order to tell the complete story I intend to tell?" Because unlike traditional stories, your readership is likely to drop if you don't put out chapters quickly enough. So You don't have time to make things perfect and plan things out so that all the unnecessary bits get cut.

Also I think some of the authors don't always know where there story is going to end as they're writing it, so they just keep writing the logical progression of what would happen next until they feel like they've basically written everything that this particular mix of characters/setting will allow for.

I think interludes add to things. (Once in a while it acts as a different vehicle for (the main) plot as well - the villains find out the hero's secret identity, it can be a good way to introduce a character gently rather than suddenly, etc.)

****** Parting the Clouds is realistic; one flawed rational 13 year old girl without a leadership position among non-rational peers can only do so much so quickly, and yet the changes to canon are adding up. The status quo is becoming more untenable with every new book as Cassie's individual actions build momentum.

As much as I enjoy and avidly read your take on rational animorphs, the AU elements introduced often fly in the face of canon and realism for the sake of the plot. It's still engaging and raises deep philosophical questions, but it's no longer simply "Animorphs, but both sides are hyper-rational", it's "Animorphs if it was HPMOR, except the changes to canon mechanics continually crop up at convenient times instead of being outlined early on".

Like I say though, I'd still love an audiobook version of either one. Animorphs deserves the love, and it would be timed well with the official audiobook releases coming up.

******** To the first point, this sub is home to both rational and rationalist fiction. r!animorphs is actually rational fiction(rational actors and logical mechanics), while PtC is rationalist(characters aspire to better themselves or the world through rationality). Both belong here.

To the second point: I apologize for the perceived hostility, I have a gift for poorly conveying tone over text. Animorphs is a difficult setting to AU because unlike many settings, the characters get very little starting information to build from. It's obvious in hindsight that you planned the changes to canon from an early stage, but from my perspective as a reader they were about as expected as The Ellimist was in canon. The fact that the changes are often discovered right on time to, say, revive a character from the dead, or prevent an obvious route to victory for one side or the other... It's not exactly deus ex machina, but it tended to reduce the impact of those moments for me even as it sent me reeling with repercussions.

I still love the story and read every update though, major setting divergence is a skill few pull off as well as r!animorphs.

********* I don't know what fic you've been reading if you don't think that the characters in r!Animorphs "aspire to better themselves or the world through rationality;" fully a third of the inner monologue stuff is thinking about thinking and reflecting on blind spots and biases and doing explicit metacognition; as described by the rules of the subreddit "the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities; this is a feature of *rationalist fiction*." You can also check out the wiki, which lists seven distinguishing elements of rationalist fiction, all of which r!animorphs hits consistently.

(I note also that my literal job for three years was teaching applied rationality to adults, and that about half of the curriculum of CFAR has made it directly into the fic.)

I also dunno what to say about you not being able to pick up on telegraphed and foreshadowed and pre-explained stuff. I guess just "shrug emoji."

If your Animorphs story doesn't radically deviate from canon within about six pages, it's neither rational nor rationalist. I love Animorphs canon to death, but you can't even get through the first book if you have a main character being actually sane.

********** You're being very hostile. I simply expressed my personal preference in fiction and offered some critique I had as an admitted fan of your work. Parting the Clouds doesn't deserve to have its name dragged through the mud for not being as rational as your own story.

Rationalist fiction is a subset of rational fiction. The former focuses solely on the internal struggles of the aspiring rationalist, while the latter can have more elements like logical systems or major canon divergences. See EY's linked post in the rules.

I will continue to enjoy your work, but the saying about never meeting heroes is really ringing true right now.

*********** /shrug/ I repeat your words back to you, about tone being hard to convey through text, and perceived hostility not always being intended. I certainly do not intend hostility myself, nor do I think it makes any sense at all to police people's preferences.

I have only two claims, and I don't think it's /fundamentally/ rude or hostile to make either of them; to the extent that you were able to find rudeness and hostility in my choice of words, I apologize for leaving you with that impression.

Claim 1: It's not possible to /both/ have rational characters /and/ stick to Animorphs canon closely enough to still hit the same ending as the first book, let alone the second and third and fourth. That's not dragging PtC's name through the mud /as a work of quality;/ it's just pointing out that it doesn't qualify as being a member of a very specific genre.

Claim 2: r!Animorphs easily and consistently meets the criteria in Eliezer's linked post, which is where the wiki and subreddit descriptions came from. I've just reread Eliezer's post again to be sure, and it does /not/ make the claim that rationalist fiction "focuses solely on the internal struggles of the aspiring rationalist."

/shrug emoji again/

It's fine for you not to like r!Animorphs as much as you like Parting the Clouds. It's fine for you to love Parting the Clouds. But the terms "rational" and "rationalist" are important, and it's important that their meaning be defended, and I'm not going to /not/ disagree with what I believe to be inaccurate evaluations of the natures of the two works, just to avoid having you think that I'm hostile.

************ Ah, that makes the disconnect a lot clearer. See, works where the protagonist or protagonists are flawed rationalists making internally logical decisions, such as PtC, Wildbow's serials, Metropolitan Man and Code Geass:TPR, fall under the banner of rationalist fiction for me.

Rational fiction is a more advanced genre where the rationality bleeds into the setting, with HPMOR, r!animorphs, Pokemon: TOoS, Practical Guide and UNSONG being some examples. It sounds like you mostly count this as the bar to meet, while this sub accepts the first group as part of the genre.
