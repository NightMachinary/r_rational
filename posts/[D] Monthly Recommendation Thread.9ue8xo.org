** Two recent reads:

/How to Invent Everything/ by Ryan North is a book that largely concerns itself with telling time travelers how to rebuild civilization. I think it's a great resource for anyone wanting to write uplift fiction, portal fantasy, or similar, largely because it lays out, in simple terms, the low-hanging fruit for various time periods and levels of technological development.

/The Labyrinth Index/ by Charles Stross is the 9th installment in the Laundry Files series, and you'd probably not want to start with it. I'm only about halfway done, so won't be able to give a full review, but /so far/ it's one of my favorites, in part because the series has progressed to the point where CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN is in full effect (which is ridiculous, and I love it). I've also said in the past that Stross is one of those authors that occasionally dips into full-on rational fiction, which is one of the things that I like about him.

*** I read through the Laundry Files this summer, and while I certainly thought they were very good, they were also really emotionally draining. The setting has progressed from grimdark to shitdark in tone; it honestly kind of reminded me of Wildbow in the last few books, with the degree to which the mood and tone just became /oppressive/.

This is not a value judgment: many people are fine with, or even actively like, that style. I am just reporting on my experience so that people can calibrate accordingly.

***** Having finished it, I generally agree, though I think it's important to distinguish between /setting/ darkness and /character/ darkness. A lot of what made some of the more recent books in the series dark was that bad things were happening to our viewpoint characters, and these weren't the sorts of bad things that a typical protagonist goes through at the nadir of their plot arc, they were bad things that stuck around, including the deaths of important people, permanent manglings of characters, institutional issues, etc.

In /Labyrinth Index/, we end on a personal high note for Mhari, which softens the fact that the world has gotten worse. That comes along with hints at Extended Continuity Operations as a potential way to preserve humanity and, if not win, then at least maintain some semblance of civilization.

****** I don't really think it's supposed to be a personal high note, or at least not an unambiguous one. Yes, Jim is alive, and no longer staring down the short end of dementia and death but he's also a PHANG, which leaves him complicit in the New Management's policies. Also, definitely Derek, and possibly Pete (if he does actually kill himself rather than live with PHANG) are dead -- the latter will likely hit Bob hard next time we get his POV, as he was the one who got Pete involved to begin with.

And while there are a few spots of light at the setting level, don't forget the New Management's plans for England, which include a conquest of the continent under the leadership of a vampire priesthood. Plus, there are a couple of other threats mentioned that have yet to make their moves. Chernabog is listed among the Elder Gods on the Black Chamber PowerPoint and unlike the rest of them he has yet to make a move (and he's listed as working with the KGB, who are due for another appearance), while the Mandate's comment to Cthulhu about the "Cold Ones" that suggests that the series might be due for another appearance of the Infovores, possibly as a bookend for the final conflict.

There's maybe /marginally/ more hope at this point then there was at the end of the last book, but we're still at the point where victory means "maybe after things shake out something exists that still remembers being human".

** I would like to recommend Forge of Destiny.

It's a xianxia quest on Sufficient Velocity about a street girl in an original world who joins a Sect and her search for power and friendship.

The work has everything that is awesome about xianxia without most of the crap that makes 95% of the stories in the genre feel like enthusiastically fellating a cheese grater.

Most importantly, the characters behave like people instead of merely being ambulatory anuses.

The first book of the story is finished and the second is supposed to start at some point in the next couple of weeks.

​

That said, the quest text has a problem with using "it's" instead of "its". If that is sufficiently annoying to you then you might prefer to read the edited and reworked version on RoyalRoad.

​

Additionally, the author has said that he is going to include bonus chapters on RR, which is content that wasn't part of the quest, so that's another point in favor.

​

On the other hand: The story is more than 600k words long. If you want to wait and read it on RR, then you are probably going to be waiting for a very long time.

**** I've read both. The worldbuilding and setting is better in Forge of Destiny, but it doesn't explore it much, and it has far inferior characterization.

The best thing about the Cradle books is that they are very good about maintaining narrative tension (often to the detriment of storytelling) while Forge of Destiny has a lot of trouble with that, particularly with giving a reason to care about the outcome of fights. I wonder if it's because it's a quest? "Don't see the sausage being made" type of deal.

I lost interest near the final 40% when the MC chose the most boring of the available paths, to be a good little servant to a control freak and gave up most of her agency, but kept skimming to see what happens. Even in broad strokes I found the outcomes boring. The last few arcs, particularly the tournament arc was a masterwork in spoiling tension and spiking stakes.

****** I mean that the Cradle series and all Wight's novels tend to be really exciting novels, but they have shoddy characterization, and the worlds don't feel fully realized. There is no attention to detail, there is no exploration of the setting, there are no moments of respite where the characters can do something other than train and fight, or talk about something that's not training and fighting.

I seriously can't recall a single instance where the main characters just talk to person that they're not going to train or fight with, or think about how the faction they're a part of works, or remember something non-traumatic from their pasts, or learn something that's not plot relevant.

The book and all the characters tend to be pretty one-dimensional, as a result. Which is fine, I still enjoy them. Not every book has to have a deep exploration of profound themes or anything. But it's a shame, because the books could be so much better pretty simply.

As a non-native English speaker myself I find his evolution as a writer to be truly inspirational.

As for the Yi-Ti's arc, it might have dragged on a bit but I personally enjoyed it, especially since it's a crucial step in Joffrey's development as a character and protagonist. Be sure to leave the story a comment if you enjoy it, to keep Baurus motivated to write more!

** For anyone looking for a little more hope and rationality in the real world, I have two non-fiction recommendations by the same author: [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature][The Better Angels of Our Nature]] (2011) and [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress][Enlightenment Now]] (2018) by Steven Pinker

/The Better Angels of Our Nature/ shows, using historical data, how things have gotten better over the course of human history. How there is less murder, less illness, less war, famine, injury, death and suffering now than there was 2000, 500 or 50 years ago.

/Enlightenment Now/ focuses more on the recent past (really, the Enlightenment through to the present) and more on the /how/ behind the progress--the ideologies and social institutions that push progress forward. It also takes a look at the cognitive biases that make it seem like the world is getting worse when it isn't.

Both of these are fairly heavy, dense reads (with lots of graphs!), so if you're looking for something lighter, I'd recommend any of Pinker's other books, which are mainly about linguistics and psychology. In particular, [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/language-instinct][The Language Instinct]], which is a great introduction to the field of linguistics.

You can just tell he uses a lot of filler, and by that I mean he could make his point in 4-10 pages but because he wants to sell a book he bloats it to 300+ pages. Several little example stories per chapter that add virtually nothing but word count.

He's a good non fiction writer don't get me wrong, I just don't enjoy filler. He writes the kind of non fiction that people that don't read a lot of non fiction enjoy, there's value in that, you learn one interesting thing and a few examples to talk about at a dinner party.

** I've recently been hooked on Peter Watts' Sunflower Cycle. He's the dark genius guy who wrote Blindsight and The Things.

It's not much right now, only 3 short stories and a novella (plus a hidden short story that acts as a teaser for the next part of the story), but it paints a really cool 'verse that embraces Deep Time.

Basic premise is that instead of finding a network of worm holes built by precursors, lets focus in on the poor bastards who had to go out there and make them. After a while humans stop coming out of the new worm holes, but the mission continues on anyway due to +plot HAL friend computer CHIMP+, the AI in charge of the mission.

I've always been darkly attracted to stories about being lost in a way that destroys all hope of returning, and nothing does that better than a hard sci-fi story dealing with deep time. Millions of years pass, and outside of your tiny bubble the universe your culture, language, and phenotype aren't even in the historical record any more.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2309339914?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1][This Review]] of the recently published novella has a recommended reading order and warnings on helping decide if it's something you should read.

--------------

I also listened to [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/204796][The Forever]]. 6 book series published as 3 audiobooks, it's a similar premise to the oft-recommended and acclaimed Bobiverse, but it takes the idea in a very different direction. I won't say it's better or worse than Bobiverse, I can very much see someone liking either more.

Instead of being a Vonn Neumann probe on an indefinite mission in a 'verse mostly devoid of aliens, The Forever is ironically named in that it focuses on a much shorter period of time, a century long trip to nearby stars to survey them for potential immigration to move whoever manages to get off earth before it's destroyed by a rogue planet screwing up the solar system's orbits.

It's much softer sci-fi, as the "brain uploading" system and other AI is all handwaved, and later alien tech indistinguishable from magic shows up, but it's still a fun character driven comedy adventure.

All well and good, but then it comes about that in the mysterious spooky environment with massive electromagnetic Flux, our neurons end up unhinged from causality itself (Wtf).

Not only does that work, but it apparently supercharges her to the extent that she's able to deduce the entire cause of the expedition, namely a Kardashev 2 alien civilization spotted on the scopes. This was a leap of logic that I'd be OK with one of the vampires from Blindopraxia doing, but surely not a human who had their head stuck in a MRI.

Leaving aside physics, even Watts himself previously acknowledged 'Free Will' as a concept to be incoherent and not worth considering to anyone with a passing knowledge of neuroscience or philosophy. So no wonder I sat there pulling my hair and wondering whether the whole episode was him being perverse, or just losing it. I really don't get the whole point of having something like that ruin an otherwise great series :/

Most frequent and long time visitors should know about it already but it is quite a long time ago I last saw it mentioned anywhere. For those that follow Overwatch Canon, keep in mind that this fanfic was completed before the official Doomfist announcement.

Wish fulfillment and fix-it really turns me off unless their canon patchworking and power ups are achieved in a rational/realistic manner. I want the SI to focus on survival and consequently achieving power is the beat way to do so. Here are some great self inserts I recommend.

*** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]] - Naruto SI Ongoing

Best reincarnation I know of. SI actually acts like a child. Well, more than Kakashi anyway.

Point is that she acts like a Naruto-universe smart child, not like an adult in a kid's body, like many fics.

It may be my favorite Naruto SI. It's hard to say when there are fics like Sanitize.

***** Eh, I treat SIs like I would any other character, for the most part. Though I do tend to connect with them more because of the outside perspective.

I'll stop if there's a ton of romance, but if it's just a tasteful part of character building, it's okay. That's why I tend to like gen fics more though, because generally romance is not tasteful.

I'm a guy btw. In comparison to you, I like female characters because of the part of my mind which adores women, even non-sexually.

There's no romance in that fic at all. If there was any "aww so cute," then it would be only for a tiny portion, and more like in an older sister/younger brother way, though they're the same age, I think.

I encourage you to just skip that part and continue. It's not romance, it's hurt/comfort (which I usually don't like).

I do have several more, but I'll have to go through my list of read fics later on my computer to find them.

I like this one a ton, though, which is why I mentioned it. You really should try to read it more.

Rictus, who does Path of Ruin, also has some other very good SIs. I really like the Slug Star Wars one.

** Fiction rec: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside][Foundryside]] by Robert Jackson Bennett. It has the neatest magic system I've seen in a while; there is this written language that when properly used can convince reality to be subverted. There is this society that is slowly rediscovering this language and how to use it from the ruins of a dead civilization which apparently self-destructed somehow. Enter Sanchia, a cat burglar who can hear the history of objects she touches.

Non-fiction rec: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting][Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction]] by Philip E. Tetlock, Dan Gardner. I listened to a few very good podcasts(80,000 hours, Rationally Speaking) with Tetlock as a guest a while ago and decided to actually read the novel discussed for once. In the book he goes into how most so-called experts are pretty bad at making concrete predictions of the future, and what how actual good forecasters use evidence based, probabilistic, logical analysis to make good predictions. Though, like with pretty much all non-fiction books I've read, I felt like the book would have been just as informative and a better read if they cut like 40% out.

** So I don't know if this counts, but [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/404010/1/friendship-is-replicable/nexus][this NSFW]] MLP fan fiction is about the forcible, fundamental reprogramming of civilisation to end war and disagreement by uploading everyone's mind into a sort of telepathic internet so everyone can access everyone else's memories and subsequently loses all sense of individuality.

The ones I'd personally endorse are:

- *Girlish Number*- Can be reductively summarized as a more grounded and cynical Shirobako, with a more specific focus on voice actors. I probably like this one more, though.

- *Hibike Euphonium*- Looks at a high school concert band as they make an attempt to qualify for the national tournament. This is Kyoto Animation at their best, impeccable character animation with unforgettable moments.

- *Madoka Magica*- Doesn't super fit this genre, but it's still in my Top 3 of all anime, so I have to list it. Simply one of the most perfectly constructed shows I've ever seen.

Hibike:

Too little action. Though if one likes K-on and lucky star, they'll probably like this show.

Madoka:

I'm kinda surprised this sub likes a show where the main characters make consistently bad/stupid decisions and the biggest plot hole and driving factor behind the conflict is an unexplained absence of adults.

******* The plot could be resolved with a 911 call? How?

Magical girls /have/ to hunt witches, because otherwise grief will accumulate in their soul gems and they will turn into them. It /will/ happen in the long-term even if they don't use magic, because of mundane negative emotions. Witches are impervious to interventions of non-magical girls. Even though their bodies could be destroyed by mundane means, as Homura shows, you can't access or see their realms without magic; Walpurgisnacht is an exception, but /she/ is potentially immune to nuclear weapons. More importantly, Kyubey the advanced alien is the real enemy; it won't permit the government at large to know. It's likely that it could either edit people's perceptions or erase their memory, and that it has full awareness of everything happening on the planet.

So: the government can't easily save magical girls, can't easily defeat witches, and is at the Incubator's mercy.

I don't see any important part of the plot that could be solved with a 911 call, unless you're postulating a hypercompetent government made up of our Saturday Munchkinry Thread residents or something.

I would have loved to agree with you on this because having an answer to the question would have meant that the point was addressed at least in passing, instead of being left as a gaping hole that was the driving force behind the conflict in pretty much every single episode.

******* Alternative explanation: The expectation for magical girls (from in-universe fiction) is to keep a secret, and Kyubey picks girls who won't because it's a manipulative shit anyway. Plus, there isn't actually anything adults can do directly for witches; they can't see them and just get trapped too.

Supporting evidence: Mami's parents are dead, bad stuff happens when Kyoko tells her parents, and the high mortality rate for magical girls means that probably none ever become adults themselves to serve as authorities.

*** If you enjoyed K-On, try Tamako Market, which I found to be the same thing more concentrated, and also maybe Hibike Euphonium.

Haibane Renmei is a classic, though arguably slightly different but nevertheless must-watch. Niea_7, same era, same artist is more fluff less misery; or Gunslinger Girl for full-on depression if you prefer that.

For character studies, a somewhat adjacent genre, try 3-gatsu no Lion and Chihayafuru.

Tamayura, Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san, C3-bu, Koufuku Graffiti, Yuru Camp all fall firmly into the “girls doing things” genre but are all pure fluff and no substance, so YMMV depending quite what you are after (I also found K-on to be on the fluff side personally so our preferences may differ here).

Gakkou Gurashi and Happy Sugar Life are girls doing horror; the former more light-hearted, the other less fantastical but reaching wildbow levels of viewer discomfort.

Boys/men are pretty much exclusively background characters with no speaking lines or identities, with the exception of one of the character's little brother. It's definitely a deliberate choice on the part of the creators, but it always strikes me as just a little bit odd (though not in a bad way).

*** Practical Guide to Evil seems tonally based on two series, The Black Company by Glen Cook and The Malazan Book of the Fallen by Stephen Erikson. The Black Company has a great first book that you should read, highly atmospheric and a bit haunting, but only read on after that if you feel like it...kind of a Dune thing where the other books are different, and, for many, worse. Malazan is amazing but highly challenging, don't feel bad that you're not understanding things and treat it as a puzzle. I've described how to read it here in a relatively popular post:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/84iybe/confusion_on_gardens_of_the_moon/dvq6meq/]]

If you want something that will feel comfortable coming off web novels but is a real fantasy book, try the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. The series only really gets going in the third book, but the first two aren't bad, and unfortunately you kind of should read them and not skip. Arguably it's the fourth book where things really get good.

Web novels are kind of like junk food, they can ruin your palette. I say that because I cycle in and out of reading them and I've found that to be true. Give yourself some space when reading, consider writing notes in the margins or even looking at summaries beforehand. Best of luck.

You just have to know how it ended and the basic details of the Dallon family*, since Victoria is the protagonist. It referenced other stuff exactly once that I can recall, and it was quite good about not assuming the reader had perfect memory of the event in question, explaining the relevant detail.
