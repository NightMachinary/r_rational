** You must have skipped over a line, Grak agreed not to leave the gold there. As wren says, probably already used up.

** are we sure this wasn't part of the first lump?

if not, then maybe because the gold knows he'd refuse.

*** I don't think the Call takes potential refusal into account with its requests, or it wouldn't have the reputation that it does. It has some form of optimisation of short/long term goals, but it assumes it will be obeyed at every step along the path it chooses.

**** And loosing Grak for short term gains would definitely not be worth it in the long term.

** From the way Finch "fished" a confirmation of gold magery with just a coin, I'm thinking that the call of the gold uses multiversal exploration (or some heuristic approximation, more likely) to identify when and what to do in order to stay on the possible path of maximum gold acquisition at any given time.

It would be interesting to see if this confirms and if so, whether Mary can figure out a way to exploit this mechanic.
