** These reasons are not very convincing:

#+begin_quote
  Murder Hobos Want Little in Return for Success
#+end_quote

"Just" upgraded equipment. A +1 greatsword costs as much as 470 longspears, and the ratio gets more extreme with genuinely good equipment. An army is cheaper.

#+begin_quote
  Murderhobos are a Dime a Dozen
#+end_quote

There's some truth to this. Sending many adventuring bands to their deaths is less bad for your reputation than getting large hunks of your army killed. But it's not a big difference. Soldiers are replaceable too.

#+begin_quote
  The Army is Busy / Politics
#+end_quote

These arguments apply equally well to dispatching a regiment or a band of subsidized murderhobos. We're looking for a /comparative/ advantage.

#+begin_quote
  Murderhobo Investment Pays Dividends
#+end_quote

To somebody. Murderhobos are /much/ more likely to overthrow you than an army is. Some do it for power; others for the good of the country. An army has those motives as well, but it would have a huge co-ordination problem to solve first. And it's easier to keep an eye on it and see if coup sentiments are rising.

--------------

So what's the real reason?

There are threats an army can't handle. Maybe the orcs are being led by a dragon or a high-level druid. An army isn't going to do much good against those. A band of murderhobos /might/ level up enough in the journey that they can. In a world of DR and area-effect spells, quality trumps quantity.

** This works for adventurers that never get far above level 6, but once you get into high teens, your adventures both a) become larger sources and sinks of wealth than entire empires and b) have 'fate of the world' level consequences for failure.

That Empire might have a bit of a problem if the Dark Lord's plan to awaken the [[http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Atropus][Apocalypse Moon]] succeeds, or if the Nightmare Player finishes his performance of the [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?75718-Assatur-the-Nightmare-Messiah-Elder-Evil][King in Yellow]] in the capital of the Empire, or if [[http://www.andycollins.net/Campaigns/Bloodlines/40_ashardalon_finale.htm][Ashardalon]] succeeds at becoming the Font of All Souls and all future mortal children are born soulless and mindless.

*** One might question how many adventurers get above level 6 then. You might only have a couple level 7 characters per empire, a couple level 10 characters per world. You might need to get quite far in the multiverse before high teens becomes common, and worlds where that happens could be very rare.

**** Acccctually, as a necessary consequence of the [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/settlements][Settlement]] rules in Pathfinder/3.5, any settlement with more than 25,000 people has at least one spellcaster capable of casting 8th level spells, meaning an at minimum 15th level character.

Look at any Pathfinder book describing the world of Golarion, and you'll see many high level characters and monsters in each country and area.

In D&D worlds, Authority Equals Asskicking is a law of reality. Most Emperors are going to be mid to high teens level, or else they would have been killed and replaced by someone who actually is.

It also makes the world rather weird looking, given how much high level magics can break the world. As such, many people make such magic users much rarer.

I have an Artisan character (Basically a super Magic!Tinker) who is in the process of skipping the Industrial revolution to generate an obscene amount of money (Downtime Capital) and convert it directly into power (most recently in the case of an enormous flying carrier which holds what is effectively a Gundam and AI drones the size of F-18's.)

******* Yeah. Personally in campaigns with levels, I have a judgement that for an average place, no one is above level 3- an average soldier might be 1, 1/100 might be level 2, 1/1000 might be level 3, 1/10000 might be level 4, 1/100,000 might be level 5. You need to start adding in planar forces and magical lifespans and such to get higher levels generally, and when I want my players to face a greater threat I bring in elves, demons, angels, centuries old mages. Consider say, a single guard. They might have to successfully kill 10 goblins to level up. That's going to be far beyond most guards, not many are going to be that lucky. Tends to make my players feel much more awesome to get that far.

Your artisan sounds very awesome and powerful, and I hope they find fun conflicts for their flying carrier.

The last boss froze the Initiative Tracker.

Not Time, the boss broke the 4th wall and froze (with animation, great GM) the initiative tracker which kept track of whose turn it was, so nobody could take turns.

********** We have 2 Mythic Ranks, as we are the chosen of the Gods in this homebrew world (My own character being the chosen of the God of Innovation and Invention), so we tend to fight things that are obscenely powerful. The previous fight was with a metamind of 8 mid teen leveled psions. Before that there was a 17th level character, a thunder behemoth (mini-tarrasque), the previous champion of my god (who built similarly crazy things, including an enormous missile and laser laden robot suit), and dark shades of /every foe a particular character killed throughout the entire campaign/, who we had to fight all at once.

I think we mentioned in the last session that we are basically playing Exalted at this point.

Or perhaps the final boss got to fight against the GM, and the GM won, reclaiming control of the init tracker?

********** We had to talk him down. He was under some mistaken impressions that we were the harbingers of the apocalypse, as we had been framed for some large-scale destruction (Someone inadvertently set off what was basically a nuke in a major town and blamed us for it). Plus one of our main foes right now is the Chosen of Nyarlathotep, who is a god of trickery among other things. Our Divination spells have been backfiring or giving false information, some of the things we discovered are impossible to spread to the general population as there is a world-wide 'Taboo' on mentioning them (turns out a relatively new God is in cahoots with Nyarlathotep, and we were tricked into freeing him from a time freeze). And assorted other things a god-like entity can do to troll mortals even with the Divine Cold War rules against directly squashing us in play.

We had to go through a long subquest to sever ourselves from Fate to remove the ability for Nyarlathotep to screw with our minds and views, and right now nothing is certain.

So, some of my manufacturing base is building a nonmagical Oracle device to answer our divination type questions without being fucked over by Nyarlathotep's portfolio.

** /tl;dr:/

1. *Murder hobos want little in return for success.* They aren't requesting that the Emperor properly arm, train, feed, and pay them. They want acknowledgement, upgraded equipment, and lump-sum cash to take care of the job themselves.

2. *Murder hobos are a dime a dozen.* What, did the party honestly believe they were the only self-proclaimed heroes to band together and fight back against the Orkish menace? They were the only survivors, the only ones to pick up swords and fight? Volunteers always appear when the world presents a lucrative murdering opportunity--and here was a murdering opportunity. So disposable. And so many people waiting in line to die!

3. *The army is busy.* The Emperor has to think big. And, in thinking big, he's thinking about his heartland, where he grows the food to feed the overly perfumed population of his core cities. The frontier brings him nothing. His cities, everything. The Emperor isn't going to burn his armies on something as tedious as the frontier when he has volunteers standing in line to defend it and die on the cheap. No, he's going to unleash his dark armies on his neighboring nation-states and take them, instead. Orks, after all, don't pay that much in taxes. Elves, well... Elves do.

4. *Politics.* Who speaks in Court for the peaceful peasant villages of the frontier? Maybe a lower level aristocrat owns those lands. Maybe no one owns those lands and the villages are a collective community of tiny oligarchies. Maybe they are voiceless and hope and pray that murder hobos will defend them from the rampaging Ork Hordes of the east. The Emperor must balance all the voices of the various factions who swirl around him at Court. If no one insists the overrun frontier is more important than, say, the Emperor's plans to invade the Elves and take their lands, he sends no army.

5. *Murder-hobo investment pays dividends.* For the sake of argument, the murder-hobo investment in some cash and equipment pays out. A princess gives them medals and proclaims them heroes. YAY! For a pitiful investment, the Empire gets to flip the frontier into a stable strip of Empire. They weren't expecting to do so--but, hey, now it's here! Sure, it's far from the Capital City and inconvenient to tax--but any tax is greater than zero tax. /Now/ we send out the army to stabilize and build the edifices of government.

/Consequences of murder-hobo failure:/ The outcome depends on what the Orks want. If they simply want better land, the consequences are long-term obnoxious but not Empire-ending. The Orks overrun the eastern frontier, declare themselves their own tiny nation-state, and are eventually made a satellite of the Empire through trade and culture. But if the Orks want raw conquest, the Empire has a real problem on its hands...

Finally, we get decent WAAAAAAGH levels.

If the Empire has a /real/ problem, of course, it can send in its OP special forces. To get some of those, you select the best heroes who come through and succeed against regular Orks, and then actually pay them a salary and train-and-equip them /properly/. Sayeret Matkal's got nothing on that.

It's obviously not a huge deal but compare to this, and you're moving out of the Middle Ages and into Renaissance.
