Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Recently I've taken interest in the idea of The Fair Folk, so I've decided to share my way of rationalizing the behavior associated with the original folklore. I will be assuming fairies are subject to the same pressures of natural selection as humans, despite their significant differences in environment and biology. One thing I've noticed about the traditional version of The Fair Folk is how their behavior seems to correspond with human mental illness.

Their lack of empathy and impulsiveness is characteristic of psychopathy, bizarre quirks like counting grains of salt are similar to OCD, and their narcissism speaks for itself. The presumable reason why humans instinctively consider these unhealthy behavior is because our social contract is built around maintaining a standard of behavior to ensure the survival of the group. So I started thinking about what the fairy social contract is like to encourage such behavior, and here's what I've got.

The natural obstacle to sociopaths forming a society is the lack of trust for one another. Rather than solving the prisoner's dilemma with empathy like humans did, the fey instead developed an inhibition towards lying. Whereas the basic foundation of human social relations is our unwillingness to kill each other, the fundamental principle of civilized fairies is that every word they speak is literally true. The only reason they form social groups at all is because of individual self interest, so they treat all relationships as agreements to exchange services.

A major consequence of this is that they are fear and loath the way humans deceive or break previously held obligations. Just as a violation of the human social contract demands retaliation for the sake of survival, so does a violation of the fairies'. Since fairies did not evolve empathy for other individuals, this is much easier for them than us. This may also explain the motive behind changelings, since we can be trusted to care for children that they would prefer taken off their hands in the meantime. As for the human child they swapped out....

Rationalizing other fey behavior is more difficult and are more dependent upon the setting. There are theories that OCD evolved as a way of preventing the spread of disease, so that could apply to them given the strange environment they evolved in. If their magic came from scarce items or repetitive rituals, then that would explain their phillia-like tendencies towards certain activities or items/people they come across. Narcissism could be a consequence of their immortality, where the biological imperative places survival over reproduction. Even their banes against iron or entering someone's house uninvited could be phobias.

The sort of world where such instincts are essential to survival would have to be very chaotic. Granted, the best way to survive in someplace like Wonderland or Night Vale would be to examine every dust speck for danger, take whatever you can possibly store safely, adopt every superstition that previously appeared to be true, take control of everything that will yield to you while avoiding what won't, and trust people no more than absolutely necessary to your own survival.

*** I've seen this idea before, in /The Accidental Space Spy/. Relevant exposition starts [[http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/comics/154][here]]. It's not particularly well-written, but it approaches the problem from a different angle to you so it may be worth reading.

An inhibition towards lying also means an inhibition towards things that sound like lies to the listener. This has knock-on effects. If something unlikely happens, a fey who tries to tell others about it will likely be accused of lying. Which leads to a sort of species-wide confirmation bias: even if individual fey can learn new things and accept the evidence of their senses, new memes will have more trouble spreading.

Of course, a fey who's known to usually tell the truth is more likely to be believed in the future. "Trust", to them, still exists and still forms bonds between individuals, but it's of the form "this person has always told the truth in the past, so I will believe the things they say in the future".

**** I almost upvoted because of that comic, even if I take offense to the idea that all religions are built on lies, but I think the theory in The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt about how "believers" evolve is more accurate. He puts forward evidence that religious ideologies granted us major evolutionary advantages that allowed us to form more successful social groups.

One thing I realized while writing this is that the fey would probably have trouble developing science. Because they trust each other so much, they have no need for objective verification. They may not even understand the concept of objectivity if they perceive the universe as solipsistic.

I think empiricism ultimately descended from the idea of uncovering the "divine truth" of reality that was hidden from man, but later became more humanist. These fairies would only be concerned about self-interest, so they wouldn't care about finding the truth except to benefit themselves.

We humans study science and develop technology out of a loyalty to our social group, even if we seek to advance with it. The only loyalty a fairy has is what they've agreed to trade, so they would hoard knowledge rather than spread it. Or they might treat human knowledge as a gift to them and try to repay their debt to us, which could lay the groundwork for a more modern story.

A society without lies would also find outlandish claims /much more credible/, though, given they would be risking enormous repercussions if they were found out - and of course very rare. (Assuming it's even possible for them to lie on a neurological level.)

EDIT: ah, read the comic. Yeah, that simply doesn't make sense - they're not killing people for lying, they're killing /anyone they disagree with/.

*** Good writeup. Have you read or played the World of Darkness module for the fae, Changeling: The Lost?

The fae have always been one of, if not my favorite, supernatural species/culture. I finally recently got around to reading Pact and am enjoying the presentation of them in it.

**** Sorry this was so long, I have the tendency to rant about things I liked at first but stopped liking before I finished.

I've heard of the game, but haven't had any reason to play World of Darkness even if I find it interesting. I haven't read Pact since I'm ambivalent towards Worm, I loved it before Leviathan showed up and by the time the Slaughterhouse 9 were defeated I didn't care anymore. Wildbow is a good writer, but I don't know if his stories are the kind I want to read.

I feel like Worm was designed as a subversion of the superhero genre, which is fine but not really what I wanted to read. As great as the characters were, the story became so much more about just surviving than achieving anything that I got tired of waiting for drama or development.

The worldbuilding was also starting to strain credibility. Details were included solely because they're common in superhero settings and Wildbow wanted to give a darker take on them, but the world ended up being so different from other setting that I couldn't believe they would exist here.

I know it all gets explained with eldrich gods and conspiracies, but that's another case of something I don't want to read. I wanted to see Taylor face her problems and solve them so she could live be happier and have done good, not get trapped in horrible situations and try to survive.

I like psychological horror, unraveling conspiracies, and munchkinism, but the story didn't set itself up like that at the beginning. When it started I thought I was in for the next Daredevil, one of my favorite shows ever, but it drifted so far from being a superhero story that I stopped caring.

If there's some Worm fanfiction out there that was closer to the style of the pre-Leviathan part of the story, I'd be happy to check it out if it's well written. Otherwise, I hesitate to read more by Wildbow and intend to read Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain when I get the chance.

***** I see where you're coming from. If it helps, I'm a couple dozen chapters into Pact and so far it's still pretty straightforward in plot, rather than expanding into an ever wider range of conflicts and scope. That said, it does start with the main character trying to escape and survive horrible situations, so YMMV :)

Also, while you may not have an opportunity to play Changeling, you might really enjoy reading about the worldbuilding. Let me know if you want a copy of the PDF!

****** It's possible I'd still like Pact since it's a different genre, I did love the Night Angel books after all (you were right about first one being the best and the third the weakest), so I'll check it out at some point. I do enjoy the psychological horror of being trapped in a bad situation and having to survive, though I prefer it when it's impersonal like in lovecraftian stories.

In the meantime I'm four and a half chapters into Shadows of the Limelight and being similarly disappointed that it's more about subverting a genre than rationalizing it, though this time I'm not nearly as attached to the characters so it'll be easier to move on. Should I check out Glimwarden instead? I know nothing about it besides the RWBY-esque world of monsters.

*** Some parts of this remind me a little of Stross' recent book The Nightmare Stacks, part of his Laundry Files series. The series is best read in order of publication, and it's not really 'rational' most of the time, but it's a lot of fun nonetheless.

In Stross' book, [[#s][Nightmare Stacks Spoilers]]

My favourite overall depiction of the fey is the man with the thistle-down hair from Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. If you like this sort of thing and haven't tried that book, you really ought to; as well as the book itself being good, both the BBC miniseries adaptation and audiobook reading are well done.

** Playing on the whole falling in a new world thing, how do you handle not getting sick? Okay, let's say you fall into a standard fantasy world of some kind with dragons, elves, humans, orcs, you name it. I'm a first-world person, and I've fallen into their world with hiking gear since I was on a backpacking trip.

If I go to somewhere like Africa or India and run around without vaccines, I could easily catch some form of crippling disease. In India at least, afaik, it's due to their poor sanitation. My thought was to compare this new world with Native Americans of yore. It is said that the Europeans spread disease in part because they didn't have proper sanitation or keep things nearly as clean as they needed to, and that in comparison Native Americans actually had good sanitation habits, which kept them free of a lot of bacteria and sicknesses which accompanied that.

Would it then be safe to suggest that this fantasy world, while not nearly as technologically advanced, still practice somewhat decent sanitation habits? Perhaps they don't pasteurize their milk, and the food like meat isn't FDA-approved, but that's still survivable, isn't it? Anything else that I might be missing as far as disease, etc goes?

*** So, my understanding from CPG Grey's Americapox episode; [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEk]], is that most of the bad diseases come about when you have nonhuman diseases spread to humans on a large scale, usually in city slaughterhouses. Native Americans avoided plague because they had no domestic animals. A more decentralised or lower tech world could avoid a large portion of this. All kinds of "normal" nasties can still kill you, for example, malaria, but this world probably predates smallpox, typically a cow disease, that spread to humans.

Second, it's more than possible to have good sanitation habits, like quarantine and rest time, perhaps as a God-given set of ideas, such as some of Leviticus and Pasque from Weber's Safehold series.

Third, how high magic is your setting? A low magic world can cure minor wounds and preemptively stop epidemics, or possibly cast repellus mosquitoes. A medium magic world could have enough magic to grant herd immunity, a magic "vaccine" spell of resist disease +2. A high magic world could use detect cause of illness, then cast Mass Destroy Bacteria, and solve the problem outright.

**** Thanks, you just gave me a couple of good ideas to my story. I think a magical "wipe out all bacterium" is a little contrived (right word?) in that it gives my world an easy out. For my story, I want what's keeping most people from constant plagues to be a kind of Native-American their lifestyle is actually conducive to healthiness. Perhaps we could do as you mentioned and have a pantheon of Gods or ancient texts, where each group of people have their own cleaning ritual any given worshipper must do every so often which is analogous to our standard cleaning habits.

***** Sure, that works. Divine "magic" like eating chicken soup and quarantine conditions would minimise disease spread, mosquito and gnat preventions, from nets to rat extermination to anti-pest magic could make all disease a rare occurrence, animal cleanliness would reduce crossover, and handwashing with soap is downright miraculous.

Those are just the easily-created though. If the guidebooks are actually created at a higher knowledge level, bleach sanitation, pasteurisation, and even basic antibiotics can be available.

*** Because I'm the kind of nerd who read Mass Effect's codex, I know that cooling systems would be incredibly useful for space travel. Heat is one of the single biggest engineering limitations for spacecraft since there's no air to carry it away. Warships in ME are designed to hit fast and hard specifically because leaving the combat systems on will cook the crew over time.

As for the neutronium question, I think it's because the material is so ridiculously dense that there are significant engineering problems to building anything out of it. You'd have to handle it almost exclusively with element zero, which is scarce. It's not that neutronium can't be harvested, it's that it's not cost effective to do so until you have something to sell it for.

Any setting where humans live alongside another intelligent race for any great length of time (over 1000 years). I think some faction of humans would eventually get riled up, or just in a mood to conqueror stuff and after a few episodes of this they would end up exterminating that other race. In order for that species to survive it would need one of two things:

1. Living areas that are not easily accessible by humans. Mermaids, Dwarves that live without light under giant mountains, etc.
2. Massive power advantage over humans so that any wars that are fought would be won decisively by the other species.

And if reason 2 is why they have not been killed off that species also needs to be significantly different than humans in their temperament, because then they would just wipe out humans.

The elves always knew that humans bred fast enough that they would one day outnumber the elves so greatly that it would be a serious problem for all of elf-kind, but any extermination program against the humans would be costly in terms of precious elf lives, and none of the elf kingdoms wanted to bite that bullet by themselves. Talks for a human extermination treaty continually fell apart due to mistrust and selfishness (remember that you can't spell selfish without elfish).

Now the elves are in a position where human extermination is basically impossible, so they stay in their heavily fortified redoubts and count on the fact that humans can't effectively break elfish defenses.

It would also allow for a fantasy adaptation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiverfull][Quiverfull]] movement, though that depends somewhat on what the reason for low elfish reproduction rates is.

That sounds like one of my exceptions, which is that elves would be able to decisively defeat any invaders.

The problem as I see it is that Human civilizations, and possibly fantasy civilizations of other races could have a wide range of variability in their military prowess. There were groups like Ghengis Khan and the Mongols, Alexander the Great and the Macedonians, Napoleon and the French, the Roman Republic, the Mughals, etc that were all hitting way above their weight class. They all conquered their neighbors and slaughtered entire cities and peoples sometimes. They were conquering other humans that they could enslave and interbreed with. Humans could potentially enslave elves, but in most setting humans and elves can't interbreed. If they did what humans normally did, they would slaughter all of the adult males (possibly all the adults, or all the males depending on the particulars of Elven breeding problems, and the conquering human culture). You would then be left with a bunch of female elves and maybe a few young male elves that aren't really capable of rekindling a civilization.

And for each region that Elves and humans share it only takes one great human conqueror to kill off the elves.

*edit - I'm new to posting in this subreddit, but that challenge sounds fun, I've got a few ideas around semi-extinct elves running around in a human world.

It wasn't a long stretched out 'total war' situation. But its our only evidence of humans living alongside another intelligent species. And the end result is that the Neandrathals are gone. Maybe there was some non-human cause to Neandrathal extinction, but the interbreeding is evidence that Neandrathals and humans shared an environment at one point. At a minimum, humans at least caused pressure on Neandrathal habitats in a time of crisis for their species. At most they possibly hunted and killed Neandrathal tribes to eliminate one of their main competitors in the environment.

Its an n=1 data situation, but it still suggests that a shared environment lead to the extinction of one species. And the only thing to facilitate this extinction was stone age tools, starvation, shared environment, and competition for resources.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

And Humans have wiped out other groups of humans throughout history, especially on a regional basis. And there are large variations in human population's ability to wage war. So even if a competing intelligent race is equivalent to us, it only takes one generation of violent conquerors to heavily specialize in warfare and permanently tip the balance in favor of one species. Ghengis Khan, Roman republic, Alexander the Great, Napolean, the Mughals, etc are all examples of a generation or two that was heavily specialized in warfare and leveraged it to conquer massive areas of land and create mountains of dead bodies in their wake.

#+begin_quote
  Not unless the individual wars are already very close to wiping them out, which implies a very skewed weapon effectiveness/population ratio unlike anything that's existed in our history.
#+end_quote

So we have an example of stone age level tools wiping out a stone age level population of another species. We have multiple examples of medieval level technology wiping out peoples during conquest. We have examples of more technologically advanced civilizations wiping out less advanced civilizations (the Americas). And we have modern examples in China, Russia, and Germany of governments that are fully capable of killing off large portions of their own population.

So my question is, when have humans not had the ability to wipe out another human-like species? Unless that species could beat us even when we have a super-generation of conquerors, or they have a non-shared environment where we would not be competing with them for resources.

  Humans have wiped out other groups of humans throughout history, especially on a regional basis.
#+end_quote

If one species exists in only a small region, and humans are spread across a large region, then yes, I could see that tiny settlement being wiped out. But that's obviously a case of the Others being at a severe disadvantage relative to humans.

#+begin_quote
  So we have an example of stone age level tools wiping out a stone age level population of another species.
#+end_quote

No, we have an example of a stone-age level intelligent species going extinct for unknown reasons.

#+begin_quote
  We have multiple examples of medieval level technology wiping out peoples during conquest. We have examples of more technologically advanced civilizations wiping out less advanced civilizations (the Americas). And we have modern examples in China, Russia, and Germany of governments that are fully capable of killing off large portions of their own population.
#+end_quote

And yet, despite multiple attempts, no-one has ever managed to wipe out another race. As you note, the closest they came is the Americas, and that was with help from disease to kill 90% of the population. They have, at best, managed to genocide /most/ of a particular ethnic group in a small are.

Humans, empirically, aren't united enough to wipe out other races. Your assertion that multiple humanlike races cannot coexist is empirically disproven by the /actual existence/ of multiple human races, none of which have been wiped out.

Its like believing in micro-evolution but not macro-evolution. If it can happen at a small scale, then it can happen repeatedly at a small scale until it becomes a large scale.

What we do know implies that humans are more likely than not to be at blame. If we saw this in the fossil record for any other two species we wouldn't hesitate to assign blame to the invading species. Two similar species with similar ecological niches. Soon after they start sharing the same habitat one of these species becomes extinct, with only traces of its DNA left in the other species.

That is just flat out not true. Different races of humans have been wiped out, to the same degree that the Neandrathals have been wiped out. Scatterings of their DNA survive in their neighbors or their conquerors, but no other trace of them remains. There were hundreds of pre-Columbian tribes that were wiped out. Sometimes all we have left from them is a river or geographic landmark named after the tribe.

There is a long history of intentional Genocide between Humans [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides_in_history]]

If your measure of success is that 100% of the people were killed, then yeah nothing meets that metric. That isn't my metric though. I think a Human genocide comparable metric for a species that could not interbreed with humans would be that a human population has been destroyed so badly that they can never again recover as their own unique population. And that has been the case with nearly everything termed a 'genocide'.

Humans don't have to be united. That other race just has to be a competitive drain on limited resources that are worth fighting over. No one claims that the Neandrathal era humans were united as a single force against Neandrathals.

Current humans are incredibly genetically similar compared to other animal species. [[http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics/human-skin-color-variation/modern-human-diversity-genetics]] So rather than disproving my point, the human races you see today are so similar that they barely warrant being called different races. And you still mostly never see situations like in Tolkein fantasy, where there are widely different races sharing the same region. I'll call them mixed regional neighborhoods:

Human - elf - hobbit - human - dwarf - elf - hobbit - human

If they were more like traditional human racial regions it would look like this:

Human - Human - Human - Hobbit - Hobbit - Elf - Elf - Dwarf - Dwarf

And history would often go through periods of war where those different races would start expanding into other areas, usually if one race tended to go through an era of extra military ability. So it might end up looking like:

Human - Human - Human - Hobbit - Hobbit - Elf - Elf - Dwarf - Dwarf

V

Human - Human - Human - Human - Elf - Elf - Elf - Elf - Dwarf

V

Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Elf - Elf - Elf

V

Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Human

How is it supposed to consistently happen in humanity's favour over and over, unless humans have a systematic advantage?

*** There may be another solution: integration. If you can't beat humans, maybe you can join them. Sure you'd be a minority in human society, but if it got the point where humans were more successful than your species then it may actually be a better place to live overall.

**** Humans have never been very good at integration. The Jewish people seem to be an exception that proves the rule. They managed to survive as a people and religion, despite pogroms and many other attempts to eradicate them. I'd guess that there many other cases of people attempting something like the Jewish people, but ultimately failing and being forgotten by history. If those are your best odds for survival I wouldn't be placing any favorable bets on your species.

** Two (unrelated) questions:

1. Assuming that the DC Emotional Entities suddenly showed up in WH40K (having previously been fucking off on the other side of the visible universe) and each created and dispatched a ring and battery (ring includes instructional data on some aspects of ring programming, along with the ability to forge new rings through colossal amounts of effort), and given that the Entities are not friendly with Chaos: Who would each entity pick as their First Lantern? Ignore Hope, as Blue is going to be an OC (possibly SI).

2. Which settings can you think of that have parallel worlds as a technological or magical mechanism? Which of these would be interesting to smack upside the metaphorical head with a genre-savvy zerg swarm?

*** I have only superficial familiarity with 40K, but I'll try my best. Rage would probably go to an Ork due to their bloodlust. Avarice would seek out the Tryanids because to their hunger. Fear might be drawn to the Imperium since they're all "ends justify the means" at their best times. I honestly have no idea who'd end up with the rest, since the people in this universe aren't exactly known for Courage, Love, or Compassion.

**** On the contrary! The men and women of the Imperial Guard have to be quite courageous to stand off against living gods and devouring swarms.

The Tau are arguably compassionate, depending on which bits of canon you're drawing from, and in any case you could find individuals exhibiting one of these characteristics in most of the factions: an eldar can be courageous, loving, or compassionate.

***** The Tau might be a good choice for Compassion since the comics were always a little unclear about how the Indigo Tribe's actions were supposed to be compassionate. They did some pretty disturbing stuff at times and were always secretive about why, apparently trying to do good but never fully cooperating with or trusting others. Not that the Tau would make more sense, but it would be consistent with canon.

**** The obvious choice for Love would be Slaneesh cultists, but since they're avoiding those ... nonsexual love counts, right? I know WW got one because she "loves everyone equally".

Maybe someone in the Imperial religion could power it with their love for the Emperor?

There's precedent for Imperial miracles like that, too. I think the Sisters of Battle are the best at that?

It /might/, but I'd lean toward the Eldar. Maybe the Dark Eldar. (Every Eldar faction is in some way based around the fact that their afterlife consists of being raped and devoured by Slaneesh. Dark Eldar dedicate their lives to torturing, killing, and generally terrorizing people in order to temporarily appease it.)
