** So what I intend by this question is to imagine how human society would have shaped up without the certainty of profit that interest brings. Would we be as advanced as we are? Would there be more stability in markets? Would we innovate less?

And, emotionally, would we develop a culture of satisfaction with what we have and would that be better?
