** You should probably make this its own thread; right now, you're hardly making much of a splash in the raging river of the main discussion thread. Explaining more about the original world might also help garner interest.

As an idle thought: one of the main appeals of SotL is observing the emergent social effects of one phenomenon that works on a universal level, and you lose that if you simply take that phenomenon and make it a one-off bound to a single main character. It's up to you if that's a problem you actually want to tackle, or even consider a problem at all.

*** Giving this its own thread would probably help it a fair amount. I enjoyed reading it.

*** I am not a highly proficient storyteller. I'm a good writer on the prose level, but I quite frankly don't have the chops to do anything with a coherent plot, let alone social consequences or themes. I just wrote this for fun.

Did /not/ expect it to end up on [[/r/rational]]. The only reason the plot doesn't dictate everything is because there's no plot to do the dictating!

**** When you say "and last," like that, you make it sound as if it's over.

***** Once it gets a thread of its own posted, visit the thread and click "watch thread" in the upper right corner. I think you need a registered account for that, though.

****** I have one; I'm Baughn on SV. Never found a good way to follow those threads, though. :)

I'll just register my interest with the author.
