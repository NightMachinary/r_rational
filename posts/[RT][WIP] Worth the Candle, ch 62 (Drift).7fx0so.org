*** My thoughts indeed! Whether it's how the System handles demons or beings without souls, it looks like a big glaring blindspot--

--Actually, scratch that. That was my first thought, and would be really exciting (as well as scary) if so, but I'm replacing it with my new first hypothesis that the System is identifying her fine, but /she doesn't have a name/. In that case, with the System just not having a name to put in that position, it should be replaced by a name as soon as someone (the protagonist?) gives it to her (and it's accepted). Not being able to display her name because she doesn't have a name is unfortunately less exciting than not being able to display her name because she doesn't have a soul (or because she's a possessing demon).

Edit: When checking about whether any name was mentioned, I was reminded that Amaryllis is not going to be happy about him choosing to save her, perhaps mollifiable by the Companion status revelation.

**** I don't know about that. There's a few ways you could potentially get a null pointer, at least in C:

1) You left your pointer uninitialized, in which case it could be a null pointer or any other random number. You might get a null pointer, but you might also get some random person on the other side of the continent.

2) You tried to allocate memory to store the name, and the memory allocation failed. This is kind of a really weird possibility, because if you're at the point where you can't store a simple string of bytes, there should be a lot of other problems with the simulation.

3) You actually set your pointer as a null pointer.

I actually think 3) is most likely in his instance. If souls themselves are pointers, then the lack of one is arguably a null pointer. The system tried to access the 'soul' pointer and retrieved 0, then tripped the null pointer exception.

*** There's a possibility that by increasing his loyalty level with the nonanima Juniper will raise his loyalty level with every other entity that lacks a soul/is a null pointer. Which may or may not be powerful and useful.

Also, this means that souls act as pointers for the computer system that runs reality, which is very interesting and makes soul magic sound really powerful. I'm beginning to think that soul magic will end up just being computer programming.

Unlikely. It's not the value of the pointer that matters*, it's the values at the address to which they point. So it could matter what's at the null memory address, or near it, in the case of pointer arithmetic; this is (AFAIK) part of how common security attacks can work.

- Outside of pointer arithmetic, etc.

If we're presuming that this is an actual error in the game layer, and not a joke/reference, then this would imply that loyalty is NOT a property of whatever object type the pointer is for; but that where the companion title/name comes from /is/. Which is interesting. It also implies that the game layer will catch exceptions and handle them gracefully, instead of crashing. Also interesting.

**** My bet is simply that the "world" of the stimulation is one data structure (a matrix? heh) in the simulating computer system's simulator-process's address space; while souls are simply other data-structures in the same process's address space. By itself, that gives you no more ability to program the simulation than the existence of BLOB-typed records gives you the ability to program a RDBMS.

** Theory: Based on the conversation before he turned the elves into fighting machines, I am making a guess that the method Fallatehr is using to control the shaped is that he has rendered their souls unstable - without a soul mage to maintain them, they will decay and eventually turn soul-less. The non-anima is the result of those experiments, and also a reminder what happens to you if you cross him, which is why he kept it around.

... Which in turn implies the non-anima was the sort of person who would rather go into oblivion than obey Fallatehr. Yhea, if I am right, definitely companion material, tough reconstructing a soul is a tall ask.

Other things soul-magic is very likely to be useful for. Fallatehr edited fear out of himself. The fact that this is possible implies that self-directed soul magic can render Joon zen about the whole leveling process - That is, just straight up carve it out of himself as a value, making his attitude one of "it happens, it happens". That is very good news, because Experience-point addict Joon is not a story line I want to see.
