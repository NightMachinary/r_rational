** This is the chapter where you remember that the author's day job is being a therapist - we will skip over a month of psychic training, but we ain't gonna skip over the therapy sessions!

​

The part that jumps out to me the most is all the Red's sense that they need to "resolve" the Aiko question, figure out if he "did the right thing or not" before feeling guilty, etc. It evokes what the Gym third said to him as she found him outside the hospital - "sometimes we dont get to know"; sadly I dont think Red is ever going to be able to answer that question, which is the real struggle he has to deal with. Thats my, uh, guess I suppose for why he can't resolve this and what he has to internalize, though also just generally an important thing for anyone to know, how unresolvable most uncertainty is.

​

(also +1 point for Red point-of-view, oh thank you, I was suffering withdrawal I swear)

As great as the therapy sessions are... this is a little annoying, even if it is understandable why its written this way.

So far, each Gym we've seen has gone into detail as to the philosophy, training methods, and nature of people who both challenge and work at said gyms. It's really been quite amazing, and I've been eagerly looking forward to how Sabrina does her training.

I know that it is written this way because we, the audience, are still focused on the aftermath of the Endbringer battle, and therefore that thread needs to be resolved and not just immediately abandoned at the start of a new chapter. Right proper storytelling. I'm just hoping that the author will give us a chance to see and to detail some of Sabrina's methods at some near point in the future, because so far the worldbuilding has been amazing.

**** Personally I wouldn't say self-aware. He's had a partition up for long enough and prodded it enough that he now has a separate personality built around grief. In HPMOR the main character has a "mysterious dark side" that thinks differently, here the two reds have a completely different take on what reality looks like and they can't really make an argument for which one of them is "real".

I guess it just feels a bit wrong to call him self-aware when he's mostly aware of the fact that his self can't recognise or understand itself.

** I'm always super hyped for the next chapter, but doubly so this time because I had absolutely /no/ clue what was going to happen. A timeskip? How long? Whose perspective? Would it be an interlude? And sure enough, I was taken completely by surprise.

​

/Huh./ So Red has DID now. Which honestly makes a scary amount of sense. I mean, what else will happen when you literally segment a part of yourself away? It's gonna grow on its own while the "new" you grows on its own, so when you go back, it feels like you're a different person (or in a different reality, as uh...Past Red called him? Wonder if we're gonna come up with nicknames for the two Reds).

​

At first I felt a slight amount of trepidation seeing the main character suddenly get a new personality, but I think it was executed really well. Neither Red, despite literally being "out of character", feels OOC. They both feel like /him,/ and you could make arguments for either Red being the "real" one. The part where he switches between the two? So well written, you can /feel/ the shift just like I'm sure Dr. Seward did. May edit as more thoughts come to me, idk, great chapter and looking forward to the next.

I suppose this raises the question then: anyone got any good recs for works that deal in grief? Especially in unusual (but valid and realistic) ways. Definitely do not need to be rational/adjacent, but seeing how different types is kinda the point, if you do have any, feel free to chuck em my way.

** Red's DID is scary. Both Non-Partition Red and Partition Red claim they are the real and the other is fake, either delusionally-naive or delusionally-depressed. I must admit I like PR better than NPR, but eventually I hope he deals with his grief in a normal way, without a partition, but retaining his personality and character.

Really good chapter. I'll definitely have to read it again to fully get the implications.

Also, during the day, does Red normally make an effort to keep his partition down? He says it goes back up if he doesn't concentrate or after sleep, but does he take it down first thing in the morning?

*** No, Red with the partition up likes keeping it up. He described it as painful and uncomfortable to take it down and only did it because his therapist asked him too. By the same token once the partition is down, he would never put it back up, but it requires focus to keep down. As a result it always eventually returns.

The only reason the partition ever comes down is that using his psychic abilities weakens it.

** Oh, completely unrelated thought, but do you have any plans for the move Miracle Eye? Among other things, it removes a dark type's immunity to psychic moves, which has a few plot relevant consequences. Kadabra/Alakazam and Natu/Xatu are both capable of learning both Miracle Eye and Teleport, which would make them ideal teleporters for dark humans. Also, Mewtwo learns it, which sounds like fun times.

Given that this move clearly doesn't exist in the current story (as even Giovanni laments his inability to teleport), it might be a good fit for something discovered by Red when training his (eventual) Kadabra. It's really easy to imagine him immediately showing Sabrina, who then manages to unwittingly pass it on to Mewtwo.

*** That's a really good idea. Giovanni might not (actually) want such a move to exist, but there is probably at least /some/ interest in-universe for a move allowing psychic types to affect dark types. I can imagine there already being deliberate research in that area. It seems natural for psychic trainers to be interested in reading the minds of dark type humans/pokemon. Alternatively, a trainer of psychic types might make note of the move while shoring up weaknesses.

** I've been feeling a bit impatient to see Red, Blue, and Leaf try and resolve their issues after the last chapter, but luckily that didn't happen because this "intermediate" chapter was incredible. Red's emotions, and his thoughts and explanations of them, were perfectly done and his transitions between mental states fit so well for something that out of the blue. (That pun wasn't intended but it's staying.)

I almost cried with Past Red. Personally I've never been in the kind of situations Red has gone through but it's so hard not to empathise after he says: "They're dead, it's the least I can do to acknowledge that, instead of ignoring it like a... a coward...". Really makes you think about your view of death after reading that.

+On another note, Past Red says "ignore how much I miss my dad and how guilty I feel about A..." but Red clearly states that guilt isn't the true emotion that he's feeling. Is this more of an off-hand statement or is it an admission of sorts?+ Never mind, he says that guilt isn't the main thing he's thinking about, but he doesn't say there's no guilt at all.

** Thinking about it, it does make a terrible amount of sense that Partition!Red and Non-Partition!Red, while both still Red, would have different views about the world. After all, supressing a part of his brain the way Red did for as long as he did, is bound to have consequences. For now, keeping the partition up seems to be way to go. But, in the long run, his endgoal should be reconciling both his sides and learning to live without his partition.

Very interesting chapter. Not at all what I expected, but entertaining nonetheless. I'm also happy that Red is concerned about becoming aloof and distant as most psychics are because I was worried about that too when he left with Sabrina.

So things seem to be at pretty low point right now with everybody broken up and still hurting after Aiko's death, but hopefully it will get better from here on. Wishful thinking I know, but you can't stop me from rooting for these kids.

** After digesting this chapter and reading the comments here, I want to say I feel like Red with DID is almost a reference to Twitch plays Pokemon, but I'm sure it isn't. It's a funny coincidence to me though!

I dunno, it feels one step closer to canon red, and one step closer to being the lonely trainer on the summit of mount silver.

*** There was a very cute TPP reference earlier in the fic. From Chapter 21:

#+begin_quote
  As the dozens of voices buzz around him, Red admires the path of the helix spiral from an inch away, musing over whether the clue to some god lies somewhere in its curves, perhaps one of order and chaos, his gaze following the loops up right down left, up right down left, up right down left...
#+end_quote

But I will echo the other people saying that yeah, I read Red's depressed muteness and desire to commune with the minds of his Pokemon as heavily reminiscent of canon "..." Red.

** Internal Family Systems were very interesting to learn about, because as a writing/introspection exercise, in my circle of friends it is very common to concept our internal parts as, uh, goetic demons. The person who started this trend even expanded it out to a full Key-of-Solomon-modeled 72-demon grimoire.

Speaking purely hypothetically, what would your reaction be if you explained Internal Family Systems to a patient and they came back with a fifty thousand word occult text?

** So I made some comments on a thread a month or so again about this, and I finally caught up on the story (a few weeks ago actually, but I was waiting for a chapter post to make this). My feedback (I believe I made it up to the forest fire before quitting, initially) was primarily that 1. the scientific explanations felt forced, 2. The characters felt weird, and 3. Game of Champions ruined other pokemon fanfic for me.

Now that I'm caught up, I can stay I still largely agree with all of these initial impressions, but with caveats.

1. The most egregious scientific explanation was Red's experiment from when he first got his charmander. That set a /horrible/ tone for me because it felt extremely naive for a (near?) genius who lives in a pokemon world. This experiment felt like an actual 12 year old, and happens before you clarify that they're different in an AN. HPMOR had a similar issue early on as well.

2. General character weirdness. This one is less quantifiable, but I found myself not really liking most of the characters early on. It wasn't until Pewter that I realized I really enjoyed Blue, and a bit later when Leaf grew on me. Red is still half and half to me, but that's more for me not liking his personality too much, rather than me not believing it. He still feels too naive and hopeful for me to like him, but I can't complain now that this chapter has justified this, and also clearly defined a dark counterpart to it.

3. Game of Champions vs. OoS. Obviously Game of Champions has a far edgier and less hopeful outlook on the world, but it also uses a ton of evocative language and darker worldbuilding that OoS doesn't do. This is more a stylistic preference on my part rather than legitimate criticism, in retrospect. I tend to give the story a lot of credit because it flips enough switches in my brain that I don't see the flaws.

The caveat to these is that the writing quality improves */DRAMATICALLY/* over the course of the series. Early chapters just didn't have the characters as well defined, and the scientific explanations felt forced rather than natural. The last one I even /remember noticing/ was the value charting on Red and Blue's birthday. There have been more, but they felt seamless and important rather than a boring blog post interlude. All three of my complaints from before were valid /for the chapters I read/, but I currently wouldn't apply any of them to the recent chapters. This isn't my favorite story, but I greatly enjoy reading it and was disappointed when I was finally caught up.

On the interlude you suggested me, chapter 28: I actually wasn't a huge fan of it, and it felt fairly different from the rest of the story. I ended up reading the story because the quality wasn't bad, and some of the comments seemed to indicate that the story/characters got better. Most popular things on this sub tend to be good, barring a few exceptions. I'd be interested in seeing interludes from some non-characters, more to flesh out the world rather than flesh out the plot.

On topic for the chapter: I was actually hoping the time skip would go a few extra months, if only to see further power progression when the characters need to respond to disasters. I'm cautiously optimistic that the gang will get back together, but a Red/Blue rivalry *is* canon, and this would be a better way to start it than most.

*** Thank you for feedback! I'm glad you're enjoying the story more now, and that my writing has improved. And since Game of Champions is actually the only pokemon fanfic I've been able to read more than a few chapters of (and greatly enjoyed), being held second to it is still high praise, to me :)

** Awesome chapter!

I hope this eventually builds to Red learning to accept both, or all sides of himself. I wonder if he keeps gaining control over his partition, if he'll eventually be able to break it and have those thoughts memories and feelings merge with those in the rest of his mind. That's if he chooses to, of course.

** I'm really glad I checked the reviews and responses here out before trying the fic - reading that the author is a therapist and is including DID in the fic makes it easy to do a hard pass when it's meant to be rational (because there is zero real evidence for the existence of DID and quite a bit of evidence against it).

*** You're thinking of Multiple Personality Disorder, and likely the highly dramatized version that often shows up in fiction.

Also the roots of this are supernatural in nature, so if you don't have a problem with HPMOR's "dark side" I doubt you'd find this problematic.

***** Multiple Personality Disorder is often characterized by the idea of distinct "people" all inhabiting the same brain/body.

If you read Dissasociative Identity Disorder's DSM criteria, the symptoms can include something like that, but also include people who undergo periods where they just feel, as the name implies, disassociated from their thoughts/actions. This doesn't necessarily mean they think they're a different person: people who go through manic/depressive episodes, for example, can qualify, as can people who have kleptomania, or people who feel like they undergo particularly strong personality shifts under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
