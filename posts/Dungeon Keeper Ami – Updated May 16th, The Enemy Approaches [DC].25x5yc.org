** Checking my [[http://page2rss.com/rss/0ff8bb3c441dc586101d6ed6c068feb8][RSS feed]], there was much undignified squeeing involved on my part. Pusakuronu hasn't updated forever.. I'll read through few of the last chapters though, to recap.

To the folks who are seeing this for the first time I introduce you to one of the best written Magical Girl story, recommended by the Yudkowsky. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DungeonKeeperAmi][The Tvtropes link]].

The author brilliantly fleshed out the Dungeon Keeper verse into an Epic, implementing the Sailor Moon crossover aspect seamlessly. And you won't need prior knowledge for either of the franchise -- the story progression will naturally fill you up on everything.

A note of warning though. Easily Worm-esque level door stopper. You will find weeks of your life suddenly and gloriously devoured.

Edit: [[http://addventure.bast-enterprises.de/224921.html][First Chapter]], only paths and branches written by Pusakuronu are canon.

*** oo, thank you. I only check on Dungeon Keeper Ami every few weeks, so I could have possibly gone without knowing about this update for a good long time.

***** why, because it started with low difficulty and tons of coins, meaning that the people who started it off got tons of them? That's... kinda a problem with almost every coin.

But it's a bit... angrier then I'd like. And less specific. I should probably do up a post sometime.

It's a problem with every coin, but for the most part other coins have a reason to exist.

Dogecoins sole value proposition is "use a bunch of social media bullshit (read skinner box techniques), memes, and persuation techniques to boost the value of our currency".

Read through "Influence: Science and Practice" and tell me that dogetipbot isn't a scummy bit of social enginearing.

******* My library didn't have that book :\

If there is scummy social engineering in the tip bot, then I think it's just inherited. I'm pretty sure the bot's just a clone of the bitcoin tipbot that's been around since forever.

I see dogecoin's value proposition more as "The other currencies are too serious and bloodthirsty. Let's make something silly and jokey that we can throw around like the crazy internet points they are." It's something to have fun with and not take too seriously.

Or maybe more idealistically, even if I'm wrong about that and dogecoin was made as a scam, I think it's evolved beyond that. With the community that it's fostered and the crazy things they do, it's become more than just its numbers and its memes.

And what makes skinner box techniques etc an invalid tool, anyway? If you can use them to make something positive, then you should do so.

Ugh, and now I'm caught between the urge to continue this interesting debate, and the knowledge that it's /waaay/ off-topic for this subreddit and thread.
