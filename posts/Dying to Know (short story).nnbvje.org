** This was a little too obviously something it /wasn't/ for me to think the journalist would actually sit down in it. Rich old man, time releases, arcane looking brain-encompassing device. It has to be a mind-swapper right? So he can steal your younger body? Right?

** Suffers a little from the twist being obvious from the title. Well, obvious to someone who has already thought about the weird implications from some interpretations of MWI. I guessed it around "Dropped out of a physics PhD, a philosophy PhD, /and/ a journalism program." Still solid, though.

*** Interesting. I wasn't really expecting people to get it that early, but I guess you're right that if you've already thought about the topic then the title is kind of a dead giveaway.

**** I suspected that it was something along those lines from just the title alone. But that was partly primed by clicking a link on this subreddit. If I were expecting a mystery story, it might have slipped by. But if you start out expecting a science fiction story (or possibly a fantasy story leaning heavily on scientific or philosophical elements), then quantum immortality is one of the most obvious ways to obtain information by dying.

**** For me it was the QRNG; I was like oh, this is like quantum bogosort isn't it. Honestly, I don't think it's that obvious, but the title does kind of give more away than it needs to.

**** At "two chairs, with heavy straps and bulky helmets" I was expecting it to switch which person's mind was in which body

But by "From a certain philosphical perspective" I'd switched tracks to quantum immortality.

**** Anyone who's familiar with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality][work of Max Tegmark]] already knows what the story is about, but for [[https://xkcd.com/1053/][those who don't]] it's a clever and well-written introduction.

**** My initial reaction was that that's a pointless epicycle because 'success' branches will exist whether or not you have these random plans for success. But it does seem true that random vaguely-plausible plans are less likely to get your consciousness revived in a world where you wouldn't want it to be.

***** I think the goal here is maximizing the chance that you get to live ~forever /due to your own actions/. Every branch has an identical chance of resulting in a given outcome, after all, including immortality--but humans are very self-centered.

There's also an argument to be made that, just by using a QRNG, he's automatically increasing the chances of living forever by inflating the probability space, since he doesn't care at all about any other outcome.
