** I'm going to be reading Echopraxia in the next few months. Is this something I should wait to read until after I've finished that? Or are they best read in order?

*** I'd suggest diving straight into Echopraxia, since it sustains a point of view throughout most of the book that isn't the Colonel's. But it's not a heavy suggestion, you'd be hard pressed to not enjoy both either way.

*** I'm currently reading 'Echopraxia' and reading 'Colonel' first definitely improved the experience for me - refreshed my 'Blindsight' memory and now I have a better idea of what's going on

** I haven't read either, though this triggered me using audible credits on both, but it seems to be a vignette you can read alone, no clue on if it has any spoilers though.
