I don't know if the authors here are aware of this yet, but reddit's [[https://www.redditinc.com/policies][new policy]] has at least one highly questionable section, reproduced below. Just thought I would bring this to everyone's attention before anyone accidentally grants a perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license to their work without meaning to. That said, I am not a lawyer and it is entirely possible that I am making a mountain out of a molehill. Better safe than sorry though.

Section 4 paragraph 4: /When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content./


** Most of this is fairly standard; it's what allows the site to function.

There are two major issues that are cropping up on other writing subs: the irrevocability, and the waiver of moral rights & attribution.

** IANAL, but in my minimal understanding, if reddit /didn't/ have something like this, comment sections couldn't legally exist because they would violate the copyright of the users.

** Obligatory IANAL, but I think this applies to the content that reddit actually hosts. So if you write a fic in a self post or in a comment (i.e. [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]]) you are subject to section 4.

If someone links your work hosted by another website, you're subject to section 5 and it doesn't grant reddit any rights.

** Looks like it's the same thing Facebook does, it's a legal thing to allow them to show the content to people, they usually do recognize the ownership to the author, or at least that's what I heard
