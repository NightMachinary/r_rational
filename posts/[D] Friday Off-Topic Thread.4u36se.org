Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** After a serious storm, I'm on my second day without power. There was apparently some serious infrastructure damage which means that power won't be back on in my neighborhood until tomorrow at the earliest.

I tend to do a lot of thinking about the mostly invisible physical systems that make up modern society like running water, electricity, internet, credit cards, and the complex supply chains that allow me to pick from a wide variety of products at any store. I think there are some people who look at things like that and get frightened by it, because it can seem so fragile; if the power goes out in your house, you lose both refrigeration, which doesn't just set you back to pre-refrigeration technology but /further/ because you can't cook without your electric stove or your microwave. And you can't go to the store, because the stores are either closed (due to loss of power) or not taking credit cards (due to loss of power). Things weren't quite that bad for me, because I have a propane grill, a stock of non-perishable staples, and emergency cash, but in the abstract it's sobering.

Then I start thinking about what life is like in places where there are routine rolling blackouts or a lack of services to begin with. There was a documentary I watched a while back about what life was like in Soviet Russia, which I think is more intruiging than the third world, because it's not that they didn't have the technology, it was instead a system failure.

*** I once went through a short phase where I saw society as insanely fragile and was utterly terrified by what would happen when the house of cards inevitably comes crashing down. However, I then realized that humans have been constructing civilizations for thousands of years and collapses like the one I was imagining are rare historically. So what was keeping such a complex system going?

The answer is a combination of three major factors with a lot of other minors ones which I'm not going to go into:

- It's difficult for any single person to do meaningful damage to society as a whole. Therefore, no lone madman can destroy a nation a la Joker-style.

- Virtually every aspect of civilization requires infrastructure to function. This means that it's in everyone's long term best interest to cooperate (or at least follow laws) to maintain an advanced lifestyle.

- It's /self-reinforcing/. Societies undergo a particular form of mimetic evolution where the weaker societies either collapse or get taken over by others. As a result, the better surviving societies pass on their systems of governance and cultural mores. More advanced civilizations are built from the bones and foundations of earlier civilizations. I could spend a good hour talking about how the Renaissance contributed to the make-up of all cultures descended from Europe of the 1300-1500s.

I know that you weren't asking how civilization can function, but I wanted to share a few points I found fascinating and comforting to know.

***** Yeah I gave up on the belief that any one single society can last forever and I try to stay optimistic about the reasons why I think humanity can actually survive the long run to become an intergalactic civilization. Despite what I just said before, I don't actually think any society can last forever yet, but rather each civilization can learn from the mistakes of earlier ones and survive longer and longer. So therefore, civilizations become more robust and flexible with each iteration.

It's quite frankly horrifying knowing that collapses can happen, but what matters is the continuation of sapient life (with a strong personal preference for humankind over other intelligences).

TL;DR - I don't actually have a long-term perspective, I just have selfish reasons to convince myself that we have absolutely nothing to fear about humanity disappearing into oblivion without becoming something /great/. FOR THE GOD-EMPEROR!!!

Case study: Zimbabwe, over about the last decade or so.

This raises an interesting point about collapses - a /local/ collapse, over a single country, is not world-ending. Sure, it's really nasty for the people /in/ that country (at least, those unable to sneak across a border); but countries are usually independent enough that what takes one country down may have little to no effect outside that country; and once the confounding factors are removed, the /knowledge/ on how to get things up and running again is either remembered or at worst can be hired in from places that have not experienced the collapse.

Knowledge, physical health, and self-sufficiency are what you should really start working on, but there are tons of preppers who are overweight and focused entirely on the warfare aspect. They're like "runners" who kit themselves out with the best running shoes, running shorts, water bottle, etc., talk all the time about running, but then don't actually /go running/. This is a common failure mode for lots and lots of things people do (writing is the one I see the most often, but that's because I put myself around a lot of people who are supposedly writers).

But no, it's not here that's the worst. I suffered through four years of an English major with so many people who were more interested in the idea of being a writer than actually writing. Same happens on pretty much every writing forum, in part because the people who want to talk about writing are going to be disproportionately represented in those places. (And I love National Novel Writing Month, but there are always a huge number of people more enamored with the idea of having written a novel than with the actual writing of said novel.)

** *On modding*: I shipped a mod for factorio: [[https://mods.factorio.com/mods/hackerkiba/MagneticFloor][MagneticFloor]]

I feel good for fixing the bugs and making it usable to the public at large. On the other hand...there's a lack of a tutorial on how to use it. I am rectifying that slowly, however.

It's mod that's initially about floors that provide better movement bonus, but the real gem of the mod is the ability to automate movement of the player from one place to another though you'll need a factory setup to produce more of copper floors and directives that control movements, exemplifying the factorio spirit of automation and logistics.

*On writing*: The end is near for a terrible fanfic I am writing, but I slowed down considerably. I got this weird feeling against working directly on writing new chapters and finishing it versus working on filler tasks, which I am happy to do but I know won't progress to the final chapter.

Despite the badness of the fic, I feel good about writing what I want to write and see in a fic.

I am working on an original fic project that I kept mentioning on worldbuilding threads for the past few weeks, but I am nt prepared to fire on all cylinder to the project. I am still worldbuilding and there should be considerable amount of research. Naming places as always, difficult, and so is inventing new nations and a historical timeline.

*On productivity*:

I am using timeboxing to great effect, setting my effort at twenty minutes each. In my experience, it's short enough to not feel too long yet long enough to make substantial progress. Sometime, however, you only get very little done, but that may be due to reasons other than not being able to focus on a task. Usually that means I am learning something or googling or researching something.

Is there any research on productivity of timeboxing? (I am supposed to be using the podomoro technique, but I can't be bother to take a specified five minutes break)

  The Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting “USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!”, and listening to country music.

  The Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to “everything except country”.

He's painting with a wide brush here, but you can see how a lot of these things, which /sound/ strongly correlated with politics, might affect a choice of who you want to build a life with. I personally don't care a huge amount about, say, whether someone thinks marginal taxes should be slightly higher or lower, or whether the TPP is good or not. But if I'm going to make a life with someone, a lot of these other listed things /do/ matter. Even if there's not an actual correlation, there's a /perception/ of a correlation, which is enough for most people. Were I a Red, I wouldn't dismiss someone for, hypothetically, voting democrat; I would dismiss them for being someone who likes soccer or eats arugula or that whole package, etc.

How do you see this affecting things, specifically? For example, at gatherings/parties do you see people refuse to associate with each other due to political differences? Because again, in most situations I see the opposite- debates ensue (which can turn into arguments if the people involved aren't careful), but in general these are handled in an adult fashion and other factors such as how vitriolic, uncompromising, or loose with facts they are plays a bigger role in determining how the two sides feel about each other.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe you don't feel that strongly about politics?
#+end_quote

I care about politics a lot, but I'm also of the opinion that given how complicated the system is and given the vastly different backgrounds of most other interested people, it's a mistake to judge people too harshly based on their specific beliefs. For example, I have friends who are very opposed to transexual rights, which I disagree with, but as long as they are able to give solid reasons why they feel that way, it doesn't shift my opinion of their character much. Ultimately, being able to accept new evidence and correct your beliefs seems like a more important character trait.

** Yesterday I watched My Neighbor Totoro for the first time and it put me in a good mood for the first time in a while. I like Kiki's Delivery Service more, but Totoro is just so simple and sweet that it couldn't help but brighten my day. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4aawjt][A month ago]] I shared an idea I had for a story that [[/u/scruiser]] is now writing, and since the Happy Stories contest is in need of more entries I thought I'd share another premise that Totoro inspired in me.

I started with the idea of telling the same story in an urban setting, where the protagonists encounter weirdness due to social isolation instead of geographic isolation. Then I thought about making the Totoro analogue an alien who's "roughing it" on Earth. It sees humans as wildlife that can't be clearly communicated with and our society as an ecosystem that shouldn't be disturbed, maybe Earth is like a Yellowstone National Park for them.

The best idea for why the aliens haven't been discovered is that their camping gear includes human disguises and cloaking devices. The protagonists probably decide to follow "that weird hobo everyone else ignores", but they're lonely and curious enough to follow them back to their campsite and see what they really are. The alien doesn't mind, it thinks these humans are cute, and Friendship Ensues!

Well, that's pretty much it. Totoro is very simple movie that doesn't even really tell a story, it's just about two sisters going through mundane events in their lives and occasionally running into a friendly forest spirit who looks like a giant chipmunk. If that can warm my heart, why not tell a story about some socially ostracized kids that hang out with a weird alien? Am I the only one who fantasized about that when I was a kid?

** (Paraphrased from a reddit comment I didn't think to save.)

The reason Avatar (the movie) ended in tragedy was that the Na'vi were made too perfect.

Humans are willing to spend a /stupendous/ amount of money and effort to find a peaceful solution. They've been at it for years. The Avatar Program alone likely dwarfs the costs of the entire military base. We don't treat /humans/ nearly this well IRL, when they're third-world and live on top of a valuable resource.

And the Na'vi, while not fully rational economic partners, are open to trade.

But because they were made so perfect, there is nothing they want from Earth. No-one is hungry, or sick, or doing unpleasant labour, or interested in material comforts, or in conflict with another tribe. Despite being like 7 tech levels ahead, Earth has nothing to offer them.

And so trade is at an impasse, and Earth eventually resorts to violence.

*** The ending of Avatar was completely idiotic. The entire movie was an ill-conceived metaphor for colonialism, complete with "noble savages" and magical space-Native Americans. That'd be aggravating enough, since it perpetuates the same stupid whitewashing of every culture the Europeans ever wiped out that's so pervasive in our literature; replacing diverse and complex societies with a vague bland hippy-ish free loving /thing/ that favours fairy stories that appeal to our modern Western sensibilities over anything resembling a real pre-industrial civilization.

But then the natives /won/. That doesn't just ruin the parallel, it sets it on fire, runs over it with a train, and throws the crushed remains in a garbage disposal. In the moment that happened, it went from shitty, hamhanded metaphor to bad Mary-Sueish historical fix-fic. The humans utterly fail to exercise even the most basic level of strategy, entering hand-to-hand combat when they clearly have air superiority and enough firepower to burn down the entire planet, just so we can watch glorified rhinos somehow destroy tanks with their space magic and hunter-gatherers defeat space marines with sticks and stones.

***** I mean, they live in the garden of Eden. "Science/civilization ruins everything" might be an unpopular trope 'round these parts, but when your life is damn near perfect, regression to the mean is a serious concern.

What criticism there is to be made, is to be laid at the feet of the scriptwriter who built the world. In-universe, the pic's attempt to redefine victory as "building the pyramids" or spreading ourselves across the galaxy ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism][we total utilitarians now?]]) rather than having your entire species live pleasant, satisfying lives sounds very sour-grapes.

(Humans do have a much higher upper bound for longevity. Though an informed Na'vi would argue back that the Na'vi's odds of surviving the next few centuries are much higher - or would have been had they not have the cosmically unlikely misfortune of crossing our path.)

*** Probably the first step would be to analyze the community and find what issues plague it the most to focus effort on them.

That's too little money in my country (we're talking about a third world one) so I'd probably investigate and teach myself some production technique to then teach others. That way they don't become dependent on the influx of resources I provide.

Another option is to start saving and preparing for a start up so that I can provide income to others, teach them something they can do with their time (which will help lower crime too) and ensure I increase my income and can thus use the resulting money to fund other enterprises/donate to charity.

I think the rational goal of such a character would be to win on the long term, spending it all on charity and helping people is good but won't have such a lasting impact on his community if he does so alone. Plus, more than money, time is a more valuable asset and he can do more stuff if he no longer has to worry about running out of money.

I'm not a new player of /Dwarf Fortress/ by any means, and stick to a consistent layout for each fortress. However, I haven't bothered to play the game very often, since my previous computer (which I replaced a few days ago) dropped to irksomely-low framerates after I exceeded about fifty dwarves. I probably will check out the new 64-bit version of /Dwarf Fortress/ after Dwarf Therapist is updated to be compatible with it.

I have been finding it surprisingly good, it started with the pattern of a know-it-all womanizing MC, but the quality of the production have been surprising, and the female MC has shown some promise. Moreover episode 2 I think had some of the most nuanced and neutral representations of warfare.

So hopefully it will keep to these aspects instead of focusing on the typical approaches such animes take..

**** If you particularly liked the MC then you may want to give [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/13161/Hagure_Yuusha_no_Aesthetica][Hagure Yuusha]] a try, do note that it is way more service-y and explicit.

Another similar MC from a pretty good series is [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/8086/Densetsu_no_Yuusha_no_Densetsu][The legend of legendary heroes]], you'll have to forgive it's name, but in most other aspects it is actually the direction I am hoping for in Alderamin, just with replacing OP superpower with OP planning\leadership.

Last on the list of similar MCs is [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo][Mondaiji]], I would say it has quite a few similarities, though less than Hagure, as its aiming more at the shounen demographic than at the seinen demographic. On the plus(though you may consider this minus) it is far less focused on service.

Anyhow, glad you enjoyed it, Ep3 confirmed for me that this seems to be keeping up the quality(though it was more akin to Ep1 than to Ep2) so will probably move this into the "solid recommendation" category.

In other news I've been really enjoying the game stellaris although I'm seriously contemplating a major mod to give it STL tech as a default and improved wormhole tech and alcubbiere drives for later.

It has a lot of fun to be had already and the devs have a history of improving on a core game and expanding the mechanics for years after initial release.

And when I need to get myself woken up from a slow day I really have been enjoying evolve second stage for a highly entertaining asymmetrical multiplayer experience.

*** In my experience, search engines (and knowledge databases in general) allow you to formulate more complex questions, though obviously that's not the only way they're used.

Back when you needed to go to a library and check out a book you hoped was relevant (and read that book to find the pertinent page), it took an enormous amount of time to find any information outside your field of expertise. Sometimes you simply couldn't, if you didn't have access to the right library.

That meant that you couldn't easily synthesise the various data points needed for more substantial issues unless somebody else had already done the legwork, or you were getting paid for it.

Now it's changed. I can find the answer to almost any question very quickly (including whether or not that answer is contested). That could mean that I simply stop there, satisfied with my answer, or I could use that information as a basis for future inquiries.

Essentially, by removing the difficulty of actually finding the information search engines enable you to pull from hundreds of sources in a way that would have taken weeks or months before. The difficulty of your deductions is now limited by voluntary complexity, rather than by an absence of information.

I developed my skill in programming enough that I almost never ask for 'help' in debugging something. I used google to mainly look up API references, and sometime to google the context of errors.

Additionally, the last time I helped a programming noob, I immediately noticed several errors that needed correcting that has nothing to do what he was asking.

Writing is a creative process that almost never happen with google search unless I am trying to research something.

*** One way in which the search-engine learning model can be useful is helping with the old "unknown unknowns" problem. If I'm trying to figure something out by Googling it, I typically get some results that are too simplistic for what I want, and some results that are more technical than I am really looking for, whereas a result pitched at the perfect level for my needs is unlikely. So in the course of trying to find the answer to the question I actually asked, I wind up learning more background and context than I would have if I had used a more directed way of learning the information, including information I would have never even known to look for about issues I wasn't aware of. That's, for the most part, information I might never have learned at all, or even known as a thing I was ignorant of, if it weren't cluttering up some article containing the fact I was actually searching for at the time.

Well, it depends on how complacent people are with what Google can provide. Years ago, I ran several Google searches for dungeon-generation algorithms--but they turned up only methods that amounted merely to the automatic laying-out of pregenerated tiles. I /could/ have settled for those, sure--but, as it turned out, I was dissatisfied with such methods, and I not only kept searching until I found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_neighborhood_graph][better methods]] but also came up with my own original algorithms for generating dungeons.

Likewise, some people will read [[http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-california-guns-idUSKCN0YV2B1][a Reuters article about how a panel of judges refused to overturn a state's restrictions on the concealed carrying of firearms]] and leave it at that, while other people won't be satisfied with that brief overview and will actually look at [[https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/06/09/10-56971.pdf][the judges' majority and dissenting opinions]], and still other people will look at the historical cases from which those judges took precedent.

What would people have done a few decades ago? The less-inquisitive people would have settled for what their favorite newspapers and television stations told them, while the more-inquisitive people would have checked libraries and other newspapers and stations. I'm not knowledgeable enough to be able to say whether the overall change has been for the better or for the worse.

** I just finished a rewatch of Naruto Shippuden from about the half-way point, starting with Jiraiya v. Pain, ending with the most recent episode, and I gotta say, it is /much/ better watched all at once, with filler removed.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/48p81o/naruto_kai_all_episodes_megathread_2/][Naruto Kai]] is basically a bunch of 90-120 minute arcs, with the filler and opening and ending sequences removed. It is amazing. Has completely changed my viewing experience of Naruto Shippuden.

It has given me a new appreciation for Kishimoto as well. The problems I had with Naruto are still there but watching everything at once makes a lot (not all, though) of apparent plot holes disappear, makes the epic symbolism and incredibly thought out foreshadowing more impressive, and really hammers in the philosophy of Naruto.

I now realize that the oft-maligned feature of Naruto, the pervasive flashbacks, are a really important part of Naruto's philosophy.

I really, really want someone to do this for /Pokemon/ - the show has some great nostagia value at least, but also /so much filler/. I think there are multiple levels of stuff to cut:

1. Openings, endings, previews, etc. Obviously redundant.
2. Stock footage - attack scenes, duplicate shots, team introductions, etc. At this point each "30 min" episode is probably closer to five or ten minutes.
3. Edit for density - don't bother with explanations of the obvious, and so on. This is getting more subjective.
4. Remove side-plots.
