*** Unfortunately, all that Minerva wrote in this entry is "Don't get caught, or you're screwed."

** This in no way adds anything useful to the conversation but I just want to point out that I semi-predicted that moving trees would be the cause (in the previous thread). I think I'm entitled to a cookie and/or pat on the back.

Also, I still think it's weird that Emma/Ray didn't hear their screams as the other kids fell.

** Information on the current real world masquerading as fiction, huh? That's reasonably clever.

This also means Minerva has been printing the books themselves, not just leaving messages in existing ones.

*** It's not. What is even the point of the morse code if the contents of the book are incriminating?

And if the demons don't read the books, what is the point of the morse code?

**** The point of masquerading the information would be for it /not/ to be incriminating. Like Morse patterns in circles, fiction with elements similar to reality is not /easily/ noticeable as contraband.

***** I mean if the fiction is real anyone who reads the fiction will know right?

****** Not if it's not overt. Anything identical, or obviously imitating, would get caught, but Emma's phrasing suggests it's more a matter of there being similarities between certain aspects. Emma only realisedâ€‹ the similarity after being trapped in the tree for quite some time.

Also, the demons may be scanning for incompetence, not malice. Suppose they've raided a library from before the (presumed) apocalypse. They would want to filter out books with too advanced knowledge in them, but they may not suspect somebody has actively altered them to communicate with the children, thus not noticing anything less than obvious.
