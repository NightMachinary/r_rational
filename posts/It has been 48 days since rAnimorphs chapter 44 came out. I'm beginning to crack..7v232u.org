We all know [[/u/TK17Studios]] is busy with rationalist bootcamp and other writing projects, but I think flakes of my soul are starting to crack and fall off waiting for the next update. No word from the author and no update in sight. Help me. Help me.

I guess what I'm trying to say is...

** More than a year since the preview for the next "the games we play" book was posted and 2 months since the last HP natural 20 update after a year+ hiatus.

I think the best way to read these might be to just wait until a book is finished.

*** You know, I was getting kind of antsy because I'd gone more than a week without updating /Worth the Candle/, but that sort of puts it in perspective.

(The last /A Song of Ice and Fire/ book came out 2399 days ago, and it's been 1769 days since the second book in the /Kingkiller Chronicles/ series was released, if that helps further put wait times in perspective.)

**** Different strokes and all. On one end, you have GRRM and Rothfuss, and on the other you have writing machine like Sanderson.

P.S. I remember you mentioning an onset of SAD. Is that still the culprit behind the update schedule change?

***** Mostly. It's more that two of the things that help most with SAD, sleeping proper hours and exercising, eat up so much of my writing time. I've been sort of cutting into my sleeping time once again, which I think has paid dividends in terms of output but definitely also starts to show up in my mood; I'll be more comfortable doing that as the days start to get longer. I wouldn't say that I'm suffering from SAD now, more that I'm chafing under the treatments.

But the other thing is that I've just been writing longer chapters, and grouping those chapters together, which makes it seem like less writing. I wrote 12,000 words in the last 8 days, which is 1,500 words per day, and (IMO) would look more impressive as 3,000 word chapters every other day than what it's going to be, which is probably three +5,000 word chapters a few days from now.

As for why /that's/ been happening, it's partly that I like to group things by their plot beats, and those plot beats have gotten longer, and it's partly that added complexity means that I want to have more time to think about (and edit) things after they're written. Might change after the current book is done and there's a different subject that gets a different treatment?

(Stephen King has said that you should never spend longer than a season writing a book, because your writing will naturally change with the seasons and the things you wanted to capture will shift in your head, and there might be some of that going on too.)

*** But then you might never experience some great stories because the fact is many of them will never be finished (fanfiction and other online stories especially). I think the best way to read them is to just enjoy each chapter for what it's worth. Or being a bit more sardonic: adapt ratfic tenet #1 to "neatly wrapped endings don't happen solely because the plot requires it."
