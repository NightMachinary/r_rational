** I love me some TZK but I feel like linking [[https://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/search/label/ch186?max-results=26#order=ASC][the entire last completed chapter]] is more useful then linking the most recent page.

*** I wouldn't be surprised if it never really finishes and just keeps going until the author gets bored. There's a pretty sizable amount of room for further growth, especially if author decides to do a time jump.

**** I only made it to book 3, then I got interested in Wildbow's twig.

***** I loved twig but near the end it got boring. It felt as if the author didn't thought through enough this. Also the underdog winning fights but such a slim margin ALWAYS get repetitive.

****** Most of Bow's characters suffer quite a bit throughout their stories, and sometimes they don't always win.

*** If the banner is correct, then it updates ~500 words per day, which would mean 881K words, which is a lot, but not /that/ much. Equivalent to two doorstopper fantasy novels? It's just divided up into fairly small chunks.

**** It actually often updates 1500 words per day or even 10 000, but those were irregular and there used to be massive dry spells and no updates for weeks or months. It probably does balance back out to around 800 000k words.
