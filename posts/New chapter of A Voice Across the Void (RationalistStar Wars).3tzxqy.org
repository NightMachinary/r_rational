The new chapter is [[http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818185152/ch-6-an-opportunity][here]]. Earlier chapters are [[http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818575647/a-voice-across-the-void][here]].

I also took the opportunity to expand chapters 1 and 2, both of which have been doubled from their original length. The plot is unchanged, but I have inserted some more detail and backstory to make the various supporting characters feel a little less one-dimensional. I realize that ongoing revisions are highly non-ideal for readers, but those chapters were badly in need of editing; besides, the whole point of writing this on my end is to get a handle on the basics of writing fiction.

*** There's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3oogyb/hsfrtstar_wars_au_timeless_warrior/][this one]] that was linked recently. It's pretty good, but short.

I'd also like to know of more.

**** Cheers for the links, but I looked through those before. Not very thoroughly, it's true, but enough to end up feeling like that particular fanon for some reason doesn't have as many good stories as average.

***** Try sorting by favorites. If a few hundred people liked the story enough to favorite, it's a good sign.

****** I generally sort by favourites, >100,000 words and use the without genre: angst filter. It makes things better and works well enough to remove the worst of the dross, but what I wish they had is a 'you like a, b and c? try y!' function.

******* Ah. There's your problem: you aren't looking for good fanfiction, you're looking for good fanfiction /novels/, and ones that fit a certain mood. I'm not surprised you aren't finding many.

******** I found dozens in Naruto and Worm, but barely any in Star Wars. Really what I'm looking for is what KOTOR made me feel.

********* Yes! I would love to find something like that. That was one of my main motivations in writing this story, to try to recreate something of the emotions I felt when playing through KOTOR 2. That game is a work of art.

********** Even to this day I look back at it with a sort of bitersweet melancholy. It was a fantastic experience, but now I've re-played it enough times that its time is past. I hope this story achieves your goals, for entirely selfish reasons.

** While reading Chapter 2: "Wait a minute. Those teachings. Is that... /her?/" (*goes back, checks her name*)\\
"No, I guess not."\\
Ch. 3: "Wait a minute... /Nerra/?! It /is/ her!"

You clever bastard! I wonder if anybody else put two and two together.

*** You got it :)

Not sure how many people noticed -- maybe one or two others besides you (the author of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3oogyb/hsfrtstar_wars_au_timeless_warrior/][this]], which takes the beginning of the story and goes in a different direction, probably did). Not that many people played through or remember KOTOR 2, I suppose.

** At a glance I confused this for an update for 'To The Stars' which disappointed me.

This is pretty great though! I'll definitely follow this, thanks for posting.

One small note, I didn't read the earlier version of ch 1, but a few parts came across as weak. Not sure if that's because of the edits or was always there. The writing smoothed out almost immediately in the next chapters.

** Just wanted to say I like how you're fleshing out all sides, not just the protagonist (well, at least I considered Noval to be the main person but I guess it's still early). "The enemy is allowed to be smart, too" is pretty much essential imo and between the Emperor/Sith Holocron figure I think it's in a good place.
