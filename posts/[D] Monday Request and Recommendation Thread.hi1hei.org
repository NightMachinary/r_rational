Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** There's an older scifi short I'd love to find, about a time-traveler official who yoinks people (at the end of their lives, I think leaving a double?) so they can stand trial in the future for their crimes. Starts, I think, with Jefferson and his slaves?

*** Shyamalan's /Unbreakable/ film trilogy. There's always a doubt as to how real the powers actually are, which is sort of the point- what is the limit of human potential? Subtle, moving, and sometimes downright terrifying.

/Unbreakable/: A man becomes the only survivor of a train wreck, and this feat comes to the attention of an eccentric comic book curator.

/Split/: Young girls get kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities. Said personalities are all struggling to understand the meaning of one dangerous personality in him... The protagonist is one of the girls, a loner, survival-minded.

/Glass/: Brings together the heroes and villains of the previous two for a curious psychological showdown.

/Unbreakable/ has possibly my favourite villain but can be slow. /Split/ is the most accessible of the three, and probably the best. /Glass/ is a mixed bag, but I thought it had something to it.

*** I'd be interested in reading some, superheroes always irked me and always will. They make no sense, economically, or socially. I'm sure you can find some comments of mine criticizing it around the sub.

​

And no, because I know somebody will say it, the argument that superheroes decrease crime rates doesn't make sense economically. There's a thing called opportunity cost, and yada yada. Superheroes and vigilantes in general make no sense and would serve no purpose other than being cool and aggrandizing the ego of the heroes themselves.

**** Agree. Plus the fundamental problem with vigilantism is as unprofessional, biased police with too much individual power, they would commonly kill and assault innocent people. There wouldn't be many of these easily identified straightforward crooks in a superhero world.

In real life if a criminal decides to rob a convenience store or commit a rape or mugging in a back alley, most of the time the crook is assessing the risks. They generally won't do such a crime if there is a hundred percent chance of getting caught - it's why the convenience stores with an armed police officer standing outside don't generally get robbed.

If superheroes with super hearing are patrolling your city it's a similar thing.

***** Obviously a Superman-tier hero should reduce crime significantly.

But even Superman can't be everywhere 24 hours a day. You would need a squadron of Supermen to make it a 100% chance of getting caught. One Superman and a bunch of A- or B-tier heroes still allows for criminals to get away with it.

****** Interesting point, at what break point does Superman stop all crime in the city? He doesn't actually need to catch 100% initially, just suppress crime until it gets below his catch capacity.

Say he can stop 100 crimes a day, as a criminal how many daily crimes in the city would you need to feel like you can get away with your own crime? Obviously > 100. 1,000 a day? That's not taking into account that Superman is removing 100 criminals every day, which would effect the averages if repeat crimes are common. Even if you think you will get away with the crime you will have to come to terms with the fact that the only reason you didn't get caught was luck that Superman didn't pick you.

I think Superman would very quickly shut down violent crime within his hearing range even if he could only catch a small percentage initially. I would imagine removing repeat offenders and the threat of capture would create a feedback loop driving cases he can catch to 0 over time. Although crimes of passion would muddy this and potentially give cover to other crimes...

There are many points I have against this. But just think for a second that people with super powers existed, and that they don't just magically show up in the 50s thanks to author fiat but that they've been around since long ago.

***** /Fleep/ is complete, and pretty short.

(Interesting fact: It was originally a newspaper-style comic strip. The author had to have a cliffhanger on every final panel, and you can sense his struggle sometimes...)

The two other works I've read from this author are [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/7229730][Meanwhile]] and [[http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001][Demon]] (also complete).

/Meanwhile/ is a delightfully creative and technically impressive book.

/Demon/... well I have a love/hate relationship with it. It's pretty rational in /some/ ways (think "sharpened Hufflepuff bones"), and offers intriguing and mostly fair puzzles. But it also has some /massive/ idiot balls, and lots of gratuitous grossness ("see? I'm not afraid to show you sharpened Hufflepuff bones! SEE THEM?! LOOK AT THEM BONES!!!"), and every single character is an evil psychopath. Sometimes it's so outrageous it works as comedy, sometimes... not. Content warning for violence and explicit disturbing sex and assorted grossness.

To bone trap them, when he hit max range he would have had to drop them, meaning he saved them energy chasing him whilst he carried them behind him.

He can incapacitate when enemies are nearby and stay nearby, but he doesn't have many methods to paralyze then flee.

Now he could have broken their bones, but at that point he was still hoping for a minimally injurious encounter.

#+begin_quote
  It all began when the wizards of the White League were under attack by their opponents of the Black League and one of their most powerful members cast a spell to bring forth a mighty wizard to aid their cause. What the spell delivered was master hacker Walter Wiz Zumwalt. The wizard who cast the spell was dead and nobody---not the elves, not the dwarves, not even the dragons---could figure out what the shanghaied computer nerd was good for. But spells are a lot like computer programs, and, in spite of the Wiz's unprepossessing appearance, he was going to defeat the all-powerful Black League, win the love of a beautiful red-haired witch, and prove that when it comes to spells and sorcery, nobody but nobody can beat a Silicon Valley computer geek!

Sample ebook chapters are available on Baen's site.

My favorite moment comes in one of the later books when he hops worlds back to Earth at the E3 show in Vegas. One booth is selling the ultimate in untraceable porn, which your boss is guaranteed not to find on your work computer: a program that algorithmically generates a porn still image from any file over 1MB and displays it without saving a file to the hard drive. Wiz asks how big the program's executable file is, and they say it's over 1MB. They feed it into itself, and the resulting porn image is both illegal in fifteen states and physically implausible.

** Any stories in which the main character becomes an unprecedenced expert or a pioneer in deeply esoteric, spiritual, highly abstract Soul-related, almost religious stuff in contrast to the mostly hard fantasy-esque, generic nature of the standard magical system of the setting? To use an analogy, the protagonist might be something of a philosophy/theology/literature major amongst the figurative crowd of STEM dudes. Examples (kinda spoilery, so I'll black it out just to be safe):

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/][The Games We Play by Ryuugi]] --- all the archangel, Kaballah, Chakras, and mysticism shit in the late game. I loved the chapter-long philosophical siloloquies on the nature of soul, identity, and reality that took place in between shounen-esque action scenes. The contrast between a seemingly-hard, easily quantifiable concept like the Gamer powerset and some of the extremely abstract end-game skills like the Ohr Ein Sof, the Arcana, Et in Arcadia Ego was a treat. Actually, many of Ryuugi's crossovers have this kind of hard/soft play, Arana and Prytaneum had some pretty nice descriptions of ‘godly' or ‘spiritual' stuff compared to the shounen anime nature of their original settings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid by ShaperV]] --- the bright kami and demon shit, mental landscapes, the language of creation, the space between universes, the world-wide sealing fate manipulation sealing arrays drawn onto the sky, the aspects, the way chakra is portrayed when looked through the Byakugan, and so on.

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning by nobody103]] --- all the end game unstructured magic, dimensionalism, soul magic, mind magic, and stuff.

On the other hand, I wouldn't use Pact or Unsong as an example, since /all/ of the magic in there is mostly abstract and concept-based. What I'm searching for is specifically the /contrast/ between hard fantasy standard baby stuff every wizard casts and the weird-ass freaking high-level abstract shit the protagonist might attempt to do.

I'd much prefer fanfiction and webfiction/self-published Amazon/semi-amateur internet shit over older fantasy classics, but if it matches, I'll take it.

It's a pretty rough start stylistically and writing style wise (due to, I think, an unfortunate, but intentional, choice by the author). However it is an awesome take on both the litrpg and cultivation genres, with really cool world building, and I think really well done.

I love the world of Pokemon Origin of Species but would be more interested in finding/capturing/training Pokemon. Much of the content in that series is focused on teaching rational ideas or delving into Red's Physic powers, which, while I enjoy, takes away from the story/progression of the Pokemon.

** I've been reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.789109/][Going Native]], a DC/DBZ light crossover. The premise is that the main character, Tarble, is a self insert of the author. And over the course of the story he "goes native" with the Saiyans, so to speak. By light crossover, I mean that only Frieza's empire and the saiyans are ported into DC. No Namekians and any of the especially ridiculous stuff that happens later on in the dbz series.

The story avoids almost all the pitfalls I normally see in self insert stories, because the human memories and instincts of the author are slowly overwritten by the brutality of typical saiyan life (hence the going native part). It's a fantastic look at the saiyan species and how they are developing from a population of 3,000 at the beginning of the story to more people later on. The author also does power levels pretty well, making Tarble gain power at an astonishing rate that still feels earned. Overall, I give the story a solid recommendation.

As for requests, I'm still looking for stories with a protagonist that has a "tank" build. As in, they can regenerate stupidly fast, are very hard to damage, can take a beating, or any combination thereof. The focus must still be on them being able to take lots of damage. Some examples (that I've read):

- Zac from Defiance of the fall, with his stupidly high endurance.

- That gold guy from Mistborn second era, who can regenerate from decapitated heads, getting his body crushed, drowned, etc.

- The protagonist from A Bad Name, which is a Worm/Gamer fanfic.

- The protagonist from An Exercise in Stupidity, which is a rwby/Gamer fanfic.

- I recommend 1.5 Neal Stephenson books: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem][Anathem]], and the first two parts of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves][Seveneves]], up throught the Seven Eves are named. Don't bother with the third part; it's the first third of a different novel.
- Poul Anderson wrote some great stuff, including swords-and-blasters books like the womanizing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Flandry][Dominic Flandry]] series and medieval [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Crusade][The High Crusade]]. The Flandry novels share a setting with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Anderson_bibliography#Technic_History][the many other works of Anderson's Technic History]], and today I learned that the excellent standalone novel [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Shall_Rise][Orion Shall Rise]] is part of a series. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Zero][Tau Zero]] is no longer scientifically plausible, but was some nice hard scifi.
- Ann Leckie's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Leckie#Set_in_the_Ancillary_universe][Imperial Radch series]], consisting of the Ancillary trilogy, Provenance, and the short story [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212448/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2014/20141110/commands-f.shtml][She Commands Me And I Obey]] are all good.
- Arkady Martine's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_Called_Empire][A Memory Called Empire]]
- Ada Palmer's Terra Ignota series is a stupendous feat of worldbuilding like unto Neal Stephenson, except the author wrangles enough plots for seven different novels into one series, and makes it work. I will let the narrator introduce himself; [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/12/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapters-1-and-2/][the first chapter is here]] and the content warnings in the title page are serious.

** I want to get into some large fanfic people on this subreddit are fawning over, but I don't have the time nor the emotional capacity to read several works at once or in quick succession. So I want to commit.

By skimming the first chapter of some of the most commonly mentioned stories, I was left with two options:

- /r!Animorphs: The Reckoning/

- /Pokemon: The Origin of Species/

Which of these two would you recommend more, and why?

(If somebody wants to know my tastes, here are random assessments of works from this sub's wiki:

- I *really liked* /HPMoR/ (and its fic /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie/), /The Metropolitan Man/, and all the short fiction stories from SSC;

- I *generally enjoyed* /Friendship Is Optimal/ and /Three Worlds Collide/;

- I *found okay* /Mother of Learning/, /Luminosity/, and /The Waves Arisen/;

- I *didn't like* /Time Braid/.

Closing bracket.)

It explores the concepts of the original series, speeding up the plot of the original to get to the interesting parts fast and taking things to their logical conclusions. The characters are punished for their mistakes and the powers are satisfyingly exploited.\\
You don't need to have read the original series, everything is pretty self explanatory excusing a few things that would be surprising without foreknowledge of them.

** So this is a bit of an odd one, but I feel like some of you might enjoy the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KojTtZMZm4][KUSOMEGA]] books.

I highly recommend listening to the audiobook versions, but a text version can be found in the description, if you prefer.

I wouldn't call it rational (not the first book anyway), but it does the "isekai light novel that is a deconstruction of isekai light novels" thing way better than most other stuff I've seen. Beyond that, the writing style just really resonates with me in a way that's hard to put into words.

Also, if you start hating it at chapter four, don't worry. That cringeworthy nonsense was setup for stuff later on, not just pointless powerwank.

EDIT: Also, trigger warnings, it's pretty NSFW. It doesn't have any actual explicit sex scenes (as far as I can remember), but it is pretty forwardly sexual. It also has a few slurs of various sorts here and there. I can vouch for the author not actually meaning anything by it, but take care if that sort of thing bothers you. Also TW for suicide, though the title of the video tells you about as much.

** Just finished [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The snake report]] which reignited my yearning for stories where the MC is "*mentaly but not physically human*".

Any more recomendations for more stories like this?

Almost anything is fine (translated/manga/anime is fine too, but I probably read/watched most of them already and unfortunately none up to the quality of The snake report) and I am specifically after HUMANS reincarnated/transfered whatever into non-human bodies, (so not like Mud's mission where the MC is not actually human).

Also ideally one where the MC actaully does interact with the human population and is not just stuck in a dungeon the whole time or something. - I don't know what is so appealing to me about just reading the reactions of normal people to intelegent whatevers, and for some reason just the meaningless kindness of something which normally wouldn't do so makes me feel so happy.

While it's entertaining, the uplift process felt overly streamlined, with implausibly short R&D timescales, at least until new witch powers are available to substitute for a machine shop and other prerequisites.

Additionally, the main character benefits a lot from low-hanging fruit without much satisfactory explanation of why no-one else has discovered them before. The largest ones are that no other groups seem to have made a systematic effort to use witches' abilities, the solution to witch deaths to their own magic as they come of age is something that anyone else could easily have stumbled upon just like the protagonist or even decided to test, and some witch power evolutions come very easily and don't seem like they required the scientific knowledge to achieve.

The main issue I have is that everything comes way too easy to the MC. I got the impression that the world just wants him to succeed - if he needs a witch with a particular ability, she'll show up in a few chapters. If he needs to train an army, the men go from barely literate peasants to fully trained soldiers with a snap. There was too much "he got lucky" moments IMO.

The Demon Lord's Lover is a fluffy romcom with harems, where one of the main characters becomes a member of another main character's harem. It's a very idealistic world with well functioning harems, so take that as you will.

Savage Divinity has a harem, and is slowly starting to get into harem dynamics, but I don't really know if I would recommend it. It's very long and has periods of very slow pace and almost-filler, but it's better than any other wuxia/xianxia so far with harems.

That's a big ask. Even long, completed fanfics rarely reach that length. That said, here are some great ones:

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To the Stars]]*

(/761k+ words; ongoing/)

The story is set in a far distant future of the deconstructionist magical girl anime /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/.

Humanity has evolved into a post-scarcity, transhumanist civilization spread across multiple star systems and is now locked in an existential war against an alien threat. Magical girls form the backbone of humanity's military forces, their 'magic' providing a vital tactical edge against the technological superiority of the aggressors.

The main character is a young girl who joins the war effort after she contracts to become a magical girl.

(If you'd like to know more about the fic, the TVTropes article also has a good rundown: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ToTheStars][link]])

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8293519/1/Beneath][Beneath]]*

(/1.6m+ words; ongoing/)

This is an /Avengers/ fanfic that diverges from canon after the Chitauri invasion failed and Loki was brought back to Asgard.

Odin shoulders the heavy burden of pronouncing sentence on Loki. Presented with a choice between life imprisonment or a death sentence, Odin picks a third option: exile and a geas to restrict Loki's magic.

The early parts of the fic mainly take place on Earth, but the author has constructed an epic plotline that spans multiple realms with intrigue, war, and the lurking threat of Thanos plucking the strings from the darkness beyond the Nine.
