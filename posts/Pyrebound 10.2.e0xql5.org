A somewhat unusual update this week; it might be an interlude, if PB had interludes.

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/11/24/chapter-10-2/]]

For those of you just discovering this story, it starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. I am grateful to the rest of you for sticking with me so far, as always. Fair warning: it's getting towards finals time, and I've been burning through backlog trying to keep up with all my obligations. I don't foresee having to delay updates, but it's possible next week's installment might be slightly late. If it is, my apologies.


** Just read what you've written so far yesterday, and I quite liked it! Looking forward to reading the rest; thanks for writing.

** Careful of burnout, content creator! Please work at a sustainable pace, we will still be ready to read when you are done with finals. If you have to miss an update or two, it isn't the end of the world.

*** I wrote most of an update last week, then deleted it because I decided it didn't really make sense where it was. May incorporate a modified version of the scene later in the story instead. I'm not going to give you folks crap just to make the schedule.

** Your "start here" link points to the new chapter instead of chapter 1.
