** I think I came across this in a comment on this sub.

The Leaf is a real military dictatorship, and our dear supreme leader and one of his top officers are put in a precarious situation when Team 7 honestly passes Kalashi's test after the council "ordered" him to pass them regardless of their aptitude.

Great writing and character development for the whole team, and Kakashi's proud teacher moments have really moved me. All in all, I think this is great fun.

*** Thanks for the post! I always enjoy a new perspective on my favorite settings, and this does seem to written pretty darned well. Does the author have a blog or anything somewhere? I generally like to interact with the people who produce stuff I like.

**** Interact in what way? What if they're reclusive, or what if they use a stage identity that creates a wall between the consumer and the creator? Does that affect your enjoyment of their work, or likelihood to recommend it to others?

***** Hm? No, it doesn't really affect my enjoyment negatively; I just like to have a dialogue between myself and content creators. It's why I like watching streams, and interacting in Marked For Death, for instance. I seldom give unsolicited criticisms or anything, I just like giving direct encouragement; and when an author doesn't have pre- or post-scripts for their fiction, it's hard to tell if they look at reviews and such.

**** You can check out their AO3 account (linked on the ffnet bio), but it doesn't look like there would be a lot of opportunities for direct dialogue. Maybe a PM on one of the sites?

** This is actually really lovely. There's just the right proportions of character development, heartwarming moments, and action. And the writing style is pretty neat to read, too.

** Very interesting so far. It's playing off the concept of a 'Council' which I believe is non-canon, but the blending of it as a story element for forcing early-group teamwork between the members of Team Seven is quite ingenious. The fact T7 is all bonding better is lovely, especially in how their various quirks are being altered.

Although I don't think Sakura was having issues regarding what she ate in canon, or anything but her canonical 'good at theory, bad at practical' issue in melee fighting. The 'orange is unstealthy' aspect of a number of fanfic is always kinda baffling considering the outfits basically everyone seems to wear in naruto canon generally not fitting stealth all that well.

*** Yeah some fanfic authors seem to have an axe to grind about his orange outfit. They teach elementary school kids how to completely change their appearance with a few gestures. I don't think it really matters what they feel like wearing.
