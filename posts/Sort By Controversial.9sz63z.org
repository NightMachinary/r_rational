** I sort by controversial a lot, and most of what you get is:

- People being really self-righteous
- Low-effort statements (which I imagine are upvoted by people who are upvote-happy, and downvoted as useless noise)
- People who were initially upvoted, then downvoted due to shifting opinions with increased views and/or being called out.
- People with opinions that go against the hivemind for that subreddit

Also, this:

#+begin_quote
  You can also generate titles that will get maximum downvotes, but this is boring: it will just say things that sound like spam about penis pills.
#+end_quote

Is wrong. Spam gets downvoted until it's below the threshold for views, then no one sees it or feels compelled to vote on it. The /actual/ most downvoted posts are those that get linked from elsewhere ("brigaded"), driving people to come in specifically to downvote.

*** The downvote system is just so bullshit, really. The fact that you get automatically flagged for getting too much negative "karma" in a subreddit and have to wait 10 minutes between posts is rather annoying.

Much rather they do away with it entirely and just have an upvote system, or have a downvote system that actually doesn't do anything. That way, all the "unpopular" posts just naturally sink to the bottom by all the upvoted posts. Also have a report system for actual spambots.

E.g. if "I disagree" and "this makes me mad" only change the points of a given comment, but "this doesn't contribute" results in the well-known "wait 10 minutes to comment again", they will always choose the latter. And if "this is spam" flags from 5 different accounts result in a 24 hour ban, then they will choose that one.

And those people are also the kind of people who vote the most.

  Any predictive network doubles as a generative network. If you teach a neural net to recognize dogs, you can run it in reverse to get dog pictures. If you train a network to predict Reddit upvotes, you can run it in reverse to generate titles it predicts will be highly upvoted. We tried this and it was pretty funny. I don't remember the exact wording, but for [[/r/politics]] it was something like “Donald Trump is no longer the president.

**** I should rephrase. The technical details about how the Scissors function don't make a lot of sense. I don't have a lot of experience with machine learning, but I'm pretty sure you can't just reverse a predictive network to generate content.

That being said, I found this to be an interesting take on the human psychology of controversial statements and how it interacts with society at large. I am a strong believer that most people are fundamentally decent and that most controversial is the result of a differing set of fundamental axioms which, when applied to current events, result in massively differing opinions. The tribal nature of an us-vs-them mentality which can be seen so strongly in modern day politics also comes into play. So the idea that there exist basic statements that seem either fundamentally correct or fundamentally incorrect based on your initial set of axioms makes sense to me, and the idea that that would quickly devolve into escalation based on which side of the fence you fall is plausible.

(paraphrasing) "If someone killed a member of my family, you can bet that I would be furious. I would want to kill them with my bare hands and yell and scream at them for what they did to my loved one. But the point of having a society is that we are better than a mere sum of our parts, that we aren't just angry monkeys murdering each other because we can set rules in our rational moments. So even though I'd want to kill that motherfucker, it makes me very, very happy that society would hold me back from it."

  Unless the computer is autodeleting the data and just keeping the data from this exact moment, should we not be able to?

And I actually think it's one that should appeal to most rationalist readers (given a little willingness to buy into conceits of the universe, like the fact that their training station is the best way to train military genius'). None of the bad guys have irrational goals or desires (besides the normal irrationality of hormonal teenagers), people mostly take actions that, within the rules of the universe, help their goals. A lot of the psychology that underpins the novel is sketchy at best, but that's the type of thing I'm willing to give a book as long as it remains relatively consistent within it's own universe.

******* Book was okay. I can't say it's best sci fi or even great sci fi frankly. I suppose the amount of things they just want you to take on faith was too much for me. If you can stomach that many conceits, like the fact that Ender family somehow birthed not one, not two, but three geniuses that are somehow superhuman in ability then I suppose it would seem better.

******** That's one of the least controversial things I think. Intelligence is one of the more inheritable, genetically linked traits we know of. It's something you wouldn't necessarily expect in real life, but there are way more unrealistic things in the book than that.

********* To be a genius, let alone a superhuman genius, you need luck in addition to intelligence. Genes can move the mean of the Gaussian to the right, but then you also have to luck into being a couple sigmas to the right of that. Their parents aren't superhuman either.

I dunno, it just seemed that Ender family was better than every other human for entirely plot reasons.

******** It's not universal - I have read better books. But, while it could be a matter of taste, it could also be the result of higher standards. I'm interested because as far as I know there /isn't/ a maximum, so when someone says they don't like a book I like, maybe they've been reading /much/ better books - and I am very interested in reading those.

********* Well, the usual stuff from here. Hpmor, Metropolitan Man I'd say. As far as more classical sci fi goes, Asimov is pretty excellent. I dunno why EG fell so flat for me when it's apparently considered good by other people - maybe I just didn't get into the main character.

********** I think it's popular because it does some things that aren't done too often. The aliens don't speak English initially/,/ and they're different from humans; the protagonist is young, but things aren't 0% dark (work for your 'happy' ending); and if you're part of an alliance against a common enemy, do you really want to win?

It's also something I read as a kid, and it's possible I wouldn't have liked it as much if I read it later.

** An excellent story!

One possible flaw is that the second list would've been calibrated with the entire country population as its target group, not fine-tuned for one specific person. And there would be plenty of people in that set for whom the statements ranked #1--#3 would've been just irrelevant, even those for whom the entire list would've be irrelevant [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][(e.g.).]] In other words, the network was trained to generate the most controversial statements for that target group, not the most controversial statement for /all/ members of that group.

This is not an outright plot hole for the story, since the narrator could've easily just not been lucky enough to be one of such people, but I think the story should've touched on this at least with a few sentences or a paragraph.

  Any predictive network doubles as a generative network. If you teach a neural net to recognize dogs, you can run it in reverse to get dog pictures.
#+end_quote

I realize that you were probably just taking creative liberties, but this is not true. If two different dog pictures create the same label "dog", and you tried to run it in reverse, which dog picture would be generated by the label " dog"?

*** He's talking about things like Google deep dream, where you feed a network noise and have it transform it into whatever closely matches the networks idea of an ideal dog.

You don't get an image of any specific dog, you get stuff like [[https://www.google.nl/search?q=google+deep+dream+dog][this]].

**** Trust me, he's not. The concepts he describes don't match any existing neural network architecture, because the problem he describes is fundamentally ill-posed. It makes for a decent story, but don't try to map it onto real neural networks.

*** Generative networks are /very/ different from classification network. They usually have discriminator loss architecture unlike classification nets. Anyway "run network in reverse" don't even have precise meaning - there several different things which could be dubbed like that - decoder arch, backpropagating gradient into source etc.
