** I feel that Learn gotta fail here. He doesn't have the academic baseline, having prioritized learning about dwarven society rather than magic, and he doesn't seem inclined to cheat.

*** My understanding was that he learned a baseline of everything and philosophy came last.

Edit: such as he could anyway. We don't really know how much advantage a Command like Learn gives in it's chosen area. Tasked mages are mentioned as being the strongest a couple times in this chapter. Seems relevant.
