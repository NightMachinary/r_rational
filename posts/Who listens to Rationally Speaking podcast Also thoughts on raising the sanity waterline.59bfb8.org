I just started listening to it yesterday and it's really good. Also, episode 156 might give you some good ideas for raising the sanity waterline.

[[http://nycskeptics.org/storage/feeds/rs.xml]]

On another related note, something I've been wondering is how much should we should be raising the sanity waterline? On the one hand, a lot of people aren't very smart or don't have much time or energy for deep analytical thinking, and that could put a large constraint on their ability to learn and practice rationality skills. This could potentially cause serious externalities if we try to raise the sanity waterline for some people with insufficient mental health or ability, since it's dangerous to be half a rationalist, and telling people about biases can hurt them.

On the other hand, not raising the sanity waterline enough could also be very problematic because people not making sensible decisions in high stakes situations that affect lots of people.

So how much should we be raising the sanity waterline, or where should we be focusing our efforts to raise the waterline? Thoughts?


** I've been listening to this show for years and I always enjoy it. As far as best efforts to raise the sanity water line, that's a tough question. Julia Galef's non-profit, the Center for Applied Rationality, is working on investigating that question (as well as several others).

**** You talked in the original post about raising the sanity waterline for the general population. Lots of groups do this, usually by working in a specific area, like general math literacy, or informing the public on better driving skills. Some also do general stuff, like the lifehacking community.

But CFAR is really focused on increasing rationality at the high level. In this respect, they're fairly unique as an organization. Some of the skills they teach are complex enough that you wouldn't ordinarily expect them to be taught underneath the undergraduate level. Because of this, I wouldn't say they're increasing the sanity waterline so much as to focus on making the a smaller subset of the population significantly more rational.

Of course, I say this only as an outsider looking at what CFAR does. For all I know, they may have a desire inside the org to reach out more to the general public.

We don't have any plans to expand to additional centers in the foreseeable future, but a major goal of the next four months is to basically double our instructor staff, allowing us to run two or three times as many workshops in 2017. Most of those will be within an hour or two of Berkeley, CA (and the time commitment is usually Wednesday evening through Monday morning, with a recommended day off Tuesday, so four days off from work).

Thanks for the thanks! It's pretty sweet to spend my time thinking about thinking and then finding ways to make it better.

******* Two separate answers, seemingly contradictory and both true:

1) It's a thing we're working on, via improving our write-ups (both in content and in ease-of-comprehension) and experimenting with other things like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKpH-7fs9zE][videos]] and one-topic seminars. Ideally, we'll have at least 3-4 pieces of broadly-disseminated and useful content out there in the next year.

2) We've tried it, and it doesn't work. Actual experiments, actual data. I know where your "80% of the results" thing comes from, because I had the same belief going into my workshop, and it's only after seeing a variety of experiments first-hand that that belief has been shaken.

There are several things at play, here (longer, in-depth discussion [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/n5h/unofficial_canon_on_applied_rationality/ddco?context=3][here]]). First, the concepts interact with everyone's personal beliefs, preconceptions, problems, and goals differently, and you'd need something like fifty different versions to actually get the thing to land (and the difference between "mostly got it" and "really got it" is /in fact/ enormous---you get something like /20%/ of the results from an 80% version of the concepts).

Second, there are issues with idea inoculation, where people will /think/ that they get it, but in fact they don't, or they get something nearby, and this causes them to stop seeking and become complacent (and become resistant to further attempts to clarify or re-teach). In-person transfer prevents this at a much higher rate than simply dumping the information online.

Third, people just don't actually do the work---believing that Technique X is worth using with your System 2 (analytic, verbal, reasoning brain) doesn't lead to people remembering or putting forth actual effort, and instead leads to "Huh. Neat." followed by /no change in behavior./ The workshop environment, on the other hand, forces people to try things repeatedly until their System 1 (intuitive, nonverbal, emotional brain) learns "Hey, this /actually/ makes a difference," which results in /some change in behavior for some people./

(Note that getting people to update in the direction of rationality is /actually hard,/ and that we're in fact trying many things to see if we can improve outcomes in this direction.)

There are other concerns in the mix, like intellectual property and continuing to sustain our research through workshop revenue, but those are honestly waaaay down the list, and make up something like 5-10% of our reluctance to publish. Overall, the reason we haven't done a blitz of online education or published a ton of content is because we've tried it in the past in small ways, and it's actually worse for the world. It makes some people get the wrong ideas, makes others "full" and "satisfied" and stops them from seeking further growth, and simply doesn't work at all for the rest.

That being said, we have indeed occasionally provided our content (i.e. our ~200pg handbook) to those who've asked. There are people who are deeply suspicious of "you just have to come and try it," and I can't really fault their suspicion, as it pattern-matches to a lot of things that ARE fake or bad. But I'll note that NONE of the people who've just received our handbook and read it have reported leveling up, switching to better careers, doubling their output, etc. etc., which are things that happen fairly frequently after workshops.

******* Disclaimer: Not the guy you asked.

I remember reading that the CFAR classes tend to be more group focused - there's a reason that the workshops are 5 nights long. It's a bit like math camp. If you just wanted to remotely teach somebody about biases and rationality, you would make the /Sequences/. (admittedly, this isn't in video form. I've been thinking about making a video series on the sequences for a little while, and it seems like the logical step for people to take)

It might not be the very best format, but I can't see why you couldn't achieve at least 80% of the results as in-person. You'd certainly be a lot more accessible and reach a lot more people. I assume that's the purpose of CFAR, so I'm very surprised they're not doing this.

As someone who is currently going through the Sequences, I think these are very inaccessible to the average person. Some kind of video course seems like a no-brainer. Can anyone explain why this isn't happening?

(also, as for why nobody else seems to try, think about the niche the Sequences fill. They primarily cater to people who have already read most or all of the things the sequences are based off of - most of us view the Sequences the same way most of the readers of /Superintelligence/ and /Godel, Escher, Bach/ viewed those books when they came out. What more is there to say on the topic? Anyone who wants to know can just read the Sequences. But there is something to be said for linking similar concepts together and putting them in one place.)

#+end_quote

We'll have our best shot at convincing people to do things that are fun or useful.

"Fun" seems kind of dangerous. If I'm being honest, the most fun I have with rationality is attacking beliefs that I'm already predisposed to dislike. Mostly, that turns out to be anti-bigfoot-style silliness. Or articles making some tribal point.

I'm not sure that "fun" is the best tactic because it's not going to accomplish all that much that's useful. We don't help people by giving them new ways to confirm their existing beliefs.

So, if we want to do it, I'd focus on "useful." And this would come down to measurement.

Do our approaches measurably improve our lives? Are we, as rationalists, healthier than other people in our demographics? Are we more likely to exercise? Happier with our jobs?

If so, I'd focus on the places where rationalism matters and get people in that way.

I have found our community to be overwhelmingly composed of members of the WEIRD demographic, which is a limited pool to draw from considering we want to appeal to the whole human race, and I think also biases our community towards views held by that demographic that aren't necessarily rational. My concerns may be overblown, but I still think it's important to understand who are becoming rationalists and why.

** It's never been clear to me what "raising the sanity waterline" actually means, and the phrasing has always made me shirk. I instinctively assume that it means that they're extending the definition of insanity to cover holding irrational beliefs, which leaves me worried that I would fall under that umbrella as a theist. I know my spiritual beliefs aren't epistemically supported, but that hasn't made me stop believing in them.

Sometimes I worry that many rationalists see themselves as an island of sanity in a world of maddness, which has some distressing implications no matter which side of the line you're on. I am very likely to be overreacting to something that I don't understand very well, but it might still indicate a problem with marketing this idea.

*** I'll try to put this very gently, and I'm sorry in advance if what I say hurts you: I don't mean to make you feel pain for the sake of pain, but for the sake of truth and growth. We've talked before about your feeling of not "belonging" here, and I don't want you to feel further estranged: ultimately this subreddit is about rational stories, not rationality. But you expressed confusion, so I feel compelled to answer:

Your fears will not be dispelled before you "buy in." Your fears are totally justified.

To admit that you know your theistic beliefs aren't epistemically supported, but that you continue to hold them anyway, puts you under the "sanity waterline." That is partially what the point of it is: to measure the clear difference between people who can recognize and care about how rational their beliefs are, and those that don't know, or don't care.

The word "sanity" was originally used tongue-in-cheek, if I remember correctly. It's not that people who aren't explicitly pro-rationality and empricism are clinically, pathologically insane, just that they do seem at times "crazy" in particular areas of their thoughts/actions, and /do/ make rationalists at times feel like an island of sanity in a world of madness.

Not perfect beacons of sanity. Not flawless machines of sterling logic. Not incarnations and avatars of Truth.

But /rational enough/ to want to further understand our own brains and avoid what we know are its weaknesses. To resist the tide of biases and cultural baggage that crashes on the shores of our minds. And willing to say yes that matters and yes it's objectively better than the alternative.

That's going to be offputting to some people no matter what. Maybe it's going to be offputting to MOST people in most current cultures. But implicit in the idea of raising the sanity waterline is the recognition that this isn't set in stone: that people can learn, improve, get better at thinking more logically.

Superstitions, religiosity, and prejudice are all shrinking in many western countries as education becomes more widespread and information more widely available. That is not an accident, to me: that's evidence that while people are born with some irrational biases, others are culturally imprinted, and the attitude of not caring about those irrational biases is itself something that can change.

**** This is perhaps my favorite expression of this point, and I want to add (for trekie140 and other people with similar perspective) that the first-order goal is less about "release all irrational beliefs" and more about "/recognize/ your irrational beliefs for what they are."

I catch myself having irrational beliefs /all the time,/ in part because I work for a rationality education organization, and we incentivize /noticing./ Literally everyone has hundreds of irrational beliefs, and it's not something to feel shame or guilt or weakness about, but rather something to include in your awareness, and build into your understanding of the broader universe.

Both "rationalists" and thoughtful, perceptive, introspective "non-rationalists" can and often do that. The difference is what happens /next,/ which is that, upon noticing an unfounded or unjustified belief, a rationalist then takes explicit steps to "update their map" and replace that belief with a correct, justified, or at least /less wrong/ new belief. The central assumption is that there isn't really any such thing as a "harmless" false belief---many, many, many of the weird things our brains do are /useful,/ but the usefulness of a false belief comes at the high cost of distancing us from a deep understanding of how things /really/ work.

Rationalists are those who, for inductive reasons, believe that the correct move is to sacrifice some degree of comfort, blissful ignorance, social normativity, and general chillness about what goes on behind the curtain in favor of moving toward truth, accuracy, openness to objective reality, and (thereby) greater ability to successfully cause good things to happen in the world.

****** Thank you for answering my question so well and dissuading me from yet another existential crisis. I do really like rationality, HPMOR and LessWrong have taught me things that have made my life objectively better. Rationality is something I cherish, but it's things like this make me doubt myself, or at least give my anxiety and depression an excuse to latch onto that I can't easily throw off.

Ever since I first started reading Yudkowsky's LessWrong posts I found myself agreeing with his reasoning, but disagreeing with many of his beliefs. At the time, I decided that was okay since I was still learning useful heuristics that were improving my life. Over time, though, I got deeper into rationality and have become more judgmental of myself out of a implicit loyalty to the group's moral paradigm.

If if is rational to be an atheist, how could I claim to be rational if I am a spiritualist? If my values prevented me from giving up a belief that lacked objective evidence, why did I even want to be a rationalist? If I believe differently from them and I think I'm right even after they criticized my beliefs, shouldn't I think they're wrong and leave their community?

In the end, I decided those questions were irrelevant and I was just looking for excuses to beat myself up, but I've never managed to resolve the paradox that is me being here if I don't fit in. Religion is just one example. I'm the odd man out on a lot of the popular fiction posted here, either because I have different tastes or I'm outside the fandom they cater to, and I not only sided with Robin Hanson in the AI Foom Debate but consider the goal of building an AI God to be immoral.

There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with someone you respect, as long as you do your best to be honest to yourself about why.

******** I was under the impression that spiritualism was considered a form of theism, though it makes sense that it wouldn't be now that I think about it. It's a religion I've made for myself out of personal experiences and philosophical ideas I liked rather than an ideology I was raised in. I haven't had loyalty to a particular religion since I began to take issue with the Catholicism I was raised in, and even moved away from the trappings of New Age when I discovered I was embracing pseudoscience.

I said AI God because the way I've often seen a singleton presented is similar to Friendship is Optimal, even if the AI's values more acceptable. I don't think it's possible to build an optimizer AI, don't understand why anyone would ever want to build it, and find the idea of it ruling over humanity to be horrifying even if it is benevolent. If it possessed the same legal rights and responsibilities as a human then I would accept it as a politician, but it often sounds like people intend to create something specifically to take over the world, which I disapprove of no matter how benevolent it is.

It may be that all you need are some courses on probability and epistemic philosophy to let go of the last vestiges. Just recognize that any friction you feel between them and the promotion of objective truths is going to occur for justified reasons, and don't worry about proving to others whether you're right or they're wrong, if you do at all. If your beliefs are based on subjective things, you know you can't do that anyway, so why beat yourself up over it?

If your personal beliefs make you happy and don't harm others, then it's really not that big a deal. Many people are smart and competent and still have irrational beliefs. That does make them "less rational", and if that bothers you, ultimately that friction is up to you to resolve at some point. I know plenty of people here agree with me in saying we'd be happy to help, but it probably won't happen as long as you /want/ to believe in spiritual things, or they provide you some irreplaceable value for now. Which again, is fine. No rush.

Super AI will take over or destroy the world when it comes into existence, or at the very least change it completely in unforeseeable ways. Specifically wanting to build a "good" one doesn't have to conflict with the belief that one shouldn't be built, but /recognizing that it will/ regardless of whether we want it to allows us to aim our beliefs and preferences toward "build a good one" rather than stand on "not wanting one to be built" as if that matters.

It's like talking about nuclear bombs. It was going to happen, eventually. Someone would discover how to utilize them. The choice was to either decide they shouldn't be built, and be at the mercy of others who do make them, or build your own so you could have some say in how events unfolded.

*********** Well, I don't think anyone's looking down on you. But maybe having such a different map from most other rationally minded people is making it hard for you to relate to them. Like, you feel like you live in a different world from them, and vice versa? Or something like that. It's not that you're being excluded or anything.

If you don't mind my asking, why do you need to believe in a God? If...

-your belief has no evidential basis

-you know that your belief has no evidential basis

-you know that you know that your belief has no evidential basis

-you consciously know what evidence is, and you know that truth is just a correspondence between beliefs and reality.

Then there must be some other reason why you're still holding that belief. Maybe "A world without a God would be too horrible a place to confront?" or "I need to believe that there's someone high above watching out for me, because otherwise I will feel very very unsafe, and that feeling of unsafety will cause a panic attack?" Or maybe even "It's socially unacceptable to be an atheist, and if I become an atheist then I will be ostracized and a lot of people will hate me, including my own family" or something like that. Or maybe there's some other reason. Regardless, you might want to consider whether there are any healthier alternative solutions to such problems besides consciously deceiving yourself.

I swear, I wouldn't have said anything if not for the fact that conscious self-deception probably makes it harder for you to evaluate the decision of whether conscious self-deception is worth doing. Evaluating the reasons you need that self-deception in the first place would be necessary in order to evaluate alternative solutions to the same sorts of problems that you would need that self-deception to solve.

However, if you are consciously deceiving yourself you wouldn't want to examine that deception for fear that the deception will fall apart, and if you don't already have alternative solutions that you know are likely to work, then you would risk being left very vulnerable to whatever problems you were using self-deception to solve.

Hopefully I haven't caused you any psychological distress with this post, I was just trying to explain it in a way so that other people here might have an easier time understanding you.

************ Because I think I've met God, and other spirits, while meditating and speak to what I think is God regularly. SlateStarCodex had an article called "Universal Love, said the Cactus Person", the pretty much sums up my experience except I wasn't on drugs. I don't have any objective evidence to indicate I was talking to God and cannot prove to anyone else that I was talking to God, but I still believe that I was. One of my other comments on this thread leads to my original discussion about this, which you can read for more detail.

************* Interesting. Do you have any hints on how to talk to God through meditation? I would be very interested in doing such a thing (whether or not the being I interacted with was a construct of my own mind).

************** Only that I followed the instructions for how to perform astral projection, which appear to be the same across spiritualist websites, and experimented with gradually expanded my mental parameters for what I could do with it. Since there's no medium between my mind and what I observer while projecting, I suspect my visions were colored by my personal beliefs and yours will be as well.

I was already speaking to spirits at the time, particularly the dead and associated support staff, when I decided I wanted to speak to God personally. I entered a world of pure white where I met Jesus and he led me to a being that seemed to encompass the entire universe, actually looking like false color images of space, and spoke to me in a booming yet soothing voice that knew me and encouraged me to be the best I could be.

*** So hold on: when you say you hold theistic beliefs, how does that cash out? What do those beliefs make you /expect to see/? Or are they just phrases you recite in your head?

Cuz everyone has /those/, but a lot of us differentiate between Beliefs which are recited in the internal narrative and /beliefs/ which guide observation and action.

****** I'd rather not have to defend my spiritual beliefs /again/, since I am incredibly unlikely to change my mind at this point. I've filled in every obvious hole in my belief system to the point where it cannot be disproven, and the act of having faith in the existence of something I cannot prove is something I have accepted about myself.

*** Have you read [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/][belief in belief]]? Or "making beliefs pay rent in anticipated experiences"? Either may provide some valuable tools for unwinding that particular knot.

***** If I may ask is there a deeper meaning behind the word choice tests? If so what would it take to "fail" in one of these tests?

And what about spiritual beliefs? Do you mean theological beliefs? Atheist can have spiritual beliefs too. Depending on the definition of spiritual at least.

****** I said tests to indicate that my beliefs do not fall prey to the biases that Yudkowsky mentioned in those articles, and I have abandoned beliefs that did me wrong like favoring pseudoscience while keeping the beliefs that have done me right like communing with spirits. I don't know the difference between spiritual and theological beliefs, and while I do believe in God I do not identify with any particular religion.
