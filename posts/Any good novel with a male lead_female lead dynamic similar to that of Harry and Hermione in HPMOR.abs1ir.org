After binging Yud's work I crave for that sort of relationship in stories. Any suggestions?

Edit: Specifically a partnership that may or may not evolve into a romantic relationship. It's this tension that I'm looking for.


** What aspect of their dynamic did you like? Nailing down exactly you're looking for could help.

** I think [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][The Dark Wizard Of Donkerk]] might fit what you're looking for.

It comes with the disclaimer that the author isn't quite happy with it yet, but as far as the dynamic between the two main characters, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

*** It's a great story, I think it could go to physical print as is and do well. Reminds me of some of my favorites growing up.

*** I suppose they mean friendly, and with more than a hint of rivalry, but not necessarily romantic (though everyone around them seems to expect that to happen).

Can't think of anything really out of my head. "UNSONG" had a lot of stuff going on, but the MC and his not-girlfriend had certainly a good and interesting relationship going.

***** Even if you don't find what you were looking for in this sense, that's always a good idea anyway, since it's a great novel. Reminds me a lot of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's "Good Omens".

***** Fair warning, UNSONG is a little weird. Personally, I loved it. I can also appreciate just how information dense it is even if it didn't delve into it very far personally. The combination of computer science plus Hebrew Kabbalah makes for a great read but it is definitely niche.
