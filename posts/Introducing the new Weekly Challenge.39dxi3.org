I'll be running a weekly challenge, starting next week at this time. The rules have been pulled from [[/r/worldbuilding]]'s weekly challenge, and I'll endeavor to run it like that one. The biggest difference is that this is *prose only.*

** Standard Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: standard-rules
   :END:

- All genres welcome.

- Submission thread will be posted 7 days from now (Wednesday, 7PM ET, 4PM PT, 11PM GMT).

- 300 word minimum, no maximum.

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Don't downvote unless an entry is trolling, spam, abusive, or breaks the no-plagiarism rule.

- Submission thread will be in "contest" mode.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- One submission per account.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment below. I can't promise that reddit gold will always be on offer, but it will for at least the first month.

** Next Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-week
   :END:
Next week's challenge is "Portal Fantasy". The Portal Fantasy is a common fantasy trope: a group of children get pulled into the magical world of Narnia; a girl follows a white rabbit through the looking glass; a tornado pulls a Kansas farmhouse up and plops it down in the land of Oz. In a rational story invoking this trope, what happens next? Keep in mind the characteristics of rational fiction listed in the sidebar.

*The submissions thread will go up 6/17, and the winner will be decided on 6/24.* (If you want my advice on how to win, and a preview of winner flair, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/39cn2a/how_to_win_challenges_on_reddit_revisited/][see here.]])

*** There's a prompt for next week, which is "Portal Fantasy". Prompts will always be given a week in advance. So when the submissions thread for "Portal Fantasy" comes there will be a section at the bottom of the post that tells you what the prompt is for the week after.

- This week (6/10): prompt given for Portal Fantasy
- Next week (6/17): submissions thread for Portal Fantasy, also Prompt X given
- Week after that (6/24): winner declared for Portal Fantasy, submissions thread for Prompt X, also Prompt Y given
- Week after that (7/1): winner declared for Prompt X, submissions thread for Prompt Y, also Prompt Z given

It's done like that mostly to give you time to get writing /now/, and to cut away some of the benefits of just being the first one to see the thread and push something out fast (so hopefully you spend /tonight/ writing up your Portal Fantasy and have it ready for next week, giving better content than something just dashed off in the spur of the moment). Of course, you're free to dash something off in the spur of the moment a week from now if you really want.

Edit: That also allows for this to be a meta thread, in case there are any glaring errors in the setup, questions, comments, clarifications, or things of that nature.

***** Timing is always going to be a (minor) problem. There are a couple solutions that negate it entirely; for example, it would be possible to set up a bot that you can submit to at any time during the week that's set to disgorge all of the submissions into the submission thread the moment it goes live. Alternately, I could try to write some open-source script so that people can make their own bots that poll for "[Weekly Challenge]" in the title.

For now, I think contest mode negates the majority of the benefits of posting first, and having the threads go up at a set, predictable time means that no one has to be refreshing the page throughout the day, and (ideally) means that submission can be something that you do during a five minute break from work, or from your phone. If you /really/ want that minor edge and the thread goes up when you're sleeping, you can set an alarm on your phone, wake up for the handful of minutes it takes to post what you've written, then go back to bed. That's not a perfect solution, but the alternative seems to be that the thread would go up while you're sleeping and you wouldn't know about it until you woke up.

I'll watch this first challenge closely though, and try to get some sense of how much impact timing /actually/ has; after the fact it will be possible to grab all the timestamps and scores and see what the correlation is.

(We'll also have to see how many submissions we get; if it's three, then trying to totally level the playing field is probably not worth it.)

** [[/u/alexanderwales]]; It is a pain to scroll past every entry every time a new comment is posted to see if that comment was a new entry.

Suggestions:

- Have entrants make one top level comment (perhaps with a title, word count, optional short description), and submit their entry as a reply to that comment. All voting should be done on the top level comment. This makes it many times easier to sort through posts and see if anything new has been posted, while not affecting much else. It would also allow longer entries, as the author could post multiple numbered replies under the same top level comment.

- Create a second thread for discussion of entries. No comments should be posted in the contest thread unless they are entries (this isn't as necessary if you go the first route, but still useful).

*** I would /suggest/ that you install [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]], which (among other things) has a feature called "Comment Hide Persistor" which will make it so that every comment you minimize (using the minus symbol next to the voting buttons) will stay minimized the next time you visit the thread. It took me some time to realize that this wasn't default reddit behavior. By collapsing every top-level comment that you've read, the only expanded ones should be ones that you haven't seen before.

Let me know if that works as a solution for you. (I understand it doesn't do much if you can't install RES, if you're using AlienBlue or RedditIsFun.) It's possible that I'll just decide to switch over to top-level comments being a link to Google Docs or off-site, which is what [[/r/fantasywriters]] does, but that would be the week after next, as the rules have already been posted for next week.

(If anyone else is having issues with this, let me know so I can see how much of a problem this is.)

** So what's the deal with people posting their contest entries to the [[/r/rational]] main page? It seems like it confers a huge advantage over people who don't so it kind of forces people who want to win to post as well. Plus people who are good at redditing (e.g. they know what times of day to post and other techniques like that) get additional advantage. Should it just be a given that you post both to the thread and to the main? Doesn't this have some of the downsides that the random contest mode is meant to avoid? Also it raises questions like how much are we allowed to market our stories? Is it ok to post it in other subreddits? Other websites? It just feels kind of inelegant but maybe I'm just being neurotic. There definitely are some benefits: it encourages more discussion, provides more content for [[/r/rational]], and increases overall visibility to those who don't want to dig through the contest thread. On the other hand those benefits would still mostly be there if the stories were posted after the competition

There might also be an issue with clutter on the main page, but I think that's either minor or even a positive.

*** Blegh.

That's mostly how I feel about it.

The /intent/ of the challenge is to have a fun community thing, with the secondary effect of stimulating people to create rational fiction. This works well in a number of other subs, who have rules that are substantially similar to what we use, and those subs have substantially larger contests with more entries.

The challenge is not meant to be about marketing, or about gaming the system, and what rules there are (those which aren't just clarifications or common sense) exist in order to reduce those advantages.

So ... yes, there are definite advantages that are conferred by posting your story in this subreddit, or by advertising it elsewhere, like on your personal website, your blog, Facebook, or whatever. There is a strong possibility that this will make the contest more about marketing than actual writing skill, which is not at all what I want, because it then pushes out people who know they can't win a war fought with marketing. (There are benefits to marketing, such as growing the subreddit and increasing exposure to rational fiction.)

On the other hand, I totally get the impulse to share what you've written with as wide an audience as possible. I get how it might feel stifling to have this awesome story you've written consigned to contest mode in the weekly challenge thread. If your primary motivation in writing is to get your writing read, why chose to write for a contest that's going to limit that exposure? If we implemented perfectly anonymous posting and strict rules on cross-posting, I would expect participation to drop. I would expect that if /I/ were thinking of writing for that contest, I would be less inclined.

And no, I don't want the front page clogged with people making duplicates of their entry, though we've only got five entries right now, so ... that's not really that much of a concern.

I'm disinclined to making rule changes, just on principle (well, also because there are frictional costs associated with doing so). And we've only got 1.5 challenges as our sample size, with the first being won by someone who opted /not/ to post elsewhere, for whatever reason. I would prefer for there to just be a community understanding, but doubt that's going to happen. So far, there has not been a real problem.

(Posting to [[/r/rational]] after the contest is over is probably my preference? I do really like "A Man and His Dog", and obviously it's the sort of thing that [[/r/rational]] enjoys, and I think it's good to post to the main subreddit, because people might otherwise miss it.)

** [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]]: (I don't know if you bother checking this regularly...)

I am concerned that the cash rewards are not really helping to the extent I hoped for. Only 2.something data points, but the trend is worrying. At least, there doesn't seem to be any strong effect on quality or quantity of submissions due to the reward. For certain, the first contest's hype was enough to overcome any effect it might have.

I actually predicted this in the other thread where we were discussing competitions and cash rewards -- in hindsight I probably shouldn't have deleted that post (I just did not want to be the naysayer...)

My mental model anticipates a long stream of short contests with small rewards won't entice many new people to join in. The flair + bragging rights is sufficient to push most people who would participate to do so; there aren't many people who would not participate for that, but who would if you added a chance of a small monetary reward. Also, anyone entering is already going to put forth their best effort in the time they feel like allotting. Again, an additional chance at a small monetary reward isn't going to have much effect on their level of effort or the time spent.

In my previous post, I mentioned how I did not believe that many smaller competitions would have much effect on participation or on bringing in new people to the sub. It certainly should (and does!) result in the creation of interesting stories, and in motivating more existing members to write. That is a great thing, and I am very much in favor.

I do believe, however, that regarding resource expenditure, our interests are best served in increasing exposure to rational fiction and in getting /more/ people interested. If the goal is more and better quality works, this is limited by the 1% rule. You can only entice existing members to contribute so much, but there is a long, long ways to go before you hit diminishing returns on resources put towards growing the member base.

My mental model anticipates that any monetary rewards can used more effectively by one large competition with a longer timespan, multiple substantial rewards, and lots of hype. Either that, or advertising.

As I stated before, ultimately I trust your discretion. I think this is something to consider at least.

Edit: tagging [[/u/amitpamin][u/amitpamin]] since he also has a stake in this.

I think I generally agree. Next week's challenge ("Ever After") will then be the last challenge to offer a cash reward, but that brings the question of what to do with the money.

- If we do a "big" challenge with it, we'll have to figure out some rules, and I don't know the best way to structure it. Longer word count minimum, for one thing. Probably not decided by upvotes or downvotes, which are easy to game, and which might not produce good results if lots of people are coming in from outside. Panel of judges willing to read lots of entries?
- If we do advertising, we'll have to figure out the best way to do that. I'll talk to my wife about it; she works for an SEO company. If you want to advertise within reddit specifically, we could put up ads for a contest targeted against most of the larger writing subreddits ([[/r/writing]], [[/r/WritingPrompts]], etc.). Or I can talk to some of the mods there. (We also need to get a submission for [[/r/subredditads]]. And probably talk to what I see as a spiritual sister-sub in [[/r/AskScienceFiction]].)

I'll do some more thinking on it over the weekend, and talk to my wife (and some of her coworkers) about advertising, click-through-rates, and all that sort of stuff. In the meantime, let me know your thoughts.

**** Taking a look at the number of submissions for "Ever After", I think it's probably a good idea to hold on to the cash for future contests and figure out a better way to organize it. After a couple weeks of no-cash-reward prompts, having something that's advertised to reddit as a whole (probably with a longer writing period) to get people writing rational fiction is a good idea. We should try to like, maybe make a document with a summary of what we think rational(ist) fiction is and a link to a couple short examples. This way, someone completely unfamiliar with [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but who likes to write can jump right in if they see an ad for the competition

*** I might change the format slightly after this week; I do think it would be cool to see a short film, though I think that's somewhat unlikely to happen with only a week's time. Comics would be more feasible. Mostly the "prose" descriptor is there because I don't want people to just lay out their /idea/ without actually turning it into a prose story.

I'll add a rule to limit it to a single entry per account, though there's nothing I could really do if someone wanted to submit from multiple accounts. I'm doubtful that making multiple submissions would greatly increase the chances of winning, as compared to simply putting more work into a single submission.

** I've got two suggestions for new rules:

1. Each entry should consist of a no-more-than three paragraph blurb and a link.
2. Entries should not be linked to from elsewhere until the contest ends, after which go nuts.

The second rule is there to make the contest about writing instead of advertising.

The first rule is there because it teaches people to write good blurbs, which is an essential skill for anything beyond casual writing. It will also reduce the 'wall of text' look for the page and mean that people will scroll farther and see more entries. Finally, it will even out the advantage that short pieces have -- if it fits in the text box more people will read it than if they have to click.

First rule ... it's been talked about. I don't want to make people write blurbs, because that greatly increases the barrier for entry; as you've said, many people are terrible at it, and some of them will just opt not to write anything rather than putting in the effort of learning to write a blurb.

And next week we're switching over to links only for longer works anyway - it's already strongly encouraged. (Looking at the results by voting for long/short analysis, it doesn't appear that shorter works /do/ have an advantage, though that might be because there's less effort involved.)

*** Reddit "hot" sorting has a time component (rank decay over time); reddit "top" sorting does not (/edit: though it's got much of the same implicit bias as best sorting, see below/); reddit "best" sorting has an implicit one, not an explicit one (in favor of posting early).

"Top" is just total upvotes minutes total downvotes, which means there's a strong incentive to post first. But it also means that a post that 60% of people liked can beat a post that 100% of people liked, just because the one that 100% of people liked was posted a bit later. We do want people to post early, but we don't want to give strict penalties for posting a bit late.

"Best" sorting uses a confidence interval. A comment with 3 ups and 1 downs is sorted lower than a comment with 6 ups and 2 downs, because we can be more confident that the latter comment actually is liked by 75% of people. There's some complicated math to figure it out, but it's explained in [[http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html][this article]], or you can look at the direct implementation in [[https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/db/_sorts.pyx][reddit's sorts.py file on git]]. The implicit time component of "best" sorting is that if two comments have equal percent ranking, the one with higher confidence is going to be sorted higher, so there's still an incentive to get your comment posted first.

Hopefully that makes sense.

I feel like you would want to post earlier with top for the purpose of getting more exposure and views which was my original point when I thought best=hot. So they are the same expect whether you value raw votes or want to weight in favour of popularity/activity. Personally I doubt the random person is different enough that a) 5 votes isn't enough to represent populace or b) that 5 isn't but 10 is. Though I know statistically you only need like 30 before it becomes nigh on perfect for any size population and I imagine that's what the reddit link is but I can't read that at the moment.

Other way around. Winner is determined by "best" ranking (the default for reddit), which is partially determined by ratio. "Top" ranking is just raw upvotes minus downvotes.

So in the case that "top" and "best" show a different post at the top (they currently don't), the winner will be the one with the higher liked ratio (after confidence is taken into account).

Edit: Because I'm afraid this isn't clear, let's say there are three posts:

Reddit doesn't have strict average ranking implemented, because as you can see, it sort of sucks.

******* Heh, no problem; this is a perennial question in [[/r/TheoryOfReddit]], in part because reddit itself isn't explicit about how these rankings work until you start drilling down into the code (or dredge up old announcement posts from years ago).

***** There is no explicit time component to best sorting. To the extent that there is a benefit to submitting first, that benefit also exists in top sorting.

I'll change the rule to be a suggestion to think before you downvote rather than a blanket "don't do this". That was partly a holdover from the old contest rules that these were copied from. I do think that there are legitimate reasons to downvote a submission; there will inevitably be people who completely disregard the prompt, for example.

** The multiple comments for long stories goes against your own strategy for winning competitions/contests and I wonder if it is the best way to run things.

As you say people are far less likely to read over multiple comments but surely there has to be some way like linking to a pastebin or something that can be held standard for everyone that doesn't punish longer stories even more than them just being long.

*** It's already in the rules that you can link to somewhere else. The only change that I can really make is to /force/ people to link to somewhere else. I sort of assumed that people would be linking to Google Docs of their own volition, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Yeah that's what I'm thinking as a level playing field everyone should have to host on the same platform like pastebin so no one gets an advantage there.
