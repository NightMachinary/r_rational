** So...this was amazing. Not much else to say really, things make sense, the characters are interesting and not too clichéd, and while the main character isn't completely rational she's intelligent and her decisions still make sense.

*** I agree. They hit a good balance with the rationality.

The characters are making reasonable steps towards their goal. But they still feel reasonably human.

I just hope that the argument about [[#s][]] doesn't drag on forever. It would be way more interesting to see a "good" character accept an unpleasant truth.

** Starts out interesting, but I'm not sure of how far the story will have contort itself to allow the idealistic gotta-save-everyone hero and her I'll-do-everything-for-the-one-I-love sidekick some measure of success.

Every time I see this "I refuse to admit/don't care how impossible it is" bullshit I just start hoping that the hero doesn't beat the ridiculous odds for once and gets everyone killed. Will probably devolve into typical shōnen fare soon enough.

*** Oh, sure.\\
The official synopsis is: Emma and her friends have a pretty good life at the orphanage they grew up in. Though the rules may be strict, the caretaker is kind. But why are the children forbidden from ever leaving...?

I'd rather not say any more. The first reveal is pretty impactful, it's worth not spoiling yourself.

But if I were to give it a genre, I'd say it's a [[#s][minor spoilers I guess?]]

**** At the start of chapter 4, it calls the series [[#s][]].

Edit: also, I strongly recommend the story. Definitely counts as rational, and maybe even rationalist, depending on the future chapters.

***** My only real problem with that movie, at least from what I remember, is that the clones have that annoying "memory leak" problem that's common in stories about clones.

If clones inherit memories and skills from the original, you can clone extremely smart and knowledgeable people and use the clones to greatly increase the pool of smart and knowledgeable people you can throw at problems.

It's not an instant solution to problems, but it would mean that The Island could be a competitive scientific and medical power in its own right.

****** Yeah I never like that element either, it adds a silly supernatural element to what is otherwise quite good sci-fi.

But the rest of the film is quite good. I'd watch it on Netflix, and actually on purpose rather than just wanting some cheese in the background. Wouldn't buy it though.

** I can't imagine any way the kids would escape in a rational universe, especially if they try to take other kids with them.

The obvious obstacle n°1 is that the moment they go over the big prison wall, their tracker emits an alarm signal and maybe releases an anaesthetic in their bloodstream. The general problem (which has been kind of ignored by the manga so far) is that the monsters would have no reason to teach the kids any skills or knowledge that might be relevant to prison breaking.

Actually they did reference that. There's a panel somewhere where they talk about how training the kids would usually not be a good idea, but they do it for the sake of quality.

Norman showed he knows how to pick locks - I don't know how he'd have picked that up... but maybe he's smart enough to figure it out from a mention in a novel or something?
