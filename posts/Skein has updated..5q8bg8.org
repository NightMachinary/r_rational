** Mind saying a bit about why Skein is worth reading? I can't see any posts on the sub about it before

*** It is an altpower!Taylor Worm fanfic. The protagonist basically sees a wordnet of associations in people's minds.

***** Well, I mean, it's still short enough that it's hard to say. The power is definitely interesting, and there's been nothing egregious (heh) about the writing and characterization so far, but at the same time, there's nothing about it that makes it particularly /well/-suited to this sub, either. I'd say give it a read, and if you don't like the first chapter, give up on it.

***** So far its pretty slow with mostly just Taylor and Lisa gradually trying to feel each other out, and Taylor manipulating people's associations.

Their powers interactions lead to very different sorts of mental "fight" scenes where Taylor tries to rearrange Lisa's associations, while Lisa keeps making new associations fast enough to figure out what is going on.

I'd say its pushing that sort of psychological soft-power angle more than a rational angle, but the story is fairly new, so its hard to judge.
