** Of the four "sciences" mentioned in the description, one of them isn't a science, one of them probably isn't capable of generating accurate predictions, and they seem to have completely ignored any sort of biology. So, that's a good sign /sarcasm.

*** It's science fiction novel. If the author stated that toe nails were a scientific discipline, then for all intents and purposes they would be within the context of said book.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the genre.

**** So long as you follow the scientific method, studying toe nails /is/ a science. "Science" has a definition, logic does not fit that definition. It is literally not a science.
