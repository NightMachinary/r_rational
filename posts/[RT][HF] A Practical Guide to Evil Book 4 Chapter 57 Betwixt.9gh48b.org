*** EE [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/chapter-48-shadows/#comment-21305][mentioned]] that Catherine would rule under the name of Dread Empress Victorious, which is somewhat more frightening, in the sense of the implications for her ascension and reign.

**** I like it.

"Triumphant" gives you the impression of someone taking over and doing amazing things, bragging about their accomplishments and everyone acknowledging how awesome they are.

"Victorious" is simple. "I beat everyone else". No pretentious claims to grandeur, just a flat out statement that everyone who tried to fight her lost.

** Cat mentioning the Drow might have to relocate as an opportunity is... odd. A goblin settlement is one thing, but drow? They're pretty much antithetical to any surface morality. It'd be a disaster to dump a pile of them into Callow.

*** Well, if she doesn't want them in Callow, she could dump them in Arcadia.

There's a lot of room in the courts, now.

/Edit:/ The more I think about it, the more sense it'd make. They are already dark-themed backstabbing assholes, so they are already basically Winter-lite. I doubt that they are going to stop the dwarves and Cat definitely isn't, so her showing up with a portal and a proposition of "Dare you enter my magical realm?" is pretty lucrative when the alternative is death by dwarf.

*** The globins have managed it despite the awful interlude from robbers pov. They are very separate and secretive so I'm sure it could work. Since they have no apparent issues with being above ground, I can see it happening.

**** Sure. That's why I'm saying it's one thing. They're not nice, but there isn't a huge cultural bulwark against any sort of partnership with other species. To the drow, surfacers are slave species. Look at what we've seen from them - crabs in a barrel. They don't just murder for position like goblins, they have a magic reason to kill each other for knowledge and power.

*** Good point. There's no reason to think there /aren't/. From what I can remember about Naming dynamics, a mantle is etched into the fabric of reality over time as narratives and stories within a given culture are repeated; e.g. the White Knight slaying a dragon and saving the princess, the Tyrant stooped over in their throne, plotting for total Calernian domination, or the Wandering Bard getting sloshed and meddling.

Dwarves definitely have a culture, which means they would have their own stories, which naturally implies they would have their own Named. Makes me wonder what /kind/ of Names they would have.

Cat should /hopefully/ realize this, at the very least. Having the "world's foremost Namelore expert" as a mentor would have its upsides, one imagines - regardless of her Foundlingâ„¢ brand impulsiveness.

***** Honestly, probably not. I'm assuming that mining is ubiquitous enough in dwarven culture that /everybody/ mines (call me /racist/, but I calls it like I sees it.)

While it might be a core - if not /the/ - pillar of dwarven society, mining would be too common for it to be a 'special talent' or 'defining trait' that is inherent to a Role.

If the Role of Dragonslayer was a deep and narrow gouge in the fabric of reality, painstakingly etched out by every single wide-eyed peasant boy who had the balls to draw a sword against a dragon, then the dwarven 'Role' of Miner would be broad but shallow - defined by the millions of bog-standard Joe Blows who have ever used a pickaxe in their lives.

Of course, this is all headcanon and you're free to ignore it if you please. But who knows - maybe our 'Knight, princess, dragon' story is their 'Miner, pickaxe, giant man-eating mole rat.'

****** Honestly, I'd picture a mining-related Name - if one exists at all - as being something like "Delver," a dwarf that explores long-forgotten tunnels and journeys deep into the bowels of the earth to discover treasures and fight ancient sleeping monsters in the dark.

*** as the other guy has said, most likely. if the ratlings of all races can have named anything with a culture can.

to give my 2 cents on what sort of named they would have i can immagine they would be more inclined to names closer to tech and administration.
