*** Seven mortal rulers and one. There's seven Proceran princes, two Lords of the Dominion and one who doesn't rule but could all the same.

Who are the two survivors?

**** We only know that about 3 and a further fourth prince who is a horrible human being.l but worth something in a fight. We also know for a fact that at least two of them are very competent/good at what they do.

*** There might be a fight, but I strongly suspect that the battle ends with most of the royalty alive and traveling to fight the deal king, and being completely disowned by their respective nations due to not fighting Catherine hard enough.

Edit: “the deal king” we're going to make undeath great again 😂😂

** Wasn't there an open plot thread about how the Augur was the secret to controlling Cordelia? If you could somehow influence the Augur's prophesies, you can control what Cordelia will do because she trusts her cousin implicitly. I think the Wandering Bard was playing some high level moves with developing certain stories at certain times to influence what the Augur can see.

Does any of this sound familiar, or am I making things up? I honestly can't remember.

*** I just looked it up. The bit about Augur is a theory that Tyrant has while he and Cat have their chess match. Not definitive, but disturbingly plausible and he /has/ put a lot of effort into understanding the Bard.

**** Wait, the Augur foresees peasant revolts if Procer makes peace with Callow, and the Tyrant just happens to have a guy who specializes in creating present revolts. So if a truce happened, the Tyrant is going to nudge the Hierarch into the provinces that Black razed and encourage him to do what he does, and since the Tyrant's plans is one step removed and the Hierarch doesn't have a specific plan at all, the Augur can't see them at all so all she's left with is Cordelia's plan for a truce -> present revolt with the middle steps missing.

***** Wow... so the Tyrant, or anyone else with the resources to ruin Cordelia's day can essentially communicate conditional threats through the Augur. Even without knowing her plans, simply by pre-commiting to punish actions they don't want (or presumably reward those they do) they can influence Cordelia's plans.

*** Or she knows that the Pilgrim doesn't linger in peaceful places, so his presence here (instead of, say, north where the Dead King is) means it's going to be a long string of bad days.

Or both.
