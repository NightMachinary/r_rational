Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I had acquired a +1 warhammer of apparitions in my dnd campaign. The hammer was enchanted with a killing blow counter, where after killing 150 creatures, the hammer would release it's dark power for me to overcome and then master

I took that hammer to the fishing and bait shop and made 150 doses of worm puree, the apparation inside the hammer was unimpressed, but this +3 warhammer hits like a bus

** edit: it looks like this isn't going to work regardless of how I tweak the ruleset.

tl;dr: *What are the most powerful mythological or fictional creatures that you can think of?* Note that creatures shouldn't be humanoid (in their true form), and there should be more than one of them in any given work.

--------------

So I'm working on creating the ruleset of what has a low chance of turning into a freeform RP.

During "character creation" so to speak, a genie appears to every person on the planet and let them pick /any/ real, mythological, or fictional (but not imaginary) type of creature and get their abilities (from the mundane to the magical). Now, I figure a majority of people would either dismiss the genie (getting no powers), pick some regular animal (say, cats) and get some relatively unimpressive powers (nightvision, better smell, better able to survive falls, etc.) But some subset of the population is inevitably going to pick magical or fictional creatures, and some of those creatures would be very, very OP.

Now, a certain amount of OPness is expected, and even welcome; it's more wish-fulfilment-y to have characters with neat superpowers. But while a lot of possible choices exist on the same "power scale" so to speak (for example, most kinds of werewolves are less powerful than most kinds of dragon, but by the same token most kinds of dragons are still killable by most kinds of werewolf), you have creatures that are explicitly designed to be ridiculously OP, to the point where if a person with bad intentions picks them, they're extinction-level events (or at least still incredibly dangerous.)

So,

- What are the most OP creatures you can think of to pick, especially considering that other people will also be picking OP creatures?
- How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)

Some examples of creatures I consider powerful, but balanced:

Inheritance cycle dragons (mindreading is nasty good, but they're still very vulnerable to ordinary weaponry), Nemean lions (high tier invulnerability is great, but still have exploitable weak spots), most non-legendary pokemon, 5e Tarrasque

Some examples of creatures I consider unbalanced:

3.5e Tarrasque, legendary pokemon, anything that has to be killed with a special, magic weapon that obviously wouldn't exist in the real world, Naruto tailed beasts

+edit: actually, I think I've come up with a possible, partial, solution. Namely, that the genie will scale the offensive and defensive abilities of every creature to asymptotically approach the power of a nuclear bomb (say, 500 kT), and the maximum speed to be mach 2, and the maximum acceleration to be 10 gravities, and the maximum mental processing speed to be 4x human average. If you have less than than, say, 90% of an amount, abilities are virtually unchanged. Approaching or exceeding a bound places you on a logistic curve, with the "meeting" point being the optimal choice of creature for each category. So without warning, virtually everything is still vulnerable to an ICBM strike.+

I'm thinking something along the lines of "non-humanoid, organic being". So you get plenty of sapient "creatures". But I'm having trouble identifying the fuzzy logic I'm using to determine what exactly a creature is. Given any specific example, I can easily say whether it is/isn't a creature, but I can't do that in the abstract.

They seem a little UP honestly, compared to some of the stuff available. You'd be able to build all sorts of cool stuff, but assuming society doesn't immediately break down, you'd have all sorts of mind readers/regenerators/breath weapon havers/ clairvoyants to stop you from having your way with the planet's natural resources.

I'm not seeing those specific abilities for drone on their wiki, but at the same time, I can easily see creatures having that ability existing, so I won't gainsay you.

Can you think of a way for the genie to nerf creatures in the weight class of swarm drones without having to go in and give out unique nerfs?

I think the largest parts of what make them so broke is their self-replication and instinctual knowledge (as you wouldn't be nearly so threatening if you couldn't properly manipulate your fields and your firewalls) so maybe a ban on self-replication outside of normal human sexual intercourse (or technology assisted human intercourse), and removing all instinctual knowledge (with the justification that such a knowledge dump would be like replacing you with another person) thus forcing everyone to learn about their new abilities through practice (albeit aided by instincts that can't be called "knowledge" and any brain mechanism boosts)?

That of course still leaves really high potential with the FTL capability, shapeshifting, mental defenses, displacement, etc. But doesn't make you broke straight off the bat, allowing people to come up with countermeasures.

Fields, Displacers, and Effectors are basically the core Culture toolkit, and SC agents are equipped as thoroughly as the Minds can manage. Displacements are generally done by the local Mind when possible, but I'm pretty sure I remember drones displacing themselves and their knife missiles around. Even if I can't displace myself, I can just use CREWS (extremely OP Culture-tech lasers) to interdict anything coming at me, or even disassemble munitions in flight with effectors.

I don't need to self-replicate, I just need to make remote-controlled knife missiles and/or eDust. And either I lack the knowledge of how to use my drone body so completely that I die instantly, or I understand effectors well enough to use them to examine my own systems and reverse-engineer them. Culture people are much, much more in control of their own minds than we're used to, and that's even more true for the synthetic ones.

Those would be terrifying tools against "ordinary" (i.e., only slightly superhuman) humans, but wouldn't be enough to take care of all the other powergamers intent on stopping anyone (who isn't them) from taking over the world.

Here it would be the in-between option. You'd have a human body (plus any self-modification and special body-related abilities), so lack of knowledge wouldn't kill you. On the flipside, while you would eventually be able to reverse-engineer your own abilities, sincr you still have a human body, it would take time and effort, leaving you vulnerable to the intervention of other parties.

It sounds like you'd still very much be on the "op" end of the scale, but definitely a doable opponent for PCs.

I think "being" is a little too permissive, because it lets past all manner of AI and robot, plus stuff like golems and genius loci. It's annoying having to split hairs like this, but I think it would be a bit arbitrary for the genie to examine everything case-by-case...

Step 1 of course is to begin accelerating upward at 10g as soon as possible after receiving powers. Step 2, to be completed within 6.9 seconds, is to see if I can dispose of the mach 2 speed limit by reconceptualizing my frame of reference, because speed limits other than c don't really make sense. We're all moving much faster than 686m/s, relative to the sun. World optimization is like step 1000 or something.

Okay, I'm confused as to how these granted abilities work. Suppose I'd chosen eagle. Would I get wings, or would I just be able to fly while fully humanoid? That is, what is an "ability" vs a feature that makes that ability possible? Because I assumed not understanding my effectors would mean that my antimatter core would lose containment.

Before I answer this, I'm going to clarify that I'm making it up as I go along-- when you ask me a question, I don't have an answer prepared, I just try to generate one based off my previous statements that I think would make the most sense. So if my answers seem tailored towards mitigating unbalanced builds, that's because they are!

Anyways you can get any and all specific features of your chosen creature (so if you chose eagle, you could get good eyesight, smell, and the ability to track small creatures at long distances) but because you're not /actually/ the chosen creature, you can't necessarily do all the things that creature can do, because your body geometry is fundamentally different, and you're still "you" mentally, although you may have gotten some tweaks that make you less "you" than you were previously. So in this example, choosing "eagle" wouldn't give you the ability to fly because even if you had wings, you'd be too large to fly with them. If you had chosen something like "dragon" who obviously flagrantly violate the square/cube law, then you'd have the same mechanism they use to fly.

There's an inherent fuzzyness to this question because I'm not making this a maximum-transhumanism setting, so there needs to be a balance between the fact that obviously straight humans wouldn't be able to do all the neat stuff that magical creatures could, and that the full turn-into-a-magical-creature regimen would replace you with a completely different being that shares some of your mental patterns.

To clarify, being a spirit is not /sufficient/ to qualify, but being a spirit doesn't disbarr something that would otherwise be a creature from qualifying, and typically makes things less-humanoid than they'd otherwise be.

Golems, meanwhile, are purely constructs. They're not really "creatures" or "beasts" or any of those other, related words.

Sure, golems are creatures. Or at least, if they're not, then neither are many, many created beings in fiction, such as Tolkien's Dwarves, being made of earth by Aulë. The artificial/natural dichotomy is nonsense which only becomes more nonsensical in being connected to the multiverse of fiction.

You have 1-3 words to describe your creature. After that, the genie may ask clarifying questions, or may give you some powers that match your description.

For example, "Tarrasque" may get the powers from [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/tarrasque.htm][D&D 3.5]], [[http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/tarrasque.htm][D&D 5e]], or [[http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Torrasque_(StarCraft_II)][Starcraft]]. All of them are large, powerful beasts that are difficult to kill, but they have wildly different power levels.

"Dragon" may get the genie to ask questions, like "what type" or "from which stories", and then proceed from there.

I actually think regenerators wouldn't be /that/ much of a threat, because there would be so many out-of-context powers running around, guaranteeing someone would be able to no-sell anything but the highest tiers of regeneration (ignoring grey goo, that is.) Certainly still incredibly dangerous, but with the relatively low probability for any single person to specifically pick the most broken regenerator tin order to kill bunches of people, they would actually make interesting challenges that destabalize regions, but aren't threats to the world as a whole.

#+end_quote

Yeah, I've definitely been looking for an organic way for the genie to pick the "least worldbreaking" version of a worldbreaker, and this seems like a good one.

--------------

How about this for a better restriction on creature picking/power granting:

"Pick a class of creature from either the natural world or published fiction that has previously had members of that class killed by the actions of mortals. You will gain powers of the same type, and of proportional magnitude, of those possessed by the creature you pick."

With the genie then either asking questions clarify what exactly they mean by, say "3.5e tarrasque" (e.x. from which novel?), and picking a representative example to base powers off intended to balance creature choices using fuzzy DM logic.

So if you pick a wish-granter, for example, your power to grant wishes is limited, and you can grant them at a limited rate. If you have regeneration, it's slowed down. Self-replication only happens so fast, and is dependent of food intake, mind reading only shows you a bit of a mind at a time, and so on and so forth. And the "killed by mortals" restriction sections off a vast quantity of the truly broken monsters.

  How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)
#+end_quote

Step one is to ban any creature that has time-travel as an ability, because that's an instant balance breaker: the first person to activate a time travel ability can just go back in time and kills all the puny other humans before they transform into OP creatures. This ban also rules out all kinds of gods, genies, and reality warpers.

After that most creatures are okay really. For every creature that can only be killed with attack method X, there's another creature with an attack method that always kills absolutely anything. It's like when the unstoppable force hits the immovable object. Just create a massive magical explosion that hurts both sides whenever that happens.

Once you have that, the smart people will choose dimensional sliding creatures so they can get the hell out of our universe that has suddenly become full of horrible creatures like [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/d/d1/Justice_League_Adventures_Vol_1_5.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100812070042][star conquerers]] and [[https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1901472-sun_eater.jpg][sun eaters]] (the two most overpowered things I can think of, but there are surely other more OP ones).

Anyone foolish enough to choose something as puny as a werewolf, or really any creature that can't escape Earth, is going to find themselves without an Earth to stand on. Anyone choosing creatures that can escape Earth but not the Milky Way will likely die from collateral damage soon after, unless they are one of the big players that are throwing stars around.

**** Nah, time travel isn't so bad if you establish rules for it.

You can state that it's a "Many Worlds" universe or somesuch. Time travel just sends you into an alternate timeline where you can make all the changes you want, but since /you/ are from another one, you can't create paradoxes. From your enemy's perspective, you basically just erase yourself from existence.

Alternatively, you can state that the timeline is self-repairing, and will prevent you from changing any of the /causes/ who's effects you've already interacted with. On the 'nice' end, luck will conspire to keep you from changing any part that affects your history. On the 'mean' end, it will actively seek to kill you by having 'completely random' events take you down--IE: You and another time traveler unwittingly choose the same time and space and kill each other on arrival.

  I think the largest parts of what make them so broke is their self-replication and instinctual knowledge (as you wouldn't be nearly so threatening if you couldn't properly manipulate your fields and your firewalls) so maybe a ban on self-replication outside of normal human sexual intercourse (or technology assisted human intercourse), and removing all instinctual knowledge (with the justification that such a knowledge dump would be like replacing you with another person) thus forcing everyone to learn about their new abilities through practice (albeit aided by instincts that can't be called "knowledge" and any brain mechanism boosts)?
#+end_quote

This opens up the opportunity to pick godlike beings who would otherwise be off the table for any reasonable person because of how much you'd lose your identity.\\
So with the stipulation that you keep your personality and gain no new knowledge in place I will simply pick Azathoth. Or any of the number of other gods conceived of which aren't humanoid.

Alternatively I could pick the enhanced humans from some fiction I previously wrote. These enhanced humans would by themselves not really be that impressive (basically they're just peak human in every regard with a few extra goodies) however they also have cellular machinery which will construct nanobots to kick off the creation of a FAI and a singularity should they ever find themselves in a pre singularity world.\\
Of course I couldn't pick the enhanced /humans/ because of the "no humanoids clause" however there are equivalent versions of many other animals. So I could turn into a warbird which has human level intelligence, and then pretty rapidly when the nanobot triggered singularity gets afoot I can get my body changed back to human (or just upload).

Add a “power conversion efficiency factor” which determines how efficiently will be the power conversion between the creature's fictional self and the person who chose it as their donor. Add some of the following sub-factors to influence \ calculate how high this conversion factor will be on individual case-by-case basis:

- the more attention (stored knowledge in their minds, daily thoughts, etc) is allocated to this fictional creature by sophonts IRL worldwide, the higher;

- the more would this creature's powers in the hands of the choosing person break the “average suspension of disbelief” of sophonts IRL worldwide, the lower;

- the more [[https://youtu.be/L7jClyinERY?t=204][self-contradictory]] the nature of this creature and \ or its power, the lower;

- the better the choosing person understands the nature of their donor creature \ its power, the higher;

- the more people choose that creature (or, alternatively, a creature with similar powers) as their donor, the more that power gets divided among these people, the lower becomes the conversion factor;

- the genie warns about one or more of the above-mentioned limitations only after a person makes their final choice --- or doesn't warn at all. This one would be counter-productive if this is intended as a CYOA or something similar to a CYOA, in my opinion.

Some sort of power scaling needs to exist, definitely. The trick is setting it up so regular people are completely unnaffected (I choose dragons because dragons are cool! What kind of dragons? I dunno, the kind that fly and breath fire), savvy powergamers recieve some nerfs (what do you mean, I'm not completely invulnerable to fire as a chromatic dragon? Well I guess massive defense is good enough...), and absolute gamebreakers recieve significant nerfs (I should literally control the entire universe! The fact that I can only affect tectonic events on one continent is an insult) while still rewarding people for making smart character creation decisions.

****** The tactics you used could be useful, but they would be difficult to translate into crunch-- how could a DM predict the chances of any particular creature getting picked? There are too many unknowns to implement those specific suggestions as stated without resorting to dm fiat anyways.

That's why I'd prefer power scaling based off an established higher bound of some sort, potentially based on the heuristics you provided. You can solidly place a specific option on a scale against other options, and then finangle with world details to mke sure that, despite that, you can still tell the scale of story you want to tell.

** Under the whim of some chaotic god whose name you don't know how to properly pronounce, you are given the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball][Magic 8 Ball]] of Power and Happiness. Unlike the more traditional ones this 8ball only has a decahedron inside with only 5 positive and 5 negative answers. The instructions that came with the 8ball tell you that it will only work under specific conditions, however the result will always be 100% accurate.

The conditions are:

- Your questions must always be asked with good "intent" behind them. If you try to make a prediction knowing that someone will be harmed by it, even if not directly, the chaotic god will smite a relative or a loved one.

- The questions must always be asked with the purpose of either conquering a country/the world, or reaching true happiness. Otherwise you won't get an answer at all.

- Within the span of 10 predictions, one of them must always be done with the intent of amusing the chaotic god. The counter resets every 10 predictions so it doesn't matter if it is the fourth or the eleventh one, but it must be done. Otherwise...

Some attributes of the 8ball to keep in mind:

- The card with the instructions/conditions/attributes is the "key" of the Magic 8 ball. The ball itself won't work unless the owner is the one asking the question and the card is within 5m of the ball and the owner.

- Every time you touch it, it releases a randomly disgusting and intense smell that can last from 10 minutes to 3 hours.

- Whenever you activate it, it will try to taunt you by laughing like a madman or crying like a baby.

- Predictions that result in the user being miserable lower the above effects, while predictions that greatly benefit the user will make the item temporarily unusable and generate a very strong but short ranged AoE mental attack that lasts for 6 hours (basically a car alarm in your head or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYKgkFvMM][this]])

- Ignoring the 8ball and therefore boring a chaotic god, is NOT a good idea. However, you can gift it to someone else as long as these two requirements are fulfilled: 1) You have to bathe the 8ball in your blood and clean it with your tongue. 2) You recognize the person you will gift it to as someone who is more fucked up than you are, and is even less qualified than you are to use it.

How would you take advantage of such a powerful yet obnoxious item? What kind of questions or "predictions" would you make?" would you even try? how long do you think it'll take until you get sick of it and try to give it away? are you willing to pay the price? or would you rather come with a way to bypass its obnoxiousness?

It's just a limit to not let you go overboard as soon as you get the item, if you ask the ball if there's a way for you to become inmortal or stop a loved one's deadly disease, and the result ends up being yes...

But even then, the "mental attack" is just some stupid loud noise in your mind, which you can easily avoid if you just get outside the ball's range (or throw it away) and simply wait until it stops to pick it up again, which is 6 hours of waiting until you can use it again...

It might seem silly and a very low price to pay for an object that is OP, but every single aspect of the ball combined can eat away at a person's sanity, unless you somehow manage to get past that.

*** The obvious solution here is to learn to get very used to the mental car alarm and use the somewhat pitiful binary data outputted by the ball to transcribe the message that is specified to contain the best possible course of action according to some criteria for how much past you would have liked the outcome.

Or perhaps instead ask for the message that will lead to the best outcome (from your perspective) due to the butterfly effect. In this scenario it's possible you may not even end up /doing anything/ and instead just looking at the message will be sufficient to cause a FAI to arise by chance in a botnet/supercomputer due to cosmic rays randomly flipping bits. Actually I would feel confident that this is /by definition/ the best thing you could ask the 8-ball for at least from the perspective of your utility function.

So depending on what the best course of action ends up being you might end up either laboriously coding a seed FAI/botnet that will instantiate a singularity. Or likely you may end up taking some course of action which results in you becoming extremely rich and powerful and then hiring researchers who miraculously seem to have insights on how to progress in AGI/AI alignment nearly constantly such that they get decades of intellectual work done in only months.\\
Though as previously stated it may be even more likely that by exploiting the butterfly effect the way the message leads to a singularity will look like fate manipulation or supernatural tampering.
