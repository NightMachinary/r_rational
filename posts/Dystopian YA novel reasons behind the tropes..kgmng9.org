Lots of dystopian ya novels have a lot of shared tropes. Why do said tropes exist and what do they satisfy in the target audience and how can we get these to make sense. To show you what I mean. Here is a helpful twitter page, [[https://twitter.com/dystopianya?lang=en]] . Also If you have seen this before I apologize.


** Many of them are in service to appealing to teenagers and providing drama that would be appropriate. From an entirely Doylist approach:

1. The protagonist needs to be roughly their age so they can best identify with them. Thus, there needs to be no sensible adults to handle the conflicts that drive the plot.\\
2. The protagonist should be special in a way that the reader can relate to, and equally "misunderstood" by others. This is why loners or people more complex than the boxes that society tries to force them into are common.\\
3. Dystopias are about fundamentally unhappy societies with inequitable power structures, and teens can really relate to that, because of middle/high school. Not being treated with respect by tyrants especially.\\
4. The story should be action packed, and there should be someone for the protagonist to fight.\\
5. The initial powerlessness of the protagonist exists to give them a chance to "fight back," and a touch of nihilism helps, which is why often their antagonists are people just like them, equally unfairly thrust into the situation, but making it worse. Kind of like their classmates at school.\\

And so this is why most dystopian youth fiction has some sort of element of pitting young people against one another at the behest of an oppressive authority.

That and also the fact that everyone is shamelessly ripping off Battle Royale, because it's awesome.

*** Lol my favorite part of those stories is how the government is always able to be taken down by a stupid teenage girl/boy after only a few months/years, EVERY TIME.

It makes sense from a happy ending perspective, and yet it's one of the prime example of the opposite of rational fiction in my opinion.

**** What makes the YAs unrealistic isn't "teenager saves the day." It's "person totally outside the power structure suddenly gets in charge."

Alexander the Great was a teenager when he defeated and claimed the Persian Empire; Octavian Augustus was a teenager when he challenged Mark Anthony for Rome.

But neither of them were outsiders; they were inheritors, born to power.

Nobodies do sometimes take over. Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang began as a literal beggar. But that was a rise over decades of civil war chaos in China.

TBF, you do get "teen celebrity issue speaker." But I think nobody is going to confuse Greta Thunberg with Katniss Everdeen.

***** There was an article that alleged Greta's father and one of his friends were writing posts on her page (the evidence was a Facebook bug that showed the authors AFAIR).

*** I do understand the majority of these claims, but why oh why do they all suck at the romantic subplot. Seriously, they can't write teenage romance to save their lives. Perhaps it's because in these sorts of plots, teenage romance would not rationally happen, or at the very least not love triangles. Also every teenager wants to feel loved and appreciated without having to work for it. Having two guys attracted to you because you are special and not having to work for their affections is at least from many of these writer's perspectives a teenage girl's dream. Also many of these issues with characterization come from the fact of trying to make the character relatable to too large of an audience which has the nasty side effect of not having enough of a defined personality. So that way any teenage girl can identify with the character. I seriously read a ya dystopian novel and didn't realize that the protagonist was a guy halfway through the book, I forget the title.

***** Oh no, it's not that it's cringey. It's that it doesn't make logical sense. They throw a girl who is hot but says that she is plain and a hot guy together in dangerous situations and somehow you get a romance, barring personality traits, fights or anything else.

****** putting a hot girl and a hot guy together into dangerous situations and having them develop attraction to each other as a result sounds completely realistic to me

******* Sure, but they tend to forego the actual romance parts of this and act like them being in dangerous situations together inherently makes them a couple. For example many people go through dangerous situations together as a group and they don't become polyamorous.

**** Im pretty sure that the main problem is that these teen romances are written by 40+yo housewives, who did not have a romance (let alone a teenage romance) since 1980. If they consulted actual modern teens about every part of the romance, it would be considerably less unrealistic.

** Reading this reminded me why I think The Hunger Games series, despite its obvious flaws, remains the best example of popular YA fiction.

The entire point of the last book is how it isn't really Katniss that brings down the Capitol - she's just a figure-head the leadership of District 13 uses to rally the other Districts in their own war against the Capitol. The books manages to deconstruct the 'Teenage Saviour' trope and play it straight, at the same time - Katniss is just a piece of propaganda in a wider war machine. District 13 uses her to promote the war effort in almost the exact same way the marketing campaign used posters of Jennifer Lawrence to promote the movies. She really is, in the end, just a souped up, more effective version of Greta Thunberg.

The books even manage to deconstruct the classic 'love triangle' plot as well - all of the 'forced' romance is actually 'forced' in-universe, a ploy used to make the main characters more interesting to the Capitol in the exact same way it was meant to make the books more interesting to the target demographic.

Sometimes it really does feel like The Hunger Games managed to take all of the classic tropes of the YA Dystopia genre and take them to another, deeper, more introspective level... and then all the copy-cats that followed just played them straight and slowly ran the genre into the ground.
