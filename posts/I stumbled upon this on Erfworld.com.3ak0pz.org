***** Nah, if given 'people who help you bring bodies back from the dead aren't automatically your real friends' plot, they'll make it into the old 'comforting' aesops: 'Death is a natural part of life', and 'Nobody wants to live forever'.

****** Actually they had an episode recently where one of the pony's pets was going to die(ok "hibernate"). The character's response was to determine that pet was dying because of winter and then attempt to literally prevent winter from ever coming. She ended up blowing up the facility that produces clouds, snowflakes, cold, etc.

When that finally fails and she's sulking one of the other ponies outright says "you're going to be petless." Its not completely rational but in terms of both caring enough to make a significant effort and facing hard truths it does a pretty good job.

** The comic itself is greatly deconstructionist and, while maybe not completely rational, not so far off either.

**** Seeing how you replied to my comment as opposed to the top post I assume you're talking about the comic in general? In that case I already mentioned that it isn't completely rational.

But to elaborate, it is about a pretty smart guy being shunted into a deconstructionis world based on tabletop strategy games in which everything seems silly and nonsensical at first sight but in truth has all kinds of rules that the main character tries to figure out and then proceeds to use and abuse. I wouldn't call it quite completely rational though because the main character seems a bit too willing to play along (which is explained with two interconnected reasons though), because the villains aren't quite that rational (at least not the obvious ones) and because a few rare times things seem to be happening a bit deus ex machina. But all in all it sure is more rational than many other webcomics I've read.

How far into the first book did you get before starting to judge its rationality?

--------------

Edit:

Looking at the Characteristics of Rational Fiction sidebar I have this to say:

- Things do happen solely because of the plot. But characters don't do things solely because of the plot. Instead the world seems to have a will of its own and often nudges things along. This is however a theme that is explored numerous times, a major plot point in itself and something both the main character and others grapple with nd struggle to understand.

- Haven't found an "evil" faction yet. Only lots of jerkass factions.

- The smart ones do. Sometimes they just use educated guesses. Sometimes those are more or less spot on. Sometimes completely unexpected things happen. High stakes experimentation under time pressure is a thing.

- They seem consistent enough. As to /sane/, the main character and many readers would disagree. It's pretty crazy.

The story even slightly touches on the first two criteria for rational/ist/ fiction every now and then.

***** I'd certainly recommend it. It's a fascinating setting, especially with how childish it appears at first glance compared to how grim it is in actuality.

I should catch up on it, I think the last I read it was several years ago.

This is actually an interesting exception to the rule. When the world /is/ a character, who is plotting, then things happening "because of the plot" it has a different meaning.

****** Like Homestuck! Any timeline that doesn't match the plan that The Game has set out is labelled a "doomed timeline" and everybody in it is slated for death at the earliest opportunity. Only the one path that follows the plan gets to survive

I only say this because I dreadfully want to have a discussion about Homestuck with the rationalist people, and it keeps not happening.

Edit: hey, look at that off-topic thread, anybody want to go talk about HS over there with me?
