** A lot of the things that happened in these chapters were largely things I expected to happen: a new exclusion, another conversation with the DM, things getting politically dicey for our fledgling republic, etc.

I did /not/ expect to watch Bethel rape Juniper, nor did I expect June to soulfuck away the trauma of it. This is... oof. I'm REALLY hoping that's not something that's just gonna linger in the background for 30+ chapters before being addressed again, because EVERYTHING about that situation is just... uncomfortable, to put it mildly. It's gonna be hard for me to focus on anything else while that's just quietly lurking there.

**** Yeah, the fact that Juniper likely wouldn't call it rape is one of the most uncomfortable things about it. Like, he feels /guilty/ and is afraid to tell Amaryllis because he thinks it's /his fault/. The fact that he's fucking with his soul/spirit with that in mind is genuinely disturbing. He knows how fucked up it was, but he can't really process /why/ it was fucked up, and so he warps the fear and disgust that he can't properly process into guilt, which is something that he /can/ process but which /isn't/ actually the proper response to the situation. He then uses those warped emotions and explanation for those emotions as motivation to /alter his soul/ without telling anyone.

There are just layers and layers of disturbing and unsettling to this. It's like an onion, if that onion /also/ had a profoundly unhealthy reaction to being a victim of sexual violence.

As an aside, I'm... not happy, because it's fucking rape, but I'll say that it's /gratifying/ to see that for once there's a work of fiction wherein the teammate with violent impulses and no conscience or respect for the boundaries or wishes of others is actually causing problems for the people on her team thanks to those qualities. All too often, the "murderous" teammate is played for laughs, with little thought given to how poorly suited someone who habitually kills people would be to working with others. Like, the teammate who's supposed to be a "violent psychopath" usually just ends up being slightly grumpy with a particularly dark sense of humor (my brain goes to Jack in /Mass Effect/, though there are probably better examples). Bethel here is actually /completely fucking nuts/ and that is, naturally, hurting her team tremendously. Even if you ignore her mutilation of Raven, her repeated death threats towards Amaryllis, and the joy she seems to take in tormenting her teammates and violating their privacy, she's causing tremendous harm to Joon here, and it's not entirely clear if she's so broken that she doesn't realize that, or if she does realize it and just doesn't care.

** I love how the characters live in their own world and don't just go along with the plot. It's easy to notice when a work has characters holding idiot balls and forgetting what drives them but WTC's characters don't give a shit what the plot wants to focus on, they react and behave in accordance with there motivations and values.

Oh shit, skin magic was excluded!? Well I know you want to dissect that and it's awful and everything but for Valencia that means she might be able to pass as a normal person for the first time in her entire life and that's more real to her than the exclusions long term ramifications.

The worlds in danger and Joon's the only one that can stop it and is currently dealing with major tragedy and political calamity? That's good and all but Solace cares about the Locus more than any of that and isn't afraid to push for joon's time and attention.

Ditto Bethel who isn't afraid to voice her complaints at being used to provide medical care for thousands of innocent civilians after an unexpected emergency because her self-identity and autonomy are more important.

Many stories will pay lip service to their casts differing perspectives and character but they'll fall right into line when the plot wants to focus on a specific conflict. Everything's streamlined because the plot's decided what's /really/ important. It's a more subtle facade than the standard faults you find in unrealistic character writing but the fact that WTC avoids it is one of the things I love most about it.

**** Solace's anger feels unwarranted here. Juniper doesn't believe you can deliberately boost loyalty, and that's the only real step she recommended so he had a good reason not to be doing it. I think her anger is more from Grak encouraging or supporting her in general or some that a catastrophe, like what just occurred, could kill Juniper or the locus off prematurely.

I also think Juniper's mental drive to understand and dissect systems, along with his huge suite of observational and processing skills, makes him basically the hardest counter to druid's we know of. Far less methodical and skilled people killed the majority of them, 1 vs Juniper doesn't stand a chance.

So I think it's worth acknowledging that Bethel may have been entirely ignorant and incorrect about Joon's qualms with what happened, given his recent increase in skills.

#+end_quote

After some time thinking about the subject, I came up with some conclusions:

Bethel doesn't sees sexual abuse (the act, not the words) the same way we do. She does not feel violated by having to provide carnal pleasure to another, but she feels it when others try to forcibly tamper with her ego (by permanently adding entads to the house).\\
She pretty much admits in that 164 that that's the first time she's going to experience a sex act /actually/ involving her/emotionally engaging¹ for her. But she also implicitly admits this when she told him (and to the others) what Uther had her do with him and then told what the /his/ threats was, and then saying that she doesn't understand why they get disgusted/horrified with the /first/ (which she doesn't care about), but not with the /latter/ (which she pretty much /does/).

Bethel misinterpreted Joon's /motives/ to be feeling what he felt.²\\
She thought he /wanted/ it, but that his morals (all the "if I do, I'll be "cheating/betraying" all those people whom I have no real obligation to be faithful to" stuff) would not allow him to /willingly/ accept it, but that he would roll with it if the choice was taken away from him(like in "I had no choice; my hands were tied; etc").³

Combine those two, and I find it very likely that Bethel thought that forcing Joon to have sex with her was more like her being forced to temporarily serve as an airship/hospital/indoctrination center, rather than more like Uther forcefully adding new entads to her.\\
More like something that to be uncomfortable doing because it goes against your moral values, as opposed to something to have an abject dread of.\\
And we even saw the effect of her being loyalty 18 in her actions at the end of 164 (not in the motions, but in the /dialogue/), she expresses a (slight) concern for Joon when he finally speaks to her, tries to assure him that she will not tell to Mary or to anyone about the sex⁴, even attempted to dissociate him from trying to pursue a relationship with her⁵, and saying that, in the rare case of her attempting to have sex again, it would not be with /him/.⁶

With that said, something that no one seems to have commented yet: Valencia knows.\\
Even if we consider that she is keeping the promise of not using devils in same room that Joon unless it is /really/ necessary, even if we consider that Valencia and Joon had almost no interaction between 164 and 165, we still have an obvious moment in 165 where:\\
A) Valencia, Joon and Bethel are in the same room, and where;\\
B) we have evidence of that Valencia was using a devil.\\
That does not mean that she knows /everything/⁷, but she must have seen enough to be concerned about Joon, and to possibly self-justify some future use of devils in Joon to find out what is wrong.

1- "Engaging" like in "participating or becoming involved in".\\
2- And was later sufficiently fooled by Joon's self-preservation mechanism to continue to believe in her initial misinterpretation, or at least enought for not try to probe further about why joon sounded so strange at the end of 164.\\
3- When it really was "my body is betraying me and I really, /really/ do not want it, but I'm going to roll with it for fear of the possible and /violent/ consequences of denying you it."\\
4- And bearing in mind the alienness of the Bethel's mentality, and how she seems (dis)cosider sexual acts, I think it is more likely that she was /genuinely/ trying to reassure Joon that she will not tell about his "betrayal" to anyone (because she thinks that's why he's acting weird, that he's afraid others will find out that he "betrayed" them), rather than hiding a rape committed by her (since she does not consider it by what it is, for her it can be just casual, if hidden, sex).\\
5- Because Joon's self-mind&spirit-fuckery was making him seem, from outside, as if he was /actually/ considering becoming her lover.\\
6- Although this latter may also have been for somewhat more selfish reasons, besides her perhaps not wanting to put him again in a position morally difficult (for him).\\
7- Because, again, Joon's self-mind&spirit-fuckery, but too because Bethel has a mentality that may be atypical for /even/ the devils.

  Combine those two, and I find it very likely that Bethel thought that forcing Joon to have sex with her was more like her being forced to temporarily serve as an airship/hospital/indoctrination center, rather than more like Uther forcefully adding new entads to her.

God damn that's insightful. I would genuinely appreciate this being canon.

I'm curious to see if / how well Joon's spirituality perks work to obfuscate his thoughts from people like Bethel and Valencia. Until the author specifies, I would argue that it's a up in the air as to who knows what in relation to Joon's mental state.

  My personal opinion though, is that Bethel would have at least been given pause if she knew of Joon's reluctance. She ate Ropey, she's loyalty 18, and she's generally compliant with Joon.

I would not be surprised if Bethel thinks something along the lines of "If he /really/ does not want to, /really/ resist, I'll stop and not mutilate him/screw him by telling others."\\
But whether or not she would be lying to herself no matter more /so/ much now for, in the end, Joon did not resist¹ (comprehensively, since the fear of bethel reacting badly/violently to the overt and forceful denial from Joon, in that situation, was not one without base).

** I'm calling it now, future Joon is the DM.

Also that scene with Bethel seems like a clear case of rape intellectually, but on some level culturally and emotionally it partially feels to me like Juniper had consented, even though I know it shouldn't, which really disturbs me. In the gender reversed scenario it would probably be considered unambiguously rape by all the readers. And I mean, I'm not a woman, but if an attractive man forced me to have sex with him, a part of me feels like I would at least try to enjoy it to some extent even if I really didn't want it, just to make it a little less awful.

It really really disturbs me that any part of me sees this as "not rape", simply because the victim is male and the perpetrator is female. It's as if american cultural mores have sunk their teeth into my mind on some disturbingly deep level. And when I think about the reason it has sunk into me on that deep level, its maybe because if I didn't let it that could hurt my own reputation. On some deep level, american culture does not consider male victims of female-perpetrated sexual violence to be possible. A part of me is terrified of being falsely accused of rape, or of unintentionally pressuring someone into having sex with me, and so I overcompensate for that with a combination of paranoia and only having sex with people I would trust with my life (or in other words no one yet) and publicly condemning male human beings who commit acts of sexual violence as monsters, but not female ones. To side with a monster causes others to see you as one. In american culture, female rapists have more power than male ones, becuase no one really believes that a woman would be a rapist. If a man gets raped by a woman, the rapist can just accuse him of raping her. The only surefire way to avoid this no matter what is to avoid sex with women, or to simply be lucky enough to not get raped. Because if a man does get raped by a woman, he has no defense, our culture nigh universally will see it as his fault at least in part and on some level.

Professor Quirrel's quote from hpmor seems relevant here:

"You should know this to be true, boy, for you have made freer to speak ill of Dumbledore than you ever dared speak ill of me. Even in your own thoughts, I wager, for instinct runs deep. You knew that it might be to your cost to mock the strong and vengeful Professor Quirrell, but that there was no cost in disrespecting the weak and harmless Dumbledore."

I thought I was better than this. The fact that any part of my mind is assigning any blame whatsoever to a victim of sexual violence, when it wouldn't be doing that if the victim and perpetrator had different sexes/genders, even after everything I've read about the mens rights movement, even though the example here is fictional and even though my mind is only doing that out of self preservation, makes me feel horrible and dirty.

Also I will note there are strong parallels to what Joon did to Maddie and what Arthur did to Bethel.

-Joon has his own /mobile base/ that he used to deploy his own /private army/ for the clean up of the town. This is going to be the most obvious to Mr Satyr as it is probably what his day job consists of.

***** Not needing to sleep isn't all that mysterious, the tattoos is just expensive. I agree with the rest though.

One thing that Satyr doesn't have the information for yet, but which could become relevant, is that Joon is a human who became a master still mage within hours if not minutes of leaving the Temple. In regards to the other magics he has, they could come up with explanations like him being a master soul mage who stopped his soul from decaying and also masked his age, or something like that. But unless he's a Renacim or Rhannu, there's no existing way for him to become so good at still magic within so short a period. That's scarier than any existing power he has, because he can gain new powers in such a short period of time. If you do some spying and find out all the magic he has available to him, will that information be relevant in a week? Maybe he gets substantially better at blood magic in that time, or he picks up velocity magic, or he's suddenly a really good gold mage. Who knows?

The obvious explanation is that he's the next Uther, but I don't think Uther ever escalated in skill so quickly. Add in that he can get a lot of entads from Uther's caches instead of needing to fight various groups for them to claim them in the first place, and his knights are extremely strong already...

He's walked away from fighting mages with their powers a lot. Restrained by a tattoo mage? Gained his power and killed him. He literally broke the last known soul mage master out of prison to kill him for power/soul monopoly. Goes into the still mage school? Tons of them die and he becomes a master.

** wow uh that third chapter

Let's speculated on that DM convo instead. That sounds easier.

It seems the DM really wants Juniper to realize that the game is, in fact, /worth the candle/. I'm not sure why he wanted to redo the conversation at the end, though.

#+begin_quote
  even if you don't think the game is, well,” he moved his hand as if to tap at the book again, then looked down. “Dammit.” He looked back up at me. “How would you feel about wiping this conversation from your mind and doing it over?”
#+end_quote

It sounds to me like his heavy-handed attempts at telling Juniper that "the game is worth the candle" are not going as he planned and he wanted to reset? But he ended up not resetting, and I don't know why that is, either.

For reference, here was Juniper's original "prayer" way back when:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't want Fenn to change because her loyalty metric increased. I want her loyalty metric, if she's going to have one, to just be a reflection of how loyal she is, not an invisible lever controlling her. I want her to be a real person, or at least as real as I am. And ... I'm hesitant to want that for everyone else in Aerb, because sometimes existence is pain, but ... if they're not going to be real, or at least as real as I am, then I want them to be real enough that I can't tell the difference. I want that for the whole of Aerb, alright? I want to poke at the seams and find out that you thought of everything. And at the end of it, I want Arthur back. That's the only way that this game is ever going to be worth the candle.“
#+end_quote

This suggests that "the game is worth the candle" means that the people in Aerb are "real" in some sense.

So I think the whole point of the conversation is that the DM is trying to get Juniper to realize that Aerb is "real". Why? I have no idea. Especially since I feel like Juniper usually acts like it is, anyway.

So in conclusion, I don't really know why the DM is saying the things he's saying. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

So first order approximation for the total would be something like 2,000 typos.

Of course, what you'd really want to do is chart it in two different ways: chapter the typos were caught in, and when the typos were caught, which I guess you might as well do if you were going back through all the typos threads anyway.

I don't primarily think of Amaryllis as a warrior, anyway. She can fight, sure, but her biggest contributions to the team (apart from her entad collection) have always been her analytical and social abilities, combined with her relentless willpower and workaholic tendencies. It would be more true to her character to show her at the head of a meeting or representing the party in negotiations or something like that.

Raven became one of the missing: she was having a daydream of a shining palace on top of a cliff, and ended up there, leaving the prime material plane behind. As it turned out, one of the other planes, Xoltle, had been brought into collision with the material plane. Anyone who daydreamed about the place on Xoltle that was co-located with the dreamer's physical location on Aerb would wind up on Xoltle, where they would be picked up by the insane hierarch who had set his sights on conquest. Uther had defeated the hierarch (naturally), then untangled the planes with star magic beyond anything anyone had seen before or since.

Nothing world ending, we don't think, though they were making an honest effort there at the end. There was discussion of the man on fire in their notebooks, and a handful of drawings.

#+begin_quote
  I wanted to say that I couldn't, that I didn't want to, that I cared about her but that it was still a bad idea for a fair number of reasons. And then I thought that we'd already gone so far, so fast, this would already need to be explained, or could be exploited by her if she really wanted to, and if I pushed her off and told her no, then if she really wanted to, she could overpower me, or kill me in a thousand gruesome ways, or just hurt me, even if I could heal back.

  And I liked it. On so many levels, I liked it, not just the purely physical, but the sense of the forbidden, the bad idea that I knew I would regret, giving in to basal impulses, the roughness and intimacy of it, the power she held over me, the fear and adrenaline, being her first, showing her what it was like ... the more it was happening, the less I was thinking, the list of pros and cons got washed away into a confusing river of emotion and sensation, all moving toward the same destination.
#+end_quote

If I'm in the GM's shoes and committed to manifesting inner demons as love interests, that dichotomy right there is the reason Bethel exists. It's not a coincidence that Bethel basically acted out Juniper's fantasy of Amaryllis coming on to him, and it's really important to remember that Juniper responded exactly as she might've hoped.

It's just that Juniper /also/ has the brand-new ability to reach unforeseen levels of doublethink, to simultaneously give strong indication of consent while quietly having a panic attack. I'm not quite willing to chalk the timing up as another diabolus ex machina, but I have a hard time faulting Bethel for not taking into account a completely novel magic being used to hide the damage she's inflicting.

(There's also a perspective issue that we as readers have an inside view of Juniper's negative thoughts, but fade to black while the other half of the dichotomy is driving. For obvious reasons, sure, but it does bias the account of what happened.)

Another poster has made a comment about black and white framing not being useful in a nuanced situation, and I agree. I'm deeply uncomfortable calling this rape for a variety of reasons, mostly boiling down to the fact that the label distorts more here than it explains. Bethel's interest is as academic as it is purile, she doesn't put much emotional weight on sexuality in general, she wants to do something nice for Juniper, and she's calling in a favor. Juniper has incredibly conflicted feelings over his psychological quirks being expanded into independent sentient beings, is struggling with a heavy weight of cultural baggage, and is trapped between the fate of billions and preserving his own sanity. Both bring plenty of damage to the table. This wasn't a crime, it was a disaster.

And maybe it's time to earn the fact that I'm posting this on an alt account. The line "I hadn't actually decided that this was something that I wanted to do, and I felt a knot of fear forming" might use a literary trope, but it rings so damn true as someone who's been in that kind of situation before, multiple times. But I'm almost automatically dismissing the explicit justification as bullshit - the physical threat is never as paralyzing as the stuff in your head. When someone you care about, who cares about you, puts you in a situation like that it's easy to feel trapped but you always have plenty of options; and while it's going to hurt someone no matter what you do the only time I've /regretted/ is when I ran.

I doubt self-psychosurgery is a substitute for time and communication, but it's a damn sight better than fear.

(And to swing the mood completely: how the fuck did the acting not get Juniper skill progress in Romance‽ Has AW just abandoned tracking that skill?)

*** All the black and white framing and strong emotions running in the thread make me wonder what verdict a jury would pass on Bethel's actions. The popular consensus seems to be that it falls under the technical definition of rape since Joon expresses his lack of consent several times and fears the threat of violence. However, Joon's internal monologue also suggests it's partly consensual and Bethel never actually threatens Joon - nor does she seem to intend to rape Joon, as she's advancing based on her reading of his arousal. It's just a complicated mess of "said no but nonverbal was projecting maybe and was partly thinking yes but meant to give a clear no if given more time to think clearly but gave up because everything was too fast and [passage]." Guilty verdict with mitigating factors? Hung jury?

We have real difficulty with the idea of saying that some rapes are not as bad, or more messy, and so on than others, and in fact not all rapes and rapists are created equally. You can, in fact, become a rapist without meaning to, and with no malice. The real world is complicated.

​

However, none of that creates any ambiguity around the fact that ignoring someones repeated no's and climbing on top of them to pin them down is 0-ambiguity rape. The whole point of the entire consent framework is that, because of how messy sex and power and peer pressure can be, when a relationship is starting people need to communicate fairly explicitly to avoid a rabbit-holes of negative experiences. So i think a jury could well debate the punishment, just like the punishment between one thrown punch and a baseball bat to the face will receive different sentences, but the conviction is the same.

I don't think it's possible for the same word to both refer to a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil][uniquely]] horrible act and something that can be committed without any mens rea.

For some people, that's foreplay.

I'm not being glib - there is a sizable fraction of the population that genuinely enjoys playing games with consent. Bright lines are highly desirable from a legal standpoint (and a moral one, to a slightly lesser degree), but it's not tenable to proscribe sexual relations that specifically. The obvious patch is to say that such exceptions can be limited to established relationships... but now we're back to some level of qualitative ambiguity.

And as far as the text has told us, Juniper can definitely get off on that kind of play. And Bethel has an unparalleled level of insight into crude biomechanics, which she uses in lieu of more detailed interpersonal skills. It's entirely likely that she thinks she's acting out his fantasies - /and she's right/. But sometimes, that's not enough. Loyalty 18 is pretty damn high, and I find it /really/ hard to believe she would have acted as she did if she got an accurate read on how Juniper was reacting.

(And while she's undoubtably being unacceptably reckless with another person's volition, I've also known a happily s&M couple that legit did not know to have a safeword after being together for 3 years. Responsibility around this stuff does /not/ come naturally.)

It clearly does, whether we want it to or not. Most laws make it pretty clear that "person A a bit less drunk than person B sleeping with them" and "dragged someone out into a back alley and tied them up" are the same exact crime. I dont even think this is abnormal, its true for most crimes - we just have ~/discourse/~ telling us otherwise, but of course that obfuscates.

And you, uh, dont need to explain to a poly switch what kind of foreplay that could be ;). Which is why I feel confident stating how capital-R rape it is - those kind of power dynamics are things you play with in /established relationships/. It doesnt matter how Joon felt, because people's feelings are a hot mess. He clearly articulated his No, multiple times, which is the bedrock of the consent framework - because we have complicated feels, we have to put power in our will to determine the start of these kinds of things. I would be confident betting that 95% of people in the bdsm scene would label this as rape for precisely that reason.

Bethel's insights are a great example of it actually - she has far higher levels of "reading someone's intent" than most humans ever could obtain, and completely botches it, due to motivated reasoning, personal biases, and with some active deception on top. It puts paid the idea that you "knew they wanted it".

Ok, shared context then! ;)

I think the core of my thesis can be summarized by the prediction that 95% is a significant overestimate even among the community that cares the most about this issue, and puts the most work into getting it right. Not out of disagreement, in so much as they would approve if the question/scenario was put to them, but in that the praxis that would have been needed for a happier ending isn't in routine use.

I think this is something a large fraction of the population gets wrong with alarming regularity. Alternative lifestyle folks /need/ stricter standards (simply because they're the ones actively experimenting with boundaries) and the mutual consent framework is definitely close to an optimal solution for real-world humans, but I'm hesitant to hold people to it universally without allowing for context. If only because it's such a potent weapon, and one that will inevitably be used on the vulnerable.

#+begin_quote
  Most laws make it pretty clear that "person A a bit less drunk than person B sleeping with them" and "dragged someone out into a back alley and tied them up" are the same exact crime.
#+end_quote

Mostly a tangent, but I don't believe that's true - it's my understanding that the level of intoxication that inhibits consent* is the level where the victim is incapacitated to the point that they physically can't make their wishes known. I blame the misconception on a mix of wishful thinking and exactly the polarizing obfuscatory language in contention.

*Legally! Morally is obviously a stricter standard! Can't stress that enough!

#+begin_quote
  Bethel's insights are a great example of it actually - she has far higher levels of "reading someone's intent" than most humans ever could obtain, and completely botches it, due to motivated reasoning, personal biases, and with some active deception on top. It puts paid the idea that you "knew they wanted it".
#+end_quote

I think a lot of the problem is that she's a house. Or rather, that she's likely never had a romantic experience in her life (and even the *thought* is a novel thing!), and that these are the clumsy first steps of an adolescent, despite (exacerbated by) all her age and power. I'm absolutely prepared to revise my assessment depending on how the next chapters go, but my model of Bethel is one where "you raped Juniper, and he didn't resist because you made him fear for his life" is a crippling nightmare scenario.

--------------

Speaking of shared context, what are your thoughts on Juniper vis-à-vis the companion harem? I broadly subscribe to the idea that the Council of Arches really /was/ designed to reflect off of his psychological quirks/issues, and that the DM doing such for a committed monogamist is a cruel move that forces a tradeoff between emotional and romantic development. Separately, I think monogamy is ultimately untenable for someone who seriously intends to achieve immortality, and that jealousy is a /disastrous/ trait in a deity. Juniper as he currently is is *not ready* for omnipotence, not in the current context at least.

***** Yet despite strong gut reactions to it, rape - particularly male rape - is ironically and sadly underreported. Victim blaming cultures, socially learned discomfort with discussing rape, patriarchal societies and masculinity demanding hush hush all contribute to the mess. You can say the same of murder, yet murder law tends to have quite a bit more variation. However there is a bigger burden of proof in intent for rape and you have two sides - like in Bethel's case.

I wouldn't say it's zero ambiguity, except in the technical sense and maybe that's what's causing the dissent. If someone says no and the alleged rapist advances anyways and the victim seems to consensually engage without expressing continued resistance, is that still rape? Is it the after-the-fact feelings of violation that determine the nature of the act? If there was an element of fearful coercion but the perpetrator was unaware of that being a factor at the time of the act, are they legally or ethically responsible for that? Lots of relevant jurisprudence in similar situations like rape in marraige or implied consent in relationships with skewed power dynamics.

I think the text is pretty clear that there's no line to draw - by Aerb law, Bethel is property, end of story. If there's any wrongdoing at all, my guess would be something like tortious negligence by Amaryllis.

  All the black and white framing and strong emotions running in the thread make me wonder what verdict a jury would pass on Bethel's actions.
#+end_quote

By Earth standards, there is very little chance of Bethel being convicted of anything as things currently stand. But if Juniper and Bethel were both determined to testify, you're looking at he-said-she-said with no physical evidence. My money's still on little chance of conviction.

Generally agreed. It's a legally inconvenient fact that rape is a crime that can occur entirely within the head of the victim. Without defensive wounds or the like there can often be zero physical evidence establishing a lack of consent, and there are strong reasons why those might not happen on both sides of the gender divide.

As per my above comment - some couples consider that a fun Friday night. By the bare facts, not enough to establish any level of wrongdoing.

These are really interesting to consider together - if a crime could be committed by one's partner withdrawing consent during the act despite saying nothing, isn't /everyone/ bringing a legal weapon to /every/ sexual encounter?

A separate thread, but if we're talking about personal violation then it strikes me that a large fraction of Bethel's personal trauma comes from the fact that she was forced to become a tool of coercion against her will. Not directly relevant to the dynamics of Chapter 163, but a slanted parallel.

This couldn't be backlash from the tattoo, because it isn't magical when it's outside the zone.

Maybe giving all those rare magical items to the constantly-threatening jealous unstable sociopath with a well-documented history of murdering... I'm going to go with "thousands"... was a bad idea. The group has terrible odds in a fight (and between burrowing and the Egress, she can disengage trivially), and they can't boot her because she'd probably be unhappy enough to raze Anglecynn.

I guess either they have to let the newly-threatening Draconic Federation fight her or Juniper can try to "soulfuck" her into some amount of sanity. Not only would the latter (doylist narrative thinking) be a reversal of her attack, it's been (watsonian) built up to with Ellio and Hyacinth, and Juniper visiting her soul during the Infinite Library sidequest.

  “A tree with flowers,” she replied as she took my hand and shook it. “Lisi,” she said. Her hand was limp and a bit cold. “Are you?” she asked.

  “Am I what?” I asked, bewildered.

** I am happy that everyone here is treating the rape seriously. As a victim of rape I was scared that it might be swept under the rug as it was for me for a decade.

When it comes to characters... To me this puts Bethel past the moral event horizon. It would take an awful lot to redeem her in my eyes.

I certainly had an extreme emotional reaction to this part. Perhaps it is not rational for me to find rape more evil than murder. That said it happened to a protagonist, making this event somewhat comparable to if Bethel had murdered a party member for fun. The excuse of 'she didn't do it to us' doesn't fly is what I'm saying.

Finally, is it right for me to judge her when her values don't line up with a regular human's? Personally I feel ignorance is no excuse, she is dangerous. Dogs don't understand they have rabies but we put them down anyway.

I wish the author the best of luck in writing about this extremely contentious topic.

1) As far as I can tell, Juniper never actually says no. He wants to say something but never does. The quotes are what he thinks to himself but never communicates.

2) Then he's presumably an active participant as he is "showing her what [sex] was like".

3) Afterwards he asks to do it again.

Have none of you ever had sex when you knew you shouldn't? Cheat, sleep with an ex, sleep with a girl who's in a relationship, even sleep someone you know you'll regret after you nut and sober up like a coworker or a fat chick.

No, it doesn't. People talk about a "fight or flight" response to danger, but the reality is that it's "fight, flight /or freeze/."

Denial of consent doesn't magically become granted consent when you don't resist hard enough. Or do you really want "I was paralyzed from terror," which is a /normal psychological response to terror/, to be considered proof that something isn't rape?

I'm saying that, due to a common, basic human reaction to trauma, "They didn't keep saying no" or "They didn't stop me from petting them" are /horrible/ ways to determine whether sex is consensual or not.

*** This is an issue of putting things in neatly labeled boxes. This is a grey area (emphasis on /grey definitely not being white/). Since we don't have a third box, people put it in the 'rape'-labeled one, not without merit.

Which is sort of amusing, I mean, we have literal soul-fuckery ongoing, but it's the fear of penile degloving is what gets people.

**** Im pretty sure the soul-fuckery gets to us too - was pretty terrifying when it was happening to the team. Its just also so far removed from anything real people experience to elicit more visceral reactions, and also not happening to characters we care about outside of self-modification, which is of course far less problematic (not saying it isnt problematic)

*** That's the beauty of literature man, your interpretation is just as valid as the people saying it was rape.

I agree with you, I felt that if Juniper wanted to, he had enough power to force her off him, even with the threat of violence she had over him. He still has prince's invulnerability and is pretty much invincible, so he could've stopped it, if he really wanted to.

He /does/ like her, and really doesn't mind having sex with her, if not for all the other "petty morality" he subscribes to, as Bethel puts it. People just like to project what they believe onto characters, and again, that's the beauty of literature. Neither interpretation is totally wrong. Nor right.

**** On a side note, as Joon mentions in the story, Bethel could kill him easily.

The issue is, people are raped every day. It can happen in many different ways, and it can involve force or it can be completely without violence. Saying that it's not rape because the victim had the physical power to get away (which again, he didn't) is just an evolution of the biblical "the woman is as guilty as the rapist if she didn't cry out for help". You're telling rape victims that, if they were aroused by the sex and didn't fight hard enough against it, then they weren't raped. This is either fucking horrible or it's born from ignorance.

All you really need to know is this.

1. Joon specifically said he didn't want to.

2.While it was happening he thought about the ways she could kill him if she was displeased.

3.After it had happened he had to hide his revulsion and thought about how he would have never said yes if she hadn't forced him.

4.He literally had to use a skill to hide his hurt and revulsion afterwards and then had to manually alter his emotions to make sure he could be calm around Bethel. Even after *that* he still reacts negatively to just seeing Bethel.

I don't mean to be too hard on you, I have no doubt that you never intended to mean anything bad. With that said, this isn't just some fictional story about hells, soul editing, or something like that. This is someone not wanting to have sex, being forced to do it while fearing for their life, and then acting exactly like a trauma victim. This happens in the real world all the time and the reasons stated in this thread as to why it's not rape are the same things those rape victims get told.

Right now, at this second, odds are that someone is being raped by someone they might consider as a partner if not for "petty morality". Right now someone is being raped and isn't fighting back for various reasons. Right now there's someone who isn't telling anyone that they were raped and just pretends that everything is fine as they continue to interact with their rapist. Don't talk about the beauty of literature when we're discussing whether or not those people should blame themselves or not.

***** Could you explain this section for me then ?

#+begin_quote
  And I liked it. On so many levels, I liked it, not just the purely physical, but the sense of the forbidden, the bad idea that I knew I would regret, giving in to basal impulses, the roughness and intimacy of it, the power she held over me, the fear and adrenaline, being her first, showing her what it was like ... the more it was happening, the less I was thinking, the list of pros and cons got washed away into a confusing river of emotion and sensation, all moving toward the same destination.
#+end_quote

And what about this passage -

#+begin_quote
  And in the thread that was thinking like her lover, or at least like a Juniper that was trying to show her love, a thought occurred, one which might have been warm and pleasant if things had been different, but one which I couldn't help but speak, even with the roiling conflict inside of me. “Would it be so bad, to do this again?”
#+end_quote

why would he say that if he was actually feeling violated and not just morally conflicted? Especially after Bethel said she didn't see herself doing it again..

****** To explain the second passage, he literally says it in the part you quoted. He used a skill to put all his thoughts of revulsion and trauma due to the rape to the side and creates a new strand that's acting like a lover. He specifically says that he's unable to just focus on the pros because they're so heavily outweighed by the reasons he didn't want to do this.

Then there's this passage

#+begin_quote
  pretending that we were lovers, that any intimacy between us hadn't been rent to shreds.
#+end_quote

and then while his isolated thought patterns are literally in a loop agonising over the traumatic experience when Bethel betrayed him and blaming himself, the other part that's (as Joon explicitly states) /pretending/ to be loving says the part you quoted.

He specifically says that one thread of his consciousness is acting, that it's not warm or pleasant due to what happened, and that he's saying it despite how sick he feels. And he says that in the part you quoted!

****** Sure, people sometimes get aroused and orgasm when they're being raped. There are countless studies, stories from rape survivors, etc. to explain why it's still rape. There's a reason why any politician or authority figure who says "people who experience pleasure during rape weren't raped" are derided and shamed by human rights activists and such.

See, it's actually very very simple. He said he didn't want to, she pushed him. He said no, she didn't stop. Right there it's already rape and nothing else that happens changes that. In certain cases it can be complicated, there was a case in Sweden where a female politician who had a military position and a position of authority in a refugee camp raped a young male refugee. He could have fought her off, he could have tried harder to say no, and he experienced sexual pleasure in the act. He never had a choice because he was terrified that his life would be destroyed if he didn't do this. That was judged to be rape and she went to prison.

I'm sorry to say this, but you're acting on a mindset regarding rape that's decades out of touch. You should do some research because, while it might not seem that way to you, you're sounding like you're about to say "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down." regarding rape and pregnancies.

Yeah, and if you had a choice between a 20% chance of death, and a 100% chance of rape, with the possibility of disassociating enough to possibly enjoy the rape, what would you choose?

I'd pick trying to like it and scrambling to take ownership of something I had no choice in. (And I did).

******* Obviously I'd pick rape over death, but that's not on the table. I reckon it's a 0% chance of death for too many reasons, and slight possibility of injury just because Bethel lied this chapter so that puts her confessions earlier in doubt.

Actually rereading the scene, it sounds more like Juniper just thinking through the possibilities rather than assigning them high confidence like I initially thought.

An explanation of why you think the handling is terrible.

If you would like the author to learn from and avoid making such (in your opinion) mistakes again then this is information you need to convey. As you can probably see from this thread, this is non-obvious, as a lot of people did not find issue with the handling. This doesn't invalidate your opinion, it just means the grounds for it aren't likely to be clear.

Telling the author 'this is bad and you should feel bad' isn't helpful and is a dick move as any (theoretical) failure on the authors part is almost certainly unintentional and not malicious.
