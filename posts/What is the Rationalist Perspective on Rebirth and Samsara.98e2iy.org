** I had a lot written, but if I'm being honest, I've rehashed this argument so many times I'm sick of it. Go to [[/r/DebateAnAtheist]], or visit [[http://www.lesswrong.com][www.lesswrong.com]] and start a thread about it, or go to [[http://www.slatestarcodex.com][www.slatestarcodex.com]] and post in the latest open thread about it. [[/r/rational]] is for discussing rational fiction, not rationalism. (for reference, the last two are rationalist and the first one is just very likely to give you a similar answer)

Is there an active subreddit for rationality discussion? There's a weekly thread here for it, so I don't think it's entirely correct to say that this sub isn't fit for that type of discussion.

**** Not really. [[/r/slatestarcodex]], maybe? I don't know if there's a subreddit for Less Wrong. I'm not saying that rational fiction isn't ostensibly about rationalism, more that meta-discussions of philosophy aren't really on-topic unless they're specifcally about fiction. At least I think. Rationalists have never been really active on reddit.

***** There's [[/r/LessWrong]], but it's fairly dead. [[/r/SlateStarCodex]] is the closest sub, but I'd recommend the slatestarcodex.com open thread instead.

** What exactly "seems shortsighted" about life not continuing after death? What actual evidence do you have to support the idea that reincarnation exists in any form?

** I think samsara is an appealing concept, for me as well as, apparently, for you. But there's no evidence for it, just feelings. The only evidence for samsara would be the unlikeliness of living this life (yours or mine) here at all. Unfortunately, that can more or less be explained by the anthropic principle...if we didn't exist, we wouldn't be here thinking how unlikely it is that we didn't exist.

A better path to go down, I think, is the negation of self. If you can internalize the idea that there is no "you," no hard line between you and everything else around you, then you've just extended your life expectancy quite a bit, because the universe isn't going anywhere for awhile. Kind of hard to stay in that mode and actually live, though.

*** There's also the consequentialist perspective: When you believe that you're conscious experience ends at death it can result in unskillful action i.e. some of my atheist friends often talk about how their gonna try hard drugs when their near the end of their life because they believe there's nothing after it's over. For Buddhists the moment of death is the most important time to be fully present and bring all your faculties to bear during the process of death to help ensure you go to a good destination. In this context which is a more skillful belief?

** You're blatantly overusing and misusing the phrase "doesn't make sense". I can't even understand what you mean by it. It seems to me that you use "doesn't make sense" for whatever doesn't aesthetically please you.

But whether that's what you mean or not, I suggest tabooing that phrase. By "doesn't make sense", what /exactly/ do you mean. What exact conditions would an AI have to check to verify whether an idea/theory/concept 'makes sense' or not?

** Doesn't "nirvana" mean something like "the blowing out of a candle"? Like, the realization of Anatta and all that, like there is no individual self/soul because All is One or something, and "reaching nirvana" is like "dissolving back into the All after you realize your sense of "you"ness is an illusion," and by becoming one with Everything you for all intents and purposes cease to exist?

** I always loved the philosophy behind Buddhism. And its emphasis on being present in the moment. The practical aspect of it that we can apply to on our lives. The ancient monks had a very insightful understanding of the human psyche.

Respectfully though, I choose to view reincarnation as more of a metaphor for the cycle of life, as matter flows from place to place to momentarily become you. I in particular liked what Stephen Batchelor had to say about the subject in his book, Buddhism without Beliefs. Even if you disagree with his views, I'm sure you'll find the perspective fascinating and better understand where agnostic Buddhists are coming from.

Jon Kabat-Zinn's Wherever You Go, There You Are will remain one of my favorites.
