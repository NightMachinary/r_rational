** Call it an "Oracle" and define exactly what you mean by the term in the text.

You're going to need to define the term anyway, no matter what you use, and "Oracle" seems to capture the "I-can-see-your-future" kind of concept.

** The one word term, assuming you were reading on Less Wrong, for this, would be Omega.

However, I would recommend avoiding using LW-specific terminology to help avoid alienating potential reads, given that it isn't really a term that exists outside of that sphere, as far as I know.

***** I've got an alternate in place. I'm looking for this one because it felt really right --- it had great affordance, you could grasp what it meant just by reading it. But no luck yet! I wish I could remember.

** [[/r/whatstheword]]

My advice: make up a term within the context of your story and explain it in exposition. Something pithy and clever to match the tone and themes.
