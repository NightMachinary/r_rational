  The pale-skinned man chewed thoughtfully.

  How the Tyrant had managed to exert pressure on Bellerophon enough they would agree to this would have to be found investigated. Such a lever was too useful to be left solely in the boy's hands.

Nominally, sure. In reality, the Tyrant will carry on doing whatever the hell he wants to do.

Cat will come into an existing name (theoretically the Black Knight, presumably something unexpected) unless she does something like burn down Heaven and Hell, or create a new Role by altering society.

He's terrifying and seems to always be winning....

But I have to believe that every dread emperor was like this, before Malicia. The name of Tyrant is designed with a definite arc and it doesn't end well for the Tyrant.

The Tyrant seems crazy and unconventional... But that's what makes him conventional. He's a flying fortress crazy emperor. He is setting up the heirarch to kill him, and his lack of longevity is making him more nihilistic, but he's not a threat the way the calamities are.

He thinks he's got the Calamities and Bard all figured out... But why should we take his word for it? Every Tyrant knows that their days are numbered by their names. This Tyrant is only different in that he was going to die any way.

I guess that's why Bard isn't worried about the Tyrant, because the Tyrant won't break the story... Rather he is the pressure release of all of the Capital E evil that Praes hasn't been doing for 20 years.

** I... need to reread this chapter. And maybe a few of the previous ones with Tyrant. I can't tell if he's crazy-sane (as in, he's totally nuts on the ground but has a clear view of the "big picture") or just completely biased like all good Tyrants seem to be. I really don't know what to make of this chapter, but it sure sounded interesting!

- *Mend* is obviously one of Hierarch's aspects, but it feels like he failed to use it when it was mentioned? I'm not even sure what kind of mending could happen, because it sounds like a very rift within the fabric of his society.

- Tyrant obviously sees at least part of Black as he truly is - the wheels and cogs. Think he sees it right about how Black incorrectly views himself, and how he'll react as the Calamities start to die?

*** The use of *Mend* seems paradoxical, though I suspect he used it inadvertently on himself. The laws were broken, and *Mend* should fix things so the laws so they are not broken AKA making Anaxares the Hierarch. However, Anaxares has to be named to use an aspect so he is already the Hierarch. What it did was allow him to accept that he was the Hierarch. Additionally, it may have caused the other ruling members to outlaw his suicide / death so that Bellerophon is whole.

Random thought, I wonder if Bellerophon is a name derived from Isabella the Mad, though it would make more sense if she was the first Hierarch and she was not. However, I could totally also see the first Hierarch picking a random crazy lady out of the crowd to be a military leader / namesake of the nation.
