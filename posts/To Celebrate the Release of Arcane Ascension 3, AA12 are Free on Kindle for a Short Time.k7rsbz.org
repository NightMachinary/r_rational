Hey, everyone!

To celebrate the Kindle launch of my third *Arcane Ascension* book, [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HKV8LPV][*The Torch that Ignites the Stars*]], my first two *Arcane Ascension* books are free on Kindle for a short time.

*You can get the free books here:*

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/][*Sufficiently Advanced Magic*]] [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D3C3RX4][*On the Shoulders of Titans*]]

Note that these are links to the US store. I know the book is free in /some/ other regions, but I don't have a full list of regional availability for the free copies. Sorry for an inconvenience if it's not available in your area!

*And the new book here:*

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HKV8LPV][*The Torch that Ignites the Stars*]]

For those of you who are not already familiar, my books are heavily inspired by Japanese gaming, drawing inspiration from series like *Final Fantasy*, *Zelda*, *Ys*, *Dragon Quest*, and *Fire Emblem*.

This series in particular mixes JRPG style magical school content with dungeon crawling. Some of the closest game comparisons would be *Trails of Cold Steel* and *Fire Emblem: Three Houses*. In terms of the dungeon crawling, think *Azure Dreams*, *Tower of Druaga*, or the first *SaGa* game, if you're familiar with those. (Or, more recently, there's some similarity to Torghast in WoW.)

*A quick blurb for the first book:*

/Five years ago, Corin Cadence's brother entered the Serpent Spire --- a colossal tower with ever-shifting rooms, traps, and monsters. Those who survive the spire's trials return home with an attunement: a mark granting the bearer magical powers. According to legend, those few who reach the top of the tower will be granted a boon by the spire's goddess./

/He never returned./

/Now, it's Corin's turn. He's headed to the top floor, on a mission to meet the goddess./

/If he can survive the trials, Corin will earn an attunement, but that won't be sufficient to survive the dangers on the upper levels. For that, he's going to need training, allies, and a lot of ingenuity./

/The journey won't be easy, but Corin won't stop until he gets his brother back./

--------------

The first two books are also available in paperback and audio formats (with the audio narration done by the amazing Nick Podehl). The audio books can be found [[https://www.audible.com/series/Arcane-Ascension-Audiobooks/B0731RZ6L7][here]].

The paperback and audio versions for Book 3 are coming soonish. Probably a few weeks for paperback and sometime earlyish next year for audio.

--------------

In terms of rational elements, this is a hard magic story with heavy magic system detail and a character that does a lot of introspection and problem solving. If you're looking for a perfect optimizer, this isn't that kind of story: rather, the protagonist is good at certain specific intellectual challenges and poor at others. (I tend to write characters with intellectual specializations, rather than just "high intelligence". More on that [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2018/12/08/writing-intelligent-characters/][here]], if you're interested.)

I get a lot of comparisons to Brandon Sanderson and Will Wight, so it's probably useful to think along those lines if you're trying to determine if you'd be interested in my works.


** For people using Amazon in Italy, it is free there too, just checked for you.

(I already bought both in may 2019 and they are really good!)

*** There's some similarity there, but this is more like a mix between something like Tower of God and a magical school story. Also, multiple towers rather than one, and the main character is very different.

Corin is much more of a nerdy wizard type than a shonen-style fighter like Bam.

**** There's been a few slow arcs but the end of Season 2 and Season 3 have been really epic in my opinion. It's become closer in spirit to a more traditional shonen over the years but the characters evolve in very natural/interesting ways and the worldbuilding is as incredible as ever.

**** Hey again, I really liked the premise and the setting of your story. Very cool to have a rogue-like dungeon that hands out magical powers. And it seems like you put a lot of thought into how adding that into a world shapes the cultures that inhabit it; the part about intergenerational occupations based on the magic received from the tower was a cool idea. And I liked the implication that a caste system arose from having those powers. I see a lot of potential in your story.

Unfortunately, the book didn't really connect with me, so I didn't finish to the end. Regardless, I wish you success and good health.

*** That's understandable - it was in a lighter and more comedic style than usual, and they weren't dealing with threats from Katashi or Mizuchi, so the situation didn't have anywhere near as much risk involved. That said, some of the things that happened in there, especially the talks with Meltlake and the contract with Emery will have long-term impacts on the story as a whole.
