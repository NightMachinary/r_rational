** Hey everyone, sorry it's been so long on a podcast episode. Recorded this before August, but was too busy with my license exam then teaching at ESPR to edit it until now. Hope you enjoy it!

(Also if this is the last you hear from me, I may have died tragically in Hurricane Irma. If so, sorry in advance for not being able to finish Pokemon)

*** Why are you at risk of dying in hurricane Irma?

**** Was sort of joking, but Category 5 Hurricanes shouldn't be underestimated. Even sitting in a somewhat sturdy condo with shutters and lots of food/water, I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm a little worried, and it would suck if I actually do die without being able to finish the story :P Particularly if none of the readers know why it happened and think it was just abandoned.

***** Facebook has an option (enabled by default) to memorialize your account if they find out that you died, so assuming that any of your Facebook friends are IRL friends, one of them would probably click some buttons to tell Facebook that you died with a link to your obituary, and then Facebook would switch your account over, which would /probably/ show up for anyone that you're Facebook friends with, which includes a number of people that frequent this subreddit and would make an announcement (I would probably be that person).

(I had this exact thing happen to me yesterday; an acquaintance from high school died and I found out through the automated systems Facebook has set up.)

***** Then, write a future plot outline and put it on release by a dead man's switch?

****** I've actually thought about that before, no time now but will probably do so at some point. Writing the future plot out will be easy enough, researching the deadman switch part will probably take some time.

******* A quick read of the Wikipedia page for dead man's switches turn up Google's [[https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546?hl=en][inactive account manager]]. Even if it's not the perfect service, it seems like a good starter pack.
