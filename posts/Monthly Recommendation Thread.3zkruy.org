Welcome to the monthly thread for recommendations. I will post this on the 5th of every month. This thread does not supersede any other recommendation thread that any other user may create of his own volition.

Please feel free to recommend, whether rational or not, any books, movies, tv shows, anime, video games, fanfiction, blog posts, podcasts or anything else that you think members of this subreddit would enjoy. Also please consider adding a few lines with the reasons for your recommendation. Self promotion is not allowed in this thread.

Something I hadn't thought about until recently, this thread is also so that you can ask for suggestions. (In the style of [[/r/books][r/books]] weekly threads)

A couple of things before we start:\\
* Are you guys against the stance of disallowing self-promotion in this thread?\\
* Should this thread be biweekly instead of monthly?


** I think self-promotion should be allowed as long as it's admitted, and monthly recommendation threads seem sufficient.

--------------

I'd be remiss if I didn't first recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984][To the Stars]]. It's an intelligent sci-fi fanfiction of Madoka Magica, which was already a serious (slightly) sci-fi take on the "Magical Girl" genre of shows. (You don't have to know anything about Madoka Magica to read it.) If you've been on this subreddit you've probably seen a chapter update posted or perhaps a link to [[/r/TotheStars]], which I help run, and which has a summary and a host of relevant links in the sidebar. If you're wondering whether or not to take the plunge, I'll say this: To the Stars has one of the best fictional universes out there. It takes a creative blend of magic and technology and builds a deep world out of their interplay. The details are thought through and there's a wealth of forces and powerful actors working hard to reshape the world anew. The only downside is that when you come out the other end deeply invested in the characters and story you'll have to wait patiently for updates as To the Stars is still ongoing. That said... just do it!

The second thing I'd like to recommend is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4121383/chapters/9290023]["The Trial of Darth Vader"]], which follows an alternate universe where Darth Vader survives his apparent redemption and is brought back as a prisoner to the Rebel Alliance by Luke. It's a pretty thoughtful take on both the ethical questions surrounding a man like Darth Vader and the difficulty the remains of the Empire and the Rebels would have in attempting to answer them. It's technically incomplete, but there's only one more chapter to go and it updates fairly frequently.

Edit: Last chapter was just posted.

*** I'm about to dive into The Trail of Darth Vader now. A theme I see far to often in redemption of evil characters is that after they are saved they die. The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath][Redemption Equals Death]] trope always felt like an easy way out from a story telling perspective. Not having to address the what to do with someone who has committed atrocities but is truly and fully redeemed, or whether someone like that can ever be truly and fully redeemed.

(See also /[[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29966][The Shape of Things to Come]]/.)

[[/r/NarutoFanfiction][r/NarutoFanfiction]] recently gained [[https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/wiki/index][a recommendation wiki]] in the style of TV Tropes. So far, no one other than me (aside from the moderators) has bothered to edit it (it's a very small subreddit...), so two-thirds of the current entries were added by me.

My most-played video game (according to Steam), at over one thousand hours, is /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/236850][Europa Universalis IV]]/ (see also [[/r/EU4][r/EU4]]), a "grand-strategy" game that allows the player to control any country in the world (not just in Europe, despite the name) between about 1400 and 1800. Like the other games developed by [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/720][the same company]] (see also [[/r/ParadoxPlaza][r/ParadoxPlaza]]), EU4 is /extremely/ mod-friendly--most files are in plain text--and there are many complex modifications that improve the historical accuracy of the somewhat-simplistic base game, from [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=180557557][Dei Gratia]] (/inter alia/, adds simulation of religious minorities in every province and drastically overhauls the Protestant Reformation) to [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434940442][Lex Talionis II]] (primarily, adds simulation of dynastic politics in every country) to [[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234109254][MEIOU & Taxes]] (a massive compilation that includes Dei Gratia and many other items). The game is somewhat expensive when [[http://www.eu4wiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions][the full list of more-or-less-indispensable expansions]] is considered, but all except the most recent one go on sale with reasonable regularity.

All recs are given equal space / weight and none ever get deleted even if only one person thinks the recommendation makes sense.

I don't have anything new that I didn't mention at some other point before now, but has anyone else here read books by Tom Holt? He's a new author that I'm interested in who's often compared to Terry Pratchett, but I'm worried that his books are full of "because PLOT!" which seems to be slightly implied from the summaries and reviews I read.

So has anyone else read them and is there any railroading?

EDIt: I almost forgot, I did have a new book to suggest. [[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_A_Succession_of_Bad_Days?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ][A Succession of Bad Days]] by Graydon Saunders. It's a really interesting book about how a world could look with a lot of horrific magical abominations, eldritch creatures from the beyond, and power mad wizards wandering around. It's a very grim setting but the book is focused on a group of late-blooming wizard-students are attempting to figure out a better way to do things and to help everyone without wizardly protection, rather than merely focusing on protesting only people in their in-group. [[http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1327901980?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1][Here's]] a review which better explains why the book is so interesting better than I can.

It's a rather obscure book, since I literally cannot find it anywhere other then on Google Play which also has a $2 off sale right now. I should also warn that it's a rather dense book and he covers a lot very quickly.

It's actually the second in a series, but they are both self-contained stories set in the same setting and I haven't read the first one yet. [[https://play.google.com/store/books/author?id=Graydon+Saunders][Here's]] a list of books by Graydon Saunders.

I recommend just starting with the one where the summary is more interesting to you.

If it helps, the themes in March is about magical military and Succession is about learning magic and growing up into something hopefully vaguely human.

** I've recently read [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/5170/Project%3A-Sunflower][Project: Sunflower]]. It's an MLP "human in Equestria" story, and I think it fits "rational" criteria reasonably well. It's not rationalist, though. The protagonist is nominally a scientist, but the scientific exploration doesn't come up too much (almost not at all). Transhumanistic implications of nanotechnology are acqnowledged, but not dwelled upon. There's no universe-breaking munchkining. There is greater conflict, but the focus of the story, really, is more on the "slice of life", interactions between humans and ponies. But anyway, if you're interested in a reasonably sane "human in Equestria" story, I think you may like this one. Also there's an incomplete sequel which I haven't read (for the reason that it's incomplete, I'll wait until it's done), and which may or may not explore transhumanism and scientific exploration of Equestria more.

There's also another sane "human in Equestria" story I found in the comments here some time ago, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in][Celestia Sleeps In]]. This one has a distinction that the author seems to take research seriously almost to a ridiculous degree, and described the first contact in detail (in /Project: Sunflower/ Aliens Speak English).

** I'm sort of a rationalist fiction newbie and feel like I'm running out of things to read, so I'd love some recommendations! I've read most of the recommendations on the community wiki, with *Mother of Learning*, *Pokemon: The Origin of Species*, and *HPMOR* being my favorites. I was hoping to get some insight on what to read next of the few I haven't read:

- *Branches on the Tree of Time* (I have no interest in Terminator stuff and only saw the first two movies; still worth it?)

- *Shadows of the Limelight* (Looks interesting, but I haven't seen it pitched here much)

- *Ra* (Started reading this long before I found this sub, lost my place after the first couple of chapters and never went back)

- *Weaver Nine* (Read *Worm* a year or two ago, don't recall all the details; do I need to reread it before tackling this?)

For recommendations, I really enjoyed a manga called *Tales of Demons and Gods*. You can find it on [[http://www.mangahere.co/manga/tales_of_demons_and_gods/][mangahere.co]]. I believe it's Chinese manhua, not actually manga; anyway, only 52 chapters are translated but it's based off a light novel series so there's plenty more to draw from. It reminds me of Mother of Learning or Mushoku Tensei in that it involves a young kid being wise beyond his years due to inheriting memories of his past life.

Basic synopsis: a demon spiritualist is sent back in time to his 13-year old self and vows to right all sorts of wrongs - especially the destruction of his city and the death of his lover.

I don't think it's necessarily rationalist fiction, but the MC is more rational than most - to the point where he borders on being OP, which some may not like.

And I started reading *Set in Stone*, which you can find [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][here]]. It's very good, but I set it down a few weeks ago and haven't gone back (I think I'm on chapter 9). It's best described as "stonepunk," I believe; it's set in the future but on a world where there's hardly any metal and human development is overseen by an AI that keeps humanity from being violent or advancing too far technologically.

/Edit:/ For the questions, I'm fine with self-promotion as long as the promoters are fine with criticism. Not from me, but I'm sure some folks will pick at them. And I think monthly is better than bi-weekly; most stories don't seem to update all that often, so once a month seems plenty.

** I tend to like stories that make me laugh and make me think. Here are a couple recs that met that criteria.

1. I think I stumbled upon this on SV somewhere; also it is mentioned in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2u0xw4/open_fanfiction_thread/][Open Fanfiction Thread]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]]. Great character arc for Hermione as she learns social skills in Slytherin, which makes you think about how social dominance can be a force for good or bad. Also liked that it makes Neville a main character. (Currently on chapter 8, as I just started it yesterday.)

2. [[http://www.amazon.com/Fimbulwinter-Daniel-Black-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00KZ41LHM][Daniel Black Book 1: Fumbulwinter]]. This one costs money, but you can read the first six chapters [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3198066/1/Fimbulwinter][here]]. YMMV/TW/etc, has some author tract elements with a neoreactionary flavor and contains a certain amount of BDSM as well as other sex scenes (all consensual). It is by the same author as Time Braid, and the character becomes similarly overpowered compared to those around him. My biggest complaint with this one is that the main character seems really slow on the uptake about how to exploit his powers, and the magic system comes across a little too exploitable. But he does do some smart things, the worldbuilding is interesting (if a tad exploitable), and it's entertaining enough that I ended up buying all three of the books.
