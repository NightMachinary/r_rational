** As I know a few of us here try our hand at writing from time to time, I wanted to share this podcast. It's short and pretty dense. Part handy information, and part inspiration/motivation. I generally want to go and write whenever I'm done listening to an episode. It's hosted by Brandon Sanderson, author of the Mistborn trilogy (among a number of others).

** Definitely a good podcast (and handy for me on the rather long drives I have to make semi-often; there's just so much there!). Brandon Sanderson has three laws of magic, the first of which you can find [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][here]] (and he first originated them in the podcast), that I find very helpful when creating a magic system.

*** An entire semester's worth of his ectures (a creative writing course from a few years ago) are available online for free, as well. They're pretty useful.

** I only subscribed to this podcast a month ago and I missed out on seasons 1-8.

Unlike the HPMOR podcast, which carefully and lovingly includes the whole stream, it looks like Writing Excuses may be hidden behind a pay wall for older seasons.

Is it worth it to purchase the old seasons on CD?

*** To be honest I've only been listening for the past month or so myself. I haven't heard the previous seasons so I can't say.
