In [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2i6iz1/rt_will_you_help_fund_a_commissioned_horror_story/][this thread]] I asked if people would help fund a Kickstarter for a horror story that [[/u/Timewinders]] would like to commission. I'm putting that Kickstarter together now, and would like to take a quick survey.

- What rewards would you like to see? Here are the ones I've thought of; are they of interest?\\

  - Receive a by-name thank you on the Kickstarter page
  - Receive a by-name thank you at the end of the story itself
  - Get input on the plot before I start writing. I would maintain final veto on plot points, but I would work with you to come up with something that could fit
  - Get access to early drafts so that you can call out problems / suggest solutions and thereby help shape the plot after I start writing. (Again, I would maintain final veto.)
  - Have one of the characters named after you

- Can you think of any other rewards you would like to have?
- The success of a Kickstarter is largely determined in the first 48 hours, and one of the most important factors is the number of backers. Would you be willing to precommit to giving during that time, even if only a dollar?
- If I provide you with a simple and not-obnoxious banner, would you be willing to display it on your Facebook page?
- If you have a publication or a podcast, would you be willing to do a piece on the story? I could provide appropriate questions for a Q&A, and would be happy to write up article text for you to use.
- If you are artistic, would you be willing to donate some art? Specifically, I would like to produce:

  - Banners for advertising the Kickstarter
  - Artwork of the characters and / or the events in the story, to be used as rewards for donors

In case I hadn't mentioned it -- I intend to do more Kickstarters for my writing in the future, so I am considering this one a testing ground for those that will follow.


** The way I see it, the more time you spend on rewards the less time that you're spending doing the writing. I'd be more concerned about getting a good high-quality finish product than any of the other things.

I'll back it in the first 24 hours once you put it up, and I wish you luck.

** The biggest reward I'd enjoy seeing is having yourself in the story, even if it's just a one off mention about how horrible your death was.

Early drafts is pretty high up there in terms of priorities too. It's fun having a somewhat regular story to read and critique.

It'd be good to have a few exceptionally high rewards in case anyone powerful and rich drops in. 100 dollar ones and such. Say, the chance to design a monster within the story, the chance to design a character that plays a major role, the chance to help design a death scene.

I would be willing to precommit to boost your ranking and get a good story.

I don't use facebook.

I am not artistic.

Ah, I could do that. Thanks for the idea.

Note that this particular one is going to be a long short story -- something on the order of 5000-8000 words. (Which is roughly on the order of 20 pages.)

Good, I'll add that to the list.

  it would need to be implemented in a way so that there aren't too many mismatched ideas from different people there.
#+end_quote

Simplest solution is to only have one or two rewards available at this level. That way if people want it, they need to pony up quickly.

Also, as mentioned, I get final veto. If what you want is "and then clowns come parachuting in!"...well, no. But I'll talk with you and say "ok, maybe the clowns just walk in? And they're psycho clowns, with knives...and..." until we figure something out.

  I wouldn't want to spoil the experience by reading an early draft, but I would be interested in seeing a late-stage draft before you publish. That might limit the extent of changes you could make, but I'm fine with that. I'm not particularly interested in any of the other rewards.
#+end_quote

Ok, good to know. Thanks.

#+begin_quote
  I will back it within the first 48 hours.

You rock. :)
