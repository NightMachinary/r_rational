**** I'm not in love with Jaune's semblance but you've claimed there's more to it than meets the eye so I'll withhold judgement for now. I do really like Yangs terrible puns and as long as they don't get used too frequently I think they'll continue to be really funny.

***** Yeah, Jaune's semblance is sort of boring for now -- it was originally way more obvious why it was how it was now but a beta nixed some details about initiation. It'll get more interesting as time goes on.

** Just dropping in to say that I'm really liking this so far and to keep it coming :) I love the depth of RWBY, and the way you bring bits out could prove to make a really interesting story. Plus 1 from me :)
