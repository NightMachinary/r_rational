** Self-modifying AI, which seems very topical for this subreddit since it has strong ties to lesswrong and co.

For whomever doesn't know it, STP is a rational webcomic about superheroes/superpowered beings

**** Well, I don't know if LW-relevant but certainly very relevant to this subreddit! I agreed wholeheartedly with it being posted here already

*** I read the whole archive.

I'm rooting for Patrick. Why is he not the protagonist? He seems like he has a better chance of fixing things than anyone else.

The fact that some group managed to [[#s][spoiler]] is utterly terrifying, and why is this not the absolute priority of frigging everyone who knows it to deal with? The fact that it was organized so efficiently and actually hit all or most of them implies [[#s][spoiler]]

And if they missed any, finding them is the most important thing possible.

**** I think that 'everyone who knows it' consists of Patrick, Allison, and maybe a couple other people. And Allison can't do much about it as-is.

That's part of the reason why he's not the protagonist. Alison makes a better viewpoint character, and while she does have superpowers the story isn't about battling supervillains.

** Finished it. Really good. Nice to have some fiction here exploring these themes without the crutch of supersmart characters who are already on board with utilitarianism as brought to its logical conclusions.
