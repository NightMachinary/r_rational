It begins with the Hero splitting from his party to go kill the Demon King, to his surprise the Demon King is not looking for a fight and infact is fairly sympathetic to his ideals and gives a whole long presentation on the socioeconomic causes and effects of the war then asks for his help in a plan to seek a clean and peaceable end to the war.

It's all very well done with parallels to actual historic revolutions and events. I particularly like how despite the fact that the Hero can level mountains or slay armies singlehandedly it barely ever comes up and the Hero actually feels quite powerless at times since those powers are inherently destructive and the motivations of the story are primarily constructive.


** Apparently it also has an [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/14833/Maoyuu_Maou_Yuusha][anime adaptation]].

Reading the summary of that, it sounds fascist. The demon king thinks war is better for the economy and unity, so they fight an unnecessary war. Does it get better?

*** Back then, it was the first and only anime I live blogged. [[https://nerditis.com/tag/maoyuu-maou-yuusha/][I did not enjoy the experience]].

As a person who is thus most qualified talking about it, I'll say, I don't think it's fascist; it's less "oh, I will plan keep fighting this war because economy" and more "our two sides have been locked into this war for centuries, so if we want to phase them out, it has to be gradual". That seems sensible, because obviously if the new Great Demon King just came out and said "stop all fighting, the humans are now our friends!" after war had been the state of things for so long, she'd just be dethroned and replaced with the most bloodthirsty Infernal Warlord who can put his grubby claws on the throne.

However where the anime fails to me is in that it just has very bland economic notions, doesn't do much with its premise, and most heinous sin of all, it's boring as fuck.

***** Is it? I think it's a pretty low bar, TBH. We try the first episodes of everything, every season; three crotch/boob/naked shots before it's done anything interesting plotwise and it's out (opening doesn't count, or we'd never watch anything); otherwise, it has 5-10 minutes or so to grab someone's interest before we move on (usually 4-5 of us around with fairly diverse tastes). Very occasionally, the heuristic fails and we miss something that later turns out to have actually been good (e.g. School-Live), but generally we end up following 3-4 shows a season, which is pretty manageable, after feeling like we've drunk from the firehose and given even all the "my little sister" etc shows a fair chance not to eliminate themselves.

****** I mean, I understand your perspective here. I'm simply pointing out that fanservice, be it maximal fanservice a la a standard ecchi show or minimal fanservice for something grim dark like Youjo Sensen, isn't something I personally would consider a useful barometer for quality.

If lots of fanservice is something that makes you drop a work despite other things being present that you might enjoy, that's fair enough, and definitely a good barometer in that case. Everyone has things that make them hard-drop a show or story. Otherwise, the amount of T&A isn't really all that important.

*** Yes, I guess with how it puts it it implies that it's an aggressor/defender scenario and that the Demon King has the power to simply surrender or call a truce but it does have more than that, it notes that if she just surrendered or was killed she'd get replaced and that the central nations view it as a holy war and wouldn't accept a surrender anyway. I guess it is still sorta fascist with only a few people being let in on the full story and allowed to help with planning, on the other hand most of what they do is above board, even if all their motivations are not.

** I like kingdom building stories in general, but teaching Middle Ages tech level societies crop rotation when they should've known it already always triggers me.

Release that Witch (CN) and A Hero's War (English) also has pretty good kingdom building elements.

**** Depends on the universe, really. Most fantasy stories with Heroes and Demons etc. (especially Japanese ones like the OP) are mostly stuck in the Middle Ages in terms of tech, with magic tacked on. Japanese fantasy writers are often inspired by the Dragon Quest video game series, after all.

The three-field system was already invented in the time of Charlemagne (742-814) and most farmers are aware farmland should be left to "rest" once in a while in the two-field system invented thousands of years earlier. Only really isolated villages, nomads and tiny islanders with no agricultural experiences would be unfamiliar with the most basic crop rotation technique like the two-field system.

**** I've re-read a little and the four-field crop rotation system is indeed more advanced than typical of the medieval era, which in real life birthed the Agricultural Revolution.

I think I've mixed up my series a bit, so thank you for the correction. I like that they even talk about nitrogen fixation with the dead fish as fertiliser thing.

*** I read a fair bit of Release That Witch, but I think I was a bit spoiled by having read A Hero's War first. RtW seems to make things too easy. Projects get finished with improbably optimistic timelines and very few setbacks, everyone is constantly astounded by how the kingdom they're building is better than everywhere else in every way, etc. A Hero's War felt more like it earned its successes.

Yeah, that's my impression as well. A Hero's War has actual failures to make the successes all the sweeter, but Release that Witch coasts on a tide of small successes that makes the plot a bit dull.

But that updating schedule...heaven and earth.

** I followed it in the past. After some time, it turned bland. At the beginning, I was excited with introduction of potato: how one crop can virtually solved food shortage. But with printing press following that, I felt unsatisfied. It's the same. The demon king acted as dispenser of new tech and not much else. Without greed, spite, or any base motive that drive her (or any good guys) acted big, the story just doesn't have grip.

Add to the mix antagonistic church that lacked higher motive, three-way romance of little consequences, poorly designed demon race, and unsophisticated quips between demon lord, her maid, and two hired girl maid, I quickly lost interest.

It /might/ have traits of rational fiction, but imo, it's a kingdom building story heavily muddled with un-thoughtful plot element.
