** There's a reason [[/r/AskReddit][r/AskReddit]] has a dedicated [Serious] flair. With ordinary questions, the intent is purely to entertain. Even the most creative answer to that question wouldn't be as widely appreciated in terms of enjoyment value as humour. I don't think any of them, if they got that power, would choose to attend sales pitches, or go to work as a pharmacist. They're not being irrational, they're being funny, because the point with the question isn't solely to munchkin.

** To be fair, the question was "how do you use it to get rich," not "how do you use it to improve the world." Using it as a lie detector has limited wealth-generation power because you have to be physically present. I guess you could rent yourself out to the FBI or whoever and get them to pay you a salary that's greater than whatever you make paying someone $10/lie to lie to you all day, but that process would take a long time, during which you could have been racking up the Benjamins.

EDIT: Also, exposing yourself to an alphabet-soup org for cash is probably a bad idea in the first place. It's highly unlikely they'd just let you walk around free once they realize you're a perfect lie detector.

** Because using it to shift through every single thing anyone says to you is too much time and energy for something that might not be that big a deal. Sure if you suspect your SO is cheating on you then it might occur to you to use it as a lie detector. But 90% of the time this is basically a passive source of free money with minimal effort, so it makes sense to sit back and let it do its job.

** does the lie have to be understood?

If not, have someone rig up a speaker and make a computer lie to you at extreme speeds to get some cash

​

can it predict the future?

this horse will win the race etc...

​

can it handle universal truth?

use it for research. "string theory is a more accurate description of reality than relativity..."

** Ways to make money as a perfect lie detector... maybe high stakes poker? Be a chatty kathy and get them to tip their hand?

** The prompt as written doesn't work the way you're assuming it does. Being wrong isn't a lie. "Solve P=NP" is not a possible application of this.
