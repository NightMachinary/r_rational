  I tend to avoid fanfiction unless I know the genre, and I don't read Harry Potter fanfiction (HPMOR was an exception, and I don't intend to read HPMOR fanfiction).

Like, I've at least /looked at/ all the other HpMOR fanficscs and I think I've got something differennt goiing on...]\

*** I don't really care about completing stories was the point I was illustrating. I decided to save the remaining chapters for an extremely bored day. I didn't drop HPMOR so much as kept it aside. HPMOR is still one of my best stories.

I'll look at the fic you linked.

**** Hey man I was drunk last night and I wasn't thinking correctly, crap, it's been six hours, do NOT look at the fic I linked. I mean, I really hope you'd have enough sense to read the notes at the beginning of the chapter, specifically "*you're gonna have the entire ending of HPMOR spoiled if you try to read HPIO first*."

I mean, Jesus Effing Heck, all the spoilers in that story are centered around /exactly/ the part of HPMOR that you haven't read yet.

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break them All]] is almost precisely what you described, with the exception that it is not all that long yet. it is a prequel to some other story which I haven't bothered to look at, but this one stands entirely on its own.

  I liked The Metropolitan Man...90% of Metropolitan man
#+end_quote

Oh god, you have no idea whether you like The Metropolitan Man or not. You liked the first 90%, but that's a different question entirely.

Read to 98% at least, the Finale chapters are very important. In fact, I'll recommend just the two Finale chapters to you. It meets every criteria except "long", and a slightly-faded memory from the reading the other chapters earlier should be sufficient for background info.

*** Well, I'll finish it I guess, but it's short. ._.\\
I guess I'll pick it up when I have little time on my hands.\\
 \\
The point I was trying to make is that I don't care about finishing stories, and don't need to finish them to enjoy them. I don't need that completion to the story to like it.
