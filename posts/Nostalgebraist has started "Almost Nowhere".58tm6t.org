[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8341348/chapters/19108573][Almost Nowhere]] is a story by Nostalgebraist. This author previously wrote both [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2372021/chapters/5238359][Floornight]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]] which [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pyud7/dc_nostalgebraists_the_northern_caves_is_now/][we discussed]] some time [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hrilt/rt_floornight_a_ngeinspired_original_fiction_with/][previously]].

Nostalgebraist's previous works have not been 'rational' if that matters to you, but they /do/ encompass a lot of themes and topics that are probably of interest to the LW/SSC/Rational/etc sphere. Floornight has the more spectacular ideas, while The Northern Caves is one of the more interestingly written and styled things I've read. With only 5k words so far, it's hard to say anything definitive about Almost Nowhere, but I'm definitely going to keep an eye on it.


** I mostly just desperately want more Northern Caves, or more stories like Northern Caves, or anything vaguely related to Northern Caves, but at the same time I've accepted that this wish will never be fulfilled.

This new story seems promising enough, although in a very different way. Sadly, it kind of looks like the update schedule will be less than great and it might ruin the reading experience. Ideally, I'd make myself forget about it until it's finished, but I won't have enough willpower for that.

Prediction: the title means that something is going to have measure zero. Possibly related to Cordelia becoming "skeletal"?

** Thanks for the heads up, I liked Northern Caves a lot, and now Floornight has me hooked. With that establishing a pattern, I'm looking forward to getting to Almost Nowhere in due time.
