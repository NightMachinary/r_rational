[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6fxuzy/biweekly_challenge_gods/][Last time,]] the prompt was "Gods", and our winner was [[/u/syncope_apocope]], with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6fxuzy/biweekly_challenge_gods/dipu19u/][their story, "The Voices of the Gods"]]. Go read it now, and [[/u/syncope_apocope]], congratulations on your win!

Next time, the challenge is *Barrier Maiden*. Your prompt is, "The girl is alone, holdling back the darkness. She's too young to die ..." Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, July 5th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge is *Quantum Suicide and Immortality*. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality][See the wikipedia page]] if you have no idea what that is or need a refresher. Strict adherence to actual quantum physics is welcome but not expected, so long as the stories rules are consistent. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 7/5.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6iqzof/challenge_companion_barrier_maiden/][can be found here]].
