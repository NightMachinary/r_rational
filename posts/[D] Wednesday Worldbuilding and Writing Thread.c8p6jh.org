Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Mine is a writing question. I am working on a web serial that is still a ways away from being ready...but when it is, I am hoping to submit it for "rational review" so to speak.

Is it acceptable to post it here a single time to ask for opinions on if it should have a "rational" tag on it? Alternately, is there any kind if writing review group that checks out works for that purpose?

Ive worked fairly hard at making it a rational story, but I dont want to just declare it a success at achieving that without any input.

*** Pretend it's rational, post it here every time you update as if it is, and if people complain that it's not rational then it's not rational.

If you've worked hard on it, it's probably rational enough that people here will like it. And I've definitely seen people whine in the comments section when a posted story isn't sufficiently rational.

** The setting of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200][/The Unincorporated Man/]]: At birth, every person is "incorporated"---divided into shares (which grant voting power over the person's major decisions and a portion of the person's earnings) and put on the market.* Automatically, each parent gets 20 % and the government gets 5 %. (Usually, a parent refrains from selling stock in his child, and wills such stock to the child upon death.) Primary+secondary education typically costs 10--15 % of the student's shares, and college 5--10 %,** leaving the graduate with self-ownership of 30--40 %. In order to prevent situations where a person owns so little of his own stock that his cost of living exceeds his retained earnings (forcing him to rely on shareholders for room and board, and making him effectively a slave), minimum self-ownership is set by law at 25 %. (If that sounds low to you, remember that the story is set 300 years in the future and the productivity-to-cost-of-living ratio has risen dramatically.)

I wouldn't recommend bothering to read the book,*** but I do think that the setting is interesting. Does it have any glaring holes? What if there were no 25-% minimum on self-ownership, and every person started out completely owned by his parents (or a 45-45-10 split between parents and government)? Would something like this system (e. g., everyone carries around an officially-stamped share-book, and every town and village has a registered share-stamper) work in a lower-tech setting (with or without magic)? (E. g., new law: Once per year, the king must provide proof that he owns a majority stake in himself. If he fails to provide such proof, he must immediately abdicate.)

*If this sounds completely implausible to you: The book opens with a 1962 Milton Friedman quote that suggests a system where people could pay for college by pledging a percentage of their future earnings.

**You can get a lower rate for college if you've been working toward a particular career path through high school. A person who doesn't know what major he wants to pick and who took random courses in high school with no particular goal will be a riskier bet and therefore will have to pay more.

***Summary: The titular person, a 300-year-old human popsicle from the 21st century, is revived, is outraged by the proliferation of what he sees as slavery, and starts a crusade to wipe it out.

*** The logistics of holding a vote on someone's decisions escape me here.

â€‹

If I am trying to buy a couch am I suppsoed to call a shareholder meeting to vote on the matter?

Then, don't all my shareholders have to call their own meetings to decide how they're going to vote on my couch purchase?

â€‹

How does anything actually get done with that cascading series of votes?

**** I actually read most of this book! (not OP)

But in general each person is considered their own CEO. Meaning they effectively make all decisions about their life, and must report to their shareholders with a monthly earnings report and justify it, and so on. Life decisions might be put to shareholders, but not smaller stuff like buying food and furniture.

Also the couch would probably come out of their personal stock dividends (the 25%), unless they could justify it as a "business" expense. For example as a software engineer I might be able to justify buying a top of the line computer with my (pre-dividend earnings) revenue (or like with the IRS, claim that it will be used 60% for business and 40% for personal use and split it 60% revenue, and 40% personal dividend).

Shareholders don't have to be consulted everytime. But they do have certain rights, like requiring a psychological investigation of the person's behavior. And I think at one point, a character (as a shareholder) even forces another character (the person whose shares are held) to undergo some sort of brain re-wiring procedure.

***** I don't see every citizen compiling a monthly earnings report as a sustainable system. While it's less egregious than calling shareholder meetings at decision time, it's still a major increase in the accounting burden of the general public and aggregated across a whole society adds up to a lot of wasted labor.

It'd be like filling tax returns with an employee self evaluation attached every month. And presumably there are legal consequences to getting it wrong. There's also the issue that these reports are either public, or you have to track the ever shifting set of people who own your shares to send the report to them (again with legal consequences if you mess up).

And that's not even getting into the issues related to making schools into major stakeholders requiring them to have people to manage those stakes, or the conflict of interest between governments owning shares in citizens who vote on government matters.

****** I mean I assume a lot of that is solved with computers, and I think it's more likely to be quarterly or yearly. And I would point out that people are expected to file quarterly earnings reports (or yearly if you don't make enough money) with the government already.

But I do agree with your points to an extent, I just don't think it makes it totally unworkable.

******* It might be solvable in that the system can technically function, but it's still a huge broken window fallacy.

I'd possibly be less critical of it if there seemed to be any kind of point to it (what problem did the people who devised this think they were solving?) but even with clarifications and assuming a competent implementation this seems like it's just straw-manning Corporate America as slavery with more steps. (which while fun doesn't seem like a valid basis for a system of government).

******** I mean considering it's meant to be a parody of libertarianism (not corporate America), and specifically anarcho-capitalism (and how corporations can also have the same problems as governments, like slavery), I'm not sure you are understanding it correctly. (this is made clearer by the inclusion of things like cryptocurrencies and smart contracts before bitcoin was well known, and also the behavior of the main character when it comes to precious metals)

It solves taxation by rephrasing it as a 5% flat tax post earnings. It takes corporate person hood to the literal extreme (there is no legal difference between a corporation and a person now). It solves education and other long term investment in people's futures without the need for a government. It uses /the best economic system ever/ the free market to solve all problems.

I don't agree with those positions, but they are the core problems with anarcho capitalism, and this was a system designed to solve them.

Consider a variation on this:

Suppose the cost you pay for college is a percentage* of the change in your future earnings that are caused by attending the college.

*Or some other function. The tax rate isn't flat, and this function might not be the same percentage for everyone, perhaps depending on factors like people's sense of fairness, and details of economics.

**** The book doesn't really go into the details---but I think you're overlooking the existence of [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097][rules]] that govern shareholder voting.

Even IRL, [[https://www.hutchlaw.com/library/the-basics-of-corporate-governance][not every decision requires shareholder approval]]. The +CEO+ incorporated person has leeway to do /some/ things, but what those things /are/ depends on what the shareholders have agreed to. Maybe /some/ shareholders want to pass judgment on your every little action before you take that action, but most are content to check on you intermittently, look back on the past few days/weeks/months of your behavior, and take corrective measures accordingly. Maybe they'll pass a rule stating that a shareholder meeting must be called before any purchase that exceeds one percent of your annual gross income and before any unusual action that poses a large risk of impairing your future earning potential by at least ten percent (worded more precisely than that, of course). (And, really, how often will you be buying a couch?)

Likewise, to me it seems overwhelmingly likely that the larger shareholders will push through a rule mandating that no shareholder under a certain threshold (1 %, 0.1 %, or whatever) need be consulted for a vote. (Small shareholders might still be counted toward the quorum, though.)

Under such a system, cascading votes probably wouldn't be a problem too often.

***** I still think this becomes an unworkable mess fast unless basically everyone is juts ignoring the whole system.

For example, instead of filing a tax return to the government annually you need to file that earnings report with every shareholder you have. That includes the government, your old schools, and parents, but also anyone who's happened to buy a share you sold in the past, which means you need to keep track of those sales. So any time a mutual fund buys a share from another mutual fund you need to be notified and keep up with your own records.

Then there's the meetings themselves. Institutions like schools now have to have investment boards that brief representatives who attend the shareholder meetings of former students, or decide when to sell shares in former students.

And remember this has to be done not only by Mr.Colledge educated investment banker, but also by Cletus the slack jawed yokel, who's shares were sold down to the minimum legal self ownership level by Dureen the neglectful mother to buy cigarettes meaning he has a lot of shareholders to track and notify.

As anything other than a make-work program fro accountants, I don't see this being successful.

Some other failure points:

1. Unless it's specifically outlawed expect every employer to require you to sign over a share or two when you are hired, because it's easy money and if they all do it you can't really say no.

2. Governments will get into all the shenanigans that wallstreet does (sub prime citizen backed securities anyone?) but there's even less accountability between soverign powers than there is between banks.

3. The drama surrounding any combination of choices regarding how marriage interacts with this system.

Again, you have to remember that /the shareholders/ decide on how much information they want to see. Shareholders don't want to have their time wasted with zillions of reports and meetings about penny-stock people any more than the penny-stock people do. If the shareholders want to switch from monthly, highly-detailed reports that are sent to every shareholder to yearly, less-detailed reports that are sent only to larger shareholders, they can do so.

I don't see how that's a "failure point".

The government's constitution specifically forbids it from owning any more or any less of any person than the five percent that it received at that person's birth, so it can't buy or sell any shares in people.

#+begin_quote
  The drama surrounding any combination of choices regarding how marriage interacts with this system.
#+end_quote

Mention is made of a "traditional exchange of stock" (the amount is unspecified) before marriage, as well as of marriages between more than two people, but no details are given of marriage or of divorce. In any event, I don't see why it would have to be worse than the current system.

*** I saw this on the shelf at the bookstore once... thought it looked cool, but never saw it again (i wasnt going to pay hardcover prices).

the premise is fairly similar to the old company store model in some ways, a rigged game where everyone loses except for a wealthy few in charge. setting-wise, enforcement of the law matters more than details of the law. how do you deal with the rebels that fight against the system? thats where the real story is.
