** First time reading it and it was great!

The biggest surprise is that the author also cowrote the Expanse. This is good writing, but I remember not being able to make it through the first book.

** One thing about it that strikes me as non-rational is that the third problem was only difficult because Lord Iron asked the question in a confusing way. If instead of asking for the price of a soul he asked how to not go to hell, the Cambist could have answered immediately.

*** I don't think that's true. The Cambist is shown to be good at exchanging one thing for another. If the problem were not couched in the form of finding a price, he might not be able to generate any better advice than "reform, spend your money on charity, don't have wild semiconsensual sex orgies and murder people"; which presumably Lord Iron knew perfectly well already. The relevant insight is not "a life of virtue and service"; it is "I happen to have one such, with which I am willing to part".

**** The insight it took him three days to figure out was Lord Iron was trying to buy his soul, rather than sell it.

***** True, but if not for spending those days thinking about it in terms of a transaction, even if the wrong transaction, could he have come up with the solution?

****** Considering that he was thinking of things like trying to quantify what it sold for in a work of fiction, I don't think he was thinking of anything useful.
