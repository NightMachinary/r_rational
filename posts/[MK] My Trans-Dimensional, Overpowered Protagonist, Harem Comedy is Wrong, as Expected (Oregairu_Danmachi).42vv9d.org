** Just throwing this out there, for anyone who isn't familiar with Oregairu:

Hikki isn't a loner. He's lonely, and in denial about it.

I'm tossing this out for anyone else who would get frustrated with his "Herp derp I'm a loner yup so lonery WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LOVE ME!?" attitude. It irritated me until the above clicked.

** Come to think of it, Hikki is a perfect one to make !smart crossovers. Internal monologue is built in his charcter, he is pretty smart, cynical and is completely ok with morally dubious plans. You can throw him anywhere, probably barring most dark settings.

** I have started to read it and there is one thing doesn't make sense to me.

Why on Earth would Hikki *want* to return home? This new universe is better than his home universe in nearly every regard.

*** He misses his family and friends from home, basically. That's why he enjoys verbal sparring with Lyon, since she reminds him of Yukinoshita.

** I haven't watched Danmachi so I'm not sure how good the munchkinry is, but there's a lot of it. The writing quality is pretty good too. A lot of internal monologue, but that's meant to mimic the style of the Oregairu light novels. The character interactions are good. The only annoyance I have is the way thoughts are presented in between lines of dialogue, which can be a little hard to follow.

**** I'd suspect yes. I'm not familiar with Danmachi and was able to follow it. The world of Danmachi is basically based on dungeon crawling videogames, similar to D&D. The only element from Oregairu is the main character, Hikki. Familiarity with Oregairu might make it easier to understand his unhealthy mentality and his backstory, but I think it should be doable to pick up the important points as you go along.

**** I'm in this boat. I wasn't paying attention and just thought it was an original work for a few chapters and it read fine. Some things were more confusing than others but that really just put me in the same boat as the main character, who is also new to the universe.

That said, I later did realize that it was fanfiction and started looking up characters as needed on the Danmachi wiki. Largely unnecessary, but the fic does sometimes under-describe various side characters, so it's nice to see their full physical descriptions from the source material.

*** So could you give me a quick summary of what to expect from this story? The genre, what kind of story it is, stuff like that.

**** It takes place in Danmachi's fantasy setting, which is a bit similar to D&D. Hikigaya, the main character of Oregairu, which takes place in our real world, is transported to the world of Danmachi, and is trying to progress to the end of the Dungeon in order to get back home. He finds the protagonist of Danmachi, Bell Cranel, who he recognizes as the protagonist of the light novel-esque world he's in, and decides to mentor him so he can tag along to the end of the Dungeon. The story seems to follow some of the plot points of Danmachi, which is a harem comedy anime. So I'd say the main appeal is probably the comedy of seeing a dour character like Hikigaya in Danmachi's setting, but there's also quite a bit of fantasy action/munchkinism.

**** The apathetic narcissistic, semi-nihilistic somewhat pessimistic main character, Hikki (from Oregairu), is placed into a gamelike dungeon universe whose main character, Bell Cranel, literally has the power of friendship. (Danmachi)

Notable moments are Hikki stretching the truth around entities that almost can't be lied to, and Hikki munchkining his various skills as well as simple tactics and dungeon knowledge to fight enemies way above his supposed weight class.

**** Hold on. threadmarks let you go to the next chapter, and the text is fundamentally copiable. Why hasn't someone made a downloader for spacebattles? Should be trivial. If I wasn't lazy I could probably make it even.

***** That assumes threadmarks being used in a way which makes that possible. Not necessarily true. Some sort threads don't have/use threadmarks for whatever reason, and depending on your method/approach to editing for all I know it's possible to completely break them.

Probably doable for the ones that do use threadmarks, though.
