** Reading this chapter brought home how cliche everything is.

  Ratbiter was getting a little old as well, he thought. The days where the destrier dutifully trampled whoever was in his way would soon be over. Tossing away the rest of the bread and washing away the taste with water, Klaus affectionately slapped the animal's neck.

  “We've still got another few in us, don't we old boy?” the greying general said.

  The horse whinnied and the prince smiled grimly.

It feels like you can find variants of this scene in almost every fantasy novel - old man talking to faithful animal companion just before a big battle.

But somehow the author makes it work.

*** I know exactly what you mean. As I read your message I was planning to reply with a comment that echoed your last line.

  But somehow the author makes it work. The story of creation is based on cliches & rules. And we've already seen Cat subverting the story (with the Lone Swordsman), I think we'll see more of that including, hopefully, breaking free of cliches...

Except, now I think about it, Cat's ultimate victory will be the biggest cliche of all.

What do you think?

**** Well it's cliche /to us/. Not to get into a rant about how basically nothing is original, but the fact is that especially when focusing only on the broader strokes every story has been written to the point of cliche, subverted, and those subversions in and of themselves written to cliche. It's how stories survive, because there are universal themes we can relate to and pass on. So we have an infinite amount of "Cinderella stories" while the story of "Og found a log" has been lost to time, no matter how much more factual and less cliche filled it might be. (To go meta for a second, while the implementation is unique in some aspects, this is hardly the first story that leans this much in the fourth wall, and it clearly borrows much from D&D, though of course D&D is hardly completely original in it's stories, creatures, and mythologies) I include all this because of the fact that for us stories /reflect/ reality, if sometimes through a warped mirror.

An important distinction here is that Cat's ultimate victory is not cliche /in her world/. Because there, stories are instead /weaved into/ the fabric of reality, and cliches are better known as Names and Roles. It is a land where the grooves have been worn to ultimately favor Good over Evil because good has always won. And Good has always won because not enough have considered that Evil could win, and keep their winnings. No stories are told of the Villain who lived happily ever after, the Tyrant heros could never fell. So the grooves got worn in Good's favor. The Bard opposes Cat so much precisely because she wants to break the cliches, escape the grooves. While an anti-cliche antihero that is wiling to break the very founding the world to make it fit her vision of a better place is something of a cliche to us, the fact that it is so foreign to basically everyone but the Black Knight (and arguably Apprentice in a metaphorical sense) is key to the conflict. Both sides Hero and Villain willingly follow the path of the Story even when they try to use it for their advantage. Cat's victory would force a new story to be written, a new set of cliches to start to form.

***** i would rather make a distinction between an archetype or trope and cliche. cliche implies something bad.

trope and archetype are just things used in writing

***** Excellent analysis. Thanks for explaining that important distinction. It gives me a new perspective on the most recent Villainous Interlude -(Chiaroscuro) where +Heiress+ the Diabolist understands the Villain's story more deeply than anyone else and recongises that Cat used the story against her; she (Akua) wants to dig deeper grooves for Villainy.
