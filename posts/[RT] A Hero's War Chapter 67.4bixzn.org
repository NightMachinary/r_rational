** I've never heard of this story, but it has an interesting brief synopsis. Could someone tell me a little about the story/genre/etc. without spoiling anything?

  It's somewhat similar to 2YE, but with more emphasis on discovery rather than exploiting pre-existing rules, and the scientific method is made use of excellently. It also re-constructs some tropes commonly found in light novels, which is cool.
