** * Summary:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: summary
  :END:
Players once trapped in a video game world find a way to connect it to the original world... but since the video game world is a real world in its own right, they get to keep their powers, and people back on earth can figure out how to use them as well. Politics ensue.

Log Horizon fans will get the most out of this, but it's written so as to be relatively understandable by people not familiar with the source material.

I'm looking for a beta, PM me for details.

Many thanks to the posters who spellchecked/grammar checked the previous two chapters. I've decided to post fixes on saturdays, then update on sundays.

I may or may not have gotten Tetra's personality a little confused with Pinkie Pie's on account of the hair and the whole dissapearing/reappearing gimmick.

The part with Michael originally wasn't going to be there-- I deleted a scene and put it in because of popular demand. The scene I deleted is still canon, and will eventually be posted, but it didn't really advance the story.

  Minori's mother placed her hand on his father's arm, and he cut himself. Off.

  Minori pulled her arm away from Tetra, but kept pace alongside the pink haired guy-turned-girl..

guy-turned-girl.

Hm. I can understand Midori's folks trying to fit her life experiences since the Catastrophe into something familiar to them, but the concept of the pre-uni players going back to school seems...unlikely. Not only are Adventurer immortal now, with her healing abilities from her class alone she could help out at hospitals and such if she needs money for something. And that's not even taking into account whether the currency of ET could be used here in some way, among other things.

*** Thanks for the feedback!

I'd like to point out that Minori's parents haven't actually figured out she's immortal in the sense that she doesn't age. They "know" she respawns on death, and while they're having a little trouble with the idea, it's not that big a change from normal-- very few people, comparatively speaking, die from abnormal causes. But the actual, no strings attached, eternal youth is so out of context they're not even really considering the idea.

Minori, on the other hand, being young, hasn't spent nearly as much time confronting her own mortality, and thinks when she says "I'm immortal," she's getting the whole story through.

Wouldn't help there's multiple 'types' of the condition either, but yeah, I see where you're coming from.

I'm finding that kid from our world practicing game mechanics interesting too, interspersed between Midori snips, so I'll be looking forward to where you're taking the plot element.
