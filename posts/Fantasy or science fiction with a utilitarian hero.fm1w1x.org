Hi! I hope this counts as on-topic. I have a question.

Most fiction hates utilitarianism. When the hero is presented with a trolley problem, more than 9 times out of 10 the hero will refuse to sacrifice anyone and instead dons his plot armour and saves everyone. A character who thinks in utilitarian terms is either a villain or a silly naysayer who gets proven wrong.

I hate that.

So can you name any fantasy or science fiction that shows utilitarianism in a positive light, or at least doesn't demonize it?

The best examples I can think of:

- Tamas from Brian McClellan's /Powder Mage/ trilogy (willing to kill a lot of innocents to get rid of the bad regime).
- Reinhard von Lohengramm from /Legend of the Galactic Heroes/ (Japanese novel, anime).
- Arguably Lelouch from /Code Geass/ (anime).

EDIT: Also Frank Herbert's /Dune/.


** I hope it isn't tacky to self rec. I write The Fifth Defiance. (link: [[https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/]])

It's a story about a world where there is a super person reigning as dictator, and all attempts to straightforwardly rise up against her regime have failed. The protags are collaborators, attempting to work from within the system to bring it down.

The necessity or lack thereof of utilitarian tradeoffs is pretty central to the various dilemmas that they face. I dunno, I think I can at least give myself points for 'doesn't demonize it'.

It's pretty long too, so if you turn out to be able to get some enjoyment out of it, you should probably be good for a few days.

You may want to check out [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]]. The premise is that Jewish myths are real, as is the judeochristian hell. Without spoiling, this is a major theme that certainly does not go ignored. Peter Singer is referenced as an early figure in the fight against Hell and there are some definite instances of the sort of tricky utilitarian decisions you're looking for.

Edit: As a matter of fact, considering that Kairos got applause from the Gods Below when he died seems to indicate that the Gods Below might actually have rewards for their best adherents just like Above. Pragmatically speaking, you've got to motivate loyalty somehow.

Not really.

IIRC part of hell was literally invaded and taken over. So Hell isn't some undefeatable force as long as you have the right Story backing you up. Also they've acknowledged that different Heaven and Hells exists, same goes for the Fae. It basically boils down to what you/your people believe. Also apparently the Gnomes are more powerful than Heaven/Hell since their threat of Exterminatus keeps them from developing certain tech.

**** Yep. There's a lot of worldbuilding discussion woven in and around the central plot; Juniper is basically an experienced and creative DM who is dropped into a world that seems to be at least partially based on several of the worlds he made up over the years (which in turn drew heavily on classic DnD manuals).

Except that he's not the first Earth human to have ended up there, and the deeper he goes, the more everything seems to point to the Lost King...

It does keep things relatively fresh by having the game interface elements be only one part of the overall story, and while they start off relatively straightforward (and are actively used as Chekov's Guns a few times), they fade into the background a little as the story proper develops more complexity. It's also one of the few Gamer isekais where the protagonist gains companions which are, in at least one case, notably /smarter/ than him and actively give suggestions about how to explore and munchkin the interface (and push it towards particular goals).

I should add that the character of Amaryllis (the aforementioned companion) is probably even /more/ utilitarian than Juniper. She has a very political background in a fairly red-in-tooth-and-claw noble society, and has absolutely no compunction about killing people in cold blood if that would be the most useful thing to do.

** Well, in /Wizard's First Rule/ by Terry Goodkind, the heroes have a discussion in which they say that their mission to keep the MacGuffin away from the Evil Overlord is more important than any of them, so they agree that if one of them gets captured and held hostage, they won't give up the MacGuffin no matter what.

I found the first two books in the Sword of Truth series to be very good, but it starts taking a serious nosedive in quality starting with the third book, eventually descending into Ayn Rand worshipping madness. The worst part is the disgusting eighth book, /Naked Empire/, which explicitly reverses some of the morality discussed in previous books. In the first book, it's discussed how killing is always a tragedy, because even the life of an enemy has value, and the most dangerous thing in the world is someone utterly convinced of the rightness of their own cause, because they'll be capable of anything. In the eighth book, the moral is that some things really are as simple as black and white, that some things really are just Evil and that there is nothing bad whatsoever about killing people that support Evil. :/

Incidentally, the "each book has a new problem that's solved by the end" structure was a deliberate attempt by Goodkind to let each book stand on its own as much as possible. That may or may not have been a good decision.

To be fair it's also pretty clear that Shiro's heroism is naïve and he eventually comes to regret his ideals. I think that story does a pretty good job of not picking one philosophy over others, but rather exploring the positives and negatives of several different worldviews without trying to claim one is better than others. You don't get competing worldviews with one coming out on top, you get worldviews struggling against their own internal inconsistencies.

** L.E. Modesitt Jr. has heroes that generally have a utilitarian bent, frequently choosing to use magic or advanced technology to cause large scale destruction in order to make sure that defeated enemies can never pose a threat again. This is taken to an extreme in /The Ethos Effect/ in which the hero observes that a civilization is about to become an Evil Empire and destroys it (using a device that causes what appears to be a massive natural disaster) /before/ it can become a threat to everyone else.

** OK not gonna call it rational but it was damn funny.

So last night I read LORD DOOM, where Taylor wants to become a hero, but she figures she needs to fund her tinkering first so she creates a disposable alter ego to steal some funds.

Not sure if it is utilitarianism of idiocy, but... [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/worm.115/]]

** The protagonist of Ward just tried to hopefully save the world by unleashing a virus that would have killed all Capes, and hopefully fucked up the Entities' data storage scheme, so that was pretty utilitarian of her, but for most of the rest of the book she was pretty set against the utilitarian mindset in general.

** Ringworld engineers by Larry Niven features at its core classic utilitarian calculations. Probably better to read "ringworld" before. Standard Niven disclaimers apply.

**** His characters do act and react in ways that are not obvious and not always well explained, but are consistent. Eg. its a bit of a puzzle sometimes to figure stuff out, I like that though. Let me see if I can find a certain short story in the ringworld universe that'll show this.

***** You'll want the story "Madness has its place" in Man-Kzin wars III. We see characters updating thoroughly and then act on it - but we see this only implicated not well explained. I consider Niven a quintessential rational author

. People update on info like no-ones buisness, like in the linked story. Foes often include superhuman intelligent beings that can out-predict you. So the characters start throwing coins to randomize their actions.

** Not quite utilitarian but practically driven is the protagonist of the dark fantasy in the broken empire, I think it's called.

What is the worldbuilding like? High or low on magic and fantastic creatures?

**** it's relatively low magic, though that's mainly because the mc isn't proficient in it. fantastic creatures there's very few. The worldbiulding of the magic and creatures is a nice idea, i don't think it's explained until the second book though.

**** That is a very tricky question.

Fundamentally the setting is one of a high fantasy post-apocalyptic medieval/reneaissance earth. Basically, in the future human science was used to erode the natural laws, allowing the human mind to have direct effect on reality i.e. they made magic work. Then the apocalypse happened and society was destroyed.

Basically, the earth is a functioning, mostly feudal, post-apocalyptic grimdark place rife with magic and strange creatures (high magic). It is, in my opinion, one of the better built settings.
