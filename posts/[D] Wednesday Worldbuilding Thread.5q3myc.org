Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So I've got this world that is basically robots building and maintaining facilities around the stars, that use their energy to power servers that simulate happiness.

Basically, people (in the far future) discovered that you could upload your mind onto servers and have a simulated awesome life with lots of happiness. Everyone did that and left everything in charge of robots. Now the robots, being pragmatic, simplified the codes, to optimize happiness and also created new servers with other simulated lives, but this time they didn't even upload minds, they just created AI's. Eventually, they simplified it to just a few lines of code, outputting happiness.

The robots, with their only goal, being to create happiness, just build servers hosting lines of codes having continuous orgasms. This until the heat death of the universe or until another civilization interrupts them.

*** I like the idea that there's a shortest program that can experience happiness. This idea could fit into lots of other settings.

In the cyberpunk future, a sect of philosophers begs borrows and steals computer time to run this program as much as they can. Of all people, Bitcoin miners completely sympathise with their quest to run quadrillions of iterations of a program that just solves the same mathematical problem over and over, and only debatably produces anything useful.

/And we haven't found it yet./ There is a rift in the philosophy community, between those that want to create more happiness in the world right now, and those who want to spend those resources researching new, more efficient algorithms.

Another debate is whether old processes should be killed to free up their resources for the newer algorithms, given that the oldest algorithms that can experience happiness are less than 0.1% as efficient at creating happiness as the newest generation.

Not really, if we were trying to maximize happiness we would have done quite a lot more drug and brain stimulation research in an attempt to male everyone happy all the time.

As for asking whether it's "really" flawed, that relies on assuming there /is/ a objective morality, but it's about happiness and not autonomy. It seems abundantly clear that given all the talk of "biting bullets" that it seems difficult to really argue that morality isn't just about trying to make our moral intuitions into something somewhat sensible, thus why so few people are classic utilitarians.\\
But even if that classic utilitarianism is somehow "right" nobody would care, because people care vastly more about their own convenience than they do about what's morally right anyway. So good luck getting anybody to get on board with a moral system that prescribes that all humans should be wiped out when it becomes possible to grow a super happy eldritch horror with the resources keeping them alive.

As for drugging people into happiness, we aren't talking about just using standard methods which aren't long term sustainable. That's why I said you would need to do research, because the existing methods don't really seem adequate. Also you really should have phrased that better since hard drugs /cannot really be argued to not be enjoyable at least initially/, the problem is that they come with many problems, side effects, tolerance, addiction, etc.\\
As for maintaining civilization that seems an obvious consideration. So the idea would be to develop drugs/brain implants that would permanently leave you in a functional constant blissed out state.

******** 1. First, I'm not even sure of my opinion right now. I'm still trying to understand it. But let's say I do: I don't mean murder because that would bring a lot of unhappiness but by not reproducing. I do have a small comfort in the idea that humans may conquer the stars but once I'm dead, I'm dead. I don't care what's happen to them. And is it bad to just stop reproducing? Do what have a moral obligation to continue the human race?

2. That's what I meant when I talked about hard drugs. On short term I may bring happiness but the problems it creates doesn't make the equation positive. But yeah if we find a sustainable way to drug everyone in a sustainable way, why not.

3. I like being autonomous because it brings excitement, change, happiness,etc... and the prospect of maybe being happier later. But if you promise me that I will have more happiness by lobotomizing me, go for it! I don't understand people's attachment to things like that. I like living in freedom, but if you can convince me it is better not to, Id live without it... Why do humans absolutely need autonomy? (certainly if it stands in the way of something better)

See I don't think you realize how rare classic utilitarians like yourself are. The number of people that would be totally fine with wireheading, or the human race being consumed to feed a utility monster is utterly microscopic, to the point I've never actually heard of one existing. Wireheading and utility monsters are treated as deathblows to classic utilitarianism /precisly because/ basically no-one is willing to bite those bullets, so it's extremely unlikely that you could convince enough talented AI researchers to be likely to get your way.

See we fundamentally aren't going to convince people with each others values, because we have different terminal goals. I (and most people) care about autonomy over maximizing happiness and would oppose the creation of utility monsters, because most people are closer to preference utilitarians than classical ones.

The Romans once invaded an island next to Wales. When they arrived, there were a huge number of druides (some kind of warrior-priests) waiting for them. But to the Romans' surprise, they didn't attack. They just stood there and immolated themselves.

They didn't use modern propaganda techniques to convince the druides they had to sacrifice themselves. I don't think there is any limit to what you can convince the people of.

As for real life, I am as fearful as you of something like this, because in the stage of technology we are now, I think it is very, very, unlikely that it will bring us happiness. What I am talking about is in that particular hypothetical scenario.

The difference there is that the druids almost certainly believed in some sort of afterlife and had some justification for their suicide. Whereas convincing a bunch of probably fairly intelligent programmers, to wipe out all of humanity and themselves with no hope of a payout seems implausible. See convincing people to do crazy things usually requires that you get them on board with a insane belief system, within which those crazy things seem perfectly reasonable.\\
Point is I don't see any programmers ever deliberately creating that sort of AI, at least unless you somehow indoctrinated a bunch of genius programmers into a cult in order to get the sort of control over them you'd need.

************** Well, if you can convince someone to suffer horribly using some special after-life trick, you can convince people to 'not reproduce' the human race for unlimited happiness. Them being intelligent is a plus because, even if you may think it is wrong, this conclusion requires a certain amount of rationality. Don't forget that in my scenario, it is real and has real scientific proof.

You say my arguments are 'insane' which I find quite arrogant for someone who hasn't refuted any of them. Certainly for someone who has said himself that he didn't really care if the human species continued to exist.

In my scenario, all the existing humans get uploaded onto the servers and then 'simplified'. So they all gain from it. Also, since the robots will create new digital 'beings' far faster than humans can possibly reproduce, the 'simplified' humanity will reproduce extremely rapidly. The only difference is that they aren't really humans anymore. They don't have concepts such as autonomy, freedom, self-consciousness,... but these concepts don't even apply to them. So the only thing you need to say is: "If you follow me, you will have much, much, more happiness and we will spread much more happiness to the entire galaxy. You won't have all the things you like now, but you won't care since you won't like them anymore."

I just said that no human would die, they just would reproduce (physically) anymore. I don't see what's monstrous about that. Besides, one could argue that keeping human race alive at all cost is irrational. If we could have greater happiness by not keeping it alive, it would be immoral to do so. You force people who are suffering from depression everyday and children that are dying to some disease to continue living a shit life because you believe we have some god-given task to reproduce ourselves at all costs.

A normal utilitarian would be more extreme than me in that regard. He would argue that if all humans have to die for the greater good of the galactic community, then we have to sacrifice ourselves. I am more an egoïstical kind of utilitarian and the scientists creating the robots would have at least their own interests and probably the interests of the whole human race in mind. Since the humans (or another sentient species) are require to start the project, there is no way around it. Also, just implement a certain line of code, interdicting the robots of closing the servers of the first humans.

*Inside*: Because time is advancing more quickly, light is not entering the bubble often enough, and as a result bubble interior is quite dark. Weird things happening at the boundary (would anything going at different accelerations be sheared at the boundary?). Sounds coming in would be shifted into low pitch. You could not stay in the bubble for longer than a few minutes or the different rates of air exchange would cause the bubble to fill up with Co2 or other toxic gases. Other effects?

*Outside*: You can't see into the bubble of sped up time, it would appear like a black sphere. Possibly generating very high pitch noises if anything makes a sound inside. Other effects?

*** Looking into the sphere from the outside would appear incandescent white, (assuming it had an energy source, like IR radiation from body heat) not featureless black. This is because the number of photons leaving per observer-second is much higher, and also the frequency (and therefore energy) is higher as well.

It would also rapidly depressurize itself. Assuming that the bubble popped up in normal air, the molecules of gas would be leaving (due to random motion) at 100x the rate that they are entering. A similar thing happens with heat transfer, with heat flowing out very rapidly.

**** I decided to do the math on this, and it seems like you're right. I was skeptical because the Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total radiant energy emitted by an object is proportional to its absolute temperature raised to the fourth power. This means that even when you're radiating 10x as much energy because of time acceleration, an object at 300°K (room temperature) will still emit 1,000x less energy than an object at around 3,000°K (like a halogen lamp or incandescent light) which is outside of the zone. Of course, once that hits the edge of the zone, frequency shifting will make that 1/100th.

People will emit about 13% more total radiant energy than room temperature objects around them. Wien's law states the wavelength of the peak of their emissions would be about 9.5 μm. Once that hits the edge of the zone, that would change to 0.95 μm, or near-infrared (instead of long wavelength infrared). This is close to the same peak as you'd see with objects at 3000°K outside the zone (see this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_body.svg][graph]]), but the curve would probably be quite a bit flatter. The peak would be in the about the same frequency range as a halogen lamp, although much of the light would be spread out through a wider range of (mostly non-visible) frequencies. The flatness is likely to make the color appear whiter than you'd expect from a 3000°K light source, but dimmer as well. I haven't calculated this, so bear that in mind when reading my estimation of luminance in the following paragraph.

Since every object in the zone would be about 1/100th as bright as staring into an incandescent filament, and humans would be about 1/88th as bright, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(luminance][luminance]]) of objects inside the zone (seen from outside) would be in the ballpark of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp][low-pressure sodium vapor lamp]]. That probably wouldn't be so bright that it's painful to look at, but definitely bright enough that you'd be dealing with a decent amount of glare when trying to look at anything inside the zone. The brightness would be temperature-dependent, so humans and other warm objects would obviously have somewhat visible contrast from their surroundings. Objects in the zone would probably stand out due to being somewhat cooler and thus somewhat darker than the ground.

One big problem is that any typical light sources from inside the zone will be hazardous to you on the outside. All visible light (380-740 nm) will be shifted to the extreme ultraviolet range (now 40-74 nm within the range which is 10-124 nm), and the total power output of such sources would be amplified by a factor of 100 for objects and people outside of the zone. A strong LED flashlight or laser pointer could become quite dangerous.

******* Correct. I probably got a bit too excited about the question and doing the math for it and glossed over that part. At 100x time acceleration, luminance of room-temperature objects should approximately match an incandescent filament. Ouch. Peak energy output wavelength for objects at human body temperature will be about 95 nm which is in the near ultraviolet range. Due to the flatness of the curve, you're probably going to be getting a sunburn if you get too close to the zone and stand there for a while.

Visible light would be shifted into the soft X-ray range (3.8-7.4 nm in the 0.1-10 nm range). Total power output would be 10,000x the original output. Even if you were exposed to what would normally be only 1 watt of power in the form of visible light, once it exits the zone you'd be hit by 10,000 watts of x-rays. If you're 70 kg (154 lbs), that would work out to roughly 140 Sv per second. 3-4 seconds of that would give you symptoms of radiation poisoning. 14 seconds would produce severe radiation poisoning, 38 seconds would be usually fatal even with prompt medical attention, and 76 seconds would be fatal regardless of medical attention.

I was assuming no light sources but you're actually right just because any EM spectrum source (like heat/IR) in general is going to be shifted up and some will end up as visible light.

#+begin_quote
  It would also rapidly depressurize itself. Assuming that the bubble popped up in normal air, the molecules of gas would be leaving (due to random motion) at 100x the rate that they are entering. A similar thing happens with heat transfer, with heat flowing out very rapidly.
#+end_quote

So effectively it would turn into a vacuum, like space over time. That's actually really fascinating.

Thanks for the speculation... I believe I am conceptualizing this quite a bit better now.

Some other things (assuming the above have been magically fixed):

- From an inside PoV, Earth's gravity will drop to 0.098m/s². So if the person inside is not aware and careful about this, they can accidentally launch themselves into the air without any means to control their flight trajectory, and end up finding out on themselves exactly what kinds of weird things are happening at the bubble's surface.

- From an inside PoV, some things that are outside [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/EM_spectrumrevised.png][will change their colour,]] some things will become invisible, others that were invisible before will become visible. Or everything that was visible regularly will become invisible, and some wavelengths that were invisible to the human eye before will now be perceived in regular colours.

- Radio-signals that have to travel through the bubble will reach their destination a bit sooner.

- It will be possible to burn something that's outside using a regular source of light, especially if it's a powerful laser pointer.

- solid bodies that are hitting the bubble's surface from inside (e.g. bullets) will crumble into themselves, or just bounce back upon hitting it. I'm not sure how Newton's Third Law will interact with the bubble.

  - same bodies hitting from outside will get pulverised. Or maybe a continuous series of atomic explosions will be happening?

- Radioactive elements that are inside the bubble will be much more dangerous to the outside environment.

- maybe the bubble will effectively become a hole-puncher in the world, if everything that enters it accelerates and leaves its current frames of reference.

That strongly follows [[/u/ulyssessword]] speculation about pressure and heat too, I am thinking this bubble more and more strongly represents the vacuum of space as time passes.

*** I've seen this question (or something along those lines) before on [[/r/AskPhysics]], and unfortunately, it's a lot deeper than it looks. You see, the answer really depends on how exactly time is being sped up. If you're actually somehow accelerating /the flow of time itself/, then you've already completely broken physics as we know it, and it becomes impossible to give you a good answer (since any such answers must rely on /known/ physics).

With this in mind, your first task should be one of the following:

1. Conceptualize a way to achieve this "acceleration" effect that remains at least somewhat compatible with real-world physics. (E.g. perhaps everything inside the bubble experiences reduced inertial mass? Pros: things mostly behave as you would naively expect things to behave in a region of sped-up time. Cons: it's unclear how such a phenomenon might affect massless quantities such as light, if it affects them at all.)
2. Invent a different underlying set of physics that your universe runs on which is compatible with such regions of sped-up time. This latter approach seems, if anything, even more difficult than the former, but if you pull it off successfully you might end up with something /really/ cool on your hands. (As a /very/ rough starting point: perhaps this is a universe where Newtonian mechanics or something like them holds rather than relativity? This has... well, there are a lot of problems with this that still need to be addressed, such as the fact that the speed of light in such a universe would be /infinite/.)

TL;DR: Talking about bubbles with sped-up time is hard.

**** Good point on the framework being important. I'm imagining our world, our physics (as closely as possible), and the universe being a computer simulation. "Time sped up" then means the affected bubble receives 100 simulated frames of plank time for each frame of the simulation of the outside universe. This makes sense if everything can be described as discrete particles that can be simulated but breaks down if not. For example if light acts as a discrete point in space it either receives 100/1 frames of updates or it does not. However if it is a wave bordering the edge of the bubble does it receive 100, 50, 1 or some other amount of updates? Does the uncertainty principle apply to the underlying computer or is fuzziness a part of the map and not the territory?

I am not certain about a lot of this but I probably will hedge in the direction of vagueness because I don't want the inhabitants of said universe to be able to use time bubbles to leak details of the above universe.

Ooooh, this makes a number of important differences. For one thing, it means that things leaving the bubble don't stay accelerated.

Consider an oxygen molecule, bumbling along through the air. It's in the time-sped-up bubble. travelling at 1m/s relative to the observer in the bubble (measured with his sped-up clock - the observer outside the bubble sees 100m/s). Then it bumbles off to the edge and drops out of the bubble; it loses 99 out of every hundred frames, but its speed doesn't suddenly jump up to 100m/s. Its speed is still 1m/s. So, to the outside observer, it suddenly drops in speed by 100x.

This is happening to every molecule that attempts to leave (and about 100 are leaving for every one that enters) so before long, you'll have a continuous, spherical wind blowing out of the timesped sphere in all possible directions.

** Continuing where I left off [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5optr4/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dcl9ap0/][last Wednesday]].

Kung Fu Battle Wizard setting:

*Concept:*

Humanity isn't on top of the foodchain. Rather, humans are forced to huddle in heavily forified settlements while being surrounded on all sides by all manners of scary animals, many dwarfing the size of humans, and still very agile.

Nonetheless, there's still a need from time to time for humanity to step outside, explore the world, and gather resources, or to travel from one settlement to the next.

Enter the elite soldiers known as ninja, who wield the power of chakra better than any other in combat environment. They are heavily specialized for movement and parkour, and their effort is focused on outrunning and outsmarting monsters rather than hunt them, perfect for the environment and challenges they contend with on a day to day basis.

There are three classes of ninja in this setting:

Scouts - Free ranging explorers. They look for opportunities and dangers. This may be looking for resources, or looking for creatures which may endanger supply lines.

Runners - Couriers who runs on known fixed routes. They carry packages in pocket dimensions and are the crucial supply lines between settlements.

Heavy combat - Their job is to defend settlements, resource extraction locations, outposts, convoy, and VIPs.

*Environment:*

If there is anything to be said about the environment, it is their sheer scale and lack of flatness, starting with the very ground.

Earthquakes are a frequent occurrence, running the gamut of very strong but rare to weak but frequent, causing the ground to take all sort of shape, anything but flat. Most of the ground would be very tough for humans to walk on, as they are frequently very steep.

Another force of nature to contend with are fast moving waters, which are unpredictable and torrential, carving cave systems, creating further elevations.

Finally, life itself seem to frequently be on the large side. Trees often rose hundred meters into the air, their branches and roots creating natural highways for humans and other critters.

Beasts of all kind frequently outnumber humans, are huge, and often have their own special chakra abilities.

*Resources:*

Light crystals: Useful crystals that usually emit the right kind of wavelength, without emitting useless infrared radiation. They are the primary mean of growing food for colonies, or otherwise it would be impossible to practice agriculture.

*Power and Abilities:*

Every human beings born uses chakra, and have roughly the same basic powers, though only a fraction of the population will be scouts and warriors.

Chakra Adhesion: To navigate the three dimensional terrain of the world, they must be able to stick to walls and other objects. Otherwise humanity would not survive in the world. Charka Boosting: At time, jumping between chasm and gaps may be the only option. Enhanced Kinesthetic Sense: Anybody could easily fall to their death if they made the wrong move, so it's important for people to be highly aware of their own bodies and what they are doing. Enhanced Upper Body Strength: Since the world is three dimension, all four limbs must be used. Sigilism: A relatively undeveloped science. By drawing diagrams certain way, it's possible to create chakra effects independent of a person. Justu: Any techniques casted by the user in the form of handsigns to create effects. Although handsigns are not strictly necessary, and could be omitted, it makes creating effects easier. Using a justu without handsigns is often a sign of mastery.

*Sigilism*

The art of creating magic through the drawing of sigilism and its infusion by charka.

Sigilmasters - Scientists, engineers, and craftmen who study and practice sigilsim. They spent their time drawing and infusing sigils, but also experimentation. Almost every part of the process must be done with care, lest harm will come to sigilmasters or their users.

Crafting or drawing sigils must be done with good craftmanships as the tolerance for error is high. Infusion of a sigil must be done with knowledge of how it work and how to shape one's charka.

Materials must be chosen carefully. Drawing must be done with charka-conductive materials, such as blood, ink, certain type of metals, and so forth. The medium must be nonconductive to charka. Frequently, this would be animal skin, wood, or clay.

Type of Sigils:

Storage Sigil - Store objects in pocket dimensions at the volume of one cubic meter with one-fifth the mass. This is what make ninja logistic and trade between colonies possible.

*Colonies:*

While there are hunter-gather bands, most humans live in colonial cities. Colonies, unlike our cities are self contained supporting environment, heavily fortified. The world agriculture is synonymous with cities.

*Questions:*

What is the origin of humanity?

How did the first colony developed?

I'm always partial to "Humanity isn't from around here." Could humans ultimately be descended from Earth? If there's chakra to begin with, it wouldn't be unreasonable to suppose that there are places with more or less chakra. Maybe there was a shift in the amount of chakra in Earth's universe, ultimately allowing people to figure out how to use it to cross to other universes (with Earth as a hub).

Then there was another shift, and the outposts in this (and every other) world were cut off.

Also, can light crystals be grown?

I probably have humanity come from somewhere else, most likely from another universe with chakra metaphysics.

Light crystals are definitely grown, if not naturally obtained from the environment. I haven't decide on a mechanism, but it will probably include some sort of chakra spring or vein.

I probably change how light crystals work. Maybe they aren't one hundred percent efficient for plants, but varying level of efficiency? The perfect light crystal will emit 100% useful energy to plants.

Ideas:

Normal evolution in a world split into two (or more) parts: Chakra monsters originated on one side, then expanded to the other(s) as an invasive species. Humanity has been on the decline ever since.

Colony mission from Earth (or some place without Chakra monsters), something went wrong and memories were lost, or old earth became a legend became forgotten. But the materials from the ship were used to form the first colony.

Chakra is a technological development of humanity gone wrong. It warped the planet and animals, making the world as it is. It's only success was the few powers it granted humans, who have been backpedaling ever since.

The way the gambling works is that skins are traded between Steam accounts between gamblers and bots run by the gambling dens, so I got the idea about criminals in the future using robots who pretend to be human to commit crimes in the real world.

It probably wouldn't be that easy for a robot to get fake ID in the future, but it's still a really cool idea. It could be like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, except the rogue androids are acting the behest of other humans instead of independent goals. Or maybe it takes place in a world where humans have started uploading their minds and suddenly there isn't an easy way to tell who's a bot and who isn't.

** Running a quest on SV at the moment, and been thinking of the magic system I'm going to introduce eventually.

The big theme behind it is "Change". Essentially, you cannot create or destroy anything with magic, only alter it. Further, magic isn't something you learn, it's something you /use./ Belief (or Quintessence) coalesces into items that you use to perform magic through. There are three broad categories of items:

Charms: Small trinkets that can be made easily (eg Witch-Doctor rituals) that perform variable effects but have a one-time use. Like a feather that can let you glide for five seconds or a bead that will purify a pool of water.

Icons: These ones are rarer and take longer to make , usually the result of decades of investment by an individual or years of desperate need by a society. Like a doll that can help you in all manners of agriculture (and provides a bonus to growing plants) or a chalice that lets you absorb the strengths of any animal whose blood you drink from it (for a limited time).

Artifacts: Singular, unique existences that are the product of a culture believing in something for centuries. I have a few ideas, but the main one right now is a crystal ball that contains a God of Knowledge that will answer any question you give it (usefulness of the answers nonwithstanding).

**** Oh no, the three categories are so I can keep track of them and easily delineate them for players. There's no in-universe difference between a charm and an artifact (some can even ascend the tiers given time), but I think it would be helpful to the players to know if they're dealing with a limited use item or not.

Although there is a sort of "self-perpetuating" mechanism going on behind the scenes. There's a physical source for all the Quintessence, something that turns human belief into tangible items. Outside of this area, belief doesn't coalesce into Quintessence. When Icons are taken outside of that range, they'll slowly degrade and lose their magical properties. Charms break apart almost instantly. Artifacts, on the other hand, don't. They have so much energy in stock that they can function outside of it's range indefinitely, sort of like a reactor.

** I'm thinking of a rational reason for why magic can be used by everyone but very few people become full fledged mages, so I'm going into this with how education or language evolved in human history, now I'm no expert in this field but I'm just using the basic knowledge that I've learned about this area.

So it is possible for everyone to use magic, think of it as an extra sense just like seeing or hearing except it's more intuitive but just like how you need to learn to speak or read, similarly, you need to learn to use this extra sense to use magic but a certain level or type of magic can be very easily learned like how we can learn to speak as we grow up , now, my world would be same old medieval era kind of world or even older so schools and such are not common.

So first thing, humans can easily become proficient in speaking a language if they grow up with everyone around them speaking it, similarly some simple types of magic is very common and almost everyone can use them because it's just easy to learn. Next is that some people are born with a special talent, just like how some people are really talented in arts or science or such, similarly people proficient in magic or certain types of magic are also born, these people can either be pioneers into a new field of magic or just easily able to grasp certain magics when taught. This leads to continuous improvement of magic over time.

Use of magic is very common among the people but there's also other races that exist so it's not all peaceful, though countries are not always at war but there is heavy focus on combat magic for war, which leads to some talented people not being able to reach their full potential.

The commoners can only use very basic magic barring some talented people, because similar to how commoners in ancient times could not read or write or have access to education, similarly, high level magic is protected by the ruling classes as this is the main reason they were able to become nobles, the noble houses are those who have some sort of strong magic that has been developed by their predecessors and so they are very proficient in it, and some of the older noble houses can have more developed magic as it's always being perfected through the generations, and they can also have a more kinds of magic either by acquiring them through conquering or by other means like political marriage or having genius ancestors.

Now, the reason why noble houses came to be is because their founder or ancestor was able to create/use advanced magic which lead to them becoming rich and also starting their own family magic, many noble houses have unique magics (which I think I'll make based on modern science), (and I'll need some reason why these unique magics are very very difficult to learn by other or to steal,)

I'm also thinking of people being able to awaken/create bloodlines, so if a person can have sufficient mastery over a certain type of magic, it can manifest as a bloodline leading to the creation of a new house. The bloodline will allow the persons descendents to be able to more easily learn their ancestors magic(or type of magic). (I'm not sure if this idea is okay or not, what do you think 🤔?)

So since my world has these realms of elementals and also some special realms(like heaven or hell) , which can be accessed from certain locations(its actually very difficult to find and entering is very very risky), and also there are mythical beasts and other sort of more common animals which are magical so some people can tame the common magical animals while others can steal the bloodline of the mythical beasts (I need some ways to incorporate this bloodline system, it's basically stealing one of the abilities of the mythical beast but unless you steal it from the king of that race, every beasts have a king, you can't pass on that bloodline.) (I seriously need more ideas to flesh out this bloodline system)

Back to the magic, so basically what I'm thinking of is that the more you use magic the more proficient you became at it and also that the capacity of mana that you can use is limited, actually the way to use magic is that you absorb mana (like oxygen) which your body converts into magical energy which is then stored in your body to be used later, so magical capacity can be increased as well, your body can become more efficient in converting mana or storing the energy(like marathon runners or sprinters). And this can be affected by your house, the older the better your body will be at handling mana. And also that the more advanced magic is the more efficient it has to be in energy expenditure which can only be achieved through trial and error,

Eg;a commoner may be using mana to power fire magic but an advanced fire mage from a noble house would be more efficient in the mana expenditure and a genius may use modern principles and rater than fire use heat gathered from the sun or the surroundings. A water mage will use existing water but a genius will pull the water vapour from the air while a commoner will directly convert magical energy to water,

So any ideas if this is going in the right direction and any comments or flaws, please do tell me,

** (Using [[/u/hackerkiba]]'s format since I found it really neat-looking.)

Concept:

The laws of mathematics are moderated and regulated by human beings. Each topic of mathematics have a single appointed human being or guardian to moderate the topic as they manifest. When the first quantity was counted by a human for whatever reason, the numbers king was born. He would be the leader of all of the guardians, and had ultimate power over his guardians in terms of what they can or cannot do.

The highest power would be the God of Logic. This is the embodiment of humanity in all of its facets. The good, the bad, the intelligent, and the ignorant, the evil, and the good, and everything else combined into a single, statue-like, unmoving being which only serves as the universal glue of all things.

More guardians other than the numbers king showed up as mathematics became more and more complex, and more topics began arising. When the first computers arose, the Computer mathematics guardian came into play. When probability and chance was first discovered, the guardian of Probability and statistics manifested.

All these guardians were once human beings, but were appointed by the God of Logic to become the representative of a certain mathematical topic. Should a guardian grow weary of moderating their mathematical topic, they can resign and appoint their own guardian of their own choosing.

The only reason why mathematical topics need moderators are because mathematics was injected into the context of humanity. The collective complexity of all human beings is enough to disrupt the balance of mathematics, which is why guardians needed to be appointed in order to rectify any and all chips they see in their given topic. Further out into space and guardians wouldn't be needed as the wavelength of complex intelligence emitted by human beings would fade. All intelligent civilizations across do have their own mathematical guardians, though.

Environment: The world at large have little to no knowledge on these guardians for a large part of history. The old ones felt no need to expose themselves, and they spent little time in the output realm, (which is basically earth). They chose to simply stay in the Input realm, where they moderated mathematical topics around earth.

After a complete change in management in the present day time, a new set off prodigies were appointed to becoming guardians, but they did expose the existence of mathematical guardians as they didn't see a reason not to, which nearly lead to a global upheaval, but was curbed. Now mathematical guardians are almost seen as god-like figures, but not by everyone. There are still disbelievers in the world.

Also, the simpler and more elementary the topic of mathematics is, the more powerful the guardian is.

The list goes on depending on which mathematical topics had been discovered and categorized at the time. For simplicity's sake, assume that all the mathematical topics that have been already categorized in the present time have their own guardian.

Powers and Abilities:

The Numbers king is charged with keeping track of all numbers within a reasonable and calculable sphere. This also means decimal numbers within a certain amount of decimals that has any chance of being used. Failure to do his job would result in worldwide catastrophe fraught with non-existence of logic. Shit would go down, basically.

Other than that, the Numbers King has complete jurisdiction over what a guardian can and cannot do. If a guardian, say, wants to increase probability of good fortune world-wide, he can choose to deny it if he wishes.

Every other guardian has abilities based on their given mathematical topic. A primary ability would be being able to alter the rules of their given topic, while a secondary ability would be near-perfect mastery over their given topic.

The God of Logic has laid out some ground rules for all guardians to follow. One isn't allowed to harm a human being. The whole point of being a guardian is protecting their world from mathematics imploding on them, fucking everything up. Although the God of Logic isn't capable of enforcing his laws, the Numbers King, the right hand of the GoL, is tasked to do so.
