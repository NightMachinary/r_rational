** If this is what we're doing, I recommend [[http://youtu.be/JxgEXDnXD6M][this]], where Mario finds the exact pattern of jumps necessary to take over the universe in a minute and a half. Not just fiddling with the details like Red here; Mario decides he'd rather be playing other games, so he does.

Red gets in on the action too, [[http://youtu.be/3UnB1fomvAw][manifesting dancing numerical constants]] and [[http://youtu.be/aYQpl8Jj6Yg?t=10m30s][replacing reality with something he prefers]].

Breaking out of the Matrix is really dangerous you guys.

It looks like these are hacks written by someone and then performed by video poster. Not bad as far as playing around with game code goes, just not really Munchkinry. EDIT: turns out I was wrong, all of these codes are already in the game.

**** These are not hacks. These are tool-assisted runs. They use pre-made frame-perfect input to show the game being played at the theoretical best. Other than the controller input stream, the games themselves are not modified in any way. Other than needing to be really precise, a human could theoretically do all of this on the real game.

**** The way these work is by exploiting a glitch (or series of them) that can write an arbitrary number to an arbitrary address, and can change the program counter. If you write a series of numbers to a block of addresses, then move the program counter the the beginning of said block, the console will execute whatever assembly is stored in said block. Hence, arbitrary code.

It's not really a hack since someone trapped inside the vanilla game would have access to this ability.

** Considering the Ocarina of Time post, I figured this would fit in even better.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3EvpRHL_vk][Here]] is a different video from the same guy, showing off the creation of an entirely new game using the glitch.
