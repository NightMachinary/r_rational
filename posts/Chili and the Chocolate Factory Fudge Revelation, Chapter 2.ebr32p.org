** Well, two out of two for the "A children wins when they actually input what they like best" theory. The actual implementation of that scheme would require a full database about the likes of every children in the world, which would create a 'Likes Best' entry for that children. Those whose input matches that entry wins a ticket. And actually liking something best is harder than it seems.

And now I guess that the next episode will feature the chatters trying to use this strategy, and failing.

****** That's probably true but then you could say that for a lot of concepts. If vaping and appreciation of absence (or whatever nothing is meant to represent) are able to be 'liked best' by teenagers then hentai is probably going to benefit from the same hormone fuelled passion.

Also surely so many narcissists would be the best person at liking themselves and would definitely type themselves

******* Yeah I'm with you, I think "being able to be liked best by" is different from "more likely to be liked best by" though. I think the answer, for this premise, is that the child who likes cigars best among children would not be granted a golden ticket if there are any adults who like cigars more.

That point about narcissists is a good counterexample, makes me think "what you like more than anyone else on the planet" can't be the answer. Lots of options for likes that are too personal for it to be applicable to any competitors

***** Of course, I'd completely forgotten about those! Horrifying as they are that's almost a relief, since it could equally have been going in a more simulationist direction (where only the world is modelled in detail, and people aren't supposed to know).

That's not a bad plot in itself, of course, but there's a definite appeal to a setting having complex and strange rules that can't be explained in a sentence, such as 'this whole time the Dahl books were a simulation'. It's also suited more to plots about life outside the simulation or a individual character's journey, and there's too much of an ensemble cast for that to feel like the case here.

***** I suppose the part I was trying to answer was whether the events were included just to be 'le random'. While the actual plot of The Witches isn't something that tells us what's going to happen, it explains some basic motivations (witches are cruel, may have specifically planned to get these children, and may scheme towards grand strategies such as electing a figurehead for some purpose) and gives a precedent to some abilities (i.e. the feel of the magic in The Witches matches what was possible here).

It's a definite dream sequence of events, but it seems likely to follow an internal logic through the story as we learn more about them, in the same way that the selection of winners will make sense in the context of the setting.
