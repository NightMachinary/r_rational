** I have to wonder what the hell Veyers is doing here. I think this pretty much confirms that he is not Red Robe. I just can't see RR taking a risk like this at this point in time. I bet RR taught Veyers how to control his power a little bit then went off to do more important things. Veyers not understanding the situation entirely then thought it'd be hilarious to go flex on the school he got expelled from, not realizing what he was getting himself into. That's my best guess at least. RR has up to this point been the quiet efficient type when not fishing for information. I can't imagine him thinking this debacle is a good plan.

*** We saw that loopers who leave the loop, leave copies in the loop that return to their old selves. That would imply that Veyers was NOT a looper, or at least not one that left the loop, but WAS someone who was soul-killed in the loop by a looper. Probably red robe, but potential Zach.

Veyers is almost certainly not RR, but was in some way connected to the loopers. It's known that Zach and Veyers hated each other, so young Zach may have soul-killed him simply out of spite, but the fact that Veyers was removed from Zach's memory would imply that it's more complicated than that.

**** Yes I agree. I've been pretty sure Veyers is not Red Robe since that reveal but it's still a possibility until we know for sure who RR is and that there weren't any shenanigans. Honestly even with this I think he is still far more likely to be RR than the more absurd theories like it actually being Zach, his simulacrums or Zorian's simulacrum.

**** I don't feel that Veyers is RR, but if he was it would definitely be possible for him to arrange the 'soulkill' to happen after leaving the loop.

We know that QI is able to quickly accept the existence of the loop and even go so far as to self-destruct his own soul to try to help his original self. RR would just have to explain the situation to QI, tell him how to get and use the dagger, place a temporary marker on him, and then leave the loop. QI would then 'soulkill' the new Veyers once the next restart happens. By the time Zorian and Zach go back to Cyoria, QI's temporary marker would have expired.

It's a messy situation, but RR-Veyers might do it to keep the new Veyers from ever wandering into a Zach that had no memory of him. QI would be inclined to help because he wants his original self to succeed and keeping Zach from suspecting RR's identity would be in QI's best interest.

***** We've seen how QI reacts to people he thinks are time loopers. QI has a code of honor and a sense of logic that don't necessarily apply or make sense to the people around him and definitely isn't always what would pragmatically give him the best final results, but we've SEEN what he thinks the correct action is when faced with a looper. He was working together with ZZ when he catches on to them, so being allies is no protection. The moment he realized he wasn't the real QI and RR was a looper, RR would be at ground zero to a soul explosion.

****** QI found out they were loopers in the middle of a fight between QI, Zach, Zorian, Xvim, Alanic, and Silverlake. He first suspected it was an illusion and that's why he began the fight with ZZ. They then pulled the others out of the orb where they had been waiting for this fight. The battle ground was even prepared beforehand for the ambush, which became obvious during the fight.

Partway through the fight QI hit Xvim with a dispell to break down his mental barriers and did a memory probe. The memory probe is what made him realize that it wasn't an illusion, it was a time loop.

Earlier on in the restart ZZ were raiding QI's forces, then they talked with him and told him to his face that they were "irreconcilable enemies", then they brought him to an ambush after working with him to steal the dagger.

QI's response was definitely not /just/ because he found out they were loopers. At that point they were clearly enemies working to stop the invasion. And the time loop provided them an insane advantage that the original QI would have no way to account for. That's why he blew up his soul. It was a last ditch attempt to completely disable them.

He would have no reason to do that for a person who is helping the invasion, especially if that person properly describes the situation. QI would see that RR is his only option for countering Zach's timeloop advantage. And a millennia old lich is bound to have methods to make sure that RR is being truthful.

******* Touche, my memory on that portion was clearly not up to snuff. I concede the point. It takes Veyers being RR from the realm of "next to impossible" to "technically possible", which is all that really matters in a work of fiction. It still doesn't seem to be the case to me, but then the story itself concerns itself very little with my particular expectations of it.

I will say that I don't think RR COULD convince QI that he's an ally while also convincing him that he's a looper. QI knows full well that actions in the loop are like actions in a dream, and not at all evidence of someone's real predisposition. For him a looper is someone of extraordinary and growing power, whose true goals are impossible to know as any action they take in the loop is guaranteed to revert itself. I still feel like it would be suicide bomb central, population QI, but I'll concede that that isn't certain.

****** That's not right.

QI had already been betrayed when he detonated his soul. And the reason he was willing to do it was because he learned he was a temporary instance of himself and he saw a chance to sacrifice that instance to potentially wound people who could threaten his 'real' self in teh future.

​

If RR was an ally and QI belived he'd continue to be an asset outside the loop he wouln't go nova juts because he's ina time loop.

​

IMO the reason this idea doesn't work is instead because if QI spent a reset with the ability to soul kill and his only loopng ally had exited the loop, he'd probably have soul killed Zack (RR having pointed Zack out to him in the encounter at the dance). Worst case scenario Zack wakes up outside the loop, but not knowing he's out, and with no additional opportunity to exploit the loop. Best case scenario Zack's soul gets deleted on the next restart and the loop runs on automatic until the power runs out.

The potential advantages a looper promises might be high, but the cost of betrayal is much higher and just as easy. Perhaps easier. He knows he isn't real. Death costs him nothing. Bombs away.

******** QI has not been established as assuming treachery until proven otehrwise. He's savvy enough to expect treachery from Z&Z but they're on the opposite side of a national conflict from him, and again, he was already in the middle of being backstabbed by Z&Z when he detonated himself. We have no examples of his doing it as the opening move for his own backstab.

RR on the otehr hand has the same goal as QI (release a primordial), and has spent the loops optimizing the same side of the conflict as QI. And he has a pretty big incentive to follow through as he'll die in real life if he doesn't. RR could in theory even arrange for Pan itself to fill QI in via the soverign gate, but I kind of doubt that would happen as RR should be worried QI might pull a Silverlake.

********* When QI meets ZZ for the first time in the bar, he clearly begins from a state of distrust and becomes even more wary of them when their excessive resources become apparent. The greater their resources the less readily he was willing to trust them. He doesn't move to work with them until he believes that he has something over them, eg. their need to study quickly and access to resources only he has, eg. his intelligence. He doesn't also trust them immediately to uphold their end of the bargain and only agrees when he has some good reason to assume they will, eg. straight up giving him the crown, one of the most powerful relics on the planet.

He was shown to exist in a state of caution and distrust by default and a looper is by default someone who's motives you can't ascertain from their words or actions. Giving him the crown as a looper wouldn't work, the ownership of property is meaningless in the loop. Promising to help him with tasks won't work because he has absolutely zero power to enforce that promise. QI doesn't know you have aligning goals, your words mean nothing if there is absolutely zero power to verify them, eg having a future that exists. Of course you want something from him, but from the Spirit Serpents reaction earlier it's clear that previous loopers in history have made a lot of promises and not fulfilled any of them. Those would be the loopers that QI was around to learn about.

Maybe if you could show some strong reason that you would want to help him, that existed well before the loop began and could evidentially be shown to exist well before the loop began. I could see that working. And maybe RR has that. Totally possible.

That's hugely suspicious. It also means that when he realized he was expendable the equation was "self destruct for a chance at harming the most dangerous enemies he's likely to encounter".

RR would be somone with an aligned goal (release Pan) who is offering him something not especially costly (aid optimizing the invasion) in exchange for something that would benefit them both (It's to the benefit of QI that only allied loopers leave the loop, or enemy loopers leave with as little correct information as possible).

That's a completely different scenario. Also RR is a looper. He can try again if he fails to create the correct impression the first time.

He's already had a life longer than any looper, and clearly isn't in great need of more training or power. And he is not so selfish as to worry about himself over his original, since he has no problem blowing himself up for the cause.

If RR told QI about the loop, the correct thing for QI to do is immediately kill RR (who definitely Knows Too Much) and then find a way to turn Zach's soul into Swiss cheese. That neatly ties up all the loose ends from his perspective.

************ You're weirdly fixated on the idea that QI self destructs in any situation where he learns he's in a time loop. Which is pretty silly.

He self destructed when he was already losing and dicovered that he had no long term survival option but did have a "screw your canoe" solution.

Pan's offer of incarnation outside the loop completely reverses that as that ensures long term survival of the instance of himself in the loop. Further, if Loop QI exited in a new body as per Pan's offer the invasion gains an archamge with a divine blessing with comparable loyalty to the cause to original QI's, and QI gains an instance of himself that is not a liche, and has his own mana pool. Even if loop QI didn't gain any knowledge useful for improving the invasion he's still a valuble asset that may open doors for future plans that would otherwise be unworkable due to the difficulty in locating and trusting mages of QI's caliber and skill set.

************* Sorry, I think my reply to you must've gotten eaten by the Reddit app. Perhaps I've been unclear---I don't think QI blows himself up every time he hears about the loop, I think QI would simply take /direct action/ with the knowledge in a way that none of the other characters would.

Setting aside for now the question of how QI would even get into the loop, from his perspective, the risks have to outweigh the benefits. Unlike Z&Z (and presumably RR), he doesn't have nearly as much to personally gain, and the benefits for his nation are relatively minor; better black rooms would be cool, but as the loop demonstrates, the entire reason he's on the mainland is a resounding success absent any intervention.

On the other hand, he has all the knowledge he needs to find this whole thing very doubtful. Learning about the loop is enough to demonstrate to him that the angels aren't just involved, but /already trying to stop the primordial,/ which suggests a lot about how likely the summoning is to work, IMO. And much like Silverlake, I find it doubtful that he'd have any success working together with his original self.

And all that is contingent on someone actually telling him about the loop, which, again, would be incredibly stupid of RR to do. Now, RR isn't just a mysterious figure that QI plans on investigating after the invasion, he's someone who knows extremely intimate details about QI himself. Killing him would be the smart move. Zach would also have no reason to tell him either, and even if QI /did/ learn about it another way, I'm not sure Panaxeth would offer him anything or QI would accept. How do you tempt the world's most powerful lich?

In conclusion, I think the more interesting question here is why QI /hasn't/ taken that decisive action. It can't be because RR doesn't want QI to find out about the loop at all---there are other ways to tell QI to crush Zach's soul permanently---so there's got to be a good reason why Zach is still alive. And given Panaxeth's degree of control over the gate mechanism, I also find it hard to believe it's because Zach has to stay alive for the loop to keep functioning.

***** I don't think this checks out.

First off, if Veyers is RR, why erase his memory of Veyers in the first place? It's very lame if he just assumed that leaving the loop would leave you soulkilled; the RR we know might even have had Panaxeth test that in some way. Just barely erasing yourself from Zach's memory and then soulkilling your old self seems like it couldn't be better designed to get found out the first time Zach actually tries to solve his memory issues, something that was bound to happen.

Why would RR tell QI anything about the time loop? Why would QI do all the complicated soul stuff to keep RR in the loop if he could just do it to himself and avoid having to rely on some random person whose goals are only tangentially related to his?

And we have good reason to believe that QI doesn't typically even get told about Zach, given that he usually doesn't attack him until after he's already caused a lot of damage. Even in the reset where RR specifically has QI and his vampire friend seek out Zach with him, it's not remotely clear that QI understands anything about what's going on; he certainly doesn't act like he's dealing with a time traveler.

And because you can't really tell QI, you also can't get QI's crown to get somebody else to do it unless you take it by force. Good luck doing something that eventually required Z&Z to gather several archmages and a teleporting hydra to accomplish!

#+end_quote

If RR was Veyers he would remove Zach's memory of him early on to keep Zach from seeking him out. We know that Zach would often attack his appointed guardian during the loops because of how much he hated him. We also know that Zach hated Veyers, so we can assume that Zach might have occasionally gone looking to attack Veyers. If RR was Veyers he wouldn't want Zach to come looking and find that Veyers wasn't acting the way a non-looping person should.

#+begin_quote
  It's very lame if he just assumed that leaving the loop would leave you soulkilled
#+end_quote

In this hypothetical scenario, RR-Veyers isn't assuming that he leaves a 'soulkilled' body behind. He's setting it up so someone else 'soulkills' his replacement. RR-Veyers wouldn't want Old-Veyers walking around getting discovered by Zach/the other loopers, so he opted to arrange for him to be 'soulkilled' instead.

#+begin_quote
  ...the first time Zach actually tries to solve his memory issues, something that was bound to happen.
#+end_quote

Zach actively avoided trying to look into the missing memories. Zorian had to argue with Zach fairly hard just to get him to admit that the missing memory was out of the ordinary. Zorian then mentioned that Zach was probably under some sort of mental compulsion to keep him from looking into the missing memories. So it definitely wasn't bound to happen. It required not only an additional looper, but a looper who knew Zach well enough to notice that that missing memory was weird.

#+begin_quote
  Why would RR tell QI anything about the time loop?
#+end_quote

Because in this scenario RR needs someone to get rid of the Old-Veyers that would be walking around after he left the loop. Getting QI to cooperate is a simpler narrative solution than stealing the crown and getting someone else to do the cleanup.

I don't particularly want to argue about QI's motivations for helping, because it doesn't really matter. I don't even actually believe that this is what happened. I just wanted to point out that RR-Veyers theory is still possible (although quite unlikely) under the time loop mechanics we are already aware of.

I think it's more likely that Veyers was 'soulkilled' as part of the shenanigans that the primordial used to make it so RR could loop in the first place. Something along the lines of providing a convenient body for the primordial to shove an expired temporary looper into. But that is all speculation outside of our current knowledge of the time loop's mechanics.

***** The soul kill used on the aranea was likely the ability granted by the imperial dagger and not some technique that can be taught. Outside the loopers, the people being born each cycle aren't rewinds of the same soul, they are entirely new souls. No amount of damage done to a soul will make it "soul killed" (which is a misnomer really because the soul isn't killed it's just removed from the loop by the system using the administrative authority granted by an imperial relic).

It's still possible that it was a technique used and not an imperial relic, something that marked the soul for removal from the system, which you might learn how to do if you studied people being removed from the system by the dagger, but that would require soul killing quite a few people for study, and that would be something that would be noticable. After the soul killing of a relatively small number of people, Zorian sees the news show up in the papers.

Also considering that having a temporary looper to help is also an imperial relic ability, this plan relies on RR having access to imperial relics either way. And he can't pass on the dagger.

Nothing here is strictly impossible. Just much less likely than other available options. But it's a work of fiction so odds don't necessarily have to matter.

That means that the only possible way Veyers could be red robe is if he left the loop (which happened a significant portion of the way through the story) and THEN Zach soul killed him after that off screen, That would require Zach to get the dagger off screen (something he couldn't do even WITH Zorian's help later in the story) and specifically soul kill Veyers and apparently no one else.

It's not technically impossible, especially with the checkov's gun of Zorian learning to mind fuck people who are mind blanked, but it's exceptionally unlikely.

Edit: Technically we only have Zach's word that silverlake didn't leave behind a soul-killed corpse. So there's another technical possibility that Zach is working together with red robe, but I think you'll agree that that's even more unlikely.

Zorian also knows that Zach was not capable of removing people from the loop at that time, and had no idea of soul kill. (When they talk later). Nor does the Zach in that time loop know who the third time traveller is (because he is desperately searching for one and tells Zorian that; and that Zach was surprised by the third looper).

There's a lot of mystery and a lot of intrigue surrounding Zach and the events up to the start of the loop and including him being the new chosen one and his early years in the loop, which apparently RR came from.

The by far more likely option is that Veyers isn't RR, so much so that I'm not entertaining the idea at all that he is, but remember that this is a work of fiction so probability isn't nearly as important as the real world. Even what should be possible isn't a hard and fast rule in fiction.

********* I wouldn't try to imply that RR is Zach. I'm not sure THAT is physically possible given all we've seen. There might be some way to wriggle an explanation out, but it would take a lot of work if you aren't willing to just redefine old events. I was just trying to point out that while Veyers is certainly not RR, it isn't something that is "technically impossible" as you worded it. It's technically possible, just exceedingly unlikely. Conflating the two is dangerous when, even in the real world, the exceedingly unlikely happens every day.

*** I'm seeing a few possibilities for why Veyers just showed up:

1. RR isn't expecting Zach to show up in class and just wants to dump Veyers somewhere innocuous. RR thinks that even if Zach is there, Zach shouldn't be able to remember him after the mind edit.
2. RR wants Veyers there because he has watchers and knows Zach is attending this first day. He wants to gauge Zach's reaction or behaviors for any hints, since Veyers should still be safe from Zach's suspicion (as above).
3. RR has suspicions that the competent time traveler (Zorian) working with Zach is someone close to Zach or at least won't be far away. RR might not know that they've figured out the Veyers' shaped hole in Zach's mind.
4. RR is in contact with Silverlake already and Silverlake revealed Zorian's identity. RR knows that they know who Veyers is through SL. Veyers is basically bait.
5. Veyers isn't RR, but this Veyers that just showed up is RR using some advanced illusion magic, either to ambush Zach or sniff out the other time traveler(s).

The major hole in most of these is that Veyers was already expelled IIRC. It's probably trivial for RR to buy Veyers back into the academy, but that explosive door-kicking entry seems to suggest Veyers actually is bait and a fight is starting shortly.

It's entirely possible that Veyers was soulkilled for reasons that we don't understand yet; maybe he actually was very important to the invasion, and RR soulkilled him in order to hide that from Z&Z in addition to laying a false trail.

Even if he is important, he most definitely isn't RR. We know now that RR was more or less recruited by Panaxeth, and there are plenty of reasons to think that the only way this could happen is if pre-mind-screwed Zach took someone into the gate to meet the Controller. It's impossible for me to imagine a situation where Zach would feel the need to bring a lawyer down there. Plus it'd be a big anticlimax to one of the series' core mysteries and Jornak didn't even show up until the third act of the story. Veyers /could/ be RR, even if it's highly unlikely, but Jornak definitely isn't.

(My theory remains that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/aazrb6/a_final_rr_theory_spoilers_through_93/][RR is Zorian]] and nothing I've seen so far really shakes this, but if I had to guess at an alternative, it'd be Fortov.)

The story has already heavily implied that the Eldemar royals are major dicks who could be compared to IRL Vladimir Putin - they're just waiting for a chance to gobble up and conquer/annex the neighboring Splinter States, whose sovereignty they don't even remotely recognize.
#+end_quote

There's a difference between actual treason as part of a plan to burn the country to the ground to become immortal or whatever and just being greedy bastards.

And yeah, the royals are heavily implied to be dicks, but that doesn't mean the entire government is. I mean, just because the absolute monarchs of a country of millions want to conquer other countries doesn't mean everyone is war-hungry.

#+begin_quote
  However, to play devil's advocate to myself here, corruption isn't always a bad thing. House Noveda has a long historical record of loyalty and good service to the Eldemar Throne. Would it really be such a bad thing if Zach and Zorian informed the crown of the time loop? I could easily see it being played off as the Crown handling the situation by giving the two of them a golden leash, because they aren't just upjumped peasants. House Noveda is a big deal and Zorian is the Noveda heir's best friend. The Crown might restore House Noveda's fortunes and bind Zach closely to them with a favorable marraige, giving him power and authority but on the restricted terms of serving the crown for the rest of his life, which isn't all that bad a deal in this universe.
#+end_quote

To play Jesus' advocate (and man have I waited a long time to do that), Zorian is a jumped-up peasant and Zach is a washed up member of what was once a powerful house but now is a single stripped-out building and a legacy. Zach is powerful but politically isolated, it wouldn't be impossible to make him and Zorian disappear into a black-ops site to learn everything they learned in the time loop with some lead-pipe legimency or just straight-up drugging them and using government mind mages.

They'd put a fight, no doubt, but if it was them or their families and friends....

Yeah, the royals would want to know /everything/, but what information do Zach and Zorian really have, that the royals would want, that if shared would have major negative consequences for the two of them?

All I can think of is the location of various divine artifacts that Zach and Zorian want for themselves. But... why would the royals not let Zach and Zorian keep those artifacts, as long as they swore loyalty? Given the connections of those artifacts to the legacy of the Novedas, the Sovereign Gate? If the Crown was informed of the workings of the Sovereign Gate (a time loop once every few centuries for a Noveda Scion), then there is absolutely no way it would be in the crown's interest to alienate that Noble House. They'd probably want to marry Zach to a lesser princess and bring his bloodline into their own. Let him handle the repercussions of the time loop and rebuild his House's fortunes, all the while acting in service to the throne.

Honestly there's so many options, though staying the pair needs to start being proactive because in war you need to have the enemy play by your rules.

So far they seem to only be reacting to whatever the enemy is doing instead or forcing the enemy to respond to moves of theirs (moving against dragon cult members/Lich).

But even in those stories, massive escalations like what you're speaking of here are basically a matter of last resort, reserved for powerful bloodlines in the hands of hostile powers. And Zach isn't exactly hostile to the crown, and he doesn't have any real reason to be so. His family has a record of centuries of service, and he himself is basically a general-class archmage with vast potential for growth in power and leadership potential. He would be a good marriage candidate to a lesser princess, a second or third daughter or something.

So, yes, Vladimir Putin would do that. He marries his own daughters to well-connected oligarchs and other useful, powerful families with something to offer. The Russian upper circle of plutocrats is practicing all kinds of marriage alliances nowadays.

That being said, he might do so if RR clued him into the time loop happening. We saw earlier that he seems to be aware that such a thing exists, since last time he realized what was going on he literally blew up his own soul to try to kill them. He clearly takes that threat very seriously.

***** I'm not talking about QI fighting countless fronts, I'm saying that the original plan would cause Eldemar to fight a multi-front war. The plan was to use the wraith bombs to attack Sulamnon specifically and make the attack appear to be from Eldemar inciting a war between neighbors and the moment Eldemar gets attacked by any of it's neighbors, the other surrounding nations are going to want to jump in and get a piece.

Technically that's still possible, but only if they don't use the wraiths now against Cyoria. At that point it becomes less likely that another nation will buy into the idea that Eldemar are the ones attacking people with wraiths. We've already seen that news travels quickly in a world of teleporters. Instead it will look like the Ibasans are the ones attacking which is the absolute last thing they would want. We also don't know that the well of souls is reusable at all.

Now it's still possible that they are going to use them now on their originally intended targets, but the original plan called for the hundreds of thousands of souls in the massive city of Cyoria, and likely won't be nearly as effective with only a few thousand that you can get from small towns.

It's also possible that they intend to save them and use them later for the same plan as before, but that wouldn't explain the change in actions, nor would it be any more threatening than every situation they've already faced in the loop.

RR doesn't need the war to win. He doesn't need Sudomir to get his wish. He NEEDS to free the primordial. He HAS to. If he's taking action to gather souls now, it's part of a play on the attack on Cyoria.

Having only one concentrated target means less are necessary, but who can say? Presumably wraiths can be created from souls at a 1:1 rate, since we know that wraiths can create other wraiths from the souls of those they kill. That would mean a few thousand extra troops for the invasion that can can multiply with every kill they make. Presumably that would mean doubling in number at least, depending on how effective they can be.

A significantly higher number if they can convert the souls of people killed near them instead of just by them. That could potentially be hundreds of thousands of extra troops.

The golden flame is probably is a mixte between soul magic and fire magic, an expert on both could manage to do so and that would explain why zorian and Zach don't seems to have learned it. I assumed the effect would burn the soul pretty hard (no permanent damage to the core of the soul but probably serious damage to the rest) and be a pest to recover from.

Not true at all. In fact, it's even explicitly stated that intercontinental teleportation /doesn't/ exist. That's why Quatach Ichl states he's operating in "impossible mode" with his gate devices. What you're thinking of are teleportation platforms. The range of these platforms is limited and they operate on an strict (and slow) schedule meaning that Zach and Zorian couldn't use them to get to Blantyrre. They could barely use them to get to Koth but managed to do so with a few days left in the restart, enough time to find a Bakora gate key. Doing so required multiple teleport "hops" all chained together.

** Some thoughts/predictions:

1. Red Robe is working on Plan B/Plan C/whatever. Looks like we've seen plan B for wrath bombings and I'm guessing we will soon see plan B for summoning. The QI/RR will attack shifter villages directly to kidnap/secure Pan's essence for summoning/release of primordial. We will learn remaining secrets of red-haired classmate beauty, cause her little brother will end up being kidnapped as well.

2. Briam's familiar sensitivity. Since drakes and Briams link is emphatic, drake could work as mind magic talent/skill detector. Investigate anyone the drake hisses at.

3. Veyers. Looking at the entrance, he's the same hot-headed-with ignition-went-wrong. Either he had a fight with his sponsor/whatever and decided to take actions into his own hands (after he learned that Zach is supposed to be very powerful - he decided to confront him to defeat him). There should be some sort of mind trap on Veyers as well to see if RR can flush out Zorian (if RR and Silverlake didn't share the information yet). This may get interesting. I'm hoping we will learn who was pre-loop RR after Zorian performs mind reading and learns who assisted him with blood-line ignition. Also this could be the ploy to reveal that Z&Z are able to cast simulacra and they are not registered as spell users in magic guild - and ordering their arrest/lock down in secure location for interrogation.

My hypothesis is that original RR was the person who assisted Veyers with bloodline ignition. Since Veyers knew RR prior the loop, he was soulkilled to hide this link.

It is hard to tell if this was happening originally. Speaking with the guardian of Veyers, when Z&Z kidnapped him, he was not aware that Veyers was re-instated into academy. He was loitering around, causing trouble.

I think this is new development (the leader of magic guild is part of dragon cult, so he should have enough weight to make re-instatement happening) to complicate the life of Z&Z post exit and get some leeway / lesser pressure from duo while arranging summoning/wraith bombings.

** The subtext of the last few chapters has sort of underpinned the risk one takes when creating simulacra. Your emotional state can influence the aims of the created simulacrum. It would not surprise me if Veyers was simultaneously both Red-Robe, and not. Veyers seems to have little emotional discipline, he could have easily created a simulacrum driven by pure malice instead of any sense of self-benefit.

Zach learned how to make simulacra, but did it poorly and recklessly, creating an evil!zach simulacra, who, uh, continued to exist as a soul-construct when the time-loop restarted, looping through their shared soul? Who eventually learns to do soul possession (possibly due to /being/ a soul-construct giving it soul-sight, maybe?) and used the dagger to soul-kill Veyers and possess his empty body at the start of every restart, and then altering the memories of the original to conceal his presence, unknowingly removing his knowledge of how to create simulacra.

Both sides - ZZ and RR+Silverlake+Q - know too little about one another to engage in immediate battle. They don't know the other side's identities, resources, tools, etc. And there are no more restarts, and death is permanent. So both sides are playing it safe and conservatively, acting through simulacrums while accumulating resources and securing advantages.

Given the knowledge and powers the two sides have, either side could have already set fire to a significant part of Eldemar and other neighboring nations. But they aren't doing so precisely because they're both fearful of the other side, and acting so openly would invite deadly reprisals.

So it's going to be a war in the shadows until, well, the shadows aren't big enough any more. I'd suggest that you have faith; I'm sure Nobody is going to give us a significantly action-packed conclusion in good and due time.

Veyers is another looper. He probably figured out how to get the marker to enter the loop and told Zach and they fiddled with things and got the marker for both. He probably needed Zachs resources.

Zach and Veyers then leveled up in the loop. Veyers got captured and mindraped and his loop thing stolen for RR/QI. Zach didn't get his memory messed up more than just what we know, his early loops with Veyers and existence of Veyers. Plotwise that's why we didn't get a glimpse of his mind, there is nothing that important there and it's a red herring.

** All this discussion of RR being a Zach Simulacrum, or Fortov, or Sudomir.... it seems really obvious to me that RR is Jornak, the lawyer who Veyers was living with. I agree with all the speculation that RR cannot be Veyers, both because Veyers was soulkilled (if he was RR, he would've reverted to normal after leaving the loop) and because a RR Veyers would never walk into class the way he did in the last chapter.

​

But in Chapter 92, Zorian discovers that Jornak and Veyers have abandoned Jornak's house in the middle of the night, something that never happened in the time loop. If neither of them is RR, this change doesn't make the slightest sense: whether RR is Fortov, or Sudomir, or whoever, he'd have no reason to warn two effective nobodies like Jornak and Veyers. Therefore RR is either Jornak or Veyers; he's not Veyers, therefore he's Jornak.

​

The story would go something like this: Zach decides to plan a legal attack on Tesen, asks Veyers for help finding a good lawyer. Veyers refers Zach to Jornak. Zach, being an idiot, tells Tesen all about the time loop. Unbeknownst to Zach, Jornak is a pseudo member of the cult. So Jornak immediately goes to the higher cult authorities, and eventually to QI. Only someone with a marker can access hidden features of the key, so at this point only Zach can place a temporary marker. There's no way Zach will be tricked into putting a temporary marker on QI, so QI has no hope of entering the loop. But, as Jornak argues, Zach can be convinced to put a temporary marker on Jornak, which QI can then modify. QI sighs, agrees this is really his only option, and helps Jornak enter the loop permanently. Then, Jornak plans to ditch Zach permanently, and deletes Zach's memory of Jornak.

​

But there's a problem: Veyers is still around. Zach has forgotten Jornak, but Veyers refers Zach to Jornak every restart, and both Veyers and Zach notice that Jornak is acting weird (because he's now a permanent looper). Zach gets suspicious, and Jornak realizes that he'll have to come up with a more permanent solution to the problem. So he gets rid of Zach's memory of himself again, soulkills Veyers, and then gets rid of Zach's memory of Veyers. Problem solved; Zach will never approach Jornak again, and Jornak is free to go about on the road to becoming Red Robe. Then, when Z&Z meet Jornak, he's already left the loop, and the normal Jornak is ignorant of everything.

I'm struggling to think of any facts that don't fit with this theory, while I know this subreddit has come up with plenty of arguments against RR = Veyers, RR = Fortov, RR = Simulacrum. As for RR = Sudomir, that hypothesis fails to explain why Veyers and Jornak evacuated at 2am on the first day of the real world.

Veyers is obviously not Red Robe. He is there today to find the 2nd looper (Zorian). Easiest way to do that would be to start launching fireballs everywhere, which will force Zorian to protect people. Chances are, Red Robe stabilized Veyers and Veyers now knows how to use his powers.

Wrong wrong and wrong. The soul well can only be detected if it's affecting you (I mean theoretically you could use divination but it's behind very powerful wards so basically you have to feel it). The invaders can extend it's reach to literally anywhere they bring one of QI's gates and feed it enough mana to stay open. Assuming that they have a mobile one they can just pop into a village, kill everyone and steal their souls, and pop to the next one with no one the wiser.

I mean I guess you could get rid of it. If Z and Z find it they can call in the military but it might already be too late at this point and the wraith bombs are ready to sail. Also, QI promised him that if Sudomir helped in the invasion QI would turn Sudomirs wife into a lich. We're not sure if he was lying or not so even if QI can Sudomir can't force him or do it himself so no real priority 2.

#+end_quote

exactly, the soul well can be detected if it's affecting you. But it's always on which is why Alanic can feel it. It can be found by any soul mage and can't be hidden. That's a huge liability. Sudomir needed to kill every soul mage, but he failed. Having a giant soul well that can be detected by any soul mage is a huge liability that can disrupt plans because it allows an easy way to get the government involved. Therefore, the priority is to get enough souls to create wraith bombs so that they can ditch the soul well. Or maybe find a way to move the soul well to a new location.

We should assume, at this point, that all "holes" in the invasion are being patched or strengthened.

Edit: In one of the previous restarts, the invasion was cancelled after Z/Z stole the gate. So Z/Z can always steal/destroy the gate to see what the response will be. If the invasion is still going on, then Z/Z can assume that the invaders are now using a different method of invading.

  He was tall, with messy blond hair and rumpled clothes that looked like they had seen better days. The door had been opened so forcefully that Zorian suspected the boy had kicked them open with his foot instead of using the handle. They rebounded against the wall with a loud bang and promptly closed themselves behind him.

  As he marched forward towards the front of the class, the boy swept the whole class with his gaze. For a moment, Zorian met his eyes and found himself staring at vividly orange eyes, their slitted pupils burning with barely contained anger and aggression.

  Veyers Boranova had arrived to class.
#+end_quote

Veyers isn't Red Robe.

I honestly don't believe he would be capable of pretending to be angry to that degree, while also being the mastermind behind all the different stuff he supposedly did.

Zach is Red Robe.

He got in a fight with Veyers sometime early on in the loop and got pissed off so badly, he figured out how to get the dagger and soul killed him. But Zach was the one acting as Red Robe all along. He worked with Quatach-Ichl to make the invasion stronger because he found it interesting and wanted to practice fighting it. He pretended to have memory problems to avoid explaining what he did in the earlier loops, and didn't want Zorian to look into his mind for the same reason. He pretended to not know who Veyers was since he had soul killed him and didn't know how he would explain that to Zorian. He created the simulacrum that he fought after getting out of the loop and had it injure him enough to clear him from blame. He kidnapped Veyers after getting out of the loop, but now he's either gotten loose or Zach let him go intentionally to distract Zorian while he makes a move.

This was all because Zach liked Zorian for some reason, realized he was smart enough to have a somewhat decent chance of figuring a way out of the loop, and didn't want to look bad by helping the invasion murders thousands of people each loop just for fun.

I know there are some holes in the theory, but it makes a lot more sense than Red Robe being some other person who has barely been a part of the story this entire time. Or worse, being some person who isn't a classmate of Zorian and just comes completely out of left field. I'm predicting that Zorian realizes Veyers isn't Red Robe pretty early in the next chapter and things blow up big time during the assault on Sudomir's mansion.

What I don't know is Zach's intentions at this point. Now that we're in the real world, I don't think he actually wants the invasion to succeed. But he obviously wants to keep up the charade for some reason, so he still wants something that Zorian doesn't know about. Which is saying something, since Zorian would probably help him get just about anything he wants.

There was an entire arc of collecting the keys to unbar the gate because someone else's exit had caused it to lock.

When they finally got all the keys, the primordial told them that it had already sent someone through and Silverlake was its /second/ agent. The Guardian even said the gate was barred again when they checked after Silverlake was gone, which shows that when the primordial sends someone to the real world, the gate locks itself.

For Zach to be RR he would have to find a way to trick the Guardian into thinking he had already left the loop. And the primordial, which wants Zach to be mind scrambled, would have had to lie for him. There's no way.

**** I am fairly sure that Zach has some motivation or secret, beyond the Red Robe thing, and even if the theory isn't true.

Maybe it's as simple as him still hating the government for what happened to his family, so he wants the invasion to succeed.

***** Oh, I'm sure Zach has something there...the mind alteration is definitely a chekov's gun. And I'm sure he's a little grumpy at the government. I just don't think it matches up with him being the big antagonist.

**** The "mad simulacrum" theory doesn't work because simulacrums don't have souls and you can't be in the time loop without a soul. Additionally, souls are impossible for human beings to create. It's highly implausible that a simulacrum could achieve a magical feat (creating a soul) in less than a month that is MORE impressive than the magical feat that almost a hundred temporary loopers working together along with Zach and Zorian couldn't manage in a year (altering the marker).

***** Well simulacrums are definitely in the time loop, as are all sorts of other non-souled objects.

Mmmm, I wonder if it's possible to put a temporary marker on a simulacrum.

Either way, I'd wager that Zach did something brilliant/stupid that resulted in the memory issue/etc. Not necessarily a simulacrum, though that'd be cool....but Zach can't actually be Red Robe for a number of reasons.

****** the marker that is put onto souls...? the marker that in of itself has no actual powers but is simply a tag for the Gate to replicate the soul on record?

*** Zach did not have soul sight until later in the story when he meets up with Zorian and Alanic. Without soul sight he can't learn the simulacrum spell.

** Just noticed this, but from this chapter:

"Once you get married, you may find your wife is not nearly as divorced from [...]"

Love the choice of words. You mention the divorce in the same sentence as in the one encouraging marriage. It's great, and entirely relevant.
