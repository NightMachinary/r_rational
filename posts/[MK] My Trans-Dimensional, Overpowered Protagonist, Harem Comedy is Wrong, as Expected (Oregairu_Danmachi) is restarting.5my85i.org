** This story went for quite a few months without any updates, but it seems the author's started to post new chapters again. It can also be found on fanfiction.net [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12308030/1/My-Trans-Dimensional-Overpowered-Protagonist-Harem-Comedy-is-Wrong][here]], where it's slowly updating. Here's a summary of what it's about:

It takes place in Danmachi's fantasy setting, which is a bit similar to D&D. Hikigaya, the main character of Oregairu, which takes place in our real world, is transported to the world of Danmachi, and is trying to progress to the end of the Dungeon in order to get back home. He finds the protagonist of Danmachi, Bell Cranel, who he recognizes as the protagonist of the light novel-esque world he's in, and decides to mentor him so he can tag along to the end of the Dungeon. The story seems to follow some of the plot points of Danmachi, which is a harem comedy anime. So I'd say the main appeal is probably the comedy of seeing a dour character like Hikigaya in Danmachi's setting, but there's also quite a bit of fantasy action/munchkinism.

**** I don't think you need to. I'm not familiar with Danmachi and was able to follow it. The world of Danmachi is basically based on dungeon crawling videogames, similar to D&D. The main element from Oregairu is the main character, Hikki. Familiarity with Oregairu might make it easier to understand his unhealthy mentality and his backstory, but I think it should be doable to pick up the important points as you go along.

*** What is the leveling like in Danmachi? There seems to be some optimization going on that isn't "level as quickly as possible". Characters seem to be delaying leveling in order to grind stats. Is there an appropriate wiki page for one to understand the motivations behind this?

**** I believe it worked something like your strength stat is as powerful as your combined score of the strength stat you earned during each level, which each level up 'resetting' your strength score -display-. So, if you went from F -> SSS (or whatever) during level one, you'd go back to F for level two but your actual effective strength would be Level1(SSS) + Level2(F). So, delaying the level up lets you put more into the Level 1 'bucket' before that bucket is permanently closed.
