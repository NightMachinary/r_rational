** On Tuesday, we're back to Simon Martin, and then we get to dive into some /really/ fun stuff. I'm working on this story in sequences of thirteen chapters, so we're juuuuuuust about to the middle of the first sequence.

If something has worked for you, then please let me know; that goes double if something isn't working for you! >:]

*Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

** It's not clear to me what he learned at the end, there. Did he attempt something, and it didn't work, or attempt something he thought wouldn't work, and it did?

*** I'll edit that tonight to make it clearer, but what he was testing was how fast, exactly, he can jump from body to body. He was able to do it before the first body he jumped from (Ricky) was able to react (and, presumably, freak out).

** You had three different people with names that started with a M which normally would have been fine, but when you rapidly switched to Michelle and then to Mandy, I got confused for a moment because I thought you were saying [[#s][that]].

I recommend changing Michelle's and Mandy's name to something else for clarity.

*** Whoops. Thanks for letting me know that was a problem. Michelle and Mandy are now Yvonne and Stephany.
