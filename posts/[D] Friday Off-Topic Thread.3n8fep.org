Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** I'm mostly upset by the /lazy/ brainstorming/question threads. If you want to /actually/ brainstorm, I think there's some onus on you to do the legwork first and give something for people to bouncing ideas off of. If it's just "Rational _____?", I tend to downvote those threads for their laziness. But if it's something like ... I don't know, getting someone to double-check your logic, point out something obvious you might have missed, get advice on storytelling, then I tend to think that's a lot better.

(Obviously I would prefer for the story to be fully written and the advice to be given after the fact, but getting advice after the fact increases the total workload because it involves both writing and editing instead of just writing correctly the first time.)

** I recently read Scott Hawkins' first novel, the Library At Mount Char. It's the best SF&F first novel I can remember since Clarke's Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Thanks to Nostalgebraist on tumblr for the rec.

The story is about a library that contains all the secrets and knowledge of the world, and a power struggle over it. The head of the library is ancient and seems immortal, but has now disappeared. This immortal raised a dozen orphan children and trained them all in the various arts the library contains such as medicine that allows true resurrection and languages of all of mankind as well as things like animals; and these characters, now in their thirties, are having to cope with leaving the library.

The novel is really exceptionally written and paced, and contains a lot of great humor. Also, very well written character interactions. Not for the faint of heart, though - it gets quite dark and disturbing a number of times.

Just a really wonderfully written novel, a strong recommendation. Not really rationalist in any way, so I waited to this off-topic thread to recommend it here.

Hawkins' description of the evolution of the title is amazing:

#+begin_quote
  I've found that a good way to get myself moving is to take the most ridiculous phrase I can come up with and try to write a book around that. For comparison, the working title of The Library at Mount Char was The Library at Mt. Sammich. In case you're wondering, the 'Library' part of the story came easily enough, but I had to really work to get the 'Mt. Sammich' part to fit. Ultimately the good folks at Crown decided "Sammich" had a misleading ring, so it got changed. For the record, I'm amazed that title made it as far as it did.

*** I put the likelihood as "high", assuming that society continues to function more or less the same.

Colonization killed a lot of languages. Globalization is killing a lot more. The reason we had so many languages in the past is that people were spread far apart and couldn't communicate with each other, which meant that language drift happened. Now, with the internet in play and increased connectivity, it seems like the pressures are all in place for languages to compete with each other until only one is left.

Language seems to me to be a sort of natural monopoly; it's more efficient if everyone is speaking the same one. Languages can only really specialize with regards to /culture/ now that geography is largely not an issue, because languages are too mutable to be missing vital features for long. There will still be /dialects/, /shifts/, and /jargon/ but a single common standard is so beneficial that we're naturally going to shift to a single one, even without government intervention.

*** In my opinion, never. I live in India where speaking superior English gets me called a 'Britisher'(angrezi) and a betrayer of our glorious culture.

Simultaneously there's an entire industry which thrives on this insecurity that most people here feel towards their inferior English. I can walk across the street and see at least two English coaching centers, these are the places that source your typical Indian call center support.

There's a few fringe elements that exploit people's pride in their local languages [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h5KzWac0_E][like this]]. To say that these people reject English would be an understatement. But, and this is my personal observation, unless you know English in India, your career is fucked.

Personally, I wish I knew no other language than English. Because knowing local languages (I know 3 others) has messed up my accent and changes the way [[http://www-psych.stanford.edu/%7Elera/papers/mandarin.pdf][I think]]. Indian languages are usually a mish-mash of the actual language and English itself and most have maybe 400-500 words in their spoken form.

  What does anyone think of the likelihood of there one day being a global language?
#+end_quote

Roughly equal to the likelihood of the internet staying intact. I think the internet and other global communications being destroyed would be the only thing that could really stop the possibility of a global language. I guess one other scenario that could happen would be if permanent space colonies were developed prior to the full emergence of a global language. Then the lightspeed delay might create enough separation in communication to allow new dialects and words to develop faster than they can spread.

*** I sincerely doubt that we'll ever have a single language. The reason is because languages are kinda like animal species in the sense that it's subject to evolution. Languages are constantly changing, growing, and shrinking all the time. The massive die-out of languages today is due to how globalization has forced the multiple languages to "compete" for speakers (think of languages as competing memes where there's not enough space for them all). Just like how when humans first traveled to new places on the globe and caused massive extinctions, so did English kill off foreign languages when it first spread to new places.

I predict that we'll reach some equilibrium in the number of languages present, and then new languages will start appearing again (probably some Internet-based languages or people will start emphasizing corporate loyalty and everyone will be speaking Pepsinese, Coca-colian, or McDonaldian).

I'm not sure what an Internet-based language even is, unless you're talking about conlangs, but conlangs, neither the personal sort that are created by hobbyists nor those created by institutions, will never take hold as primary languages. People speak what their parents spoke. As for brand loyalty, that's simply ludicrous. People partake in multiple major brands, and major brands do not separate geographically.

As for equilibrium, we already have it. Languages remain stable in population over years unless there are mass deaths of one or another. Languages that large populations speak are not made, they only ever arise out of old ones.

I'm not laughing at you but rather how I used to think the same thing.

So far machine translation is at the stage where computers are really good at translating words and phrases, but they can't really do a very good job with longer sentences or idioms. The best I have seen in machine translation so far is in Google who has so much data to throw at the problem that it works but it's not feasible for translating between two languages that aren't already extensively recorded online.

Granted there are amazing things happening in the field as we get better and better at handling large amounts of data and working with neural networks, but there's a reason why some people (nowadays? or used to?) think machine translation is equivalent to true AI.

The question is not whether "true" machine translation is AI-complete. /Perfect/ machine translation is probably superintelligence-complete, because /translations are innately imperfect/, so you'd need something with extremely thorough knowledge of multiple languages and cultures to do perfect, professional-quality translation that lets consumers of the translated product really experience all the depth and nuance that went into the original piece.

The question is /how good/ you can make your machine translation /without/ superhumanly well-cultured AI. It's entirely possible that we can get "90% effective" machine translation with 30% the statistical/cognitive machinery of a real brain.

*** Well it depends. One thing I could see happening would be two or three major languages spreading out as people pick the most common languages to learn, because those are obviously most useful. Eventually you would end up learning two main languages, much like most of Europe knows their native language and also English. So the Chinese would know English and the English would learn Chinese.

I'm not so sure it's going to happen though. English has the advantage of being the language of science. If you want knowledge, the majority of it is written in English and not translated when it comes to scientific papers and such. I'm not sure if Chinese has anything of similar pull. Whatever does happen, it will be slow. Most people don't learn new languages after they become adults.

*** White bisexual trans female, apparent male. Arizona. I was raised as a nondenominational Protestant. I was also raised as a science-lover, my biggest influence being Douglas Hofstadter.

Previously I saw Christianity as having a God-directed mission, and I was wondering why Christians didn't act consistently with moral duties laid out in the bible. At the same time, I was learning more and more science, and some moral philosophy. Evolution was never discouraged in our household, though I opposed it in middle school because it threatened my worldview. With some help from atheist writings, including Common Sense Atheism, I eventually learned what evolution was, learned what the problem of evil was, and the entire secular, empirical side of my life clicked into place and simply squashed my religious upbringing.

I have always been interested in AI research, and motivated thinking prevented me from really seeing AI safety as a problem. I dismissed the question of malice naturally, and at the same time I did not think value alignment was a problem, because AIs could approximate human value systems, and people have never tried or wanted to take over the world or anything. Continued exposure to MIRI's research, the Sequences, and Eliezer's deprecated publications (General Intelligence and Seed AI, Creating Friendly AI, Coherent Extrapolated Volition), convinced me that AI safety /was/ a serious problem, and that I had been wanting all along to build a gun without a handle.

My primary goal is to live as long as I like in a body I enjoy. This is contingent on safe AI. I was previously somewhat scornful of MIRI's research, even (especially) after I became convinced that AI safety was a problem, because all of their publications focus on incomputable agents. Then a friend reminded me that publishing research on bounded agents destroys the world. This makes me wonder if MIRI has a section of unpublished research purely for internal use. This makes me want to join MIRI.

I don't think I can join MIRI.

I am nearly twenty, and I feel old. Time is speeding up, and I can't keep the pace. I find it extremely hard to hold focus on one project for over two weeks, and my interests constantly cycle without ever progressing. Writing, AI, games, writing, AI, games. There are programmers I follow who are more capable than me, and I think one might be younger. I see the kind of people who /do/ join MIRI, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and I wonder why I ever thought I could slack off in high school. I am constantly masculinizing, and I hate the shape of my body. I have no job. I can't drive. I'm going to community college, taking more classes than I think I can handle in order to avoid being forced to /get/ a job, and I'm wasting time not studying math and computer science this semester. I'm isolated from people I know offline, and I don't have the social skills to make new friends even if I managed to find people I thought could stand me. I'm worried that all of the tests I've taken since kindergarten were wrong, and that I can't hack it in STEM. I have had these thoughts and problems continuously, even when I was on antidepressants, and I'm worried that they're right despite my depression, and that I will never get past them. I don't want to die, but I would sacrifice my life as it is to improve the chances of eutopia for the rest of the world. I just want to be told what to do. I can't handle this social, emotional bullshit.

#+begin_quote
  How so?
#+end_quote

Gah, you're making me invent new vocabulary on the fly. I can't promise to be clear, sorry.

Normally, we reason openly and inductively rather than closedly and deductively. That is, we experience things, and /then/ we generalize from the experiences. In fact, according to all the scientific and mathematical knowledge we have about cognition, /this is the only correct way/: you /can't/ build a map of the real world, effective in navigating the real world, from "first principles". You need information, and you need a process of inductive reasoning that transforms the information into increasingly accurate maps.

"Open" and "closed" here are just expressing whether or not our maps of the world can be updated to accommodate new information, or necessarily "break" and contradict themselves when trying to do so. Statistical, inductive, "cognitive" reasoning does the former; deterministic, deductive, "logical" reasoning does the latter.

Now, the problem with the psychology of religious worship, is that it takes ideas which were originally just important spots on very useful maps, and it turns them into the axioms of closed, deductive systems of reasoning. In doing so, it divests them of their original semantic content - the way they once mapped some territory - and instead replaces the semantic content with steadily increasing amounts of moralized browbeating. Over time, statements of the syntactic form, "It is the will of X!" or "It is for the honor of Y!" come to replace what were originally (understood to be -- many people thought their gods were real) justifications based on ordinary, bounded-consequentialist reasoning, of the form, "Do it so A will happen" or "Do it so B /won't/ happen".

To quote Terry Pratchett on what this looks like:

#+begin_quote
  “Around the Godde there forms a Shelle of prayers and Ceremonies and Buildings and Priestes and Authority, until at Last the Godde Dies. Ande this maye notte be noticed.”
#+end_quote

Thus my belief that if you really, actually /like/ your ideas/gods/whatever, you should avoid /worshipping/ them under any circumstances. This is not some Popperian belief about how "everything should be criticized", especially because I tend to believe that a /sufficiently motivated/ critic can find something to criticize even in entirely true statements and entirely real phenomena, simply by inventing "foundational" or "philosophical" problems where none had previously existed. It's from the belief that if I like an idea, the best loyalty to that idea is to understand it (including any flaws it might genuinely have), understand its context among ideas, and understand its domain of applicability. Loyalty to a map /means/ keeping it accurate, which entails never drawing sparkles on one spot on the map and scribbling out everything else on grounds of "holy holy hallelujah!".

#+begin_quote
  Rituals reinforce community and social bonds.
#+end_quote

You can also have rituals that are /about/ community and social bonds, in which case they won't spoil any poor ideas.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know, we got pretty far and I don't see any obvious signs of stopping.
#+end_quote

I don't think that's true. I think that civilization got far precisely by using the data of real-world experience to reason inductively and adjust our maps of the world (including the counterfactual structure of the world, the coulda-beens and woulda-beens). If people /really/ used /totally/ non-realist, anti-naturalist meta-ethical reasoning, the phrase, "Well that's just a bad idea" /would not exist/. People would just doggedly push on with absurd, stupid things of no value whatsoever /because holy-holy-hallelujah/. Sufficiently advanced non-realist moral codes of the kind you're describing become indistinguishable from compulsive disorders /precisely because/, to everyone else around the person with the sense of moral compulsion, they appear to be trading things off in ways that don't correspond to world-states that they care about minus the compulsion. The compulsion is a desire or sense of duty that is far out of accord with the rest of the person's desires and senses of duty.

(Notably, compulsive disorders are fairly good evidence that normativity is a kind of emotion or sense-of-thought that can be tuned up or tuned down and, like all other such human emotions and senses, has to be carefully calibrated before it can be used as an instrument for measuring something about world-states.)

I tend to make fun of Effective Altruism for these reasons:

- Hedonic utilitarianism, which I think is wrong because it leads to wireheading and thus /fails to map the moral territory/.

- Most especially, /Peter Singer's/ writings about ethics and utilitarianism, in which he /openly states/ that he does not necessarily think moral realism can be defended, but that he feels an ethical duty to brush this anti-realist stance under the rug in favor of getting more people to do good. This isn't just intellectual dishonesty, it's a basic intellectual self-contradiction: [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/rq/what_would_you_do_without_morality/]["Morals aren't real, but don't tell people that or they'll stop donating to charity!"]]

- Unconsidered, unreflective support of the present form of neoliberal global capitalism, and its modes of doing philanthropy and development.

As [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] once stated when expressing his relationship to neoreaction, "The wheel of progress only turns one way." I am not making fun of Effective Altruism because they think morals are real. To the contrary, I am making fun because they think morals are a silly game of appeasing their single emotion of duty!

************ You're talking about a hypothetical religious society/person that completely closes its thought process to the idea of updating based on evidence, or somehow implying that such a society has ever existed. In other words, you've constructed an elaborate strawman and proceeded to pummel it mercilessly at length to signal your allegiance to non-religious thought and societies.

But the fact is, that's not the kind of society I'm advocating in favour of, at all, nor is this generally how religious societies work. In case you haven't noticed, religious beliefs and rituals mostly deal in assertions with little or no predictive power, in fact, they mostly tend to avoid situations that would expose them to falsifiability. In general, religious institutions (of the kind I'm advocating for) don't tend to magistrate on areas that are both

- Easily falsifiable by rational inference from available evidence

and

- Have significant predictive power in an area that affects people's daily lives

So, for example, organised religions tend to magistrate on what amounts to sin and what kind of penance is required for its absolution, which reinforces societal norms and a sense of community, but they don't tend to magistrate on the required wing areas of aeroplanes, which would probably cause several deaths before they got it right, for no measurable benefit over just trusting engineers.

It's easily one of the most advantageous career choices to go for, if you don't happen to have career goals beyond, "It's indoor work with no heavy lifting, they'll pay nicely for it, and people will consider me a Respectable Member of Society." It also fits /very/ nicely with certain incentives people deal with these days, such as more traditional Respectable Professions like law or medicine carrying heavy burdens of student debt; finance, consulting, and management being founded around elite cliques; and Generic White Collar Employees slowly ceasing to exist.

If you have an analytical turn of mind, don't want to spend more than 3-4 years in school, don't want to take on slave-labor or heavy debts at the beginning of your career (or want to be able to pay them off reasonably), and want to make a living with your analytical turn of mind, software engineering is a good choice.

***** Eaturbrainz is correct. I think if you're able to be an engineer of any sort, that's often a safe, solid choice for a career and does not require an expensive graduate degree. Being a software engineer has lower entry requirements than other forms of engineering, like electrical engineering.

I wonder if it's something where being a rationalist helps one make this sort of decision, or if being the sort of person who makes this kind of decision makes one likely to seek out rationalism. I imagine it's more of the latter and less of the former.

** So. [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/][Undertale]]. It's pretty much my favorite game ever, beyond any shadow of a doubt.

It's a deconstruction of traditional RPGs and video games in general. While you're given the option to fight monsters, the game tacitly encourages you to use MERCY -- talking things out with monsters in order to avoid killing them. Whether you choose MERCY or to FIGHT everything you come across vastly affects whether the game is a lighthearted, heartwarming (and heartbreaking) adventure or whether the game will treat you like the genocidal scum you play at being.

It is entirely possible to get through the entire game without killing a single monster.

The humor, to me at least, was top notch -- though YMMV on that -- if you enjoy either Earthbound or Homestuck humor, you'll probably enjoy this. And on the topic of Homestuck, the creator, Toby Fox, is one of the musicians for it, and it shows in this game; the music is exceptional, and so is the story. Most of the soundtrack is available at his [[https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/][bandcamp]], excepting a few more spoilery songs.

I really enjoyed Undertale and it's left me a tearful mess the last few weeks.

I'm veering towards having the supernatural be a real thing, but where the Mystery gang are dealing mostly with normal people in a monster get-up. It would partially explain why there's never any actual authorities to investigate. They're too scared or incapable of handling the supernatural and whenever there's a possibility of the supernatural, everyone steers clear. The Masquerade is partially maintained through willful ignorance and it's more common than not for people to have had a supernatural encounter or to know someone who has 'disappeared'. Therefore, the Mystery gang are often the only ones actually willing investigate and stop people using the possibility of the supernatural as a threat. Of course, it helps that they are better prepared than the average individual if it turns out to be a genuine supernatural event...

Scooby-Doo talks because....well....I'm actually spoiled for choice on what to go with. Telepathy with only the group, failed possession by ghost granting speech, a friend cursed into the form of a dog, spiritual connection granting the ability to communicate with any living creature, or even a dog-shaped eldritch abomination who was the first supernatural encounter/monster who they beat and bound into servitude. The last one is really tempting and I think I might have him only speak in words starting with the letter R as part of the *Rules* he follows as part of his unnatural nature.

Also, cursed monster costumes would explain why so many weekly-villains will be such perfect actors. Seriously, they will act so much like an actual animal/beast/monster that one would swear that they were really monsters.

If the supernatural is known to exist in-universe, then I think in this counterfactual universe, I would have been drawn to whatever scientific field is doing the most to study it. I mean, right now I am interesting in AI and computational neuroscience because AI has the most potential to alter/influence the world, and neuroscience has so much left to learn and develop. In a world were the supernatural existed, often enough for it to be recognized to exist, but still rare, exotic and dark enough that science hasn't really studied it, I would definitely be interested in it, and I think most rationalists would (even if the acknowledged danger made it not worth the trouble to actually study).

In terms of meeting the Scooby gang, I would definitely want to talk to them once I realized they regularly encountered supernatural phenomena. Maybe try to get some phone numbers and offer to do analysis or experimentation on any previous mysteries that have leftover persisting supernatural phenomena? (They may have banished that ghost a few months ago, but they saved samples of ectoplasm that a solid analysis on could be the basis of some good dissertation work)

So technology is at the level of simple computers with no real working Internet. I need to make it hard for the gang to contact with the rest of the world without forcing them into extremely isolated places. So I'm nerfing communication technologies with the cause being either a techno-crash, or the supernatural actively cutting communications to keep their 'prey' from ganging up on them like a herd of cows stampeding. So probably 1990s level of technology like in the show, but with a few more advanced pieces from the 2020s.

In addition, the supernatural isn't just a strange breed of creatures or exotic physics-bending energy. They're meant to be more like the creatures from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales where they were atrocious, horrifying monsters who you could only run away from and not fight. These are not your Tinker-Bell style fairies. Before you even suggest humans working together and using technology against them, I'll point out that they are /smart/ monsters who have learned to adapted to using technology. These monsters are careful to never overprey on any one city to terrify everyone into fighting instead of fleeing, and they are cautious to remain as the scary /unknown/ threat instead of the scary /known/ threat. Also they understand the out-of-sight, out-of-mind rule very well.

I mean, if I'm going to be writing a rational story, then I better make the monsters rational as well.

The story's going to an even balance of dark and light-hearted moments, but it's set in a fairly dark world.

To brainstorm more on the internet angle... it seems like high tech, high information areas like universities or such should at least be able to set up a good local network.

Hey, I needed an actual problem that most W.E.I.R.D. folks could sympathize with. Not the traditional wasteland where everyone needs to forage for food, I want my characters to /suffer!/

I was planning on allowing localized networks to continue working, since humanity didn't lose the ability to make the tech, they just lost the ability to implement it on a national to global scale.

Phone lines are a bit of a tricky choice. I need to think about it, but there definitely should still be some allowance for localized telephone lines. The monsters just want to make it easy to isolate smaller towns, but they'd also like the ability to make a phone call. So significantly more infrastructure for phones should remain versus the infrastructure for the Internet. I need to spend some time studying just how one could shut down the Internet and what point in its history and development would the monsters have done it (they definitively wouldn't have allowed it to get to the current day's level of connectivity).

I'm thinking about how long range radio and sending low band-width texts might work.

The characters are basically being forced to forage for information. They know there exists a ritual to banish the ghost or stop the witch or whatever the monster of the week is... but the only book they know of that has instructions on this is in a University hundreds of miles away... So instead they are left with the option of searching through the spooky abandoned library in the mansion for some applicable knowledge.

Here is a good example to consider:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Thailand_floods#Damages_to_industrial_estates_and_global_supply_shortages]]

Floods in Thailand knocked out 25% of the world's hard drive production, causing prices to double for some time. If the monsters have access to magic that can cause natural disasters, then carefully targeted natural disasters to various key locations could gradually slow technological progress. Moore's law is a self fulfilling prophecy... and people have been expecting to end or slow for some time. It takes a lot of investment to keep improving. If the right companies had gotten hit at the right times maybe the monsters could break the cycle of technological improvement.

Also, in general you might consider what technologies depend on computers to improve, what technologies could continue to advance without computers improving. Also, what technologies require large centralized infrastructure development and investment to be possible. I imagine SpaceX wouldn't exist in this run-down world.

So first just addressing meeting a talking dog, before I run into any supernatural stuff. Hmm... is this set in the modern day? I would google for talking dog if I didn't already know about talking dogs... actually how would the existence of talking dogs play out?

Possibility 1) In this universe, maybe talking dogs are actually a rare, but scientifically known thing? I mean Scooby has relatives that can talk, right? Maybe in-universe a breed of dogs was breed to be sapient. In this counter-factual universe, I would be a vegetarian if there wasn't know to be massive neuro-anatomical or neuro-biological differences between this talking dog breed and other dogs (I would interpret it as evidence that dogs, and animals in general are much closer to human level of sapience). I would excited to meet a talking dog in person, but I would try not to be too awkward or weird about it. My googling (or maybe asking reddit for advice if I have time) would let me know how to interact in a polite way with a non-human sapient.

Possibility 2) Talking dogs aren't known in universe. I would be expecting it to be a prank or surrealist art or something weird like that. If I can rule out these possibilities, then I get suspicious of some weird possibilities. I would google search for Scooby... if I found evidence that Scooby and his talking relatives were scientifically known, I would be highly puzzled why they aren't famous... I might expect some kind of conspiracy or mass mind manipulation. If Scooby is entirely unknown to the internet and society, then I really expect some form of mind-manipulation. Once I see other supernatural stuff, I am going to be almost sure of some kind of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade][masquerade]]. I would be expecting the Scooby gang or government agents to try to wipe my memory when this was done. They are probably used to people trying to resist, so I will only put up a believable token resistance, and then leave myself hidden messages according to plans I have worked out ahead of time.

If I can make it through everything without getting my mind wiped or any other thing to make me ignore it, either Randi (assuming he is not in on the conspiracy/masquerade also), or I am probably going to heavily pursue occult knowledge/power. Depending on what type of time commitment and skill set developing magical knowledge/skill requires. I might give up working on my PhD and try to find a job that will pay enough to get by and have flexible enough hours so I can work on studying magic more.

**** Thanks! In the Scooby-Dooverse I'm imagining, strange things are extremely common and the people in the know attempt to disguise it by manufacturing entirely different, yet also weird events to minimize accurate knowledge spreading.

So many people would be aware that something weird is happening but it's dangerous to get involved, and they all live in a culture where it's normal to ignore it (like how Japanese society will ignore people not acting appropriately (not sure how accurate this is, but something similar is what I'm going for)).

So your reaction from possibility #1 is very helpful.

***** More brainstorming on the talking dog thing: I would imagine there would be subreddit or two devoted to talking dogs. Maybe some tumblr hashtags for talking dog rights? It would be kind of a fringe social issue. Religious nuts would deny talking dogs' rights, while more liberal religions would treat them as a target for evangelism.

Thanks I'm really proud of it. I just asked myself, "If in that movie, it's really obvious that magic exists with the wizards flinging spells in broad daylight and yet people are still ignorant, what could explain this effect without using any magic?"

From there I came up with either fear/caution of getting involved with high dangerous activities, knowledge it exists but there's no reliable information, or some souped-up Bystander Effect ingrained into the culture itself. Of course, why use only one method to maintain the masquerade when you can use them all!

There's a lot of causes/subreddits for the more benign and minor supernatural stuff, but they rarely get anywhere since a lot of people are just running some sort of financial scams, deliberate misleading groups by those in the know, and monsters deliberately tend to prey on groups like that. Of course when the Internet went down permanently, such groups dissolved.

However, while they lasted there was a large number of groups where one could learn the right things quickly enough (and caused the monsters to focus attacks on the communications systems) and that's how I imagine Velma getting a lot of her encyclopedic knowledge from and giving the gang a nice initial boost in experience to survive the initial unlucky occurrences.

People are varied and there is a wide spread of personalities across both genders. Treat all your characters as if they are supposed to be people, not stereotypes. Write your female characters the same as you would your male characters.

Speaking as a women pursuing a degree in computer engineering, I don't really feel the gender disparity. I /notice/ stereotypes and social conventions but then I choose to do my own thing. I notice that there are five other girls in a class of thirty (the only reason I notice is because everyone makes a big stink over women in STEM), and then I move on. I don't behave differently in classes with different gender ratios. Most of the differences I see between me and my classmates I chalk up to personality differences, not gender differences. People are People.

**** This only really works if you're writing in a setting where society has achieved perfect gender equality, or you're writing a character whose gender has never had any explicit /or implicit/ impact on them (alternately, a character who you backfill the details on, but then I'd argue you're not tacking that stuff on /last/).

Like, if my character doesn't have a gender, I can't really think about how they react to their gender norms. They can't possibly be shaped by a mother who wanted a daughter instead of a son. Hell, if they have children, their experience with that child is probably a quite different depending on their gender. And the further back in time you go, the more differences you're going to run into; if your character is a reporter in the 1930s, you can't flip a coin at the /end/, because a female reporter in the 1930s is necessarily going to look totally different from a male reporter in the 1930s, just because of the way that they were shaped by society (whether that's conforming or reacting against).

So I tend to flip a coin on gender early on and think about what effect gender would have had, which causes changes even if I assume that men and women are internally identical.

** People always hype the Wheel of Time series, so I thought I'd give it a try. Got 3/4 into the first book and just gave up. It's just so... stereotypical? Obvious? Tropey? Was all this stuff fresh and new when it first came out?

The characters annoy me. Small Town McDestiny is incapable of following basic instructions (What's that? You're in a ruined haunted city and the wizard lady has told you not to go wander? Better go wandering!). Wizard Lady is incapable of giving proper instructions and basic pattern recognition (What's that? You want McDestiny to stay close? Better give some vague and cryptic warning instead of actually telling him any actionable facts. Like, said, you could mention that you've warded the room and smoke demons will try to eat him if he leaves it. Seems like the kind of thing you'd want to know.). Missy Manhater I assume is supposed to be a strong female character, but her defining traits seem to be bigotry with a side of sexism rounded off with a dollop of stubbornness.

Now, I wouldn't care about this. I'd just brush it off as and move on. I read worse things often enough and they don't bug me at all, but everyone keeps talking like this book is some fantastic classic on the level of aSoIaF and such and I just don't get it.

*** I had more or less the same experience with /Wheel of Time/ and was similarly puzzled. The books came out in 1990, so it can't really be that they were doing anything /new/, since so many series predate it.

Here are my twin explanations:

1. While it wasn't doing anything too terribly new, it caught a generation of fantasy readers at just the right time. Let's say that you're born in 1975. The first book comes out when you're 15. It's entirely possible that this is among the first fantasy books that you read. So you don't really know the cliches, you don't really care about the places where it's uneven, it fires your imagination.
2. The series is long, so people have buy-in. I have long had the theory that even if quality is low (something I'm not really ready to say about /Wheel of Time/, even if the first book didn't do it for me) you can make up for it with length. There's some sort of literary Stockholm Syndrome thing that goes on if someone is a million words in. So /Wheel of Time/ is long and builds up credit by being long.

***** I think, as a more general principle, length is virtue. /Why/ is a complex question, but I think there are a few parts to it:

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect][Mere-exposure effect.]] We tend to like things that we're familiar with. A book that's two hundred pages gives you less of a chance for familiarity than a book that's a thousand pages, or a series of books that are each five hundred pages. By the time you're a million words in, you're very exposed to the material, which means that you'll look on that thing favorably.
2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization][Post-purchase rationalization.]] A longer book (or long series of books) requires more from the reader, both in terms of money spent on the books and time spent reading the books. We want to think that we've made the right choice in how we spend our time/money, so we convince ourselves that we made the right choice.
3. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_perception][Selective perception]]. We get used to minor annoyances. After maybe twenty pages, you get used to any quirks in the prose or other issues with the writing. You have to go through this again with each new session of reading, but you get better at acclimating every time. Eventually it's just automatic and your brain is censoring out all the problems unless you're particularly good and/or diligent at being a mindful reader.

And I should note that this applies even if the books in question are /fantastic/.

It was magic system drew me in as a teen. I'm hard pressed to think of other fantasy series around in the 90s that had as strongly developed systematic magic. And I stuck with them because they had good strong endings. There were satisfying payoffs to plot threads that'd had 15 years of waiting/anticipation, which is something to savour. As far as improvement, as the series goes on it gets more intricate and or sprawling - more characters, more plotlines, more details. I'd probably say books 4-6 are the high point - there's half a dozen separate plot threads in each, but they still reinforce each other through structure and theme, and come together for a big climax.
