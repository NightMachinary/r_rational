Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Seeking: Someone who understands organizational theory, mediation, dispute resolution, and/or related topics; and/or suggestions for books on the same; and/or links to relevant subreddits, forums, websites, etc.

I've recently realized that I've made some unconscious assumptions about how certain fictional problems could best be handled, and I want to find out what other options might be available. One example: publicly precommitting to use a neutral third-party mediator in case of a dispute has certain advantages, but I don't know enough about the topic to know if this might lead to any unfortunate incentives that wouldn't appear with some other dispute-resolution scheme, or that might be handled by being careful about certain details. Also have some questions on several related topics.

Any pointers?

*** Not an expert on these topics, so I may not be very helpful at discussing them, but have you tried [[/r/worldbuilding]]? It's a pretty good place to ask for stuff like that.

** Any Biologists/Chemists around? What are the minimal conceits necessary for a hypothetical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotroph][chemolithotrophic]] (rock eating) macrofauna to exist, on an earth-like planet? By earth-like, I mean in addition to similar size, gravity, solar radiation, etc., it can also support humans (with minimal alterations) and familiar types of animal and plant species.

Would it be enough for them to have several mechanisms to get energy, and live in a persistent (on geological timescales) hot, mineral-rich environment? Wikipedia lists a few mechanisms that seem promising, namely oxidation of ferrous iron, nitrites, and sulfides; all respirating oxygen and with water as a byproduct.

If it couldn't work for the sole energy source, could they instead use some symbiotic relationship with bacteria as a primary energy source? (And if so, what's the most they could get away with eating just rocks?)

How much "food" would they have to consume? What would be some likely features of their biology as a consequence of rock-eating?

Also, how might they have evolved? I was thinking the gut-bacteria symbiosis thing sounds promising, but I'm definitely not a biologist. Would it be plausible for them to have co-evolved with various forms of bacteria?

*** Obligatory not a biologist. Unfortunately, I don't think that rocks have anything /near/ enough energy inside them to sustain macrofauna, especially when you consider how much rocks weigh. All known macrofauna, except for some ocean bound species like jellyfish and coral, rely on plants directly or indirectly to get their energy. They rely on humongous unstable molecules to get their energy, either proteins, carbohydrates, or triglycerides, none of which can last millions of years virtually unchanged. Even a /completely free, weightless/ source of energy isn't enough for most things. Moving just takes too much energy. You might be able to get away with chemical reactions between elements, but the purity and amount you would need them in would mean that nothing could evolve to depend on them before you ran out.

The only energy source that could be depended on, I think, is nuclear. I'm pretty sure that a specialized metabolic system could basically capture the effects of photosynthesis, except instead of molecules aimed at the sun it would be individual radionuclides. [[#s][tag]]

Of course, even if they can't use rocks for fuel, they should be perfectly capable of digesting rock. I know of one sea sponge that uses glass to build it's skeleton, and there's a mollusk with magnetite teeth.
