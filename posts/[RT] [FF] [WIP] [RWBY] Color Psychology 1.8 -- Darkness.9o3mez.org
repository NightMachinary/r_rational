** Your portrayal of communication learning disability is spot-on. Ruby's characterization makes her very realistic and relatable. The others' reactions to her are also very realistic and relatable. I say this from experience as someone who has a communication learning disability myself. Bravo! Can't wait for the next chapter. :)

** I wanted to be (appropriately) sad for Ruby this whole chapter, but I couldn't stop laughing at the fact that you were doing the /thing/. The character-listens-in-on-the-exact-conversation-that-happens-to-be-dramatically-relevant-at-that-given-moment thing.

I don't really blame Weiss here, because I know /exactly/ what kind of mindset can lead to this kind of thing. One of the worst moments in my life was when I did this exact thing to one of my friends. It's easy to vent about just about anything when you think you're alone. I can't say I blame Ruby either. /But,/ I think if I were her, I would walk away and wait to see if Weiss says anything about it in person - obviously, you can't just unhear it, but a valid test for whether or not someone really believes what they say is to see if they say it again in a different context. That way, you avoid the responsibility of having to figure out whether they meant it yourself. I don't know if Ruby can do this, or if it would feel more like running away from a problem for her.

As for the rest of the chapter. Is RWBY trying to hack into the surveillance system just to get a look at her sister, or is she trying to use it to communicate to Yang's pad? I found that confusing. I liked the conversation by the river, specifically, the line where Weiss reveals that they're being watched, because it injects a new dynamic into how Ruby strategizes about things. On the other hand, I think her getting distracted by it and nobody really /trying/ to stop her other than Jaune - just because "Ruby is weird" or whatever - seems to me like a weird mix up of priorities. They've only known Ruby for maybe eight hours and haven't seen her on her pad once, other than navigating with the map, so they don't think it's a little strange that she's spending so much time with it now? It just feels like they had a lot of time to make the communication mishap, but it only seems to happen after Ruby's done doing her little project.

If Ruby didn't catch fish, what did they eat?

That's basically it. Despite that I basically poked a bunch of holes in the chapter, I did really enjoy this one, maybe a little more than the last.

Thanks for letting me know; I'll clarify that part. (She's trying to triangulate the positions of the surveillance drones by measuring how strong the signal they're transmitting is at different points, not hack into the network. Her assumption is that one of the drones is probably roughly over her sister's head.)

** Ruby's so adorbs =D

I loved the part about her semblance and flow state.

** I'm enjoying this story so far, but hoo boy am I looking forward to getting past the intense focus on Ruby having trouble dealing with... everything... and on to the actual plot.

*** I dunno, I'm personally enjoying the author's portrayal of Ruby's social issues precisely because it's looking to be a huge chunk of the 'actual plot'.

When your society's existence relies on a literally institutionalized process of creating child soldiers, how those children function mentally and socially is going to be a big deal. Training people to slice up bogeymen is relatively easy; training them to think clearly and cooperate despite being flawed human beings is really, really not.

**** I agree. It's not easy even when said people /aren't/ clearly neurodivergent in ways that heavily disadvantage them socially. Which is why I want to get past Ruby struggling with that, and get to the part where this school has to teach /everyone/ in it how to be an effective Hunter.

**** What interests me is the systems in place to force these child soldiers into being more emotionally stable, as a necessity because there are monsters in the world attracted by emotional outbursts.

And how the system seems to easily fail when presented with scenarios or personas which are out of the ordinary.
