**** Sorry, let me rephrase. A short description about what makes the story fit for this subreddit.

***** Okay.

I included the story, because while I wouldn't say it's rational fiction (although no one's really holding the Idiot Ball, just dealing with Outside-Context Problems), it does a really good job of coming up with novel ways to take advantage of telekinesis so weak that it's like a gentle nudge. How the main character Tarc munchkin his telekinesis and sensing heat into winning against multiple armed enemies makes for a very good cerebral thriller.

Also, the first book in the series is free. So I'm much more willing to endorse it in a separate post instead of just putting it in the Off-Topic Friday Thread, since the only 'price' is taking the time to read it and you can stop reading if it ever gets boring/unappealing.

****** Claiming that his telekinesis is weak seems a bit much to me. The ability to sense and control things at a nearly atomic level is insanely powerful. [[#s][If he was really rational]]

******* I think you misunderstood me. When I said his telekinesis was weak, I meant it in terms of physical force it can exert. In terms of ability or versatility, yeah it's really powerful and useful.

Also in the author's notes in the end of the book, [[#s][to do what you suggest]]

** Read it (and sequels) over the last few days. I enjoyed it there is some rational thinking used for healing and killing. The stories are somewhat small in scope and generally well written however don't go into them to be a piece of literature.

Overall its worth a read due to the simple writing and interesting plot that does not over reach.

** As they're releasing it free, I hope the mods don't mind if I include a [[https://kat.cr/telekinetic-a-hyllis-family-story-1-epub-t9506723.html][torrent link]] for those non-kindle users that want to read it.

** Just started this yesterday. Just finished this today.

It's probably not an instant classic, but I think it works rather well.

I also like the way it sort of works as a medical thriller. Sort of the joy of discovery with the tension of the wound.
