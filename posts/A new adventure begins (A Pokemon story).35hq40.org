Hello guys! This is the start of a Pokémon story I will be writing. Any feedback is welcome and please let me know if you would like a chapter 2!

EDIT: As per Aretii's advice I went through the whole story and fixed all of the grammar mistakes. I hope it will now be more enjoyable to read!


** This has more than two problems.

Irrespective of whether or not it's a "rational" story and thus appropriate for this sub (check out the sidebar for the definition), which is hard to tell from one chapter, I feel you're in sore need of an editor. There are basic errors of capitalization and punctuation, especially when dialogue gets involved. There are typos of the kind spellcheck should be able to find ("letetr"), which says unfortunate things. Many of your sentences are just kind of... clunky and rife with cliché ("A bellow that shook the earth itself filled the air"). Your paragraph breaks don't make sense ("Tyranitar let out another blow, as if he was testing the mountain itself. / In return another mountain of snow started descending.") and are in general far too frequent. The narration contradicts itself (in one paragraph, Pikachu is explicitly not trying to intimidate Gold, and in the next it is). These are all technical problems which a good editor should be able to help you clean up. It's hard to judge your story, themes, and characters from a single chapter. I will say that "Gold goes to Red on Mount Silver and learns his story" is an idea with potential, but you still have to do a lot of work to realize that potential.

I see from your ffn profile that you have read and enjoyed Origin of Species. Game of Champions is linked on the front page of this sub at the moment - you should read that as well. It does a fine (though by no means perfect) job of communicating the tone you seem to be going for in your characterization, and is very good at describing Pokemon and making them feel like characters in their own right.

EDIT: Also, "but when the indigo league needed him most he vanished" sounds like it came right out of Avatar: the Last Airbender's opening narration and really should be reworded.

*** First of all I would like to thank you reading my story and writing out this reply. I will go through it again and check for these obvious grammar mistakes and I hope they did not take away from the main idea of the story.

I hope to make the story rational as it goes on but I wanted this chapter to set up the story, so I did not want to do anything to plot heavy. Once again I will try to iron out this mistakes and hope you would be willing to read chapter two!

PS:No idea why I made that homage to Avatar but I will rewrite it.

You'd be surprised to know how many stories posted here with that promise never end up becoming rational. Rational stories almost always have a rational /setting/, and as we can tell that from the first chapter, it isn't. I guess it could still be, but it looks like game's setting combined with the anime's for now. Rational doesn't mean serious, or edgy, or more realistic than the source material (though that's usually a part of it).

Speaking about the fic itself, my suggestion is that you wait until you have 20k words or so before posting again, so we can tell what the story is actually about.

** I'm not sure if your edit has gone through successfully, as I literally found a couple of dozen errors, not counting repeated ones. (Typhlosion is written as Typlosion repeatedly, but I only counted it once) This included "letetr", which Aretii specifically mentioned.

I have to agree with all of Aretii's points. The story asks some good questions, but currently doesn't look interesting enough to make me want to know the answers, and shows no particular sign of rationality. I'm guessing that Red's rationality is the key to his extraordinary success, but there is literally no hint of this anywhere in the text as of yet. If this hadn't been submitted here and I'd instead stumbled across it by browsing new ff.net stories, I would have no indication whatsoever that the story was supposed to be about this.

If you can write some more chapters (I suggest before submitting anything), enough to show the reader the point of the story and that it's both worth reading and worth submitting to the subreddit, I'd be willing to serve as an editor. I'm not a fantastic writer, but I can help you iron out the technical problems such as poor grammar.

If my guess about Red's success is correct, I'd also advise scrapping the first chapter entirely, and rewriting it. Including some references as to how Red got his success from the POV of a skilled trainer who has witnessed it would make the rationality of the story more obvious, and intrigue the reader. I imagine someone who has cut through the league in this fashion would have done so in a rather confusing way that makes others very interested in how it occurred, which is presumably why Gold has climbed this mountain and wants to hear the story. After all, I'm sure that regular news sources would have told the low-hanging fruit already, considering you could look up, say, Michael Jordan's entire life history right now. But if you're an aspiring NBA player, you might want to hear from Jordan himself, if you seek to be like him.

*** Thank you for writing out this reply. You were right, it did not update, though now it should be fixed.

I actually thought about your advice, and have decided to rewrite the whole story from scratch. I will repost the story here when it is is sufficiently long, (probably 10,000 words I think).

Thank you for suggestions!

**** No problem! Once you have those 10,000 (or close to it, I'm not going to insist on an arbitrary word count) feel free to PM me if you still want or need an editor / beta reader.
