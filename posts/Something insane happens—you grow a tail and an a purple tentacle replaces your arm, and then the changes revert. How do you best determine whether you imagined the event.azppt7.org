I agree I wouldn't assume it was real, but I'd probably look for other proximate causes for me hallucinating rather than just ignoring it and going on with my life.* Hallucinations are very rare and almost always accompanied by larger issues. not just spontaneously happening.

Hypothesises would be:

- Have I accidentally consumed a hallucinogenic substance? e.g. I think there's some kinds of mold that do it, or someone could hae spiked my food/water with lsd. If I have been at a party or group meal in the last 24 hours I would check with other people there to see if they're okay. I'd check if the supermarkets or re4staurants I'd gotten food from had any health scandals in the news, etc.

- Do I have any family history of psychosis?

- Have I suffered any other symptoms that a quick google tells me are associated with conditions that cause hallucinations, e.g. headaches, dizziness, nausea. An based on that is it likely I have a brain tumor or something else needing urgent attention?

- is there some unexpected side effect of any medication I'm on?

- Have I been sleeping enough, hydrated enough, etc

****** How does the fact that it can't it be filmed manifest? That would make me suspicious that it was a delusion. Anyway, once I somehow determined that I wasn't hallucinating which is a /very/ tall order I'd be trying to convince more people that it was real. And if I find that I can't for some reason, it would increase the probability that I was insane. I'd probably go live in an environment with lots of other people so they can observe the phenomenon. I'd also find other ways to make records if not video (E.g. put the tentacle against a mold, douse the tentacle in paint and press it against things, take a video of the tentacle's shadow, etc)

I wouldn't bother limiting the spread of the information, I see no a priori reason to assume the information is dangerous or should be kept closely guarded.

******** Does the protagonist /have/ to be 100% rational and immediately check themselves into a mental institution? As a reader, having the protagonist acknowledge that they're /probably/ hallucinating but still investigating it because of a strong feeling of it being real would be enough for me to feel that their actions are plausible.

If it were me, assuming I also didn't seek help immediately, I would keep track of when it happens and what my environment is like to see if there are common threads between occurrences. I would start recording myself whenever socially appropriate. I would search internet forums for mentions of similar occurrences, and see if I can gain some sort of insight from other people discussing the phenomenon (even if I can't ever be sure that it's not just some crackpot on the other side of the screen).

If I found someone who talks about an experience with the /exact/ same thing that I was experiencing, I could use that as evidence that I'm not insane, although it certainly wouldn't be proof.

I'd try to record myself knocking something over with the tail/tentacle/other anomalous appendages. If the recording shows things moving when I couldn't have touched them, that's pretty good proof of it being real. I would ask someone else to look at the footage too to confirm.

It would be very difficult to convince anyone this was real. From an outsider's perspective, any footage could have been faked. I don't think I would even try releasing the information to the public, although I could probably manage to convince a few close friends if I was able to interact with things using the appendages in ways that are clearly supernatural.

********** To an extent. The weight of that drops off sharply as the first few people confirm that it makes sense to think something strange is going on. (Because then, either I'm sane, I'm building an insane cult of a certain popularity, or I'm sufficiently detached from reality so as to hallucinate that people believe me, so convincing addition people after the first several may not help determining additional sanity. It would also be important that the particular people i convinced aren't particularly prone to believing in supernatural things and conspiracy theories, or the type prone to playing along with a crazy person's delusions to avoid upsetting them.)

But yes, if literally no one but me experiences these things or in any way confirms that there's some form of unusual phenomenon going on that can't be explained strictly by me hallucinating and confabulating explanations around it, i think insanity should be pretty high up there as a hypothesis.

****** If it can't be filmed, we could film the physical effects it can have on the world to confirm the possibility of it being real. Say you can control the tail? Take a picture or film yourself holding something at maximum distance. Said item should look like it's effectively floating in air. This would allow you to confirm for yourself that it's real, though others might assume it's simply a picture taken while the item was thrown in the air.

If you don't have control over said tail, weigh it down against something hip-high and set something on it, tissue/paper/etc and take a picture. Confirm "floating" object is in picture from friends/family after event has faded.

Same for the tentacle, but since it's replacing your arm, the ability to verify it is much more difficult. It depends upon the location/mechanics of said tentacle. If it's not filmable, then that's much more difficult because it'll just appear to be a normal arm...albeit one that could be in really contorted/weird shapes when filmed, potentially. If the physical locations/relationship of the tentacle doesn't match a picture of said arm, say, in a tight spiral shape vs the arm simply showing bent...The only way I can think of to realistically confirm that it's real would be to create an object/container shaped such that an arm is unable to contort in without destroying the arm, and place something at the end of said shape and film the removal of that object with the tentacle.

I would likely do the same with your scenario. If it goes away, cannot be duplicated, and never comes back...does it matter?

*** This is a good way of examining this question: How did rational people who've had hallucinations that were abnormal react?

I once had my home TV start showing things in 3D in my room, while I was in bed watching a twitch stream. I concluded that my sleeping meds had kicked in and I shouldn't try to fight them any longer to watch the end of the match. Easy enough decision even though I did keep watching for a while just for the slight amusement of knowing that I was having a hallucination. Knowing that didn't make the 3D effect of my TV look less real at the time. What made me certain it wasn't real was basically that me having a hallucination from taking sleeping pills was much more likely than my TV suddenly having 3D capabilities, so I turned it off an went to sleep since I clearly needed it.

In hindsight I'm a bit sad I was too tired to think of trying to set up an experiment of moving my head to see some piece of game information that was previously obscured behind something else in the 3D display, since I shouldn't be able to gain new (correct) info from my hallucination and it would have been fun to see how my mind would try to solve that dilemma; if my mind made up info to fill that spot, what would I experience if/when that info was revealed in the "real" stream? For example it the streamer commented on the new info, would my, to my knowledge, only visual hallucination turn auditory too? Would my mind, knowing I was trying to see something it couldn't really know, just make up some likely guess, or would it go with it being a blind spot somehow, or maybe some otherwise dreamlike non sequitur?

We can assume we'd always experience it if it happened, so that probability is one. It reduces down to P(happened)/P(experienced). Using P(experienced) = P(happened) + P(hallucinated), it simplifies to 1/(1+P(hallucinated)/P(happened)). So if our prior is that the probability of hallucination is zero (and probability of happening is nonzero), then the probability approaches 1. However, if (I assume like most of us), the prior probability of hallucination is much larger than the prior probability of happening, the probability approachs 0. For example, if hallucinations are 10x more likely than happening, it's a 9.1% chance a given experience is genuine.

But if you want the character you're writing who is experiencing the body change to feel rational, it's important to have them go with Occam's razor to ask the better questions at an early stage. That is "How can I figure out if this is a dream or hallucination?

A thing's existence is the effects it has on the world. “Joe is hallucinating a blank paper is a picture of Elvis” and “Joe really has a picture of Elvis but only he can see Elvis while everyone else sees a blank paper” are synonymous.

The answer to your question is, determine the measurable effects of the event, then verify other people observe the same effects. This can include indirect observation.\\
If you have an infohazard that makes people Not Believe In Lizardpeople, you can tell a Friend “the infohazard I have in this box will change people's views on Lizardpeople,” then expose a Believer in Lizardpeople to the infohazard. Your Friend can now verify that the Believer's views have changed following exposure. This validates the existence of the infohazard without your Friend being exposed.

However, I have never had an experience in a dream that was clearly real... where that details of it persisted for longer than I was paying attention to them, and when I returned my attention to an imagined object or place it remained the same. In a lucid dream, performing that kind of analysis either wakes me up (as if the dream itself depends on my being in a state of mind that precludes analysis), or I lose the ability to effect the dream and the awareness that I'm dreaming.

So, if a physical event happens and it's persistent and analyzable, I have to assume that it's real or that my mind is broken beyond anything I've ever heard of being possible. I don't know how long it would have to persist before I'd accept its objective reality, but I'd say an hour would be well over the threshold but a few seconds isn't.

1. You live in a universe with multi-versal properties, but for some reason another universe starts superimposing on yours at constantly moving touchpoints; you happen to get caught in one.
2. The temporary weirdness from your perspective is the result of a being with higher power making a conscious decision to start and end the weirdness. Perhaps a wizard playing a prank; you have no way of determining this so the weirdness seems both temporary and arbitrary.

At level 4, a Life Mage "can alter the features of another person or give them the traits of a base or median life form", which would absolutely include turning a person's arms into tentacles, or giving them a tail. And from a Sleeper's point of view, it would absolutely seem like their body just inexplicably turned weird, before changing back equally inexplicably (in reality, the Lie overrode the spell and re-asserted itself).

That said, Life 4 is a pretty high (and rare) degree of mastery, and a Mage of such proficiency probably wouldn't be going around zapping random Sleepers with body-mod spells. Especially since using magic in front of Sleepers triggers Paradox, as the Lie asserts itself and punishes the Mage for pushing against it.

Then again, I've heard of a Mage party using magic to break someone's washing machine and flood their basement, purely out of spite. So a Life Adept might well do something like this, if only once. Just because you have access to cosmic truth doesn't mean you're going to use it responsibly.

** My first reactions would be assuming that I was hallucinating, assuming a workday I would probably take the rest of the day off and try to relax.

If the event repeated, I would then attempt to discover if it was actually happening or if it was all in my head. Mostly by escalating the proof, keeping it private at first. Trying to acquire video evidence and reviewing it as the first step, then physical-effects (tentacle-in-spray paint print), very small wound (paper-cut-sized) in tail/tentacle (Does it hurt? blood sample - same red blood, or a deeper affect?). Then lastly covering up most of the tail/tentacle and exposing it briefly to outside perspectives (other people) to check for reactions at some local mall/store.

If people reacted to exposed tail/tentacle then I'd know something was definitely going on and probably head to a hospital. I would give everyone some excuse if they are freaking out (Haha, cool costume/prosthetic right?).

If it was constantly fading/in out. I would probably get near a hospital (in the parking lot etc) then run in when it's visible again and try to get it professionally checked out (X-ray, MRI, Blood sample) to see if it was malignant.

Either way, also investigate possible “causes”, anything out-of-the ordinary happen lately? Exposed to something, something in the food/water? Replace food, acquire bottled water, add house-water-filtration system.

*** If in public people didn't react to the exposed tail/tentacle. To try and remove any doubts of my own sanity I would try to demonstrate (impossible) physical effects using the changed limbs in public to further gauge their reactions. Lifting a shopping bag with the tail and carrying it around would be a simple demonstration. Holding it in front of someone's travel path to see if it's “invisible” or if it has some sort of congito-awareness altering effect to it.

(People walk into it, or people path around it)\\
See if people can touch it/freak out if they do touch it.

Now, this is where I'd have problems with the “additions” with other people's awareness being altered one way or the other I would pretend said limbs were “normal” but I'd fake an injury to try and get an X-ray of the two areas to see if other media can pick it up. Wrapping the arm/hand up in ice packs. “I fell down the stairs doc, and my hand and tailbone hurt an awful lot, I think I landed badly on both of them”.

If I still get no reaction from anyone even from the xrays, then I'd give up on making others aware of the changes. I'd record everything I could about them myself (length, dexterity, strength, color (is it purple, exactly what shade of purple?) etc) taking copious notes and video/pictures. Continuing to live “normally” with the changed limbs (just keeping them exposed as if they were normal limbs) while checking to see if the flesh spreads, color changes, strength/dex checks, time of fading/in out changes etc. See if I can force differences by doing a wide variety of things, diet changes, weight changes, length of the tentacle/tail stretches. If no one else can perceive the changes then I wouldn't worry too much about it.

If the effects spread/got worse, I would probably freak out about it privately. Slowly turning into some sort of tentacle creature would certainly put a crimp in my mood. But as long as no-one else could perceive the changes there really isn't anything that anyone could do and I'd just look crazy by trying to draw attention to it. So I'd just try living with it and seeing how far the cognito-hazard effects extend by performing some minor criminal acts, use the tail to steal shopping bags/purses/wallets/laptops to see if people react. If not, increase criminal activity.

Why?

Several reasons, Ultimately since other people's perceptions have become warped in regards to the increasing changes, then any injury or illness would have to be tended to by myself without outside assistance.

Future (unknown) changes might cause me to become immobile or cause physical impairment or my body might require a different diet or require mobility devices (motorized wheelchair, wheel-chair access the house). Or the cognito-effect might wear off when the changes complete, rendering me as some sort of tentacle-monster which would be "ill-advised" to wander the streets and/or hold down a normal job and would require delivery service for basic needs (grocery delivery, etc).

I would use this new “mixed-bag of shitty superpowers” to slowly acquire additional funds (robbing jewelry stores) via tail sneaking into the display counter targeting 24c gold-jewelry, melting it down into bricks, tossing most of the gems (most are engraved with serial numbers) and sell the gold bricks)

Try using some makeup/hollywood-style prosthetics to alter my face/features for longer term criminal activity for the jewerly stores. Jewelry keeps dissappearing while "this guy" is standing nearby.

Use jewerly store acquisitions to fund gambling, use tail to alter roulette wheel's ball to ensure a single win on a bet. Call it quits after a single massive win. (guy comes in, puts all his money on a single number, wins big and leaves). Suspicious yes, but with only a single data point, and video-evidence which probably shows the ball behaving oddly but "me" not near it and without any electronics on me (leave the phone in the car). Cash out, pay taxes.

And purchase medical equipment (Xray, MRI, sonogram), medical books (how to do blood tests, run an xray etc) basically set up my own little lab/doc office to both track changes and see where it is all going and possibly retire from job if changes are becoming too cumbersome.

** I'd start out by trying to figure out if I'm the only one experiencing it. So, I'd make an oblique reference to it online and see if anyone else has done the same. I'd probably describe it as a "very vivid dream."

If it only happens once, and no one else is experiencing it, it's almost certainly a hallucination. In fact, if it happens multiple times, and each time, no one else experienced it, it's /quite/ certainly a hallucination; other than proximity to something weird, there's no way that I alone among 8,000,000,000 people am tuned into some word phenomenon.

If it goes beyond myself... Well, at that point, you just have to break it down. Look at the factors before it happens again.

** I've thought about this approaching the age schizophrenia likes to appear, set up a dead man switch that requires a clear thinking activity taking about ten minutes daily to send a message to someone saying you might be going crazy and need checked in to a hospital, do not trust what you say after you read it. Document on paper your experience, take as many photographs videos and audio recordings of things that seem weird. If you have clear thinking for ten minutes you should have at least a chance to review evidence and notes and see if your experiences line up with reality. If they fail to be captured on film or audio then the only factor is how much of a detriment they are to you daily, versus the likelihood it goes away, and the detriment being in a psych ward would cause you. If you see little green men jumping on a roof and that's it I'd keep the switch but just go about life knowing it's probably fake if they cant be recorded or interact in a provable way. If voices start talking to me and I start believing them I'd hope to be able to let the switch go or self report myself.

** Look for any physical evidence, first - tentacle slime or something? It may not be detailed enough to convince anyone else, but at least you can convince yourself you're not crazy.

Either way, write down that it happened, because it's easy to forget dreams. Do a quick online search for hallucinations, see if there's anything that matches your symptoms. (I don't /think/ hallucinations are normally one-offs, but I'm not a psychiatrist).

Then just wait for it to happen again. Whether it happened or not, you're not going to learn anything actionable from one instance. You need a pattern - what makes it happen, can you control it or stop it happening, etc. E.g., if it's a hallucination, you might notice that nobody else can see it when it happens, or that the tentacle never does anything your arms couldn't do.

If it was a one-off, then you don't have enough information to do anything, so you may as well forget about it.

** Assuming video/in person corroboration is impossible due to infohazards, I would do something that can only be done with a tentacle to create physical evidence.

E.g., arrange some letters in a Klein bottle if it's a thin tentacle. Clean the gap between my washer and drier. Make a green stuff cast of my arm/tentacle. Etc..

** if it happened i'd probably first just guess i had dreamt it and move on, if it happened again i'd probably show it to someone i know that i trust and is close, so either i'm insane or they can confirm i'm not.

if i'm not negativly affected by the change, like getting tired or anything like that i'd probably just roll with me being insane and move on with my life, might talk to my family about it but since it seem like no big deal in general and it's the only thing that happen i'd just be a bit afraid the hallucinations would escalate.

if my pants break because of the tail i at least have proof something shifty is going on, and i might be curious about what so it's a pretty important point.

** Hmm. Artificial recreation through using like, self hypnosis. See if phantom limb or whatever matches the experience.

​

Also I'd make a little paint patch or ink thing and then slap a tentacle at it. I'm not fucking good at freehand art, that thing's gonna be messy, but its gonna be a freaking tentacle slapped against a wall with sucker prints.

** I would assume that I had hallucinated it and seek medical advice. Were it to happen a second time, I would make an appointment with a neurologist, in the perfectly reasonable fear that I was hallucinating due to a brain tumour. He'd presumably send me for an MRI scan and then (I imagine) if nothing turned up there, on to a psychiatrist.

If the incident only ever happened once, that would likely be the end of it; I'd end up spending a lot of money on medical opinions and get very vague results back.

On the other hand, if it happened again, and in such a way that it /couldn't/ be an illusion - for example, it a tentacle out of nowhere picked me up, transported me over the Atlantic and dropped me on the Statue of Liberty - well, then I'd start off by assuming that I was hallucinating about being anywhere /near/ the Statue of Liberty, which would probably cause the police to promptly assume that I was crazy in a completely different way to the way in which I would be presuming I was crazy.

Either way, I'd probably end up in front of a psychiatrist, who I would assume at first was a real psychiatrist that I was simply hallucinating a different face on.

** If it happens again you didn't imagine. If it reverted without a trace and never comes back who cares?

Be more social and spend time around cameras in case it happens again so you have proof and emotional support I guess.
