*Synopsis*

“Even if this universe is truly nothing more than a brutal, bloody, shadowy forest, we Cultivators will burn all that we have just to give off a single weak flickering spark in the darkness!

No matter how weak each spark is, how short-lived, how small... As long as the sparks flow unabated, then one day one of those sparks will light some tinder, and that tinder shall light some fallen branches, and those branches shall set ablaze each and every last tree of the forest!

In the end, even the smallest sparks will eventually set the shadowy forest ablaze, and illuminate the whole world!”

*Nice Synopsis from [[/r/Rational]]* In FMoC, sweeping social change has changed the landscape of the Xianxia world forever. Secret sects have developed from being merely schools of kung fu to being corporation-like entities, with grandmasters and elders becoming equivalent to CEOs and Board Chairmen of modern-day corporations. Sufficiently advanced martial arts is the flavor of the setting; martial arts is interwoven into the entire world.

Schools of fine cuisine teach their chefs methods for cooking their food with magical fire and secret techniques for punching the flavor from one food into another.Universities host martial arts tournaments instead of football games. Scientists debate if the fundamental unit of Chi is a Chi Particle or Chi Wave, and have built Large Essence Colliders to test their theories on the nature of Chi. Magical physics is a study in and of itself!

The military uses high-powered enchanted swords that home in on the spiritual markers of enemy souls, rather than drone strikes, and invests countless crystal credits into researching military applications of magic.And all over the world, everyday practitioners of magic use their abilities to create new technologies, working alongside regular humans. Thanks to the integration of common humanity with the magic of the Cultivators, all sorts of wondrous things have been created, including healing pods, magical prostheses that can even replace the entire body in extreme scenarios, and even transhuman methods of capturing lost souls and bringing them back to life- all things which were once only available to the magic-users, but which have since become available to all, magic users or not. Heck, they even built a magic internet for muggles and wizards alike!

Translated by Friendship Is Power


** Chapter 6 basically sets the tone for how this story deconstructs existing xianxia settings by saying 'look, your resource consumption rates are unsustainable, your society is top-heavy, it's got too many superpowered wizards that need to eat a whole city's worth of energy every single day, your society was inevitably going to collapse sooner or later.'

I remember rather distinctly the first time I read this chapter and how I went 'holy shit this is literally the most accurate criticism of Xianxia I have ever read, this is the perfect rational deconstruction, I need to share this with [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'. The way the author begins the story by challenging the entire establishment of magical society and basically yelling 'your worldbuilding doesn't work, your economy is bullshit' at the top of his lungs reminds me a lot of the first few chapters of HPMOR.

Also, just in case you didn't notice it, the Supreme Emperor described in this chapter, who formed twenty 'Sects of Provenance' (or, alternatively translatable as 'Primarch Sects'), is, well, it's pretty obvious why the story is named 'Cultivation 40k' isn't it, now? :P

** Isn't the infant stage here the same as Nascent Soul, as used in translations of other Xianxia's?

Why not use the same Ancient Cultivation terms as those in ISSTH, which is basically the biggest translated xianxia right now?

Qi Gathering, Foundation building, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, and above that are the ones that seem to be different

**** In most xianxia the goal of everyone is to become as close to immortal and almighty as possible. This is done by transforming yourself through meditation / training / medicines. There is usually a single established way everyone does this (even if the details differ), which is then divided in "stages" that you have to accomplish in a certain order, each one transforming one aspect of yourself.

To take ISSTH as an example, the goal is to form an immortal soul. (There is also some lost knowledge about cultivating an immortal body, but only the MC does that.)

#+begin_quote
  Qi Gathering:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Infuse your body with Qi energy and develop channels so that you can actually do anything with that energy. In the center of your "self" form a Qi lake.
- Benefits: Basic magic techniques (summon small fire serpent, activate magic items, concoct basic pills, a couple of seconds of flight).

#+begin_quote
  Foundation building:
#+end_quote

- Transform the Qi lake into "dao pillars", which form the foundation for later stages.
- Benefits: Sustained (slow) flying, more powerful magic.

#+begin_quote
  Core Formation:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Form a "Core" out of your pillars.
- Benefits: A couple of decades more life.

#+begin_quote
  Nascent Soul:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Use the Core as a seed to form an actual soul self.
- Benefits: If you die, your soul can escape and try to form a new body. Natural age of several centuries. Short range teleportation.

#+begin_quote
  Spirit Severing:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Cut away the central aspects that are holding your soul tethered to your mortal life. Kill your friends and loved ones, or surgically remove any doubt and remorse over whether this is a good choice. Only your way of the dao may remain.
- Benefits: Lifespan of (I think) two millenia. Only focussed on the truly important things in life. May appear two-dimensional. Long-range teleportation.

#+begin_quote
  Dao Seeking:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Find what you really care about.
- Benefits: I don't even know.

#+begin_quote
  Immortal Ascension.
#+end_quote

- Haven't read that far.

--------------

If one is really, really talented and finds a very spiritually rich place, one might theoretically reach Core Formation without using any resources other than the energy one has personally filtered from the air. That would mean one has spent their entire life sitting still and doing nothing of consequence, though.

On the other hand, even the most talentless hack can accomplish the first stage with a few resources.

***** To, uh, put it in a less flattering light-

Basically, in most Xianxia novels, /literally everybody is Voldemort./

Once you get high enough in power levels, there will no longer /be/ any sympathetic characters with the full diversity of human motivations and experiences for the reader to identify with. All that you're left with are soulless, identically ruthless murderhobos fighting each other over resources, and the only thing that privileges the protagonist is them being able to out-murderhobo all the other murderhobos consistently. Somehow, this is a writing paradigm that has managed to not only survive, but /thrive/. Somehow.

Cultivation40k, luckily, isn't most Xianxia, and actively seeks to deconstruct this dynamic in later chapters. One of the many reasons why I /really really love this story/.

Please note that at least in ISSTH you don't /have/ to become a ruthless murder hobo. You could have some complex dao about always being reasonable despite all the ruthless murderhoboing around you, provided you feel strongly enough about it. Pill Demon is a good example of this, I think. Though it should also be noted that he didn't have enough motivation to keep advancing until he felt he had to protect one of his students.

Somewhat relevant to this subreddit, this could you into what is essentially an AI with a single goal as defined by your dao.

**** (I'd just like to note that I got in touch with Strivon and we're coming up with more intuitive nomenclature for a lot of the terms. I've always felt rather dissatisfied with 'official' translation terminology anyways, and this was an opportunity for me to help put some nonliteralist translation theory into practice!)

Basically, to put it in my own words:

The basic concept of xianxia levels is transhumanism through magic through kung-fu.

At mere mortal stages of preparation, you hone your body so that it becomes a resilient physical vessel that can hold the sheer power of essence without breaking.

At the early stages of cultivation, you gather essence into your own body, opening channels with 'hydraulic' pressure, creating a secondary system of circulation for your body to use for magic, and forming a reservoir of magic within your own body. Now you can store magic and draw on it later, rather than just relying on ambient magic in the air, making you a proper cultivator sorceror at last and not just some dude who's chanting off a scroll or whatever.

At the medium stages, you start consolidating your essence into a physical organ inside your body. This organ becomes a secondary, backup brain. If you die, this organ can survive outside of the body, like a phylactery hidden inside your body; you can use it to possess other people, and it retains your full mindstate, ensuring your continuity as a being. It also often functions simultaneously as the magic reactor that powers your whole body, being an evolved form of the magic reservoir previously described; this is the 'core' referred to by the other post.

At higher stages, your phylactery turns out to have been an egg the whole time, and hatches into a Stand. You can now manifest a spiritual form that represents the condensation of all of your magical power to augment your own powers and beat people up. It also retains the previous functionality as a mindstate escape-pod, but it can now actively use a limited range of the magic you had available previously.

Beyond that, every single story makes up its own levels of bullshit, with differing levels of mysticality. The first four levels tend to be mostly consistent across stories, though.

Note, also, that Cultivation40k doesn't follow a lot of these proscriptions in detail. It's got its own worldbuilding justification for how stuff works, which is much more consistent with rational storytelling tropes, and- to strike the comparison again- reminds me a lot of how Harry analyzed magic in HPMOR. Everything I wrote above is just how /most/ xianxia novels approach magic powerlevels.

Wait, you mean Stands are a thing in Sino-Japanese myth and fantasy generally, and weren't just invented by Jojo's Bizarre Adventure?

Holy shit.

****** I think that was more of a metaphorical thing. I looked up "Stand" in the context of eastern mythology and couldn't find anything, and TVTropes didn't have much about it. Also, when the author of Jojo introduced the concept of Stands to replace ripples, he remarked that he was worried other people wouldn't understand the concept, which doesn't fit with it being a semi-permanent part of mythology.

My best guess is that this aspect of xianxia is just derivative. Jojo is pretty popular in the east, and so are series with similar mechanics, like /Persona/. The whole "summoning an other" to fight for you thing is a common theme in Japanese games too.

**** Different cultivation realms, every seperate realm is a massive powerup compared to the former. Its somewhat exponential.

If you want to read some xianxias, I recommend ISSTH at Wuxiaworld.com, but if you want to start on a story with no chinese names, start on Coiling Dragon. I was actually put off when I first started reading Xianxias by the Chinese names because I got confused, and didnt understand how the names worked

Protip: Most of these stories aren't rational.
