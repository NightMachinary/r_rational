*** Ooh, do we get points for explaining ways in which a seven-element "whirlpool" might be possible?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem#Generalizations][Wikipedia]] shows that this could be done with the surface of a torus; simply giving this depth away from the surface would lead to a contact area for every element with every other.

At Jiraya's speed, this would take ~40 person-years to learn. Naruto could do it a lot faster with clones, but probably still not fast enough to matter. On the other hand... the "magic doughnut" would be eight times more powerful than the theoretical maximum - and ~256 times the power of a non-elemental technique.

Edit: Naruto's best technique now creates something that looks and behaves like a wet pool noodle, so that's my new favorite mental image.

#+begin_quote
  The four-color theorem applies not only to finite planar graphs, but also to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_graph][infinite graphs]] that can be drawn without crossings in the plane, and even more generally to infinite graphs (possibly with an uncountable number of vertices) for which every finite subgraph is planar. To prove this, one can combine a proof of the theorem for finite planar graphs with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_theorem_(graph_theory)][De Bruijn--Erdős theorem]] stating that, if every finite subgraph of an infinite graph is /k/-colorable, then the whole graph is also /k/-colorable Nash-Williams (1967). This can also be seen as an immediate consequence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del][Kurt Gödel]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem][compactness theorem]] for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic][first-order logic]], simply by expressing the colorability of an infinite graph with a set of logical formulae.

** Well, that didn't end with the Sannins dead or Naruto's teammates dead, so a much more positive chapter than I expected. Killa-bee and Konohamaru Sarutobi are dead, but that's just par for the course with his fic.

  Needless to say, the odds that one random shinobi just happened to manifest the long-lost rinnegan eye-technique and came up with a way to put the tailed beasts together under his control isn't something anybody worth taking seriously is taking seriously.”

Ah, but they aren't independent probabilities. A single party (Kaguya or Madara) is/was manipulating events to get things together.

*** Also, every single time someone in a rational fic mentions that something sounds so "too good to be true" that it cannot possibly be real, they are hilariously wrong.

It is effectively a trope now, it's not even Wrong Genre Savvy, it's more like... Meta-Genre Overthinking.

*** On the basis that the only reason I can think of to mention /seven elements/ is to foreshadow this, it seems likely.

On the other hand, even with shadow clones it would probably take longer than this story to learn (and it could be to troll us).

**** Shadow clones+byakugan+sharingan (once Sasuke gives one of his eyes to Naruto in thanks for the sage training). This fic has taken several small jumps in time on the order of months, with a few large time skips another dozen chapters could get us a few years into the future giving Naruto time to figure it out.

Naruto could come up with the torus idea and try it with say 2 or 3 elements, and then draw it out and show Jiriya that it would work with 7 elements. This is a rational fic, so the main character doesn't have to do everything themselves because plot, he can give the knowledge to someone that can make it work.

*** I presume that was covered under "more light-hearted conversation."

Since Jiraiya and Tsunade already know Naruto is a jinchuriki---and Jiraiya has probably fought jinchuriki while they're unleashing controlled amounts of their beasts' power before---/and/ since the three of them aren't particularly bone-weary or missing limbs---it's pretty apparent what had to have happened, without even having to ask.

On the other hand, this is a cruelty of miscommunication by the author, in that the important fact of "it's easier and less dangerous to control the Kyuubi's power than you think, as long as you can practice with someone who can beat you up before you tail up fully" has been left unsaid.
