I have recently put kindle unlimited and wanted the communities input on what good books are present.

Books I liked (not exhaustive list)

Cradle Series

Dawn of Wander

Mother of learning

Release that witch

HPMOR

3 body problem

And the usual books recommended in this group.

I am open for good recommendation from both sci-fi and fantasy.


** Kindle Unlimited has some real garbo on it that gets high reviews, so it can be pretty difficult to sort good books from bad.

A series that I enjoyed was the Bobiverse by Dennis Taylor. It's about a guy that gets his consciousness uploaded into a Von Neumann Probe.

*** I really disliked the first book of bobiverse. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5u054p/hsf_rt_we_are_legion_we_are_bob_a_novel_about_von/][Here's a discussion]] about it from last year.

I agree with the other thing you said though.

**** I'm on the opposite side of the fence on the bobiverse. You make a great criticism about the way it depicts resources, but I still like it for approaching the fun, challenges, and opportunities of uploading. Do you have an alternate book you like that explores that possibility space, IMHO Diaspora is too tied up with dimensionality, and loses all of the fun of math when exploring the coal face metaphor, to really be a fun exploration of uploading.

***** Have you tried Accelerando by Charles Stross? It has mind uploads and other crazy stuff happening. Very imaginative. And it was released free under creative commons, I believe.

Perilous Waif is not exactly uploading human minds, it's more like cybernetics blurring the line between human and AI, but it is pretty fun.

And I heard good things about [[https://www.amazon.com/Outsystem-Military-Science-Fiction-Intrepid-ebook/dp/B008GZ8HEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8][this series]] which has some uploading stuff going on, but I haven't tried it.

Also, try looking searching for threads on [[/r/printSF]], or posting your own if there are none. It's a great subreddit.

****** Accelerando is my #2 after age of EM for probable/plausible upload reference at least before the vile offspring. I'll give it a look.

** [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.The_Final_Empire?ac=1&from_search=true][Brandon Sanderson]]: Stormlight Archive, Mistborn (original trilogy)

Anything by [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4721536.Mark_Lawrence][Mark Lawrence]]

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64341.The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect][The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]] - He also posts it for free his website if you google it.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32509131-dungeon-born][Divine Dungeon]] series. Kind of like Crandle in its power gathering mechanisms, but about a dungeon and way more lighthearted with really mossively terrible puns.

Phil Tucker is a more unknown author I'm rather fond of. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29936142-the-path-of-flames][Chronicles of the Black Gate]] - a past-paced fantasy epic with a fair amount of characters, locations, and story lines. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39980416-death-march][Euphoria Online]] - a LitRPG that I thought was pretty awesome, especially compared to most of the other books in the genre.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22878967-the-shadow-of-what-was-lost][The Shadow of What was Lost]] - Another fantasy epic, but featuring time travel!

A bit more experimental of a recommendation, but I rather enjoyed this video, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY][Fable of the Dragon Tyrant]]

**** I think it's fairly similar to other epic fantasy in terms of having multiple "main" characters and sprawling scale for locations of setting. I'd compare it to A Song of Ice and Fire but with way less text and superfluous descriptions. The ridiculous amount of description of unnecessary things is what makes Wheel of Time and Malazan Book of the Fallen hard for me to enjoy.

It's also got [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/184590-the-chronicles-of-the-black-gate][great covers]].

** Is Mother of Learning even on Kindle? Or were you just giving an example of something you like? What other favorites from this subreddit do you follow (Pokemon TOoS? Practical Guide to Evil? Worth the Candle? All of them?)

With This Ring is not to everyone's taste, but makes a solid attempt at bringing consistency and logic to a comic book universe. And is long enough to keep anyone busy for a while, plus it updates daily.

**** I've actually stopped reading Worth the Candle too, at least for now. If I had to put my finger on why, I'd say that I didn't enjoy how the protagonist alternates between "world punches him in the gut" and "his own mistakes punch him in the gut."

Have you read any HPMoR derivatives? You can convert any FFN books to ebooks easily enough. Following the Phoenix and Significant Digits are among the longer ones.

***** Hmm , HPMOR can be considered a separate book in its own right with its ingenuity. I was afraid the other fancy docs won't be able to match the standards HPMOR set

I will give them a try and hope the author has added her own style rather than blindly imitating Rowling or HPMOR
