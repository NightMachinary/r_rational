I have a pretty long commute to work and not much to do. Any suggestions to stuff I could listen to that is useful?

edit: Thanks, everyone :) A whole bunch of good podcasts here. Any audiobook suggestions, as brightwing requested?


** As already pointed out: If at all practical, move. Long commute times do a really horrible number on your quality of life. It is a cost people consistently underestimate very, very badly. - It is, for example, an extremely strong predictor of divorce.

Secondly: Are you driving? Because if so, pretty much anything actually useful is going to divert dangerous amounts of concentration from that, so I would suggest just going with music.

If it's a long train or bus ride, and you can't relocate due to causes like SO's job/school for kids, ect.. well, Language tapes, podcasts. An audible subscription is a pretty good deal.

People always think I'm crazy when I tell them that the primary factor in where I live is proximity to work. When I do the math for them (~250*hours spent commuting per day). Even a half hour commute to work gives you more than enough time to watch every Simpsons episode ever made, including time for sleep, in less than a year.

** Dan Carlin's Hardcore History is amazing, and his Common Sense is good too. [[http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive]]

I also enjoy The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe [[http://www.theskepticsguide.org/]] Planet Money [[http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/127413729/podcast/]] and the Savage Lovecast [[http://www.savagelovecast.com/]]

Of course the most rational commute of all is the one where you drive less than 15 minutes cuz you live close to work. :) Except for the most extreme areas this is generally worth it, as the cost of gas/milage is not insignificant, and the cost in hours of your life is... hard to measure, but probably a LOT.

I second these.

I heartily recommend the [[http://titaniumphysicists.brachiolopemedia.com/][Titanium Physicists]] for Theoretical Physics.

*** Another good podcast is [[http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/][The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps]], which covers the full gambit of philosophy related topics, and is super interesting most of the way.

*** A lot (all?) of the Iain M Bank's Culture Series is on audio book. Not rationalist, but some good AI stuff.

**** About half of the Culture audiobooks are only available for sale in the UK, but you can purchase from them outside the UK at audible.co.uk (if you're not particularly concerned with TOS agreements) by paying with a pre-paid debit card without an address associated with it (such as a Visa gift card), and then entering a random, real UK address as the card's billing address.
