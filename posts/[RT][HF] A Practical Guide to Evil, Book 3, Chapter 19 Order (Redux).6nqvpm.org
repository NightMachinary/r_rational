** There's something special about that blaze boredom with fates worth than death; "[I'd be pissed if I'd have to] murder my way back to a semblance of humanity". Ahh, Cat.

** I forget, is Zombie the Second an undead horse? I thought it was, but then describing it as skittish around Nauk makes me think it isn't. Good chapter though! Can't wait for the Wednesday update

*** The name would imply it's undead. Maybe Erratic forgot about it? Or Cat was referring to some other horse?

**** Zombie the first was undead. Zombie the second is also undead, in the sense that he/she is /un dead/, but not yet a horrifying abomination of necromantic Name sorcery

** What do you all think the deal Cat is going to offer Thief is? Return the treasury and I'll let you live?

Alternatively, Cat already bled the treasury dry and blamed Thief, so she'll guarantee Thief's safety if she stays out of Cat's way and keeps up the lie.

*** Interesting reminder about the treasury. Maybe Cat will tell Thief about the treason and Thief can put the funds towards the war effort (paying for cavalry) or helping refugees? Thief will have to return the jewels though.

*** I'm betting his Name will be Robber. It's different from Thief because it implies violence or threat of violence.

*** Murderer? Killer?

Robber seems to tame. Although his crew's motto is something like "kill them and take their stuff" so maybe that's right.

I really, really want Robber to get a name but there's no guarantee that it's going to happen.

*** She seems to have received a massive power up in the aspects she has already, almost like she's transitioned. I wonder if there's a third aspect attached to this powerup or if it's all just juice until she gets a new name. Either way Squire is scurry.
