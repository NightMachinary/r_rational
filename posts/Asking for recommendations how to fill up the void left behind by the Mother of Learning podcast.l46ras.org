** Wildbow's [[https://anchor.fm/paleaudiobook/episodes/Pale-0-0-Blood-Runs-Cold-edv2li][Pale]] has an audiobook. If you're looking for Urban Fantasy, I can recommend the story, though I haven't tried the audiobook myself. Even has a side character who went through a time loop scenario!

*** HMPOR's audiobook is absolutely awful and I do not understand anyone who likes it. I understand it's a fan production, but if you're looking for something that compares to this, it doesn't even /remotely/ compare. Just read it instead.

***** Well, at least for me, it was the voice acting. I couldn't stand it. Maybe it gets better later on, but I couldn't hold out.

** I was on chapter 29 when it got deleted, and have been thinking about this a lot. The good thing is that it will return someday, but it's not certain when.

Personally I'm going back to what I used to do, catching up and reading some manga.

There is nothing like MoL, but if you want to fill the void just a bit, I recomend the manga "Mashle", it's different, but ti me it has a similar vibe and is hillarious.

*** Can't speak about the quality of the podcast, but I've started the text version of it recently and it's pretty good.

Basically a groundhog's day scenario, in which a young wizard relives a month of magic school over and over again.

Of course there's bigger plot things that happen, and I'm not that far into it yet. But the gist is that it's a rational take on magic with the groundhog's day twist.

*** The podcast wasn't complete, and it got removed because the author got a deal with audible. The story itself is complete and free on royal road.

**** Yeah, I just found that out the hard way. But I still think I'll read it in text version, which just means I can't start right away.

** I listened to it on TTS first when it was ~40 chapters in and again when it finished.

TTS is much more listenable if you just crank the speed up... I listen to podcasts at like 1.8x-3.0x depending on what feels right but my speedup on TTS is 6x. No idea why the default is so slow.

**** Not OP but I used MoonReader's and Librera Reader's TTS at speeds probably comparible to 6x.

I recommend both because iirc the free version of MoonReader (or maybe Librera) doesn't support TTS. Regardless I recommend either of their paid versions.

Edit: Regarding podcast recommendations. Read/Re-read worm via ebook and listen to the We've got Worm podcast. Absolutely fantastic arc-by-arc analysis. I haven't listened to their Worm 2/Ward podcast "We've got Ward" but since it's the same hosts I'm comfortable recommending it too.
