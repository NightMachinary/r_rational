*** The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar?from=Main.TheSalvationWar][Salvation War]] series comes to mind. I don't know that I would call it 'rational fiction', per se, but it featured a refreshingly pragmatic human response to an 'end times' scenario (including [[#s][]]), written by a military analyst to boot.

***** The problem with surface detail is that you need to have read the other series to know whose [[#s][spoiler]]

The salvation war struck me as a few hundred "take that's" against Christianity and associated religions cosmology and your usual military porn, but it's a fun read despite Heaven and Hell clutching the idiot ball to their chest.

** As I posted to Twitter, I'd go in with an army, force a regime change (i.e. take over the place) and market free immortality to all. All you have to do is be careful to sin enough!
