  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

I think it meets those guidelines pretty well.

** While this is a very good, enthralling story, I really have my doubts that it's rational. At the very least, there are a lot of qualities of the setting that aren't explained and that one would not expect from what we know about the universe and the nature of life and the mind right now.

I can't really do an analysis with spoiler tags liberally peppered through, so if you haven't read it yet

*SPOILERS FOR MOST OF THE STORY BELOW*

The most glaring difficulty I'm having is the nature of the mind of most of the sapient alien species. Barring racial proclivities (e.g. "Builders" being predisposed to engineering, "Thoughtful" to scientific careers, etc.) and very minor eccentricities, everyone is extremely human-like.

We are reasonably certain that a significant chunk of the nature of human thinking and consciousness is the result of the evolutionary path our species took to get to where we are. We have instinctual responses to certain stimuli, but even on top of that our default decision-making processes are heavily biased by what worked for our ancestors. In other words, humans have a very irrational baseline mental structure that's shaped heavily by our evolutionary history.

There's no reason to expect alien species that evolved on other planets completely isolated from our own to have such a phenomenally similar baseline mental structure. The story takes this as a baseline, and though I'm only halfway through, given the writing style I don't expect an explanation to be coming. Alien characters are motivated by personal beliefs and values, which is rational yes, but their actions and responses are highly human-like, which without an explanation is very irrational /as a setting/. I grant that a rational story can and should have irrational characters, but aliens that are irrational in /precisely human ways/ is not rational /writing/. It feels like a choice that was made to allow readers to empathize with the characters at the expense of realism.

Beyond that major point, I just happen across speedbumps every once in a while that really impede my immersion. For example, one alien remarks in his internal monologue that humans produce some excellent wines. What? First, there's no explanation of how the alien can consume organic products from a human environment, but there's a deeper problem. Implicit in this assessment is that more than one species produces "wine." Now, one could say that maybe it's artistic license in the rendering of the alien language equivalent of "ethyl-alcohol-containing liquids" that fits the flow of prose better, but even there is a problem. Why would alien physiology respond the same way to alcohol as ours? Granted, for any species we are likely to be able to interact with, chemistry is universal (i.e. for the acceptable pressures, atmosphere compositions, etc.), but biology is not. There's no reason to believe an alien species would process alcohol in any way similar to the way we do, especially with it suffering analogous side-effects to its biology to the ones that affect humans.

With a proper explanation, stuff like this is passable, but with all of this lumped together, it really feels like the setting has been slapped together for the story, rather than the story emerging from a rationally constructed setting. There are too many artistic details and remarks that make the story a fun read but otherwise implausible.

*** But there is good reason for that, in the story the answer to the fermi paradox is basically that life is extremely extremely rare in the universe. It makes sense if the required parameters for intelligent life are very very narrow. And convergent evolution does the rest.

Also by that point in the story 2000 years have passed, wine and all popular human products are going to be completely assimilated into the compact. It wouldn't take long at all with FTL.

**** I find it extremely hard to believe that the only difference in two (much less more) independently evolved intelligent species' response to psycho-social stress is whether their bodies sweat or itch. Their mental responses are /identical/. Do you really buy that the bodies can vary so dramatically, but the minds are bound to this extremely specific paradigm, including cognitive biases and instinctual emotional responses?

And the Great Filter argument breaks down entirely with the descriptions of artificial general intelligences. In this story you have three options: exactly human-like (with possible boosted speed and "cleverness"), too dumb to think creatively (on the cusp of sapience, but not quite there), or completely insane. Just like the aliens, they suffer from most of the same emotional hangups and cognitive biases as organic intelligences.

***** There are 300 billion stars in the milky way, that there are only a couple dozen species is some crazy filtering. So I don't think it's that crazy that the filter restricts intelligent life to only being able to come about through the exact evolutionary processes which produced humans (through the same social pressures, etc)

Yeah, the AI thing is an issue but compared to other sci fi stories with AIs it's a pretty damn good job. At least it's an immortal, fast, clever, psychopath. Remember they managed to restrict it from self-improving.

*** Your criticism is mostly about it not being hard sci fi- that isn't a requirement of rational fiction. HPMOR, the spawning fiction, was about a magical universe. Soft sci fi universes can still be rational.

For example, there is no reason to expect magical spells to work as magic isn't real. But we still accept it in the story and in many other popular rational fictions.

Also, with your second message, did the alien actually say alcohol caused drunkedness in them?

**** Talking about HPMOR is a non sequitur. The suspension of disbelief there is that some magical system exists. Once that's presupposed, it must follow rationally. That is the paradigm of rational fantasy fiction.

This is clearly science fiction. And even here, once again you can insert something like FTL travel with a similar suspension of disbelief, although the requirements are a bit more strict (e.g. you need some kind of "jargon" to "explain" it, in this case shocking is some contortion of general relativity). After those select additions are made, the rules of the universe must again flow rationally.

You say that "hard sci-fi" is not a requirement of rational fiction, and I'm saying if it's not required for rational science fiction, then where do you draw the line? In this, you have aliens with psychologies effectively identical to human psychology, apart from very minor variations. They experience arrogance, racism, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot][bias blindspot]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error][fundamental attribution error]]. They experience psycho-social stress in exactly the way a human would, and they even have a specific physiological manifestation that differs from race to race in minor detail only (e.g. Builders get itchy skin and Thoughtful rapidly blink in identically socially stressful situations that make a human sweat). Except for the descriptions of extra eyes, extra height, head-tentacles, a reader could easily mistake this for a space opera about different human nations warring with each other.

My point about alcohol is that they drink it recreationally. That's clear. Whether or not it specifically causes drunkenness doesn't really matter. If it's recreational then it causes something closely analogous to drunkenness. Plus, there is a whole section of the story where a Tribune /drinks himself into a constant haze to mitigate what is clearly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder/. That requires a mighty suspension of disbelief.

My TL;DR in all of this is ultimately that any specific facet of this story is perfectly reasonable for a story to have, but if the story is /rational/ then there has to be a /reason/ for the facet other than "plot" or "atmosphere". Most of the details of the universe have clearly been chosen to enhance the reader's relatability, not because they follow rationally from a predefined set of rules.

Whereas you are restricting "rational" to the motivations and actions of the characters in the fiction, I apply it to the entire piece. That's why the sub has tags for "hard sci-fi" and "hard fantasy" but not just "sci-fi" or "fantasy".

The story is based off Halo and The Excalibur Alternative. They are using established ideas from two pre-existing universes to write a story. The aliens there were humanoid so these aliens are too.

Another story I submitted was Mother of Learning. Would you criticize that for pretending magic was real (because the author likes DnD) and that souls were real (likely based of Naruto fanfiction?) Most rational fanfictions submitted here would not withstand your rejection criteria.

The FTL is similar to The Excalibur alternative.

#+end_quote

I don't really draw a line around this. Most authors are humans, I don't expect them to write non humans that well. There are limits to how well the average person can generate alien races plus the less humanoid they are the less popular a story will be. Besides which, it's based on fiction filled with humanoid aliens.

#+end_quote

So the effects are vague, and you somehow based on your extensive knowledge of ethanol chemistry have decided it can have no effect on alien brains?

[[http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Ethanol]]

Besides which, the source material has drunk aliens.

That is your rule, not the subreddit's.

"The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent."

"The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena."

None of your suggestions violate that.

** Thank you for this recommendation. I've enjoyed this story quite a lot.

Some things just bugged me throughout though. The first is the extremely, improbably human-like aliens which [[/u/ignirtoq]] has already touched upon. The second is the anthropomorphised as hell AIs.

Now, I get the reasons for these things, namely the source material and the ease of empathy with protagonist, respectively. It still annoys me how each AI must apparently be 'soulful' in this story. I just want to read about a damn emotionless optimisation engine that wins at everything by virtue of recursive self-improvement (or at least by virtue of rationality if self improvement just breaks the story too much). What I don't want to read is AI angst, human angst is quite enough for me. There is one decision in particular that is so blatantly, obviously suboptimal as far as Red's utility function goes that it just boggles the mind. The AI is irrational and it is irrational in a distinctly human way, which is disappointing.
