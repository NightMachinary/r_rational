*** I'm now shipping General Abigail and Anaraxes.

Not as a cute couple, happily-ever-after in love, oh no. I'm shipping them as a pair who make a horrible, awkward romance-adjacent mistake that deeply unsettles and shames them both, and which they both vow to never speak of or acknowledge again, even upon pain of death.

Following this, they will be stuck liaising repeatedly in meeting after meeting, never able to meet each others' gaze, with the fate of the world decided by their actions.

#+begin_quote
  “The cruelty of a dilemma is not only in the choice itself; it lies also in the truth it reveals to you about yourself through the making of that choice.”
#+end_quote

A bit of a mouthful but I liked this quote.

Something I liked less was the chapter opening on a humorous note at the expense of the tension that the previous chapter ended on. This is something I've noticed many times before (and something most web fiction authors who write humour and/or banter well do) whereby genuinely funny observations/narrations/banter are inserted in such a way that they drain the narrative of tension and change the tone out of nowhere.

Here we have the previous chapter ending with a big revelation with important ramifications, which transitions into Cat humorously remarking upon her friends taking the piss out of her, then back into Cat dealing with a gigantic and very serious issue in a matter of paragraphs...the tone is all over the place and it undercuts the importance of “oh shit Junipers arrested herself along with most of the officers” when Akua is using bathtubs to scry for the lulz and Cat spends time focusing on her friends ‘disobedience' and designing petty vengeance's.

*** 100% agreed with this analysis, first thing I thought when I started this chapter.

Also, on a more minor note --

** I find myself more irritated by this new development than interested. The story's been building up the mystery and conflict around the Intercessor and Dead King as the escalation of the story and stakes. I care about finding out what the Dead King's goals are, what's going on with the Intercessor, what monumental changes are going to happen on the continent, what the ramifications of the Tyrant/Heirarch's actions are, etc.

I get that Malicia is a rational actor using all the tools available to her, but from a narrative (not in-world narrative, the actual story) perspective I just don't care about her or frankly Praes at all at this point. It all feels like a pointless sideshow to what seems to be the "main story" - even the Black angle. I like them both (Black and Malicia) as characters, but the interesting parts of the story have moved away from them. Their mysteries are laid bare, there's nothing new to learn or see.

Maybe we'll see the Praes story being tied in to the rest of what feels like the "main story". It would be great if Malicia felt like more of a partner to the Dead King rather than WW2 Italy to the Dead King's Germany.

But that's... literally the point? That the Dead King is intentionally bringing up old or otherwise irrelevant plot threads so the plot /can't/ focus on him...
