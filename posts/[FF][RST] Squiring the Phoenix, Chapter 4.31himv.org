** Huh, lots of timeskips here.

I can't see the agoraphobic astronaut not ending in tears.

Hermoine and Ron? Really? I mean, it worked in canon, but the characters are quite different here.

It took me a few seconds to realize where Elon Musk would be getting that many galleons. Asteroid mining is a hell of a drug.

So is Felix Felicis. Yikes. That's SCP level science.

So, are we ever going to get some information on what Harry has been learning from Ignotus?

One hundred billion galleons is two billion dollars. It's a lot of money, but very doable for someone who's about to own the world's supply of FF. Or, to put it another way, it's about what Facebook paid for Instagram.

**** It's also about 700,000,000 kg, assuming a galleon weighs about 1 ounce, like a piece of eight and is pure gold. Since the total amount of gold in the world is estimated at about 171,300 tons (about 150,000,000 kg) that's almost 5 times as much gold made into galleons as exists, in this one transaction.

I mean, unless Horace is fine with being paid in fiat currency or the wizarding world invents credit. Then you're golden.

... I swear that was not a pun.

***** I would assume that galleons are much lighter, since in HPMOR Harry auto-thieves several hundred in his pockets before managing to get them into his moleskin pouch. I'm thinking probably the size of a dime.

****** From MoR Chapter 4:

#+begin_quote
  Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe?
#+end_quote

So each one weighs about 5 grams. Lower my above estimate to only 3.3 times all the gold in the world (500,000,000 kg).

I'm also pretty sure he autothieves under or around 100 galleons, which would only weigh 1.1 lbs.

Edit: Yes, it was 30 Galleons. Chapter 5:

#+begin_quote
  Harry guessed he'd managed to steal maybe thirty Galleons from himself.

******* Okay, so I was right that they're lighter, just not how many he stole. As to the amount of gold -- bah! Off with you, pedant! These people create matter out of thin air! I'm sure a little matter like "not enough gold anywhere" would stop them.

******** Experimenting with transfiguring gold is also a war-crime against all Goblinkind, apparently. Chapter 15 of MoR:

#+begin_quote
  "You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money, including Muggle money," said Professor McGonagall. "The goblins have ways of finding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law, the goblin nation is in a permanent state of war with all magical counterfeiters. They will not send Aurors. They will send an army."
#+end_quote

Which I suppose explains why they would use gold as a currency at all. There must be some reason - if anyone could just make more of it, it obviously wouldn't be worth anything.

But yes, I'm mostly just nitpicking.

**** 10^{11} * (5 * 10^{1)} = 5 * 10^{12} , which is 5 trillion pounds, or am I missing something? That's like two times US National Debt at the time (at the time exchange was almost two dollars per pound). /Countries/, over the years, if they made a massive effort, maybe they could have paid it (especially if they'd disbanded their militaries).

And I think 10^{11} galleons is within an order of magnitude from 'all the galleons in the word'. Making a generous assumption that there's 1 wizard per 1,000 Muggles on average (canon seems to suggest a rather smaller number), rounding that to 10,000,000 (ten million) wizards in the world, making further generous assumption that there's 100,000 galleons of money supply per wizard in the economy, it gives 10^{7} * 10^{5} = 10^{12.} So with this assumption 100 billion galleons is about one tenth of all the money in the wizarding world.

***** There is now an exchange rate between Galleons and GBP. Elon can pay him in GBP which sits in a bank. Whenever he need Galleons he takes some of the GBP out, goes to Gringotts, and turns them into Galleons.

Yeah, I had a bit of a "Wtf?" moment with this as well.

I mean, unless Ron brained up during the timeskips and became a person rather then a caricature, I see no particular reason for him to even exist, let alone for Hermione to be aware of him.

He was a competent strategist during the whole armies arc, but after that he dropped off of the radar and never reappeared, so where has he come from here?

** Good story so far. FtP had, id my opinion, a much better resolution than HPMOR (not perfect, but oh so much better), and this seems like a faithful continuation, dealing with greater consequences of the two worlds coming together, instead of focusing on vanquishing one partly sympathetic sociopath.

This chapter is a bit too timeskippy, I'd say, but I assume that this is just the author getting away from this "eleven year olds acting like adults" silliness, and it'll be more 'conventional' later.

I'll trust the author to make Ron something more than the useless fool from canon, so I'll withhold my judgment of this ship carried over from there, until we see more of how it looks like here.

P.S. There's two minor consistency errors I've noticed:

- As far as I know, in FtP Harry didn't see Riddle drink unicorn blood, this happened after the departure point in HPMOR.
- Joel calls Peri 'it' in his thoughts, while Hermione was pretty upset when Pat did this to Xeri. Maybe not all phoenix's companions personify them in the same way, but maybe it's an oversight.\\

Bah. I'm having a lot of trouble keeping the three separate levels of source straight. (FtP, HPMOR, HP). Thanks for pointing this out.

Well, I can pull out the "saw it" line and just have it be another thing that Harry learned via the Stone.

#+begin_quote
  too timeskippy, hope it will be long
#+end_quote

I hate to disappoint, but it won't. I view this as an epilogue to FtP, not a separate story in its own right--shoot, I've been having trouble keeping the source material straight over four chapters! I'm not doing another 2YE-style epic under these conditions.

Finally, the reason I'm timeskipping is to show the changes to society instead of just a heroic narrative. That's the part I'm interested in -- how the larger world is affected by magic, not what Harry and Hermione are up to.

  Ben hesitated. "Slughorn said that it didn't create luck, it just concentrated it. However much good luck it gives you, you'll have an equal amount of bad luck later, and the bad luck will often last longer because it's being pulled from across a long stretch of time to concentrate in that one short stretch where you're using the potion."
