** *Bullet attraction* is actually a superpower in Brandon Sanderson's /Mistborn/ series. It's a subset of a bigger power of pulling metal towards you, but the way they attract bullets is to pull them in towards the core of their body, which they keep heavily armored for just that purpose.

*Invisibility in the dark* is basically just "conditional invisibility". How useful it is depends on what we're defining as darkness, but it could be a very useful stealth power, allowing midnight burglaries without setting off motion detectors, being caught on camera, tripping lasers, etc.

*One second super-strength* depends on what the refractory period is, and how much strength is granted. I would have to crunch some numbers, but if the numbers were right, you might be able to use it to drive a specially made generator. One second is also enough to throw a single punch, though there you're limited by whether you also get the required secondary power of limited invulnerability.

*Absorb bad luck* implies that you can give someone good luck. Sure, this sucks for you, but that's why you have a trusted confederate. You suck up all their bad luck, they go buy a lotto ticket, and hopefully you don't get struck by lightning in the meantime. If nothing else, it's at least a service that you could get paid for.

Also, pretty much any of these would let you win Randi's prize of a million dollars, aside from "turn into a laptop forever" or "seduce hats".

How do you know the bad luck you absorb won't gradually make you more and more unlucky in your search for clients? The more bad luck you absorb, the less likely you are to find a really unlucky person, and the less money you will earn. Once you've gotten a reputation for improving other people's luck, people who are already very lucky (and if you're particularly unlucky, people who aren't very generous) will come to you and have you absorb what little bad luck they have.

** *Read your own mind*, if it's actually a superpower (as in "more than normal capabilities") sounds like a kind of supercharged introspection that would allow you to reflect on your own thoughts and where they came from, and perhaps thereby make yourself more aware of your biases and mistakes.

*Trash detection* could, in particularly poorly cleaned areas, be used to increase your situational awareness - inferring what else is going on around you by how it disturbs the trash.

*75% Levitation* suggests you would only need a little extra thrust to achieve "full" levitation, and even if you can't find yourself a 25% jetpack it might at least make you lighter on your feet, more agile, able to jump to great heights.

The picture for *acid tears* suggests that the problem is that they immediately flow into your own unprotected eye, but if there's a helpful Panacea/Bonesaw-type around, you might be able to have yourself modified to move your tear duct, so that you express acid from somewhere more useful.

*Control remote control* is a matter of perspective - who's to say a remote control couldn't have sharp edges or an attached explosive charge, at which point it becomes a mentally controlled levitating weapon. Or you could control a large number of the things to build them into some sort of agglomerated structure - build impromptu walls and bridges to control a battlefield, or swarm an opponent with the weight of hundreds/thousands of little plastic bricks.

*Summon a lamp...once* is of limited use since it's a single-shot but you might get something useful out of it by stretching the definition of "lamp" - anything that emits light could be considered a lamp, so you just need to will yourself into summoning into existence some sort of omni-useful progenitor device... with a light.

This is actually one of the powers in the /Mistborn/ series by Brandon Sanderson. You can store your weight in metal bands worn around the arms and wrists (called metalminds), making yourself lighter while you do so. This is used for extra agility, to decrease falling damage, and to jump higher. Though it's a tad more useful there, because you can store closer to 99% of your weight (and, of course, extract it).

***** Yup, you're basically storing "units" of weight/rate that you could measure in poundhours, and when you're not storing, those units are just sitting there waiting to be used. I don't think there's a limit on how many units you can use at one time either, aside from common sense. So if you need to weigh a 1000 pounds for a minute, you could get that by having stored up 16 pounds for an hour.

There's a /Mistborn/ RPG that I have at home that gives all the rules for this which the novels sort of gloss over. IIRC there's also a limit based on how much metal you have available to you to dump weight in.

(And weight is only one of sixteen attributes that you can dump and then pull out.)

Good news: even if a person stored up their mass for 20 years and "used" it all in 1 ms, they still wouldn't be dense enough to form a black hole. They would, however, extert a large (~500 GN) force on whatever they were standing on over a relatively small area -- even the compressive strength of diamond would not be able to hold up to that much (~10 TPa) pressure, so you'd end up with the person depositing a pretty large amount of energy into whatever they were standing on. And their own body. So the biggest danger to someone nearby would probably be shrapnel, not a black hole.

There's a character in League of Super Redundant Heroes who can telekinetically control cats. Being able to do that with remotes would work pretty much the same, but without being considered animal cruelty. You could tape remotes onto everything, and fly using a sufficiently large pile of remotes.

Doze from Homestuck has super slow motion. He's difficult to kill because of it, but he's also pretty useless.

Talking to fruits would be useful if they had some understanding of what's going on, but if they could only tell you things they could reasonably know like rainfall, it's pretty worthless.

Bullet attraction is incredibly useful. You could disarm your opponents by pulling their guns out of their hands. It never said the bullets have to be fired.

75% levitation would make flight a lot easier, so you could probably make wingsuits practical. You could also generate electricity by almost levitating on the way up and not on the way down.

Summon a lamp once could let you kill a supervillain by summoning it inside his head. The problem is knowing you have the power.

Turn into a laptop forever would make it vastly easier to upload your mind into a supercomputer, so you can think faster than a normal human. You could also mod your mind to make math really easy and stuff like that.

Read your own mind. Useful for introspection I suppose.

Instant hairloss. Useful for disguise purposes I suppose. Perhaps if it really does instantly vanish the hair you could use it to get rid of radioactive waste? If you could do it to others you could give haircuts or threaten people with hairloss if they didn't help you.

Abnormal arm+c+hair growth. Depends on how abnormal.

Absorb bad luck. Useful service to sell.

** Ignoring the stuff others already mentioned...

Acid tears: emotional blackmail

Control remote control: why does everyone seem to think this is telekinesis? Sounds like infrared-based technomancy to me. Which is an awesome power.

Communicate with fruit: TONS of mechanical-turk style stuff you can do with this, explaining a task to the fruit and then having it do simpler communication with a computer using metabolic changes sensors can detect. Also most fruits are still alive and doing stuff you could presumably instruct them to change the timing of, such as germination and ripening. You could make lots of money telling crates of fruits to time their ripening to when they'll be eaten. Finally, fruits actually DOES have senses and "memories" about temperature, moisture, and the levels of various chemicals.

trash detection: capture illegal pollution stuff

read your own mind: possibly very usefully for cognitive science and AI programming, in addition to the rationality benefits. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL SUPERPOWERS EVER; WAY MORE VALUABLE THAN ANY STANDARD ONES!

Super slow-mo: Very useful for science on stuff that normally happens to fast to detect or interact all the ways you want to. Also, greatly reducing life support needed for space missions.

Revive bugs: Amber get. Cue Jurassic Park. Or in more generality, getting back long extinct species from fossils is the way to go here. Insert all the standard arguments for why biodiversity is a very very valuable thing here.

** Super-slow mo: Jump off a plane. Activate slow-mo the instant before landing. If you act like you have tremendous inertia while slowed to outside forces, you could basically have conditional super-strength by swinging a hammer and activating slow-mo mid-swing. Combined with 75% levitation and a jetpack that provides more than 2.95 m/s acceleration per your body weight, which has already been brought up, this would allow you to perform orbital strikes by yourself. Assuming the one-second super-strength comes with super-durability as well, you could even survive it if you timed it properly. Summoning a lamp that intersects another object might result in the annihilation of both, meaning a four-kilogram lamp materialized in a sphere of osmium would result in an antimatter-equivalent explosion with force equal to ((volume of lamp/density of osmium)+4 kg)/c^{2.} Bug revival - does this include fossils?
