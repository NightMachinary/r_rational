#+begin_quote
  I'm polishing up the next chapter now, and I have another couple partway-done in the bank; the current goal is one chapter per month for the time being.

*** It so happens that your story here is only /mostly/ dead. See, there's a big difference between mostly-dead and all-dead. Mostly-dead is slightly alive. All-dead, well... with all-dead there's usually only one thing that you can do: go through the author's bio and look for recommendations.

** Talking about voldebook:

  He only looks a few years older than me," he added helpfully, "but in book years, he's fifty or sixty years older.

I love the humor in this story.

** Is there a good synopsis of the preceding events anywhere? It's been a few years since I last read this and am foggy on the details -- what I remember last involved a muggle detective trying to unveil the wizarding world and repeatedly getting her memories deleted/altered*. Can anyone point out where that arc took place, and maybe link a good summary of what happened prior?

*(which, as an aside, forcefully robbing someone of such a core component of their identity seems as much if not more a violation of agency and self than mere torture or mind-control, though of course continuous variation in each doesn't match up 1-to-1, i.e. I'd rather forget the last year than be tortured or mind-controlled for a year, but I'd rather stub my toe or be made to do 10 minutes of unpleasant chores than have a day of memories removed or replaced. It not being an unforgivable curse is an affront to my sensibilities. I can imagine cases where it might be justified as a lesser evil, as well as therapeutic uses, but still feel its application should be restricted in the same way state-sanctioned killing, e.g. in an active shooter context, or the administration of chemotherapy drugs are restricted).

**** It is fun to see how much one remembers from your brief synopsis and how much fails to connect, and compare that with the scenes the memory calls back on its own accord.

That being said, I think I will enjoy rereading the whole of HP-D20 even more. Thank you for making me realise that ;)
