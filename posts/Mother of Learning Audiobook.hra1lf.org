Chapter 60 was just released and there is over 50 hours of audio to listen to. The podcast has over 100,000 downloads and has wonderful support on Patreon.

Chapters are recorded live every week on Discord and Twitch if you would like to join the growing crowd and see how audiobooks are made.

In the next few weeks we will also have an artist join us on twitch to do live sketches of the scenes and characters to compliment the narration.

** Thank you so much for this! I'm a big fan of Mother of Learning, but struggle with reading text for long periods of time because of learning disabilities. I can't wait to listen.

** When I heard that /Mother of Learning/ had finished, I used audiobook to catch up (and then switched to the regular eyeball reading to finish), and now I can't un-hear the dialects you provided the various characters with.

Given that that tropical continent with Damien's fiancé appears to be heavily modelled after India, I can't shake the idea that you will give the characters there a similarly coloured accent, but then I thought how funny it would be if instead they sounded more Australian (because everything on that continent looked as if it was trying to kill them)...

Anyway, I enjoy your work. Gotta listen to that Dragon book at some point.

*** I have been saving many of my accents for when the book moves to different continents. I would like to use a variety of accents for these characters but it can be tough to pull off without sounding like a stereotype. I will see what I can do when the time comes.

​

Do check out Vainqueur the Dragon! I think it may be my best work so far!

** I remember listening to the first four chapters a while back. What ultimately turned me off, in addition to a few other things, was how not understandable Xvim's voice was. I remember it being a almost like a really bad Chinese stereotype, meanwhile he wasn't anything like that all in the actual novel. Just a really intelligent and firm man.

...was that ever fixed?

*** His voice got tonned down a bit but many people loved the voice so it stuck. Sorry it wasn't to your liking, I can understand you preferring to read instead.

** Thank you for your awesome work, I listened to your audiobook back when the final chapter came out, and it was a great way to enjoy the story.

I was also pretty hype to find out that you are doing Super Minion. I'll definitely giving that a listen when I decide to reread it.

** Great job so far, Jack. I marathoned most of the episodes a couple months back; still gotta catch up to the latest few. You're doing great!
