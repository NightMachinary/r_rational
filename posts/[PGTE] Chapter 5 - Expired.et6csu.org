** So now Neshemah has both a magical plague which can't be detected except by means of a Named who Cat just murdered, and shapeshifters who can impersonate anyone they've got the physical mass to duplicate.

I sure am glad there's no one important in the Grand Alliance of notably short stature.

** Even though there's a fight scene where Cat trounced the Revenant, all I can think about is how Cat needs a hug.

** Take your bets, who's in for "Hanno encountered similar spy-ghouls and is cleaning house?"

Anyone want to take the long shot of "the Dead king personally trounced the white knight and that's a revenant version of the spy-ghouls causing chaos in the main camp?"

*** No, we've established two major facts so far.

1) The shapeshifters are volume-limited

2) Cat is smol

She's shapeshifter bait.

**** Adding more mass isn't hard on a battlefield when the mass is made of corpses.

Edit: wait are you thinking that there's a fake cat inside there and the gate guards still didn't question her presence coming in? I think that's an even longer shot than it being fake hanno in there

***** I mean that the Story won't utilise faux-Hanno when Cat is the more likely candidate. DK does something to tie her up, knowing that she will march off to whatever problem arises, then replaces her asap

****** Dk isn't the type to leave an opening like that though. He'll kill her first because otherwise the Bard will make sure she escapes. So cat isn't a likely candidate at all because she's confirmed to be not dead yet.

Also nothing is on fire

** Are these chapters longer than they were before? I think they are supposed to be, but I haven't really noticed a difference since the update schedule changed

** Whoever is posting these, please change the title to "Book N Chapter X". I keep seeing a post with a small chapter number and thinking it's something new I might want to look at, instead of a long-running thing I already know I'm not interested in.

**** I am aware of it. But I have to spend conscious attention to notice that "[????] Chapter N - Name" is that, and not some other work. This could be easily fixed by labeling it clearly as part Many of Many.
