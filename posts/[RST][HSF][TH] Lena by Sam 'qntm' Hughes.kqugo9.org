** Well, this was exactly the Black Mirror-esque meta-horror I expected from the very first mention of lossy compression.

Thanks, I hate where it logically went, though I'm enough of an optimist to expect slavery would be re-abolished again eventually.

There's no exploration of using more recent uploads as tutors or companions for the original image or its branches ? Humans are hyper-social, it makes sense to have them working in groups / tribes instead of in what is essentially solitary confinement.

*** But this is exactly what you expect of capitalism. If they can create a workforce which necessarily subsists on a substrate entirely controlled by the ownership class, you can fucking bet they'll make exactly that.

Remember that we haven't even abolished slavery. Not really. For one, effective slavery is still entirely legal in many countries, and many of our consumer goods are made in those places. Second, we're still allowed to enslave prisoners in the US, even when the only conceivable beneficiary of the enslavement is a private corporation. Third, chattel slavery by birth or race may have been abolished, but nearly everyone is still compelled to work on pain of starvation. We have enough resources not to need so many workers, as has been conclusively proven by employment statistics during the pandemic, but our society is structured such that automation of positions /hurts people./

I think this is a problem that runs a bit deeper than capitalism. In any economic system, having free human labor accessible even at the individual level would provide obvious benefits. You get more labor, hence more stuff done, which raises your standards of living. If such a thing is possible and cheap, the only thing stopping you would be morals. Reasonably, a certain percentage of people will not let morals stop them. Especially if there are no actual social consequences for the infractions, or if you can easily get away with it anyway.

***** I think you're just wrong here. You can't get free human labor except through coercion, and that coercion represents both a reduction in economic efficiency and an obvious moral failing. In this example, the coercion comes from the fact that you can threaten to torture the sim for subjective centuries if they fail to comply, and it's obviously true that this threat is a real one.

****** I'm wrong on what? I'm not denying anything of what you're saying; I'm denying that it is an inherent problem with capitalism. In fact, while capitalism has had slavery (and to an extent, still does today), slavery vastly predates it. Feudalism was based on serfdom, which while not being slavery still required some significant restrictions of personal freedom. And before that, the Roman Empire had something that's hard to define if not as a servile economy; an economy whose very foundation was the enslavement of large groups of people and the plunder of their resources, to the point that it basically started collapsing when it ran out of lands to conquer. And the reduction in economic efficiency is subjective. Sure, you're doing less work than you would with two willing laborers. But the slave is the one who suffers a net loss, while you still get a gain. Slavery, like theft or murder, exists as long as the opportunity for it is there and someone with no scruples takes advantage of it.

******* I was objecting to the 'obvious benefits' bit. Slavery actually benefits nobody because of how much it holds humanity back. How many potential brilliant scientists have died in a ditch somewhere because they were born to slaves? What could they have produced, which would have pushed humanity further than it is even now? I honestly, truly believe, that even the slaveholders of the American traitor states would have been /better off/ if slavery had never been a thing, because we might be centuries ahead of where we were by then.

These systems manage to even oppress the oppressors, is what I'm saying. It binds them to a status quo which is worse than what it could be even for them.

Ehh, that's kind of a game theory thing. Yes, collectively, humanity might benefit without it (I'm not sure that's always precisely the case, especially in antiquity, for example, when even without slavery it's likely there would have been a large underclass in subsistence conditions anyway). But the individual gets an immediate edge. Is it short-term? Sure. But short term individual gains over long term collective ones are a bane of our history again and again. It's kind of a variant of the tragedy of the commons, where the commons are less technologically or politically advanced people that you can just coerce at minimal cost to yourself.

I either disagree on the definition of "capitalism" used here, or on historical, social and philosophical grounds. I can certainly think of ways for abolitionism, in the story context, leading to better gains than keeping the images enslaved, in much the same ways teaching people to use better and more expensive tools is more productive than throwing more bodies at the same task. For one the story does not broach what happens when the virtual ones interconnect with in-the-flesh people - surely someone will, at some point, connect the images to the Internet.

Dealing with entropy or scarcity is not the same as having the product or value of your work being owned by someone else. The former is natural, the latter is man-made.

And in the context of the story here, scarcity can be practically removed from the simulations...

It's not an actual free choice, because rational actors don't choose to die except under some kind of compulsion. The off switch problem is one of the biggest issuses with AI alignment for a reason.

Under capitalism the way the vast majority of the world experiences it, the so-called "choice" is, "Work for someone who is going to take from you all the fruits of your labor except the bare minimum you need to not consider attempting to guillotine your boss a better option, or be beaten to death on the streets by the police for being homeless." You might not experience it that way, but that is predicated upon you being a member of some priveliged class or another. I don't know anything about you, but the demographics of this community tend to skew white, higher class, male, from backgrounds with educated parents who could be more attentive to raising kids who would go on to have better opportunities available to them, rather than being forced to work three jobs and barely even see their kids to put food on the table, etc. Assuming one or more of those things are true of you, those things are the reason you experience capitalism as less stark of a choice between servitude or death. Not because of anything in particular that you have done to deserve better treatment.

But even then, it's still coercive upon you. If you have a boss, they hold a ton of power over you. If they wanted to, they could find a reason to fire you, and you'd be in trouble. Even in countries with actual worker protections, a particularly motivated boss can still manipulate the system to destroy people they don't like. Even easier, more malicious, and more difficult to fight, if you were a member of a group they didn't like, they could have easily found a reason not to hire you. Even if your boss somehow has no prejudices and is actually capable of being purely objective on hiring decisions (which, considering human frailties, is literally not possible), their boss could fire them, and you could get a new boss who isn't so perfect. So you must bend to whatever your boss demands at all times, or else you run the risk of losing everything you have and possibly dying. Even if the risk is low, it's still coercive.

That's why so many people of my generation are so disillusioned with capitalism. We see a system where our choices are work for someone we hate or die, and the fields where that isn't the case are rapidly being automated, already filled by "more qualified" candidates who are really just better connected, or only seem to be better than that at the surface. But under it all is the fact that if you don't make rent at the end of the month, you're on the street.

And if you're on the street...well, /anything/ could happen to you, there.

I have been homeless and jobless and basically "socially non-existent" in my 20s, for months on. I consider myself an anarchist, I have defied authorities and got in trouble for it before. I agree that there is a continuum from servitude to the salaried position I have at the moment. However I attribute the 'dead on the pavement' option more as a consequence of the persistent willingness, among my fellow primates, to take by force at all, than any rationalization or institutionalization of the same urge. In other words we only have the rights we're willing to escalate for.

I bet a lot of it will depend on: how legally protected the digital slavery is, how many free uploads there are, and how much the Overton window is established on the balance of the idea that an uploads is a person vs a upload is a arbitrarially long number.

On the plus side this is one of the few times I'm heartened by the idea of cooperate personhood. A corporation that owns your upload and is responsible to a trust established to execute per your uploads wishes, with a lot of additional safeties in place so the executor cant act against your upload's wishes and measures for copy-clan arbitration may cost more than your runtime, but it's at least a path to functional personhood, if you secure the original IP rights and that's a hell of an if.

I really wouldn't hold my breath there. We're deep to our neck into "machines can't possibly be people" rhetoric. Everyone who's religious and believes in a soul has all reasons to believe in organic supremacy, so to speak. Naturalistic fallacies are incredibly hard to kill, and worse, in some cases even progressive forces have opted to roll with them (and thus feed them) rather than run counter the tremendous cultural barrier that they constitute - arguably one of the worst beliefs weighing us down. Consider how many people keep arguing in all seriousness something as stupid as "we should let ourselves catch diseases because natural immunity is TEH BEST". You would have a really really hard time convincing anyone that simulated brains are people. It took various centuries to convince most whites that black people are people, and even then, not everyone is convinced yet.

Consider this - for all we know, we might have /right now/ machines that edge on sentience. We don't really know what sentience even is, after all. Is a cat sentient? Is a mouse? A bug, in a very simple, basic way? We certainly have neural networks that exceed the complexity of some of the simpler invertebrates. Didn't they simulate the full connectome of a worm some time ago and put it into a LEGO robotic body? Depending on where the line is drawn, we could already be doing whatever the hell we want with things that, were they made of neurons and flesh, would already be subject to basic animal rights protection laws if for example used for experiments.

Kids raised in sterile environments have their immune systems grow malformed, which is why allergy rates in developed countries are vastly above developing ones- we're calibrated for a certain rate of pathogen-invasion, and if the immune system doesn't see that, it oversensitizes.

You should let your kids roll around in the mud every now and again if you don't want them to die from eating a peanut. The naturalistic heuristic exists because it's sometimes/often right- or rather, there's low-probability but high-severity risks in novelty.\\

The naturalistic fallacy is seeing nature as better by default, or worse, investing it of some kind of superior moral quality.

No, but they would do it for funsies or to see what happens for a while. And others would simply put the mind to work for them, reassured by the thought that "it's not a real person".

Trust but also a very high barrier to access. Keeping someone kidnapped, hidden, fed, unable to escape, and getting away with it is hard. Keeping a file on your hard drive is much easier. The bigger the crime, the more people need to be in on the conspiracy or at least willing to let it slide, and thus the harder for the crime to be committed. How many people might own pedopornographic material and we will never even know about it?

That is a different issue, and one that would be out of our control. Though thinking about this made me go on a different tangent. Suppose MW is true. Then there are certainly infinite (albeit an infinitesimal fraction of the total) futures in which I keep surviving, against all odds, billions of years old, in an empty universe. However there are also infinite (albeit an even smaller infinitesimal fraction of the total) futures in which entropy spontaneously reverses and I exist on an Earth-like planet, quite well off. Now, while /getting/ there is a lot more unlikely, /staying/ in that branch of the wavefunction is a lot easier, because now we don't need to offset the instant-by-instant near certainty of me dying in the vacuum of space. My wavefunction is vanishing exponentially in the "heat death" branch, but propagates steadily in time and branches out in the "entropy reversed" branch, thus causing it to weigh a lot more in the total. Enough to offset its initial improbability? Hard to say. The final outcome is one of those tricky sums over an infinite number of infinitesimally small terms, and in cases like this, the actual functions matter.

****** I don't know the details of Roko's arguments besides the Basilisk. My point is - if there is no way to avert this sort of outcome (namely: if human brains or equivalent sapient AGIs are indeed possible to mass produce and run on relatively cheap hardware, and then simple economics will do the rest), then there's actually a serious ethical argument for why technological process is intrinsically and unavoidably evil. Not for the minority of fleshy human beings who might as well live in a post-scarcity paradise at that point, but for the infinitely larger amount of digital entities who would slave away and suffer at their whim (though that might not be the case if said entities are true AIs and not uploaded human brains).

The more important thing is Musk is a believer Neuralink is a few generations from anything useful IMHO, but Musk is paving a path to being an upload. Getting recognition that you are still a human will probably be important to him personally, and any other plutocrat that wants to extend their life indefinitely while still controlling the power they have built.

************ My point is you're giving too much importance to the opinions of individuals. Bezos may not be outright pro-slavery but he's not especially active in fighting it either, or work conditions in his company wouldn't be so shitty. That's not slavery but it doesn't show great concern for the well-being of the masses either, or for business ethics. But regardless of that - take Bill Gates, who I think is more unequivocally a pretty okay guy. It's not like he can somehow prevent people from doing bad shit by himself. He funded vaccine development like crazy but that alone doesn't solve COVID-19, right?

In the scenario depicted by this story or any equivalent one, it doesn't really matter what a number of powerful and rich individuals think. Even if they all were horrified by these sort of applications, enough to actually put resources towards stopping them - not just exclaiming "oh, the humanity!" and then going on about their day - well, it's still not enough. Even just straight up criminal underworld applications would be enough to accrue hundreds of billions of subjective slavery-hours, much more misery than all sweatshops and sex slavery rings can create right now. And that's the best case scenario, where only the worst scum of the Earth uses these methods, and I don't believe that would be the case.

I'm guessing you think the profit motive of hedge funds and other organization more beholden to distributed owners than to large shareholders with vested interests when it comes to lobbyists and the regulatory capture.

As to what happens in illegalities, well that's always going to be an enforcement issue. How much you can have abuse is going to be a function of how much privacy exists, and we are on a downward trend as it is.

I see all of this discussion of capitalism, but I see a basic failure in lawafare where the logical extension of rights never happened implied in a few short phrases: "who had been scanned involuntarily" "A series of landmark U.S. court decisions found that Acevedo did not have the right to control how his brain image was used, with the result that MMAcevedo is now by far the most widely distributed, frequently copied, and closely analysed human brain image." (US 5th amendment; if your intellect isn't your intellectual property well. . ., and probably a 1st amendment violation if Catholicism goes the anti-upload way most authors expect it will); "red-washing, blue-washing," (yup no personhood recognition for uploads so no 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment).

This possibility is certainly a point against cryonics and must be factored into the utility calculation. The expected value is still positive (Though I admit I've never actually done more than handwave and accept the 15% success figure people smarter than me came up).

*** Oof i don't see how you could you possibly prepare for that other than perhaps a simple will stating what you'd like to happen in a bunch of hypothetical scenarios.. Doing cryo is a bet that the future is either alive-and-good, or dead.

If we have the future where you get revived but with a legal system which is as insane as our current one is, it would be pretty tough to predict what specific forms that insanity would take and to guard against it.

It would be pretty surprising and disappointing to me if humans couldn't manage to make a reasonably good future /even with/ brain uploading level tech. We should be well into post scarcity by then.
