** So this has been in my reading list for a bit, where I frequently passed it over for other works because of the cover. By which I judged it, yes. Anyway, this story is very, very good. It tells two stories, one of the main character's rise to power and inevitable fall, and then another where he starts to build up from almost nothing once more. The really interesting parts though, at least for this subreddit, are the experiment logs every few chapters, which pose such questions as: given the ability to reduce any substance to the components that you personally find valuable, how do you best use it in your goal to kill an immortal, nearly unkillable king and master of dark magic?

This story updates at a ridiculous rate, but it does have some flaws. The author doesn't seem to know the difference between “it's” and the possessive “its” which really annoyed me, and has a tendency to break dialogue up into several paragraphs for no good reason.

That said, this gets my mark of approval.

*** I keep seeing it in the featured column but haven't had a chance to read it yet. I might start on it this weekend.

*** I'm usually the guy who wouldnt touch MLP with a 10 meter pole if you paid me a million bucks to do so but your description intrigued me. Hopefully it isn't as bad as I fear it may be.

**** It's really good; the author is an experienced dungeon master and knows how to bring a world to life. Do get back to me once you've read some of it, though, I'd like to know what someone who detests the fandom thinks of this story.

***** From what I've read, I've mentally +suppressed+ replaced all mentions of MLP with typical humanoid features. Hands instead of hoof, fingers instead of horns, simple replacements like that. The story itself hasnt really been anything special but it's not shit. That makes it at least in the top 50% of fanfics/general literature I've read.

****** Yeah, the writing quality I'd say is about average. What I like about it is the progression and the way the protagonist actually leverages every bit of power into something useful. Remaking the internet with dream magic was pretty cool.

******* Alright, I've read a couple dozen chapters in and I rate it as poor on the rationality and munchkining. Perhaps it's my own personal experience as an university lab student but the way every solution is just magic'ed away breaks any sense of rationality.

Magic is interesting and sometimes necessary to break pesky laws like thermodynamics but it shouldn't solve everything. But when it becomes the universal hammer, everything becomes a nail. Magic gotta have some downsides, or at least more than being hard to learn.

******** Huh, I disagree with that premise. Breaking thermodynamics is basically a must for most magic systems. Once you have it, it /should/ overpower technology, especially if you're letting a character munchkin it. Better yet, though, you should be able to combine the principles of both.
