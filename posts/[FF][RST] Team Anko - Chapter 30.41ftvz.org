** This felt...extraordinarily abrupt.

Like, I get how everything happened. It makes sense how it played out.

But still didn't sit quite right.

*** You're not wrong. I poked at it, but couldn't find a way that I liked better. Anko was going to get the team out of there so fast their shadows had to catch up, and it's only about a three-hour run to Konoha, so there wasn't a lot of room for other events on the way. I could have put in the scene of them arriving and being brought to the Hokage, but that just felt like filler.

He told Naruto that bijuu are physically not able to deliberately break their promises, and that doing so accidentally hurts.

***** Exactly. I'm glad we agree. You're the only reasonable one in the entire friggin' audience -- everyone else is all "Oh, Kurama is such a liar!" "Oh, Kurama is a giant Primordial town-destroying monster, he must be lying!" or "Oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god please stop eating me Kurama!" Never any sympathy, any tolerance.

What is the world coming to??

****** It really is sad to see the state of our youth today, when Primordial beings from beyond time and space such as +mysel+... /Kurama/, can not be trusted to be true to their words.

It's discrimination quite frankly, and it disgusts me.

Really, what are they teaching in our schools? Honestly.

  A normal Aburame hosted a few tens- or, for the most senior clan members, hundreds of thousands of kikai. The force that Shino set on the Sound ninja was /fifteen million./
#+end_quote

The restatement itself was already more than enough, the italics are definitely too much.

Anko wishes she wasn't living in interesting times.

** One question I have; how is it that Shino still had access to fifteen million kikai bugs? At some point in the last few chapters, if I remember correctly, it was established that the massive swarm only had a few hours to live once it stopped feeding off the chakra battery.

**** The negotiations between the Fox and Orochimaru went on "for hours" (Direct quote) and then the team (possibly sans Naruto/Fox) slept. The Fox said "Good morning" at the start of the chapter, implying it was the next day. I think I must be missing something, but it seems rather unclear how such a small amount of time has passed.

***** Well, there's two possibilities:

1. The Fox made a point of feeding the bugs with chakra so they didn't starve.
2. I forgot to update my timeline document.

Obviously, the correct answer is #1. Absolutely.

EDIT: oh, and Shino has a lot more than that. 15mm was just be number he sent back to help Anko.

  time line
#+end_quote

I have a document where I keep track of when everything in the story happens. For example, remember back in chapter 19 when Hinata went to Orochimaru's lab and he threw things at her? That started at 9am on July 29.

An author needs to keep something like this for anything longer than a short story or things get tangled up. I was forgetful at the beginning and didn't start it until I was several chapters in, so there's one day early on where the times actually don't work out -- a certain section of the story should have happened after sundown, but it didn't.
