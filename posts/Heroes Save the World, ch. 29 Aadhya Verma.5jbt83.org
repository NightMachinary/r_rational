** I feel bad that nobody commented, must have been an antimeme like the girl's power.

I really like the story even if I never comment, I hope the low amount of attention doesn't deter you from continuing

*** Thank you!

Right now I'm feeling hopeful. There isn't a huge amount of attention on HSTW right now, but the month isn't even over and I've already gotten more hits than in previous months. I'm getting a better rate of posts read per visitor and a similar improvement in views per post, too, which I think are good signs.

**** I think the story has been pretty slow for the past few chapters, not much happening other than talking but now it seems it's starting to accelerate again a little towards meaningful things.
