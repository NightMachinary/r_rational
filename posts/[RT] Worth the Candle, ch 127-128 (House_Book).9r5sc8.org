  Achievement Progress: Oh the Places You'll Go (2/64)
#+end_quote

Presumably this means there are 64 {planes/dimensions/worlds} including Aerb proper and the Infinite Library. If we include

- Aerb
- The Infinite Library
- Earth (?)
- The not-quite-the-Ethereal plane
- The Plane of Drift
- The 28 elemental planes
- The (at least) four "mathematical" dimensions (m -space, n- space, t- space, and p- space)
- The 26 non-excluded "dangerous" parallel dimensions

That's 63, which is suspiciously close to 64, so although we might have included a spare single dimension this feels pretty close to the actual list. "The entirety of hell" might count as another, and Earth might not count at all. </speculation>

I'm pretty sure that Earth doesn't count since if there were any possible way to get back to Earth, then Arthur would have most likely succeeded in reaching it. The hells probably count as a plane, and I think the last plane is wherever Arthur traveled to from Fel Seed's exclusion zone. Although it could possibly be Earth.

Turning this into a quest could actually be a classic 'dick move' from Dice Guy. Joon's finally given a solution to his Level Up's yet in order to access the solution he needs to complete a quest...which gives him XP...which could very well level him up at Spirit Lvl 1 before he can actually utilise it.

Seems like the sort of thing Dice Guy would do. Of course, also like Dice Guy, there are workarounds as long as Joon realises the danger (or future Amaryllis writes about it).

My preference would be that one because I've done programming myself and am aware of just how easy it is to fuck up, but the closest to that we've seen anywhere else was this bit from Chapter 36 where his Mental went above the level that the emulation of his personality could handle:

#+begin_quote
  So after reviewing my questions again and finding nothing really worthy of note, I closed my eyes and put another two points into MEN, increasing my mental stats by one yet again.

  The words blasted across my field of vision as soon as I opened my eyes, bright red, all caps, and in a different font. As soon as I had read them, the words disappeared, and I was left looking at the papers in front of me, not really seeing them.

  "Well, fuck," I said out loud.

That's not a "yes". That's the sort of thing I'd say if I wanted to give an evasive answer that wasn't a yes and was worried about truth-divining entads.

Now, on the other hand, we do see this:

#+end_quote

But still, I wonder - is there something going on where she doesn't have unilateral authority? A council/senate/whatever of co-equal rulers all given the title Head Librarian/Librarix/etc, for example?

Finally - could Bethel's production of books trigger a rapid expansion of the Infinite Library? If Bethel produced 100 million copies of "Missive From Mary of 20 Years In The Future to Juniper" could they flood the library reliably?

Sounds like the kind of thing that would get a bad reaction from the library (i.e. from the DM). E.g. they show up and most of the library is indeed full of that book...but each copy is guarded very inconveniently by some sort of Fel Seed-y horror.

*** My read on Raven's status is that she calls the shots as long as everyone else is more or less okay on what she's doing. She has a lot of leeway, but not enough that she could give any order and have it go unquestioned. Maybe if enough librarians think she shouldn't be in charge anymore they can +backstab her+ call for a no confidence vote.

  “It was a mix of cultural baggage, misunderstandings, and differences of our species,” said Grak. “I felt a deep kinship with Ding. To me, he was krin, or at least krinrael.”

  (I don't think I can do those words justice with a translation. ‘Krin' was someone you were physically intimate with, often to the level of sharing a bed naked with them, and ‘krinrael' was that, but much more temporary, not an ongoing arrangement. It didn't imply that you were dating, or that you even talked all that much, but it often was a stepping stone to more intimate or contractual arrangements, like the dwarven version of marriage and/or pair-breeding. You could have more than one krin, but it wasn't particularly common. There was some element of (or at least some suggestion toward) sex, but dwarves didn't place all that much emphasis on sex, and it wasn't what a dwarf would think of when they thought of krin.)

#+begin_quote
  □ Murder in Duplicate - As soon as it was discovered by a precocious young girl, the ability for a person to duplicate themselves was excluded to a thousand square miles and that single person. Doris Finch lives her life in duplicate; to complete the exclusion, it will be necessary to kill every single one of her. (0/9,511,346)

  □ Manifest Destiny - The fall of the Second Empire was, by some accountings, inevitable, but by others, it was the work of a single incident. The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, as is his exact location, but it is clear that with the magic excluded, his range is limited to only Lankwon, once the Imperial City, now the City Made Manifest. Defeating him will be an impossible task, but one that you have taken upon yourself.

  □ A Door Into the Soul - Caldwell Gatesmith has the dubious distinction of being responsible for two exclusions. Through his portals, he keeps watch over his domain. If he spies you, and you do not meet with his satisfaction, his portals will cut with an edge designed to cleave time and space.

  □ The Z-word - Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is the reason that no one says it. That's his word.

  □ Everything Eater - More monster than man, no one has seen Rove's face in four hundred years and lived to tell the tale. He sits at the center of a half mile of dirt, flesh, and garbage. If you slay him, you will be the first to have survived contact with him.

  □ Better with Loops - Through magics unknown, a young boy of eighteen found himself reliving the same month over and over again, with death only bringing him back to the same crisp spring morning. Time does not behave within his exclusion zone, and only bringing a permanent end to his life will restore the area to normalcy. Beware, lest you be trapped in the cycle.

  □ [REDACTED] - The more you [REDACTED], the more you [REDACTED], until [REDACTED]. Merely knowing his name makes him [REDACTED], and his gender alone is a piece of information you might wish you didn't have, if [REDACTED]. Better to go in blind.

  □ Unwavering - In the beginning, they said that the goblin inspired loyalty, until it became clear that what he was doing was more literal than figurative. To kill him, you'll need to fight through a veritable army of his loyal servants, if you don't end up becoming one of them yourself.

  □ Fleshsmith - For millennia, fleshsmithing was a noble trade of Pendleham, one practiced by noscere and ignoscere alike. When a small cabal took the craft too far, exclusion reared its ugly head, leaving Pendleham as the City of Flesh, where none dare tread.

  □ Aches and Plains - Perhaps farming might seem an innocuous thing to evoke the exclusionary principle, but given the time and attention brought to it by a billion minds, it was inevitable that someone would breach its deeper secrets. The land of Pai Shep is now guarded by a single warrior-farmer, his fields impeccable, his power absolute.

  □ Guardian of the Underworld - A machine of vast intellect, funneled into the body of a broken man. The people of Aerb have yet to pass his tests, but perhaps someone of a different world has the wherewithal to be allowed within his inner sanctum.

  □ Finger of the Sun - When the elves broke Celestar, there were a small few who continued on with their research. The product of their effort brought nothing but pain.

  □ Gone to Seed - There is a place on Aerb considered worse than the first four thousand hells. Fel Seed sits on a throne of living flesh, unable to spread beyond his domain, but with a rule of horror within it. You know his weakness.

*** He gets an extremely powerful and addictive burst of pleasure that is getting stronger with each level.

Once he gained access to his soul and could identify his "values", he noticed that "level up" was gaining prominence to the point where it was becoming his number one priority.

At present, he uses soul magic to artificially remove that impulse, but it has been returning stronger every time he leveled up, and the last time he did he couldn't bring himself to reduce it again (Amarilis did it for him). The worry is that if it happens with no soul mage at hand, he might become lost in the addiction.

** With this talk of Bethel drawing on the magics of the bottle, I suppose I have to register a prediction I've thought of - the locus will be "freed" by merging with Bethel, by putting the bottle inside her entad-eating cupboard.

It probably wouldn't work on a number of levels, first and foremost Bethel not consenting to anything of the sort, but I believe it's at least technically possible. The resulting being should still be enough locus to count, wouldn't be drastically at odds with itself (Bethel does consider the Loci kindred spirits, and it's easy to see why), and it requires no powers not yet introduced.

I don't consider it particularly likely, but on the off chance it does happen, I'd prefer to have guessed so publicly, and making wild guesses is a low-cost action.

** So, one thing that I feel like has not been brought up for a while is the gods. I believe there were 5 of them. And Amaryllis even met some of them didn't she? Anyways although it has been stated that these beings are nowhere near the power of the DM it can be safe to assume that the are orders higher in power than most beings on Aerb. Yet they haven't ever really been brought up as being significant. Never mentioned to have had any interaction with Uther which is crazy because with how it seems the upper echelons of the mortals realized that Uther might have been bending reality in a way that was causing greater and greater mayhem you'd think the gods would notice. Are they excluded into their own little areas, do people worship them, how strong are they. Anyways yeah it felt like all these crazy other worlds and apocalyptic beings were being mentioned and yet not one mention of these gods so I hope they are at least mentioned somewhat.

*** not afaik, but I do wish this were more of a common practice -- it doesn't seem too hard for authors to give a 150 word chapter summary at the end of every ~3-5k words, and maybe even compile a running summary of all chapters to stick at the very end. There are so many fics that I was enjoying until hitting the current chapter, but didn't follow along for whatever reason -- when it's resurrected (or I return to it) potentially years later, I'm not motivated enough to read through all the material (potentially books' worth!) I'd already consumed, and trying to jump in where I left off leaves me confused. And yet, I very rarely see something like this done. Maybe there's just not much of a demand for it.

**** Joon (Full name juniper) is a human in Bumblefuck kansas who plays DnD. His best friend died, and he was dealing with suicidal thoughts and various unhealthy coping systems. He wakes up in a world created as an anaglam of his various DnD games, including several where he was just raging about various things. He meets up with: Amy, a human woman descendant to uther. Fen, a half elf thief/archer. Bethal, a sentient house once owned by uther. Grak, a third gender dwarven warder. Val, an almost human with no soul. And a sentient deer that is actually a forest that lives in a jar carried by a little green woman who died and was literally reborn in a time chamber. Joon has access to a game layer, allowing him to do various things and upgrade, finds out that uther from 500 years ago is his friend who may or may not be dead but is missing, learns he is living in a world with thousands of hells and no heaven, and has met the DM of the world. Fen died, there are no dream skewered, and he is meeting with a party lead by people who knew arthur so he can go into an infinite library.
