** Since the author asked me to, I'll post my review of the most recent (ninth) chapter of Pokemon: The Origin of Species, so they can address the issues in a more generally-feedback-friendly environment. Please keep in mind that this is my very first post on reddit. I had and still have an irrational and severe dislike of this particular social network (the irony of admitting this in [[/r/rational]] is not lost on me). Furthermore the review was intended for ff.net and thus is more in line with that particular community's style and sensibilities, or at least as I see them. And lastly, prior to this quoted review I had already reviewed twice on previous chapters, which may account for any inappropriate joviality.

#+begin_quote
  The development and coding of machines is... troublesome. It implies a lot, really, though I expect your version to give certain allowances to. For instance programmers need to have some programming language that interferes and overlaps to a sufficient degree with the digitisation issue of pokemon. Though that can simply be a case of "round shape fits round hole, regardless of tools used to get round shape". Hopefully that simile isn't too crude... Regardless, another point in that is the testing procedure. Programmers need to have a reasonable facsimile of pokemon code they can test their prototypes on, or have some back-up measure of the real pokemon code, otherwise they run the danger of seriously endangering the well-being of the physical pokemon. That of course assumes Pokémon has a more serious pokemon cruelty and testing lobby and policy than ours compared to animals.

  And now that I think of it, this brings up another thing I always wondered: Do pokemon replace animals, or do they expand the world by a totally different offshoot of biology and evolution? There are some serious implications in both, really. Take the first case, for instance. Our understanding of evolution (mark the lack of capital E) implies that humans could be a special case of pokemon, once one applies Occams razor with enough rigour. Effectively supplanting the animal kingdom with pokemons. Which still raises a lot of questions of biology, like plants, do they Evolve? How does pollination work, or are all the colourful flowers a mere side effect and not an attractor of pollinators? If pokemon are pollinators, there's the size issue, for instance...

  The second case, pokemon being a different line of creature with regular animals also inhabiting the world, on the other hand raises the question: Where do they come from? Why the parallel development to regular animals (similarities to regular animal species like dogs, bisons, birds, jellyfish, ...)? Is the whole Pokémon world a case of second civilisation after the first that created pokemon crashed apocalyptically? A point I agree on with Blue and Red is the age issue. Personally I'd wait for the children to turn thirteen, I guess, since at that stage in their (psychological) development two years can be a lot. I wonder, though, if 15 is their age of consent -- they can buy houses and enter contracts unsupervised? If so... well, you could always say the Pokémon world has years with about 400 days instead of the usual 350. That way they'd still be around the nominal age implied, but be just a tad in physical capability and mental maturity in the bell curve we have in mind, but still perfectly regular in that of the Pokémon world.

  The psychoanalysing rule made me laugh out loud :)

  I wonder if you'll apply the easy storage and/or transport technology you just demonstrated (the acquisition of the gas masks, delivered by pokeball derivative technology) to the world and economy at large. Easy transport of goods probably the world over is intriguing, especially without the whole consumption of fuel demonstrated. Though the whole process is probably powered by energy, and that might as easily be the biggest coal power plants ever built; it wouldn't fit the utopian streak of the story, though.

  In regards to the insulated shoes... those I assume to be more prevalent due to a higher chance of electrical mishaps in Pokémon, simply by the abundance of electro type pokemons, but I wouldn't be surprised if insulated over-shoes, like socks for shoes or in the style of crampons, were widely sold. It's much easier to add to your equipment, especially in warmer climates, than an extra pair of shoes.

  The bottom-up approach in planning to use his flute is very Red, while the middle-out or top-down seems very like a Blue thing to do, so congratulations on gibing your characters enough characterisation by now to allow me make such a judgement. Another thought comes to mind, though: the command versatility of songs versus the song likeness of commands. In both directions it can become very atonal, or very pretty, and everything in-between.

  Just now I've been wondering, if you will in-or have already excluded the game mechanic of spending pokeballs, regardless of success in capture. I understand the need for the game mechanic, but can also see at least one technical option that could adapt that in-universe. Like a charge for instance, which is spent by trying to capture a pokemon. If it breaks free, the charge is still spent and the ball needs to be recharged in a pokemon centre. The Containers wouldn't have the same disadvantage since pokeballs are the specialised case, with specialised requirements, whereas Containers recharge by using the temperature gradients between storage and exterior or something like that.

  The abundance and willingness of concussive stunning of pokemon is a bit worrisome, I have to admit. Sure, slowing a pokemon down by exhausting it is one thing, but Hamato swinging the weedle into a tree trunk could have easily caused a retardation or worse in a real animal. But I suspect pokemon are hardier than comparable animals (which in turn could ties into the "humans are pokemon-ish" hypothesis).

  As always, this has been a very enjoyable read, and continues being a fine case of world-building :)

On to the questions!

#+end_quote

There absolutely exists a regulatory body and safeguards in the pokemon world to ensure that some programmer trying to make a quick name for themself doesn't test their code out on live pokemon without meeting some quality assurance standards. The computational power in the pokemon world is immense, so their modeling systems tend to be pretty realistic: most of the catastrophic errors that might occur from editing a pokemon's biology would be caught fairly quickly when testing in simulations.

All that said, there definitely exist those who are willing to cut corners and fly under the radar to speed up the process, thinking little of the well being of the pokemon involved. These people are unlikely to be sadists, and more likely to simply view it as an extension of the usual scientific testing on pokemon to advance our understandings of biology and medicine.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Pokemon have completely replaced all non-plant life on earth. I can't say anything more than that without giving away the plot, but evolution by natural selection did indeed occur on earth at one point in history, and still does: it's simply no longer the sole means by which new species arise.

#+end_quote

Honestly, the way I see it is that a world as dangerous as pokemon, pretty much everyone is a few standard deviations more intelligent, creative, physically capable, and mature than the average person in our world. Everyone else would have died long before the technology to capture and train pokemon became widespread.

#+begin_quote

Pokemon are by far the greatest source of energy in their world: their physics are not our physics, or at the very least they're capable of bending them enough that a small rodent can create thousands of volts of electricity over its lifespan. But they're also a bit more progressive, so renewable energy is the norm pretty much everywhere. I don't know that I'd call their world "utopian," what with monsters running around leveling cities every other year, but it's definitely more technologically advanced in any number of ways.

#+end_quote

I was actually thinking of this, but the idea was just to use the insulating shoes as a replacement. Anything as optional as crampons or socks would need to be worn all the time while in the wild so you'd be ready at any moment, which is far less convenient than even carrying around an extra pair of shoes.

Personally I've always seen it as a purely game mechanic that pokemon can escape from their balls once captured at all. When inside, they're transmuted into energy and data: either the ball should be able to hold them, or not. Stronger balls are capable of storing larger pokemon, or pokemon with more energy, but unless you try to use a pokeball on a snorlax or something, the balls won't break.

Please excuse my nagging, but I base this on having some expertise in this regard: it is easy to produce voltage, since it is simply a measure of differences in electrical charge. Static electricity for instance can easily go into the hundreds of volt of charge. A more apt way to describe the power generative capabilities of Pokemon would include other units, like Joule and Watts (with the former simply describing spending/converting the power of 1 Watt for the duration of 1 Second).

If pokemon are truly the biggest source of power in the Pokémon world, wouldn't that require huge farms of them, with subsequently larger farms for feed? I can reason, of course, there being a more decentralised system of power distribution, which would cut on the size necessary, but the humane treatment of the pokemon would require them to be given the chance to rest, have free days or days off during mating season, and more. Let's speculate: We assume a pikachu can produce about 300 Watts steadily, for about four hours a day, without exhausting the individual. For a twenty-four hour cycle we need six individuals. If we furthermore assume greatly reduced power consumption (say a magnitude) compared to the US, then each citizen still needs half a pikachu, times six (to cover the day), times two (for off days, safety margin, ...), giving us six pikachu for each person. I gather by your statement that the capability of pokemon increases more on an exponential or logarithmical curve than a geometric one? That'd still cover a lot of pokemon that'd need to be tamed and given incentive to work.

This whole conjecture by me supports your handling of the insulated shoes, though :)

***** Why does everyone assume /electric/ Pokemon would be used for power generation? Those'd be the /easiest/ and /first/ but the concept of a /power plant/ is that it uses heavy equipment to convert from one form of energy to another.

What you'd use is whatever Pokemon have the greatest power output. Fire Pokemon can boil water. Most water Pokemon can create it and might do so at the top of a tall tower. There are plenty of super-strong, telekinetic, and huge-and-doesn't-need-food Pokemon to basically turn cranks. Some plant Pokemon can cause absurdly fast growth of biomass from nothing and you could just burn that. And this is not getting into what the weirder and more abstract attacks actually are, but since the creation of mass has already been shown there's almost no upper limit.

And then there's the possibility, if containers actually DO turn matter into energy, of turning random rocks or seawater or something into energy and just discarding the information, using it directly for power instead.

****** You raise a very good point, Armok.

Why /not/ use all kinds of pokemon supplied, available energy? Ignoring the matter-energy-transformation for now, the very first argument for limiting power generation to electric pokemon would be efficiency. The electricity supplied by pokemon is already easy to handle and convert, whereas indirect means need to be converted into a transferable kind of energy -- most likely electricity. If all things are being the same in pokemon matter/energy generation capabilities, electric kinds would have the simple advantage of having no or at least fewer losses to incur in the harvesting process.

That is not to say such round-about ways weren't used in the history of Pokémon. The time of steam and coal? Water and fire pokemon working in concert.

But the matter generation might be an issue, once pokemon are around long enough. For ball-parking, let's take water type pokemon of all kinds, make them roughly equivalent to dogs and do some back-of-the-envelope calculation: 80 M dogs in US mass about 22 kg water generation capability is higher than actual use, so... say their mass a day on average.

80 million * 22 kg (for density of water this equals 22 litres) = 1760Ml

1760 Megalitre, or 1,760,000 m^{3} .Huh, I'd have expected more than a field of 1 square kilometre filled up to 1.76 metres with water. Even if water types provide 100 times that as an aggressive guess, it'd still be be less than 200m deep. Over time, though... in a year the volume of the conservative guess would be 2/3 of a cubic kilometres (aggressive: 64 km^{3} ). Make that ten-thirtyfold to account for the whole world and we're in the region of 6.4 km^{3} (conservative) to 2000 km^{3} (aggressive; that's Lake Superior every sixth year, or the Black Sea every 283th) per year. And who knows when Pokémon replaced the natural wildlife. 10,000 years ago? Conservative would make that ca. 1/8th of the Black Sea. But looking at the aggressive guess would make that an amount comparable to 1.5% the volume of global sea water.

So. A lot of matter. Sorry for going off on a tangent.

******* I already answered mot of those questions; electric Pokemon seems to be dealing with much lower energies than many other types, so even with conversion inefficiency and the need for infrastructure the output per unit of human labor and food in the longer term is VASTLY better. Electric Pokemon are very simple and nice, but they as several people have noticed don't scale to support a civilization. Being able to guide a wave to fill up a hydroelectric dam /does/.

Or take the Machop chain. Specifically notes being willing to do hard work and never getting tired, and throwing around specific heavy objects with one hand, including a /mountain/ for the most evolved form. [[http://www.ign.com/pokedex/pokemon/machop]] Assuming a conservative small 10^{12} kg mountain, lifted 1 meter, that's around 3 GWh for ONE lift.

But that reasoning doesn't address the point you raised.

May I address it with a counter-argument that goes a bit meta? Because the way you're currently describing the power generation capabilities, not just electrical but in a more general sense, would lead to a very schizotech world. Ships powered by machoks running in treadmills, that kind of thing. While interesting, such a world is not /intriguing/, but maybe even aggravating. And, based on a gut feeling, prone to stagnation.

So yeah, I agree with you that there are more efficient ways to supply electric power than electro type pokemon. This doesn't mean I'd have to like it, though.

Yes, you might use something like that for big ships specifically (or more likely, a water Pokemon), much like we use local power generation like diesel for those. But for most things, you'd convert to electricity for a similar reason we do; it's easy to transport and distribute, and the generation is far more efficient at huge centralized facilities. In fact, if Pokemon powered the original trains, and are used for power plants, that might be part of why cars and such are electric and the non-Pokemon related generation is more green.

Using pikachu may have been a bad example, since it's a mammal and thus easier to empathize with. Not to say that they wouldn't be used for energy if needed, but most electric farms in the pokemon world would use lower order pokemon like voltorb/electrode and magnemite/magneton, which are much less intelligent and easier to care for.

Not to say it's necessarily always humane to round up thousands of voltorbs and treat them like living batteries, any more than the way we treat cattle in our world is, but for better or worse, they also see the "manmade" pokemon (pokemon that only started appearing after manmade objects they mimic, which would include things like trubbish) in a more proprietary way, easier to rationalize using as they see fit.

The intent of my guesstimating was ball-parking the amount of pokemon needed to get some reliable power supply running. To compensate for a significantly higher energy consumption, as per matter-energy-transformator requirement, you could simply adjust for a magnitude, and ballpark it back down by using less humanly empathised pokemon like voltorb. Add to that the assumed differences in power generation capabilities of the various kinds of pokemon and it might come back down to comparable numbers once taken both changes into account.

It might even be more feasible to use higher tier evolved pokemon since they may supply or generate a more steady flow of electricity while being less active, reducing the strain or or need to actually work low-tier pokemon for comparable results. If this were true, it would decrease the net strain on pokemon as a whole; lower numbers providing equal to or more power at less discomfort. At the moment I'm thinking of the needs for the infrastructure to accommodate pokemon generated power, and the feeling I have based on my experience doesn't look good. I am assuming the world hasn't the tech to capture lightning effectively? Because that is what I always assumed most of the electro attacks to be, something akin to directed lightning. This would still require enormous voltages to bridge the insulating air. Interestingly enough a solution arises addressing both the necessary voltages as well as aiming such attacks: ionisation. A tunnel of ionised air greatly reduces the required voltage; it can be induced by various means, opening up the aiming; it is a step ahead of the actual lightning, making it possible for pokemon to seem to avoid the lightning while they actually flee the ionisation trail. Though it doesn't need to be ionisation, actually, any means that reliably reduces the voltage needed to crack the insulation between pokemon and target is game.

To address rp20, the pokemon might be the necessary step needed to accomplish the future technologies. Coal power was the easy step for us to take from which we might feasibly gain the means to an effectively unlimited power source (at least for the foreseeable future). In a sense like an exothermic chemical reaction, with coal and generally current power generation providing the initiating energy and once we have bio-power and all the other renewable energy source the reaction is self-sustaining.

This is a good point, as there are definitely pokemon capable of calling actual lightning that would be a huge boon to energy production with the right technology to harness it. Most electric attacks are not nearly as powerful as a lightning bolt, but the more evolved pokemon could definitely use that as their major contribution to energy productin.

******** That harnessing would still require tremendous technological effort. In our world one of the impossibilities to do that is the unpredictability of lightning strikes, in power range, location and other parameters; those would obviously be less / not relevant for tamed pokemon. Of the top of my head I can only think of one method to effectively utilise lightning as a power source, and that is indirectly. If it were used electrolytically with specifically chosen reactants the products of such reactions might react back to the original reactants (releasing heat, for instance). You'd have a double loss to energy transfer in this case (lightning+reactants to products, products to reactants+energy), sure, but it might work, depending on tech level. A more physical approach might be charging the biggest capacitor ever and gradually using that charge. This is more of an engineering problem than a scientific one.

Be that as it may, I actually thought in a different vein. I remember in the anime at some point they stuck suction caps to Pikachu's cheeks and it might have powered something, but I'm not sure. This illustrates my idea quite well, though; you don't need to use lightning, unless the pokemon physique is bizarrely off-charts. It ought to suffice to drain the charge off the pokemon as it builds up. Like I said in my previous comment, the pokemon attacks seem to be mostly lightning, so constituted of high voltage with decent amperage. I deem it unlikely pokemon are capable of instantaneously generating a charge of that magnitude, or always keeping one handy. (This is of course an assumption I make based on my knowledge of biology, which makes it biased in regards to pokemon biology.) More likely than not they build up the charge as needed, the energy being supplied by their body by metabolites. As those get used up, the pokemon fatigue. If one can train the pokemon to build up a low charge, one their metabolism can keep maintaining even once we drain it, we're set. It might even be a relatively level of voltage thus produced, though it would still need to be smoothed for consumer use and such.

And since I am already on the topic, let me speculate further on the electro capabilities of pokemon.

Based on my assumption before (building up a charge as needed instead of maintaining one at the ready) I assume to be two-three kinds of organs in of note in electro-pokemon: a charger and a container and a preparer. The charger would, as the name implies, supply base voltage and amperage, or in other words, power the process actually giving the electro-pokemon their unique capabilities. It is connected to the next organ by something highly conductive. The container would be the biological equivalent of a hybrid capacitor / inductor. It would hold the charge supplied by the charger. It's make-up would require an insulating tissue on the outer layer that would protect the pokemon from its own charge. The preparer might be close to the container, but has to be at least connected to it in some facility. The reason for this is the function it fulfils: It reduces the (electrical) resistance to the target, or increases the conductivity, it's really all the same. It might be some kind of string that'd ionise the air around it (high-frequent voltage changes, for instance, or some highly ionising reaction with air, ...), to name one example. There are multiple ways to accomplish either, really, and for the most part I'm talking about function, not mechanism of those organs. Furthermore it can be taken for granted electro-pokemon have either a highly conductive exterior, making electrical attacks ineffective; a highly reduced amount of electrolytes or other physiological means to deal with electrical charges (my favourite); or something different.

Based on this speculation I might actually speculate further (this is bat country, I know): The capacity of charger and container might correlate with the natural environment and behaviour of the pokemon in question. Herd electro-pokemon like magnemite would be weaker, since they could voltron their defence capabilities (highly conductive skin?). Pokemon in (predatory) packs would be intermediate (using electro attacks for hunt, to defend hunting grounds against rivalling packs, ...). Pokemon living mostly solitary lives I would place highest in capability, simply due to the danger, using electro as defence and offence for that having to gap the biggest distance by their attacks.

Aaand reading on Bulbapedia on Jolteon just implied every cell taking part in the build-up, making at the very least the charger organ nothing more than intellectual navel-gazing. Oh well.

  More likely than not they build up the charge as needed, the energy being supplied by their body by metabolites. As those get used up, the pokemon fatigue. If one can train the pokemon to build up a low charge, one their metabolism can keep maintaining even once we drain it, we're set. It might even be a relatively level of voltage thus produced, though it would still need to be smoothed for consumer use and such.
#+end_quote

This makes good sense, and fits in game terms of pokemon running out of "PP" or energy for their attacks

They should also be able to safely store that charge between uses: otherwise the amount of time it would take for a pokemon to charge up a small thundershock might be prohibitive for combat purposes.

Hahaha. Don't worry, I've had those moments at least a dozen times already :P This is ridiculously tricky work, and there are still many pokemon I haven't figured out how to handle rationally (pokemon that come in bunches, for example, like exeggcute) without contradicting established rules. The creators of pokemon were notoriously thoughtless and haphazard in their handling of their world and how it works, and there aren't even any attempts at canon answers to most of these questions, let alone bad ones.

That said, your examination shouldn't be considered a waste, as I still find discussion on these issues interesting and informative :) My expertise is in psychology, and I'm simply an eager student trying to cobble together the most rational answers I can when it comes to biology, chemistry or physics, so it's much appreciated!

********** Well, I didn't address this since I forgot to, but the container I thought of being, well, multi-storage to a degree. Not many, but a few. It would be evolutionary consistent with the way our muscles work, and the fuel supplied to them (there are some, all running parallel with different efficiency peaks at different times). I thought they'd have about one or two instant charges in the container, by then the charger would start up supplying enough power and they could use charges with relative abundance, but after a minute you'd note their increasing breathing and the frequency and power level would decrease, but remain at a balance.

You'd simply want to have a power you're capable of and rely on to be on your beck and call instantly. Electro is a major investment, biologically speaking, so they'd have some measure for instant access, I guess.

I have an idea on the communal individuals, as self-contradictory those seem to be (two cases: Rat-king; true individual, apparent commune), and might be able to advise you with the consistency and science issue of the biological side, if such is wanted. Keep in mind though, that I don't have my degree in biology, yet.

*********** The issue as I see it is thus:

Exeggcute are distinct organisms. It's okay for them to be psychically linked, but there's mention in canon of them leaving and joining herds. So it's not like they're all biologically twins for the pokeball to be willing to count them as one. And it can't be a matter of mass, because six exeggcute weigh more than two pidgey. It makes absolutely no sense that pokeballs treat exeggcute as one being.

So far, I think I'll have to ignore the mention of them each being unique individuals for it to make any sense.

************ After having thought a bit on that, I can hazard a guess what /might/ work.

But first, why would you think the identical sextuplets not being reasonable? Say their biological make-up requires the offspring to be sextuplets. Only due to the herd issue? Those herds might simply be a stage in their social development leading to mating, their puberty, so to speak. Exeggcutes disbanding and joining different herds or groups would make sense from a genetical and biological standpoint.

The thought I originally had was more in line with social insects, though. In bees for instance workers are more related to other workers than compared to actual sisters and even less to drones. (That's due to a quirk in genetics) Based on that I speculated for the sextuplet group to be something akin to a swarm without a queen.

Looking at the canon (according to Bulbapedia) that doesn't seem to be the case, though. I'd have to buckle down something fierce to figure out a way to fuse canon and biology, really.

#+end_quote

That is a good idea, but genetics don't shift on an individual level, at least not on an appreciable level. And canon says the reproduction/evolution cycle is something like this: Exeggcutes gather to a congregation of six. For fun reasons, let's call that group an orgy. Expose the orgy to a leaf stone(*) and the orgy evolves to a singular exeggutor with multiple heads. I suppose at least one head is formed at this point. More heads grow gradually and once of sufficient size they drop, forming the single exeggcutes.

By that description the heads and exeggcutes can be likened to seeds, actually. If we spin that further, it would be feasible for the exeggcutes to be haploid seeds, whereas exeggutor have a hexaploid genome. Essentially the whole stick would be akin to plant species with an alternation of generations, in this case with exeggcutors being gametophytes (/n/ chromosomes) and exeggutors being sporophytes (/6n/ chromosomes).

(The telepathy issue though... I'd personally disregard that for the most part. Have the exeggcutes talk in poke-talk with each other, like the heads of the adults do. I'm not sure if I would allow for telepathy in Pokémon at all, but can see why you'd go that route. In that case I'd limit it to the associated types, though.)

If we go by my proposed explanation... the herds would be the natural state of exeggcutor behaviour, I think. Looking for mates, the chances are higher in such big groups to find the five fitting to the individual requirements compared to solitary movement. There's also the safety issue, of course. The orgy (i.e. 6 exeggcutor communion) would work as a, well, sub-herd, or trial relationship. A pre-stage, to work everything out biochemically. Add a leaf stone and the conception stage takes place, forming exeggutor. It also instantaneously forms new seeds (= heads), probably with other personalities than those forming the original orgy.

(*) Leaf and other evolutionary stones might work by supplying a mineral that activates very specific enzymes (or supplies building material for these) in the pokemon body, triggering the evolving step.

What makes a telepthic link more valuable than simply super-powerful observation and empathy is that a telepathic link could work over long distances, or when not able to visually observe the other person.

As much of a headache as it might be, psychic powers are kind of a big part of pokemon. Not just telepathy, but also things like telekinesis. It's one of the major types of pokemon in the world, and removing or re-interpreting it to not be what it is would be like EY turning leglimensy and occlumensy into just reading faces for HPMOR, or for Alicorn to remove Alice Cullen's ability to see the future and soften it to just "calculating probabilities."

For me the goal of rationalfic isn't to remove fantastic elements: it's to make them as realistic as possible while staying as true to the source material as possible. Obviously there's some subjective wiggle room there, but the golden standard is that the "magic" is understandable and consistent. What goes to the chopping block are those things that are completely irreconcilable with logic or good storytelling, and I don't think telepathy quite meets that mark.

Oh, that's not what I meant, not at all. Telepathy and other psychic phenomena being a thing are one of the building blocks of Pokémon and you don't remove stones in the foundation of your building if you don't want to risk it all coming loose and crashing down.

No, I (personally) would have limited psychic moves to pokemon of that type, though the move shadow claw being available to charmander certainly implies there not being any real objection. But in the case of exeggcutes, well... I don't see a reason for the orgy to be telepathically linked when their growing forms talk to each other (while still connected to exeggutor). I occamed their telepathy, so to speak.

Anyway, I wouldn't try to remove the mythical chakra from Naruto, for instance, since it is a much too ingrained concept to that universe and removal would screw up everything that world is about. Though playing and trying to come up with solutions or theoretical foundations to the actions shown would certainly be interesting -- the same you do with your story and Pokémon, really.

And to re-iterate from my previous comment: I really liked speculating on the biology, so of course you're free to use my speculation as you see fit. (And even if I didn't give my assent, it's all fan fiction, either way.)

******* Daystar has said that the technology in this Pokemon world is very advanced. They already have the ability to convert matter to energy and back. In that situation I have a easier time believing that they have virtually infinite energy from fusion than them still needing Pokemon to generate electricity.

I was just going by the rough math you did. The implication of it was that for 1 human in the Pokemon world, you need 6 electric Pokemon generating electricity (you also gotta feed these Pokemon). That is assuming normal energy usage. But as Daystar said, their energy needs are astronomically high compared to the real world. So the way Daystar has set up the world, you also need astronomically high numbers electric Pokemon doing the bidding of humans as well if the renewable tech is underdeveloped.

Edit: Still it is Daystar's creation so he can choose the level of technological advancement in his world. These problems are nothing that won't be solved by him tweaking the world a little.

******** I'm sorry I didn't see your comment earlier, rp20, or I would have addressed it then instead of at this later time.

I assumed the matter-energy-tech to work by somehow shortcutting the whole conversion thing, making that a special case of a more general principle the world didn't crack yet. Assume they, for some unfathomable reason, can convert matter to some kind of storable energy and back with relatively little energy cost for the conversion process. Thus they circumnavigate the full conversion problem, as well as the simply matter replicator issue. Instead of having the capability to convert a kilogram of stuff into megatons of TNT equivalent they can convert a kilogram of specific stuff to some kind of storable energy. Maybe that works by shunting the energy into small pocket universes, I don't know. I'm not a physicist, and albeit I have a curiosity in that field, the equations frankly scare me. My point being, they don't need to have the full conversion theory for a special case to be available for them. For an example look no further than newtonian dynamics being a special use case of relativity (I don't know if special or general) at very low fractions of the speed of light; at least I remember this being the case.

Personally I am loathe to hand-wave in my universes and the universes I work in, and often work out hypotheses that reduce the number of necessary hand-waves. That being the case I am aware of the inordinate amount of waving that already happened within Pokémon. I am not averse to seeing the games as a game mechanic adaptation of the "real" version, and the anime and manga as dramatisations of stories that happened in the same. If I can think of ways to make game mechanics and story depictions believable extrapolations of a "real" version, I do so. That's my philosophy in a nutshell.

We're capable of cloning things biologically, but the clones aren't very good. They have potentially reduced lifespans and all sorts of genetic problems because the epigenetics of the somatic cell you got the DNA from and tried to return to an zygote-like state are not the same as the epigenetics of a natural zygote. Also, biological cloning wouldn't be enough to clone Mewtwo. You'd need to create an artificial womb somehow like the researchers used in the movie and that is far beyond our current knowledge since recreating the exact conditions of a womb, down to extremely small, precise concentrations of hormones that change in response to the development of the embryo, the conditions of the host, etc. would be ridiculously complex. Plans for cloning woolly mammoths involved implanting the embryo into an elephant womb, but I don't know if the same would be possible for Mewtwo or other legendaries since most of the legendaries are physically incapable of reproduction, at least in the games.

However, I don't see the process being perfect, which may be why humans that experience it come out brain damaged.

So how would an instantaneously generated consciousness function? Would it have all the "false" memories it's been programmed to have? What about things like muscle memory?

This isn't to say that flash-cloning through the digitization process isn't possible, just that I see it being more complex than we might think, and am using that potential complexity to hold it off as something that isn't perfected yet. Maybe I'm wrong to do so, and it would actually be that easy :) But it would kind of break the pokemon world if cloning pokemon was that easy, and it's clearly not part of the game other than as a "glitch" (which is an interesting thing to explore later in the story).

We know they're not sourced at any one part of the brain, but that some parts of the brain are more important for retention/recall than others. We know that even amnesiacs make use of the striatum to form subconscious memories by rote and habit, so that they could drive to work but not remember any of the directions or the route there. But we can't create new memories, or even copy existing ones, artificially.

My point is there's a lot we don't know, and more specifically, a lot /I/ don't know about how brains work. To say that an instantaneously generated consciousness "should" retain all the memories seems to me a bit unfounded: we don't even retain all our memories of the past 24 hours on a day to day basis when we go to sleep at night. We have no experience with anything even remotely close to an instantaneously generated consciousness on which to base such a confidence assertion of how it "should" work.

And since from the perspective of the pokemon world, pokeball technology is still relatively new, I think it's reasonable to make the principles at work not fully understood, or have unexpected results. Which isn't to say they can't figure it out and make it work: just that they haven't yet.

************ I don't think it's unfounded. We don't know everything about the brain or about neurons and we don't know exactly how the pattern of neural connections gives rise to memories, experience, self-awareness, etc., but it is based on the physical configuration of the brain and if you're storing the configuration of every molecule in a pokemon's body as data when you convert them to data then you don't need to understand how the neurons work. You just need to somehow be able to scan the molecular arrangements and recreate them. Regarding going to sleep at night, those memories get erased because your brain edits its neural connections during sleep. If you're reproducing the exact configuration of molecules that the pokemon used to have then it should have the same memories. Unless, of course, the pokeball technology does something else when it's converting the pokemon into data?

It does: pokemon who are captured generally become less aggressive and more open to suggestion and conditioning.

I'm not asserting that there's something mystical and unknowable at the core of memories that makes the technology impossible: but the process of conversion and storage isn't a perfect stasis, and infusing matter with enough energy to recreate a pokemon's body based on the "blueprint" of the data the pokeball stores seems like it's dealing with such delicate things that it's not a perfected technology yet.

************ I wonder if you have considered the implications of Apricorns in your timeline of Pokéball technology. Kurt claims that Apricorn based pokéballs were the original way pokemon were caught, and that even though now he uses modern technology to enhance his Apricorn balls, he says that they were made for generations before the advanced Pokéballs were made.

Perhaps Apricorns are a parasitic species of Pokémon, that "capture" pokemon inside themselves to digest them. When hallowed out by craftsmen like Kurt, this capturing method remains, but the dead Apricorn can't eat the pokemon anymore, perfect storage.

Maybe the "capturing" process of the modern Pokéball isn't wholly technological, and some of the mysteries derive from whatever biological feature of Apricorns creates the conversion effect. The feature that Humans added to the process was the simulated consciousness inside the Pokéball, where as before it was just a stasis like experience.

************* I honestly don't know what to do with the apricot thing. It's just so random and silly a concept, and really doesn't fit into anything else we know about the world. I don't want to go down the road of inventing my own pokemon, so basically I just see it as a tradition thing. The first pokeballs were made of hollowed out apricorns because they have hard shells and natural sealing tops, and the technology was very crude: it wasn't able to change size obviously, it couldn't scan the pokemon beforehand, it couldn't transmit data or detect anything around it. It was basically a "genie bottle" that was used to store pokemon in a somewhat safe manner.

Making pokeball technology a mystical/biological aspect of apricorns is a possibility, but one I'm going to avoid for now, as the canon indicates that apricorns are no longer needed to make pokeballs at all.

** I was wondering if you would restrict Pokemon to four moves like in the games, or allow them to expand their movesets like in the anime?

You seem to have many of your ideas based off the games, but part of me feels like that would make the story less flexible

*** The way I see it the move restriction is entirely a game conceit, for tactical reasons more than anything, so I have no intention of restricting pokemon moves to four :) Charmander isn't going to forget how to scratch an opponent just because he learned how to use flamethrower.

That said, there might be a "core" set of moves that most trainers use for their pokemon as a matter of what's reinforced the most often. How wide a pool that is depends entirely on how smart the pokemon is (so how many commands they can remember) and how dedicated the trainer is (for how much effort they put into the training).

**** That helps a lot. What you said actually makes a lot more sense than my thought process, as a Pokemon wouldn't have partial amnesia from learning something knew.

The thought occurred to me when reading about the Shadow Claw TM and I was thinking if as the moves got more advanced, the weaker or simpler moves would just be forgotten. But thank you, and keep up the great work.

**** The way you have set up the Pokemon League, with the constant switching of pokemon, it wouldn't be unlikely that artificial limits on "number of different moves" used per battle are put in place, at least at the E4 or Gyms, as a way of driving creativity, and not allowing wealthy trainers to just load out on coverage TMs or Tutor moves (what i'm assuming you're basing the coding machines on) and basically being set for any battle.

This leads me to another question. Are there any regulatory pressures that define what a "Scratch" attack is compared to a "Slash". I bring this up because I remember earlier in the story Red was looking at his pokedex, and it mentioned specific techniques like Ember and Smokescreen for his Charmander. Say the 'typical' Slash attack, as approved for Competitive battle by the Pokemon League, has the pokemon swiping once with a single claw. If the trainer trains her pokemon to instead swipe simultaneously with both claws, is it still a Slash attack, or something else. Or is this all just similar to the type chart Meme.

***** The constant switching is just the evolution of the professional battling meta: the only regulations in the league so far are that you can't just keep pokemon in their balls (for obvious reasons) and the canon six pokemon at a time. Past that, the rules are mostly common sense (one pokemon at a time unless the format is different) or for safety (when a pokemon is considered "out"). Restricting trainers to a few moves would be hard to regulate, as trainers just use commands to give SPECIFIC attacks when they want to: pokemon are more than capable of using their own attacks if not given a specific command.

The way I see subtle distinctions like Scratch and Slash has to do with variations on the theme of "claw attack." Remember that the names of attacks are just commonly accepted verbal commands for similar moves: some people don't use verbal commands at all.

So the distinction between, say, Scratch or Slash, may have to do with the target. Scratch may be a more competitive-friendly move that targets the chest or arms, while Slash is a more lethal move that aims for more "critical" targets like the neck or eyes, the use of which would be frowned on in League sanctioned battles.

The discussions and worldbuilding to make the Pokemon world more rational are really nice to see, and my only complaint is having to wait a month for each chapter :) By the time you're done, a few years might have passed, and that's presuming you only do Kanto. That brings up a good point, actually. Will you do the other regions, with either the current MC's or the game MC's as protagonists?

Hopefully at some point I can speed up my writing table, but right now most of my time is taken up by work, a novel I'm hoping to get published soon, and a board game that I'm trying to get on kickstarter.

So far I've only got a rough idea of a story for Gold/Silver, using that game's MCs as the main focus, but as for Hoenn, the events of Ruby/Sapphire apparently occur at the same time as Red/Blue according to a number of sources online, so there may be some overlap there :)
