** Asking "Does anybody want to play the AI in the AI box scenario with me?" is like asking "Does anybody here want to have sex with me?" as a male on a dating website: you're on the wrong side of the supply-demand rate.

** It's not really a contest. And it doesn't work as a theoretical concept if you don't treat the scenario as if the AI promises are real.

It's useful as a way to show how a theoretical AI could find its way out of containment given any form of outside communication, but that's it.

I think you've missed the point of it.
