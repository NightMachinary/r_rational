** Damn. It's been too long since I last saw this fiction grace our subreddit. Better reread then.

**** Very unique story from multiple points of view where Batman decides to try and reform villains and generally be a better person instead of using his hate and pain from parents' deaths to fuel a pointless, self-harming cycle of vigilantism. That's what I got at least. Sadly I have to point out a few issues while I recommend it. For one, the immense spelling and grammar issues; if you have issues with unproofed fanfic you will have to slog through this. Prose is very pretentious and reads like English is a second-language and the author is trying to be an inverse Hemingway. Plot is all over the place with inconsistent timing and direction, with soap-opera levels of contrived, thoughtless, poorly justified drama and a /very/ poorly executed instances where a character witnessed/knows something and multiple paragraphs are dedicated to dragging out the suspense of “the thing is important but the internal monologue will not reveal the thing that is important, the oh-so-important thing that will not be described because the thing is important but should not be revealed right now and revealing the thing I am looking at right now would spoil the mystery that is an important plot point about the thing that shall not be named, which is important”. Furthermore in the poor plot handling, characters are described to think or feel one way, and then in a later scene completely ignore their previous state or character growth. The best example I can give without spoilers would be if Luke skywalker was a good guy and then randomly robbed a pedestrian for a phone and wallet and although the story brings it up multiple times to use as a contrived plot device that change in character morality is never justified nor does the robber!Luke ever continue to go down that path or a robbery ever happen again, adding to the sense of “this is really, really OOC”. Onomatopoeia and phrases that are commonly spelled one way, such as “yeah” are consistently spelled unusually, such as “ya” which keeps throwing me off. Continuing from the above on prose, it's hard to read the descriptions or action when every fourth sentence and second paragraph is far too long of a flowery, unproofread, hard-to-comprehend mess. The thing that kills the flowery language for me is that the language is (imo) executed poorly, so not only does it break up the flow, it doesn't add anything back in to compensate. Tl;Dr plot pacing could use some serious work, a few contrived situations with no explanation for why characters act massively OOC, prose is loose, fatty, and unfinished, and it does not appear to have ever received a final editing pass before a chapter went up.

***** Since I hate dumping on a story without offering to improve what I see as flaws: Dear author, If you're reading this, leave a comment here to get in touch and I will happily proofread the entire story and any future chapters you produce to fix spelling errors and odd phrasing. I love the premise and want to see this as a well-developed story!

****** Thanks a lot for the criticism! This kind of stuff you said is extremely useful to me as an aspiring writer, especially because of how specific your points are.

​

Before I posted this chapter, I reread the entire thing and noticed a lot of my errors and flaws. I've always been bad at editing, but I'm embarrassed at how sloppy much of this story is. Going forward, I want subsequent chapters to be far cleaner, so it would be amazingly helpful if I can send you the next chapter once I'm finished with it!

​

Also, the problems you mentioned concerning prose, flowery-language, or language usage in general, are all issues I've been realizing I need to improve but am, by and large, unsure how exactly to do that. Do you, or anyone else, have suggestions on how I can work on improving those issues?

** I read to about chapter 18 before and just re-read the whole thing. This latest chapter feels much higher quality than the earlier chapters. Author, I think you've improved over your hiatus! The writing was less flowery and the entire scene felt more lucid as the chapter ties in and builds on previously mentioned plot points instead of introducing new conflicts or time-skipping to the middle of an unrelated scene.
