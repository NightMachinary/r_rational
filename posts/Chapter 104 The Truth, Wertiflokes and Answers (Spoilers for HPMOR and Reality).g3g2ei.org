*** Re: Sai's Poison

In [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/the-waves-arisen-chapter-11/][the chapter following the Chunin Exam]], we see certain characters executed for crimes which they may or may not have committed:

#+begin_quote
  The knowledge and its implications came all at once, like a memory he'd briefly forgotten. One of the guards had delivered a meal of soup to Kakashi's cell, like any other, and within minutes he was dead. Guy too.
#+end_quote

Naruto (and therefore the reader) also sees that:

#+begin_quote
  The guards all had some weird seal technique imprinted on their tongues, too. He'd seen it on the Hokage's guards as well---some new ANBU policy, probably.
#+end_quote

A reader familiar with the Naruto-verse will understand these ANBU to be a part of ROOT, a military force directed exclusively by>! the new Hokage, Danzo!<.

Further along in the chapter, Naruto reasons out that it's pretty likely the mission that Team 7 had been sent on with Sai was meant end in their assassination. Naruto also sees that Sai has the same tongue tattoo as the guards who assassinated the aformentioned characters..

In [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/the-waves-arisen-chapter-12/][the next chapter]], after Naruto and Sasuke have their bout, we see that Sai is in charge of cooking the soup. Before anyone can eat any of it; Sai is assassinated by Sasuke, spilling the pot of soup in his death throes.

​

To me, it seems that all of these observations are explained by the hypothesis that all ROOT are trained in poisoning food as a means of assassination. And if that's true, then Team 7 just /barely/ escaped a death from a direction they didn't see coming from.

That being said, I'm realizing that can't explain /exactly/ what my brain is doing to go from Point A to Point B, and so I'm open to being wrong here

*** Re: Aliens

Okay, just to clarify: When I say 'something alien,' I don't mean to evoke images of little green men in space suits with plasma pistols. I just mean /something/ which did not originate from Earth.

​

The hypothesis comes from a conversation that Naruto has with the Slug Sage [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/the-waves-arisen-chapter-16/][later in the book]]. We know that this entity has strict rules as to /how/ exactly it can communicate, and we see that Naruto /eventually/ pieces together some semblance of meaning from the message, but if you're a reader and can scroll back up to experience the first part of the conversation again, this is what you read:

#+begin_quote
  Hello. Is anybody there? Anybody at all?

  The cause in which they died will continue.

  Do you read me, Hal? Hello, Hal, do you read me?

  One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

  What's this? What's this! ...Wow, what a totally amazing, excellent discovery---not!

  ...Stop that astronaut! Bring him to me...

  A witch! A witch! We have found a witch---may we burn her?

  I found him, I found that karate motherfucker!

  We have found a witch! That karate motherfucker...

  That karate... witch! That karate... witch!

  Here he is. Here's who? The man from the moon...

  Surprise motherfucker... I'm the king of the wooorld!

  ...Randy, is that water down there?”
#+end_quote

And then Naruto figures out what it's saying from there on.

I'm down to do a line by line analysis, but before I just do that and spoil the fun; I'm /very/ interested in whether you come to the same conclusion that I do, or if you read the text as saying something else that I've missed.

Because again, my brain isn't /quite/ giving me the answer of how I got from A to B, so if someone can show me where I've accidentally made a cognitive /uh-oh,/ I'd /greatly/ appreciate it :)

**** I like this theory. My own at the time was the Slug Sage was just greeting Naruto (Hello, Do you read me? You do? /sarcastic/ Great! get over here.) Then commenting on what Naruto was (A witch! A karate witch!). It seemed to me it was limited in its means of communication to recordings it was carrying so was forced to improvise.

I think there were some strong references to the anime From the New World, A post-apoc world set in an idyllic village where everyone has psychic powers. There are slug-like simple AI that hide out in the wilds and carry vast libraries of human knowledge which they try and share So I believe the Slug Sage may have been based on one of these.

Edit: Checking again, the brand of the slug-record found in the story was a "Panasonic Automotive Archive" which meshes with what we already know from the story: Panasonic is built to last.

DOUBLE Edit: I almost forgot to upvote and tell you I enjoyed this!

**** I mean the obvious interpretation is that the Slug is replaying movie and TV quotes, quite a few of which are space related.

It also seems to be trying to synthesize the quotes into something appropriate to the current discussion, but isn't able to do so perfectly.

My conclusion at the time was that the setting is after some sort of bio-punk apocalypse that happened in our future, and the slug is a semi-autonomous biological data store that had been set free somehow.

For reference:

1.  From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After][The Day After]], though I initially thought it was from Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb (it's not)
2.  From the Presidential Address after the Colombia disaster
3.  2001 A Space Odyssey
4.  First words said on the moon
5.  Wayne's World (specifically about the Flobee I think)
6.  You Only Live Twice
7.  Monty Python's Holy Grail
8.  This one I dunno - googling for it just brings up a Tenacious D song and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-_Ee6E3vDU][this weirdly cursed YouTube clip]]
9.  Seems synthesized from 7 & 8, and is particularly relevant to Naruto
10. Seems synthesized from the same sources as #9 but mostly I think the author just wanted to write "karate witch"
11. Also dunno, and The Man in the Moon makes this particularly hard to search for.
12. Synthesized, but from two previously unseen sources - Dexter and then Titanic. Seems to be attempting to indicate its unexpected importance.
13. Seems to be from an incredibly bad movie called [[https://uncyclopedia.ca/wiki/The_Beast_of_Yucca_Flats][The Beast of Yucca Flats]], but is also weirdly relevant to The Waves Arisen.

**** When I read that passage I assumed the Slug Sage was a weird AI, or upload of a person that was badly disoriented. It makes sense with the story being set in a future where the entire world has flooded (the map of the nation fits a elevation map for an area of high elevation) and stuff like Pansonic being lost artifacts that future AIs/upload might be left lying around.

****** I assumed chakra was some sort of interface with advanced (clarketech bs level advanced) technology. (Similar to Ra maybe?). That doesn't explain why the interface is the way it is (with hand signs and chakra coils and weird eyeball powers). Maybe a lot of the technology that interacted with the clarketech got destroyed and chakra coils and eyeball powers are a hacked together backup interface that managed to persist because it was biologically based and it because it was inheritable.

So post scarcity/post singularity civilization -> something disrupts it -> in the course of disrupting it someone spams a make water command to the clarketech maybe as a DDOS, maybe as a way of destroying the world, maybe on accident -> Survivors congregate on the only landmass above water. -> most of the survivors have lost access/user permissions to the clarketech and more moderate (non clarketech) technologies can't be maintained -> a small number (perhaps as few as one) of hobbyists/survivalist/hackers retain a biologically based and biologically inheritable interface with the clarketech -> descendants retain this interface and become ninja, ruling over the unempowered survivors and brutally fighting among themselves.

******* I once advanced the theory that the MCU Asgardians were descended from a pack of Luddites left over after a massive Singularity event scrambled their world into the Nine Realms. People without physical upgrades all died when the world became weird, leading to a world where even an average Asgardian peasant is casually superhuman. And that was just Asgard, in the other worlds, life took on much stranger forms to adapt to harsh conditions: frost giants to handle cold, dwarves to handle high gravity, etc.

The nobility is basically descended from the early survivors who established a stranglehold on all the clarketech they could find, and set themselves up as divine rulers. They view it as magical because they can't actually make any sense of how it all works, but the interfaces are intuitive enough that they can simplistically use them like 'superpowers' basically, and they sell that line to the public at large. Over a few generations, maybe they end up buying into the BS themselves. It may even be inadvertent if the clarketech mods start getting passed down genetically.

Cleverer people (e.g., Loki and Odin) can do something along the lines of memorizing incantations to program ambient clarketech that can warp reality, i.e., magic. They can't actually program, but they can memorize fragments of code or voice commands and make simple modifications, so basically they're script kiddies.

Since they don't really know what the actual cause-and-effect patterns are, they do it in a ritualistic fashion, rather like tech-priests in WH40K muttering prayers at technology while doing maintenance. The stylish posing and gestures are passed down by the original users, who were consciously trying to scam scared survivors into thinking they were doing magic. Over a few generations the scam was forgotten, and magic users just kept passing on the showmanship as part of it all.

The highest-level secrets are probably only passed from each king to his successor, which is why Odin can do things like put conditions on who can use Mjolnir, and so on.

  “In this line of work you learn that there are three types of redditors,” Mad-AI Moody said. ‘The type with one account, the type with two accounts, and the type with more accounts than you or I could ever a-count.'

I mean, I used to have like four or five (or six?) accounts and now I have three because I deleted all but two of them (there might be another one floating around out there lost to time) and then made a new one.

Anyways, I still think EY's secret fic is that Star Wars one with the holocron. A Voice Across the Void. Evidence: After two years of inactivity, Zoltan Berrigomo posted a short fic like a week after that thread that was discussing what the secret fic could be.

*** The waves arisen is very good.

It's very different from Naruto, the differences are felt imo more sharply than hpmor, because there is more of a genre "distance" between shonen (boys anime) and rational fiction, compared to YA fantasy and RTfic.

Full enjoyment of the fic would be had by naruto readers/watchers, I think knowing a bit about naruto would go a long way, but it might be worth a try anyways. It pushes different ideas and values than hpmor (while still rational), and seems to me to be somewhat educational in a similar way, if not quite as pedagogical as hpmor.

** Okay but like...not sure about Wertifloke, but EY probably has at least one other account where he shitposts stories and writing advice he doesn't want associated with him.

Three reasons:

1) Writing HPMOR is fun and he likes it.

2) He wants to write HPMOR without people bugging him about "where's the epilogue?" and "Is this canon?"

3) He likes to see who likes his writing when not associated with his name, plus sometimes he wants to write literary criticism about his own work but not have anybody think he's a narcissist.

All this to say I think PM_Me_Rational_Fics is EY and maybe Timecubefanfiction.
