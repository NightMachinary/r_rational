** Cat doing a Looney Tunes skit inside a burning library during a whodunnit is not what I could imagine happening back when she was fighting Squire Claimants.

*** I think this whole story has been pretty different than what I thought it was be. When I started I binged it until I caught up near the end of the last book, it always had turning points that made me feel like I wasn't reading the same book anymore (in a good way)

*** Wasn't this the miscellaneous section of the library?

**** Yes, with subsections named things such as 'fluorescent, neither flora nor fauna', and 'travel journal, but metaphorical'. Just the /subsection names/ get my palms and brain itching to pick up one of these books and find out what the inside is like, and there are /stacks/ of these! Stacks, and way more stacks beside of subsections upon subsections that we haven't even heard the fascinating names of! All information judged worthy of storing in the Arsenal, even if just-in-case, collected from all sorts of places! This is, once again, information that there may be /no other copy of in existence at the moment!/ This is not burning silver, because silver is *fungible!* Burn some silver, you can do something of value for a while and get someone to give you some more silver again--the world has plenty of silver! Collect irreplaceable books and then *burn* them and /no one can ever read them!/

Hmm, maybe I can be comfortably horrified by the silver comparison, in that I completely sympathise with the context that forced this to be near-necessary (unless there were some other thing she could have done instead of casually doing this...), but she seems to be showing disregard for why what she's doing (/the sacrifice that's being made) is a terrible thing--like someone forced by circumstance to murder their own several-years-old child to stop a secret's exposure, then commenting on what a shame it was because of the price of the bloodstain-ruined shirt.

***** Silver is a limited resource. When a mine is exhausted, that's it for that place. Books just take someone writing them, and paper to write on. Now, any one given book could be irreplaceable, but given providence being a thing, I'm sure anything actually important to fighting the Dead King would be saved

*** Yeah. I did lose a bit of respect for Cat for going through with that.

**** I don't, she's dealing with consequences on a whole other scale of magnitude. What price is a wing of a library for a better chance at beating whatever scheme the bard has going
