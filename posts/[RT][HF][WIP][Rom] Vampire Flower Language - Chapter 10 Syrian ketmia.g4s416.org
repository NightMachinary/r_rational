** I'm not certain but I think the thumbnail image is usually the largest image in the page. If they are the same size then reddit grabs the last one.

So if you want the flower image to be the thumbnail maybe try re uploading a bigger one?

** What to say about this one?

It's not the "nasturtium" I promised last month in case anyone was keeping track, because it turns out that the chapter was like twice to three times the length of a normal chapter so I found a break point and you now have two chapters! Makes my beeminder goal happy :)

The Syrian ketmia (damn, also called the Syrian Mallow) means "persuasion", which is what the theme of this chapter is, more or less.

This is hopefully where we get some rational content, with Red being rightfully worried about whether he is in a state of mind control. Of course, he in the end doesn't ask William to prove anything, but it was really going to break the flow, so if people really want Red to do some experiments we can put it in the interlude

I love Cassius, and I think he makes for a great breath of fresh air in the middle of the chapter. What do you think his game is?

If anyone has requests for the next interlude, we're happy to entertain them: post here or on AO3.

EDIT: oh dang instead of the flower picture Reddit has made a church picture my thumbnail!!! Do they not appreciate the ART of choosing flower names from a vintage dictionary and then locating creative commons images on flickr!??!?! DO THEY NOT?

*** It chooses the largest image on the page in terms of dimensions, so just hard scale every image other than the flower down.

**** Or, have you considered.... making the section divider images GIGANTIC, to make the thumbnail extra annoying?

***** use really long thin ones so the thumbnail is two large black rectangles separated by a small strip of unidentifiable picture

****** i'm not that evil!!!

speaking of not being evil, i'm guessing you have no opinion about the subject of the next interlude? if you do please let me know because at the moment it is going to be a light-hearted romp of William yeeting axes about while Red giddily gives him more and more ridiculous challenges. (Do you think I could pull off using the word 'yeet' in the Very Formal Serious Writing Tone?)

******* I have no strong feelings on the contents of your interlude but am strongly in the anti-yeet camp.

Still waiting on an invite to your fan discord that you should make.

******** We both /have/ a discord account if you really want to be in basically a group chat with us. Which I guess I can link to on the next chapter? How self-involved is making a discord group in your honour?

(Speaking of, unfortunately we're going to be writing the yeeterlude but I will not include the word yeet out of respect for you.)

********* I'm your biggest fan. The discord group would be in your honour, technically. The plus sign in the circle on the left hand side of discord creates a server, it takes approximately 10 seconds.

(or any other secret readers, I guess. I'll post it when I post the next interlude)
