Can we have a compiled list of the fictions that obviously, definitely meet the standard for being considered rational/rationalist? And maybe put it in a sidebar, or in a wiki (and then sidebar-link to the wiki)?

Here are some old masters' non-fanfictions that should surely be on the list:

- [[http://m.friendfeed-media.com/3570919004ec89f17b6978a4bf1d5a8d46e2d804][The World of Null-A]]
- [[http://www.e-reading.co.uk/bookreader.php/133624/The_Players_of_Null-A.pdf][The Players of Null-A]]

**** Copyright as currently implemented is wrong, but not because anyone says so; because it objectively impairs the quality of a society. I imagine this is what Eliezer meant, though perhaps his implication was less clear than it could have been. Still, true philosophers take all statements in bona fide, meaning that they do not dispute statements, simply attempt to clarify them--for no one can believe an untruth, though they may occasionally undergo confusion..

***** Copyright was created as an incentive for authors to create works without fear of theft and no profit. Why write Harry Potter if the first person to read it can make their own copies and sell them just a rightfully?

However, maintaining that copyright years past the creators death is /completely unjustifiable/. Idk about you, but my utility function (in regards to money) doesn't really go past my death, seeing as I wont be around to get paid. The Copyright is now just lining the pockets of whomever's got their hands on it, and happens to be /disincentivizing/ derivative creative works while no longer rewarding the creation of original works! I've yet to hear a single good argument for why copyright should last as long as it currently does.

****** The best I can come up with is that extending copyright past the author's death removes the incentive of assassinating someone to make money off his work. Which would probably make more sense with patents that you can use to make commercial products than books that you couldn't make that much money off of, especially if everyone else could sell and make copies too.

If a ten year reduction on copyright would have meant Peter Pan was never written, then it'd be tough to say. How much do we value that book?

********* Actually, most of the time laws only get changed after or because someone has broken them.

This is not just the standard civil disobedience argument, that one is common and I have no particular skill which would allow me to speak accurately about it.

The two main ways laws do change however are via legislative rewriting or judicial review. Judicial review can cause laws invalidated for constitutional reasons to be destroyed, changing the current state of the law itself. What most people do not think about however is that the court is /a purely reactionary institution./

The court cannot simply say "Hey, we were reading that law you passed and it's no good", they must wait until a case comes to bar that touches directly on the law itself. Not only that, but they must wait until an advocate for one side in that case makes an argument that the law should be set aside for one reason or another. That advocate would only be doing so if it benefited the one they represented for it to be so. That likely means that person has broken that law. That is how it happens.

The other time the law will be changed is when the legislature changes it. Legislatures are inherently focused entirely around electable platforms. Elections are what drives policy, you put policy into place so you will win support in the next election. Laws which are not important to your policy or to public opinion tend to not be modified, even if legally they cause enormous issues - in Canada, our Criminal Code both has 30 sections or so that have been eliminated but still exist in the printed version, because Parliament hasn't updated it since 1985, and has no section with clear definitions of all included terms which causes a hell of a lot of problems.

As such, we know that issues which /are/ in the public eye, and which /are/ policies which can effect an election, tend to get changed. I can list off the top of my head a dozen or more instances of controversial court rulings on a case, usually criminal, which prompted legislative reform of the laws governing that case. This would never have happened if that crime had not happened, been prosecuted, and then created a media frenzy, which led to political fallout. And again at the base of this, you have a person who committed a crime - breaking the law.

It is in fact very, very rare for a law to get changed /without/ a direct correlation to a time it had been broken. It's one of those ever so wise sounding statements spoken by those who think they know how something occurs, but doesn't understand the actual numbers. Something that sounds good, a meme that is oft repeated, but something that has no basis in actual fact.

Of course, by the same logic, breaking a law is much less likely to lead to that law being changed than it is to you being punished for the transgression. That doesn't change the fact that change only tends to happen at some point after a breach, even it it is less that 0.1% of cases.

As most things in life, it ends up being a lot more complicated than just 'Don't do /x/'.

Do you have a source for this claim? (Not the "after" claim, of course people break laws.)

While I agree, for the most part, with the rest of your post, I don't see how any of that changes my point. (That "breaking the law is no way to change the law. Whether copyright law is justified or not, breaking it only hinders your cause.") A D-list pseudointellectual like Yudkowsky breaking copyright law, even if his posse helps out, won't change shit.

*********** In the US, the number of laws overturned or changed by the Supreme Court is a matter of public record.

Unconstitutional and Preempted Laws 1789-2002 According to the GPO (Government Printing Office Database):

1789-2002 Acts of Congress Held as Unconstitutional..............................158

1789-2002 State Statutes held unconstitutional......................................935

1789-2002 City Ordinances held unconstitutional....................................222

1789-2002 State and City laws preempted by Federal laws.......................224

Total State, Local and Federal Laws Declared Unconstitutional................1,315

Total State and Local Law Preempted by Federal Laws..............................224

Total Laws Overturned, all governments..............................................1,539

This of course doesn't cover all changes to law which come as a result of previous cases however. Part of my post above is about how public opinion and reactionary responses to past cases (even those which failed to change laws) is one of the primary drivers in the alteration of laws. I don't have on hand statistics on the ratios or similar on that, and as it was something I spent 8 months on in a single class in law school, accurate evidence is likely not something that can be summarized quickly in a reddit post.

As an aside, I made no claims on the effectiveness of Yudkowsky breaking laws in this case, or copyright in general, simply a general point on law itself.

** If this community continues and grows, and everyone upvotes fictions that are 'rationalist' and downvotes those that are not 'rationalist', then sorting the subreddit by top - all time would serve much the same purpose. That said, a lot of works upvoted on this subreddit don't really meet most definitions of rationalist I use, sadly, so some form of curated index would be very appreciated.

I would be hugely in favor of more people posting actual books and novels rather than just web-based fiction.

Thanks for the recs, by the way - I hadn't heard of Marc Stiegler before now, and I will have to find and try his stuff.
