Hi! I am a web developer, and I want to build a perfect platform for writers, which they could use to post their fiction/fanfiction, discuss writing, and later - publish books.

It would be ideal if I could make it useful for authors on this subreddit, because this is the kind of community I want to develop there.

So I want to ask you some questions:

- What would you like to see on such a website?

- What features do you miss on fanfiction.net?

- What do you think a perfect platform for that would look like?

- What else(besides community and publishing your stories) would you like to see there? Like competitions? Collaborative writing? Writing Prompts? Book club? Anything else?

If you have any other ideas on the subject - please share them! I want to build the perfect place for writers to hang out, practice writing, share their fiction/fanfics, and find an audince.

  What features do you miss on fanfiction.net?
#+end_quote

My problems with ff.net:

- Inability to copy+paste text
- Inability to do much in the way of formatting
- Publishing is a multi-stage process from Doc Manager to publication - should just be a single screen
- Docs go "out of date", which makes editing or reworking old stuff a pain
- Terrible review system
- Inability to link to a review
- Inability to add a link within a story
- Clunky method of doing "meta" stuff like author's notes, FAQ, etc.
- Terrible "discovery" system

Pretty much all those complaints apply to FictionPress as well.

I really like how Google Docs allows comments directly on the page, but that's definitely a technical challenge (and should probably start disabled if you want to share works). Having people be able to point to a line and say "this would make it better" is a godsend.

EDIT: Also, what would a new and improved comment/review system look like? I don't have any complaints with Ao3, so I'm wondering what I may be overlooking.

****** Sorting by kudos sorts by popularity, which is not the same thing as quality. It's still quite useful, but I'll give Kudos to anything I "enjoyed", even if I wouldn't give it "5 stars". [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/37bzof/what_features_should_a_perfect_platform_for/crn8fdf][More on this, posted elsewhere in this thread]]

I feel like Reviews, Comments, and Feedback To The Author are three fundamentally different things. AO3 has comments, and its format works very well for both comments and author feedback, and the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606][occasional]] [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/394694][roleplay]]. FFN's reviews are really just for author feedback.

However, I often want to leave an /actual review/, like: "Cool ideas, horrible grammar, follows canon religiously which I hate but might be your thing, overall 3/5 stars". I also want to read such reviews. Amazon's review system would work really well for this sort of thing. If you tried that on FFN, you'd only make the author cry, and your review would quickly get buried under 25 reviews for chapter 31 saying "ha ha yay update".

I'm in the Homestuck and Naruto fandoms, mainly. I'd love to read Avengers fics if there were better ways to sift out the slash. I mostly try to read action/comedy, but AO3 is literally 90% slash - I have no problem, but it's not my thing.

Complaints with AO3: it's easier to search by tag, but harder to search by genre. Authors can throw as many genre tags as they want, which has pros and cons, and sometimes you get competing tags (for example, "MS Paint Adventures" and "Homestuck", before the system started knowing they really mean the same thing 95% of the time)

My other complaint with AO3: you can't run exclusions for pairing types. You can search "Gen", but that will show you fics that are tagged "Gen", PLUS fics tagged "Gen and M/F and Multi" for example. I'm usually trying to filter /out/ pairings, not filter /in/.

That seems to be more a problem of the culture. Even a New&Improved site might get that issue (although having an explicit star rating as, say, Rational Reads has, might help).

I wouldn't really call it a "problem with the culture" - I think that FFN's review system is optimized really well for author feedback on each chapter - and so that's what it's used for. When I write a "review", I expect it will, at best, be seen by maybe two prospective readers before it's buried. As a result, I use it as a way to give feedback to the author, in such a manner that the author can but does not feel obligated to respond. Which is how 99% of people use it - if you look at the FFN reviews, they're all addressing the author, not prospective readers.

When I view reviews on Amazon, I see a summary of star ratings, I see the distribution (to see if the 3.7 star rating is because it's polarizing or because it's just plain mediocre), and it includes a view to see the "Most helpful positive reviews" and "most helpful critical reviews". As a result, I can usually find a summary written by some community member that accurately outlines its good and bad points.

I like how RationalReads allows for star ratings, but the "most helpful review" feature is what I truly find valuable.

*** +1 to all this, and to add a bit more detail to my biggest grievance, the terrible review system:

- Reviews can't be responded to if written by guest accounts.

- Reviews are responded to as private messages in interface

- Responses to reviews can't be seen by others.

Would love to see a publishing platform that allowed for more dynamic and organized author-audience interaction.

I would say that reviews can't be responded to, period. As you say, the 'response' consists of sending a PM, which is not the same thing as responding in public to a statement made in public.

I had one reviewer who read through the first ~20 or so chapters of 2YE (all that was up at the time), leaving profane and insulting reviews on every single one. (Oddly, most of those reviews ended with something like "really enjoying it!") The problem was that most of what he was calling out related to things that he had misunderstood, misread, or not read at all. I would very much have liked to leave responses saying "thank you for the input, please try not to be so profane and personal, and you actually missed a bit here" so that people reading the reviews would get both sides.

**** Given the maturity level displayed by the internet at large, I sort of wonder whether author-audience interactions would go so well. Even with the current system as it is, I've seen authors calling out reviewers in the header of a chapter as "haters". Hell, this has happened in the real world with best-selling authors, and the big difference is that there's almost never someone holding a (mostly) anonymous fanfic author back and telling them that it's not a good idea to start a flame war about how awesome your work of fiction is.

I mean, I'm a pretty level-headed guy, but when I get a review that says something like, "I wish I could teleport the author to me so I could punch him in the face" I do feel the urge to say something in response.

On the other hand, I love schadenfreude.

The reason that disabling JavaScript allows you to copy is because that inline style is added via Javascript that checks for a cookie. It's in combo.js:

- Publishing process will be as simple as writing or copy pasting markdown. In the future I am planning to add github integration.
- Reviews and discovery system will be similar to reddit.
- I'm still thinking about organizing 'meta' stuff, I'll make sure to make it as good as possible.

I personally wouldn't use github for writing, because there's not usually much cause for me to fork/merge/revert, and I think github is overcomplicating things if you just have one single file (or even set of files) that would be represented in source control as a single unbroken chain.

***** Agree with [[/u/alexanderwales]] --- github is just not made for this. Using /git/ as a backend would be good, being able to /clone/ or /export/ (to Github, Bitbucket, whatever) the underlying repo would be great, but using Github directly is going to add more friction than benefits.

Plus, how would you handle the private side of things? An author writes drafts and shares them with select betas, proofreaders, etc, /before/ publishing... having it all on a public Github repo would make it all public, that's a no-go. Having some of it in a private repo and some of it in a public repo would cost a lot, and splitting up the repos is going to be clunky.

If you just use git as a backend instead, there's also various features of /git/ that are not used in GitHub that could be useful, such as the "Signed-off-by" lines, and the difference between "author" and "commiter". Not sure about the exact semantics you could apply there, but for example for corrections, you could have a random community member "author" a correction, then a beta or more reputed proof-reader "signs off" on the correction, and finally the author "commits" the change.

**** I always thought that reviews of writing it simply makes so much sense for them to be able to blown up to take the writing.

Especially since you can get some serious in depth stuff. It doesn't have to be but it would be cool.

A delimitation of reviews and comments is something that I feel is very important that FF.net (along with many other things) lacks.

Also this is something that might be too wild but I really think some sort of ability to add a soundtrack to the story by the author would be fantastic. Obviously this can have issues but if when I start reading the action sequence (or more likely when I scroll to a certain place or press a certain button) for some specifically chosen music to set the atmosphere it would be simply amazing.

I know on FF.net many people will often suggest a song for you to go open which works as a stopgap. There was one story I read which was set in a Western theme where the music seriously added to the story, and another that was about car racing or something that had fantastic metal.

** Look at Archive Of Our Own ([[http://www.archiveofourown.org][www.archiveofourown.org]]) for a good example. It has a much, much easier interface than fanfiction.net, its tagging system is rich and has a lot of advantages, it has nice features like letting you group stories into collections, you can reply to reader comments with proper discussion threads, etc.

Some features I'd like: * For readers: a feature to auto-recommend stories based on the currently viewed story or your pattern of likes, sort of like Amazon does. ("people who liked this story also like", "people who liked works you like also liked this new story", etc.) * For authors: a way to upload chapters and have them published automatically at preset dates/times. Good for serial fiction. AO3 lets you upload chapters in advance, but you have to manually press a button when you want to publish them (and manually edit the publish date for it to be the pub date rather than the upload date).

** I like the design of fimfiction.net and think it would be a far better baseline to strive for than fanfiction.net's. I recommend checking it out. Really wish it contained more than just pony stuff. Some features:

- great search function
- each fic can be downloaded in a selection of formats
- bookmarks can be set within chapters of each fic, which is really neat if you have to stop in the middle of a huge chapter.
- If you view a story, on the side are a lot of recommendations of stories that are similar, by the same author or also read by others who read this one
- You get feeds from authors you follow, which you can divide into getting just stories, or blog posts etc.
- Probably a few more nifty things I don't think of at the moment
- I'm pretty sure I read a story where part of it was written in crayon by Pinkie Pie, but that might have been a dream.

Here's a story you can check it out with. On the bottom right you will notice that it is featured in the lesswrong group.

** *As an author:*

When uploading a story, something to automatically split out a large document into chapters would be awesome. I'd rather upload one document than manually split out each chapter. That requires people to format their documents properly, though.

Make the "upload a new version of a chapter / story" workflow as blindingly obvious and simple as possible.

Google Docs integration would be nice. If I could share a story with your service and have it be automatically ingested, that would be pretty cool. I'd want to manually control when it updated, of course. In practice, this isn't much different from just uploading files, but it suggests a particular technology that's good for beta readers. Low priority.

(Unless you make something as good as Google Docs, I don't want to edit my work in your interface.)

A preview system for a new story or new chapter. I've had stories that I had to republish four times to get it right. Not terribly professional. If I could preview them instead, that would be a lot nicer for me.

Horizontal rules. I understand that LibreOffice doesn't do real horizontal rules; it just does paragraphs with a "horizontal rule" style. Whatever you can do.

*As a reader:*

RSS feeds for each story and author. (I'm such a big fan of RSS that I made my own RSS reader.)

Ability to download epubs. I had to write my own script to do this eventually (which, on a good day, works on portkey.org, fanfiction.net, and spacebattles forums).

Failing that, semantic CSS classes. I don't want to find the first H1 tag, grab the story name from that, look for the third <select>, get the chapter list from that, etc. I want to be able to search for "div.story" and "h1.title" and "select.chapter" or something simple like that. Also, predictable (or at least discoverable) URLs for each chapter in a story. No Javascript to look up the document ID of chapter N+1.

A dedicated space for author's notes. I want to be able to include them or exclude them from epub generation, or at least have them in a standardized format.

Something better than "sort by number of reviews". If I review a story, it might be to give feedback to the author about a chapter. It might be because the story is terrible and I want to warn people away. ffnet has the "favorite" button to handle this, but I think it would be more effective if it had a "review and favorite" option in addition.

Roll up a succession of chapter reviews by one person into one effective post. I go to fanfiction.net or portkey.org reviews, and I see one person with fifty one-line reviews, one for each chapter. It's a nuisance. Alternatively, only show the reviews for one chapter at a time, but that would be kind of annoying too. Or separate chapter reviews from story reviews, but that's troublesome too.

****** Seeing a negative number is discouraging.

If I were doing it, my first hack would have a number of points for each story. An upvote gets you points. A person reading a chapter gets you points. A downvote subtracts points from your future gains, not from your current total. So no story ever sees its point total go down, ever.

You never see the number of points you have; you just see an indicator bar indicating your story's percentile compared with others -- either on the site or in that fandom.

Maybe I'm putting too much emphasis on not discouraging authors. I dunno. Maybe it would be enough to just give X points for each upvote and -Y for each downvote, where Y < X. Maybe raw vote counts would be good. Or just accepting upvotes and displaying upvotes divided by the number of readers.

** *As a reader*

- Having a digest sent every week (with the day selectable, for me that would be friday or saturday) of all updates that occurred (story updates, new stories in collections I follow, new stories by authors I follow, etc) in that past week.
- FF.net theming controls are fine, could afford to be more obvious and have more / better fonts.
- A clean reading UI.
- A lot of stories have very long chapters, which is great, but I'd love to be able to keep my place /within/ a chapter (page scroll) when switching computers/devices.
- A way to hide the authors' notes, and also a way to read only the authors' notes.
- Good search within the entire site, with a rich syntax and some kind of "relevancy index" and/or "quality index" (think Github/Google/ElasticSearch).
- Full text search within a story. This is something I'm really missing right now, and relying on google/extraction tools for.
- Related to the above, full text search with the story /except the stuff I haven't already read/.
- Blacklisting of entire categories, for example harry-ron romance, or Fate/Stay fanfic for the spoilers...
- /Reader tags./ So instead of the author having full control over (forgetting to) tag their story, delegate a bit of that to the community. Mark author tags as special/immutable, but allow the readers to add stuff. There would need to be some kind of restriction or control on this, so maybe...
- Reputation a la Stack Overflow. Certainly not for ranking authors (let reviews/comments/favs/stats/etc do that) but for allowing good readers/reviewers/community members to have access to some tag editing and moderation tools.

*As a writer*

- Simple formatting, but more than FF.net and also more than Medium. I don't want the full range of formatting options, but bold, italic, underline, alignment, section separators, whitespace control (for poetry, mostly) as a minimum.
- *Stable* formatting. FF.net had the reputation of changing formatting rules without notice at some point, making many stories' formatting implode. Medium mangles some formatting, most often I observe it has trouble with whitespace.
- If writing my stories directly on the site, I like to have a "distraction-free" environment, maybe behind a button/setting, and optionally a "Hemingway" mode that doesn't allow editing until you finish writing a draft.
- Also related to writing directly on the site, a good autosave that never lets me lose anything. See Medium, for example: if my computer is hit by lightning, I expect to at most loose a paragraph.
- Still related to that, an offline mode, for obvious reasons.
- As expressed by others, an easy way to add metadata (author notes) to a story, and differentiate between displaying some "before chapter" and "after chapter" if required.
- Links within metadata.
- Syndication to other sites, as audiences won't move so easily... so being able to publish once on the service, and have it syndicated to FF.net/AO3/Fictionaut (for short pieces)/etc.
- Easy licensing options (Creative Commons, Public Domain, All Right Reserved, others?)
- Import from other sites.
- Ability to host and sell access to /paid/ stories.
- A queue to post things at certain times without manual intervention.

*Generally*

- Competent moderators.
- Maybe separate comment and review systems? I'd love a site where there is a culture of critical and/or constructive /reviews/, but also "I like it"-style /comments/ and questions.
- QA sections for each story, at the author's opt-in, to provide an out-of-story but well-organised way to answer reader questions.
- QA events, AMA-style but maybe more organised, with a group of authors, or authors in a genre, or inversely, with select readers/reviewers/etc.
- Collaborative writing is Hard™ but if someone can figure out a good UX for it, that would be neat.
- Open source.
- Ability to donate to authors, possibly through a partnership or integration with Patreon or Gratipay.

With the TPP coming up and copyright generally being an enormous pain, I'd love to see some clarity around sharing rules. Specifically, instead of the usual garbage terms of service - just make works pick a creative commons license.

CC-BY-NC-ND is actually a better deal than most hosts offer, to start with! Others encourage more community interaction, promote openness, and there's the advantage that unlike normal terms people actually understand what these options mean.

But probably don't try to reinvent yet another blogging platform. Simple "profile posts" as a lightweight fallback for those who don't want or need anything else, maybe. But what could be interesting is an integration with other blogging platforms, so people who already have wordpress/ghost/etc blogs can show their posts on their profiles or something.

** As far as I'm concerned what will make or break your platform is tagging and searching. AO3 is the best I'm aware of on this front but even they're not quite where I'd like them to be. As far as fanfiction goes you'll want to have dedicated tagging categories for:

- Fandoms
- Major Characters (AO3 only has a general character category but this runs into problems since people tend to tag every character that is even mentioned. If I search for Hermione Granger I want stories /focused/ on Hermione. Seperating major and minor characters avoids this)
- Minor Characters
- Relationships (Serious friendships, romantic relationships, technical Homestuck shipping, etc)
- You could consider having categories for genres (drama, romcom, horror, etc) and classifications (oneshot, gen, slash, crack, etc)
- A rating system
- A specifier for the genders in the romantic focus (straight, girl/girl, boy/boy, other, poly, etc)
- A set of standard warnings for things that seriously bother people (NonCon, Character Death, Violence, etc)
- Additional tags to their heart's desire

For original fiction not all of the above will be useful but you'll definitely want a dedicated genre tagging section. As far as searching is concerned you'll want two methods:

- A user friendly setup like AO3's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/search][search page]] that allows you to easily specify several metrics and search for them
- A option for advanced users that uses logical notation, parentheses for grouping, and wildcards to allow you to fully specify what you're looking for. For example I want to be able to search =(Fandoms:(Homestuck && ~(Puella Magi Madoka Magica)) || Major Characters:(Aranea Serket && Meenah Peixes)) && Rating:(>=Teen && <=Explicit)= Which should return works with ratings between Teen and Explicit inclusive that either are in the Homestuck fandom but not the Puella Magi Madoka Magica one or feature Aranea Serket and Meenah Peixes as major characters
