** Are you only targeting existing readers with these announcements? 'ATSRTW' does not at all provoke curiosity (this is a generic problem that all acronym-only titles have IMO).

I'd suggest 'ATSRTWhirlwind', 'Reap the Whirlwind', or even just 'Whirlwind' as more interesting ways of writing the title.

**** Some [[/r/rational]] submission titles are definitely guilty of that.. but 'Reap the Whirlwind: Chapter 184' would only be of moderate length IMO.
