As a reminder, this is a challenge for which magic system writeups /are/ accepted, so long as they're written in an entertaining way.


** As far as munchkinning systems go, stuff such as HP and Discworld I'd say are examples of ones you shouldn't attempt to munchkin. Both systems with a lot of hidden stuff and the potential to screw things up horribly. I mean, there's the potential to do nearly everything, and also far more ways to screw up. HP in particular, with a system that makes everything vary on emotion and regularly follows fairy tale logic, what you do may work, but stick to trying to come up with creative uses for what is already there, and before you do your fantastic new use nobody ever did before ask yourself why nobody did it before, it's most likely that stupidity is not the answer.

On an unrelated note, the ending date on the challenge is wrong, it says the challenge ends on the 16th, I presume timezones account for the difference but it is already evening on the 17th here.

As far as this challenge goes, may give it a shot, always liked worldbuilding. Although the start is tricky, so according to a [[http://www.desiquintans.com/articles/noungenerator.php][random noun generator]] I should try and make a magic system involving creme brulee and cancer. Well, this might be possible, already got a couple of ideas. Actually scratch that, I looked away for five minutes and I've already started, lets see if I do enough before running out of steam to matter.

** Welp, just wrote and submitted my story. My main fears are twofold - first, that I fell into the illusion of transparency and it's not clear what my magic system actually is; second, that my magic system isn't central enough to my story, calling into question whether it fits the prompt well. Still happy with it on some level, and curious to see what others think of it. The main kernel that drove me to actually write it was that I fell in love with the idea of writing a portal fantasy story in a pseudo-Biblical style.

The visual concept behind it, which I've loved for ages even though it makes no real sense given how actual mirrors in reality work, is that of a person with no reflection, like a vampire, being able to step into a mirror to effectively become invisible. So, in this fantasy world, mirrors are basically portals to a world that perfectly matches up with the unmirrored world, except for humans and other self-aware creatures (creatures able to pass... the mirror test :P), which only "exist" on one side of the mirrored world/unmirrored world divide. So, for example, a nude mirrored assassin could sneak into your home and try to kill you, and he'd essentially be invisible to you unless you spotted him in a mirror of your own. You'd also be invisible to him, but unless you were trying to be stealthy, he'd almost certainly be able to track you - by watching your clothes float around, if nothing else - and he'd catch you off-guard and stab you with a knife.

*** I didn't and still don't understand how mirrored people interact with the world. For example, how do the mirror police police? Why are they mirror people?

What you just wrote and the fate of the granddaughter especially confuse me.

Perhaps adding sentences like, "Scholars now know that glass is actally sand, and by creating glass from sand we may... [etc.]" and "King Hayden hypothesized that..." would shift the focus from what King Hayden meant to the Haydenites, to what King Hayden's discoveries meant to the expansion of the knowledge and resources of the Haydenites. The story would change from, "This is the exemplary tale of a great man to whom we all owe our way of life," to, "This is the exemplary tale of the great discoveries of our people's founder: he who us into Haydenites."

Maybe that helps. I enjoyed it. Fun system (even though I don't fully understand it)!

**** People become mirrored by passing through mirrors (and become unmirrored by passing through mirrors again). Only self-aware beings can pass through mirrors; no inanimate objects or simpler animals. Mirrored people are invisible and incorporeal to unmirrored people, and vice versa. Mirrored people can't eat most food, because of chirality.

***** Ah, so the assassin would stick their hand into a mirror to kill. That was my point of confusion after reading your post here.

What about steam and healing and engorgement and electricity, though? Couldn't figure out how those work.

****** The assassin /doesn't/ need to stick their hand into a mirror to kill. A knife is an inanimate object; it's neither incorporeal to the mirrored assassin nor to his unmirrored victim.

Electricity is just electricity. Nothing magic about it. :P

Steamed mirrors summon things from other worlds. Not advisable because the things that come through tend to be dangerous. Mostly exists to justify the portal fantasy plot, honestly.

Humans pass through glass, but inanimate objects don't - this includes dirt, which gives glass an application in cleansing.

Warped glass - including, say, lenses - warps things that go through it. This can be intelligently applied to grow things.

******* Understand everything but the mirror travel, now.

So to someone in the mirrored world, they'd see all non-mirrored inanimate objects, including the clothes in which people walk about, but the opposite isn't true? A person in the non-mirrored realm can't see anyone in the mirrored realm, but objects in the mirrored realm can interact with all space in the non-mirrored realm? I don't understand what rule would make a system like that. Also sounds like people might bump into the uniforms of invisible mirrored police and through their bodies sometimes, if mirrored inanimate objects are invisible yet tangible.

******** There /are/ no mirrored inanimate objects. Only self-aware beings can pass through mirrors in the first place. Everything except for self-aware beings exists simultaneously in the mirrored and nonmirrored realm. Self-aware beings only exist in one of them, and effect inanimate objects in both of them (because they're effecting the inanimate object in their own realm, and the object exists simultaneously in both).

********* So the clothes of a person who enters a mirror are annihilated by chirality, and that's why they're invisible? If not, I'm having trouble understanding how an assassin can invisibly kill unless they go in the mirror naked, and even then they'd be identifiable by the apparently floating knife they wield.

********** The clothes cannot go through the mirror at all. They would need to put on clothes after going through the mirror, and that's assuming that they care about wearing clothes as opposed to being stealthy. Yes, you can recognize that someone's about to stab you if you see their knife floating, but that's not much comfort if they wait until they're already in your house to get a knife to stab you with.

************* Didn't know that about pigs.

Wigs, too.

Are there kobolds or gremlins? They have skin.

Can leather be sharpened? Someone could run at a pile of clothes very fast with sharpened leather armor. Would the armor-wearer feel resistance in the mirror realm? Would they run through the pile of clothes? The interaction of mutual incorporeality and worn inanimate objects fascinates and confuses me.

************** Well, the armor-wearer and their sharpened armor (covered in pig-bones, perhaps?) exist in only one of the two planes, while the pile of clothes, presumably, exists in both of them. Hence, they /do/ interact.

Essentially, for any physical interaction between two objects, ask yourself if they're on the same plane or not. If yes, they interact. If no, they can't see or feel each other. Almost everything exists on both planes; non-interaction rarely comes into play. You can't stab someone in the other plane with a pig-bone knife, because it only exists on the plane you're in. You can, on the other hand, stab them with a metal knife, because it exists on both planes.

This all started, incidentally, with the deliberately wrong explanation that the reason you can't walk through a mirror in real life is because you're bumping into mirror-you.
