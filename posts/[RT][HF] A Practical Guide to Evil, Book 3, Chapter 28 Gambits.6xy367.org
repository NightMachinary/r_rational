*** Though...consider this:

  I had to bleed them hard here, because Arcadia was the only place where I could make their numbers meaningless. As long as I had the story on my side today, I could butcher them in droves in a way I simply couldn't in Creation without losing thousands myself.
#+end_quote

Arcadia might be actually detrimental to fey effectiveness if story isn't in their favor.

***** I get the impression that since fey are more slaves to the story, they have less ability to alter the narrative.

*** The part about The Order feels like another hint to what Would Have Been had Catherine become a hero as creation seems to have intended.

***** Yes, I think you're right. But had he even missed one person in her home town or not came to see her personally it feels as though she would have eventually gone down that path.\\
Probably significantly sooner than eventually actually, considering the timeframe of the Lone Swordsmans Party coming together and how she would have been a part of it.

*** The Knights were literally made to fight magic, with their runic armour.

It's why they were defeated with Orcs and Steel by Black.

It does mention that in the chapter.

***** #+begin_quote
  it doesn't make me happy to see Fae handled as lightly as they were in this chapter, on their own home turf.
#+end_quote

I suspect I misunderstood the thrust of your message then. My interpretation from the above quote was that you didn't think the knights could/would carve through the summer fae as easily as they did. I know suspect you meant narratively, were unhappy with it.

Pretty much. Though it could be that knights really are just that good.

*** This chapter was 3,377 words.

It's slightly below the average chapter length of ~3,700 words (I used my slightly out-dated table [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6qmtmj/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_3_chapter_23/dkzwyat/][here]] to calculate).
