Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

** Just spent the morning looking at OCR (optical character recognition ) software and my thought was ... pretty good, but it's 5 years from being truly done. Which was my exact thought from 20 years ago. The real strides are in making it easier for people to confirm or correct.

The implications for this with respect to AI? Possibly none, but this is a multi billion dollar industry and they don't seem able to solve this. FWIW

*** That's a result of the 90-90 rule. The first 90% of the code accounts for 90% of the development time, while the last 10% of the code accounts for the remaining 90% of the development time. The less tongue-in-cheek version is a version of the Pareto principle; 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. My experience with software development suggests that OCR is /still/ not going to be truly done in another ten years, but it will probably be good enough for /most/ use cases, with development effort slowly dropping off after that.

One of the arguments given by Bostrom, Yudkowsky, et. al. is that we don't really have any idea where superintelligence lies on the scale of effort for AI development. It might be that once we have a proper model, the jump to 1000 IQ is equivalent to getting a computer to read text in a single font and a single color from a page situated the perfect distance away from the camera under ideal conditions. Or it might be that /100 IQ/ is that equivalent. Or /50 IQ/. If we assume that there are big easy chunks and small hard chunks, then that still doesn't really help us because we don't know what our curve of difficulty/effort looks like.

**** I feel like part of the confusion is that everyone expects "general intelligence" to be a single "master algorithm" (a Google talk actually has this title), whereas I think there actually exists a large space of learning algorithms capable of inducing arbitrary programs (causal structures) with greatly varying degrees of compression/generalization/transfer learning. And even once you've got one of those, you have to hook it up to good perceptual algorithms.

So we should really ask two questions: which algorithms, with what degree of implementation efficiency?

*** Alex St. John thinks that we're pursuing AI [[http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/2015/06/24/no-azimov-ai/][the wrong way]]. He argues, essentially, that while simulating biological processes is possible digitally (per [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Symbolic_Analysis_of_Relay_and_Switching_Circuits][Shannon's proof]]), it's hopelessly inefficient compared to the massively-parallel atomic-level physics tricks than life can pull with organic chemistry.

He proposes that minds, of flatworms or of humans, don't operate like computers at all. Our ability to simulate them in simple or specific situations is, from his perspective, essentially a parlor trick: We're fooling ourselves into believing that computers think like animals, rather than actually creating computers that do so.

Agree or not, it's a thought-provoking read... even if he can't spell Asimov.

I think he really needs to say what kind of "computers" he means. From the theoretical perspective, it's all Turing-complete, which is why that theoretical perspective is largely uninformative.

EDIT: Oh God my head. Why did I click on that link? That was one of the stupidest things I've read in a while. I mean, I've got a friend who claims cognition has to involve infinite-precision real numbers and Lebesgue measures, but that's why he's designing a programming language semantics linked to physics. He's /wrong/, but he at least manages to be wrong without being a /fucking crackpot/ like the guy who simultaneously claims that the real universe uses infinite-precision real numbers (it sure might) /and/ "computes" with them (which is flatly impossible).

We now know Mercury has billions of tons of water, as does the moon, at its poles. There is also abundant water in c-type asteroids nearer the sun. Also, is possible to recycle water fairly easily in enclosed living spaces, so it's not a particularly believable way to establish a chokehold over a rebellious colony at a distance. That said, is great that it's hard enough sci-fi that one can criticize that sort of point with a straight face. There's no FTL in the first episode at least, and it does try to give a sense of the scale of the solar system.

** Let's talk about rationality in regard to names.

Yesterday I heard an expecting couple discussing possible names for their child. They kept saying phrases like, "He doesn't feel like a Nathan."

From a rational standpoint, that's ridiculous. The reason your child doesn't feel like a certain name is because of your own personal biases. In fact, the most rational thing you could when naming a child is to research what name gives them the most advantages in their life. Does the name stand out? Is it memorable? What immediate emotions/thoughts will it illicit in others?

In your opinion, what is the most rational name you can give a child (boy or girl)?

*** I think you ideally give them a name that they can alter for themselves as they grow and change as people. You don't know which name is going to be most advantageous, because you don't know what skills or aptitudes your child is going to be able to leverage. So when trying to find a name, you want to find one that's modifiable, which probably means that it's longer. So, for example, "Theodore" can be "Ted", "Teddy", or "Theo" depending on the circumstances (with none of the difficulty or social stigma of actually changing name).

An alternate consideration is having a name that's unique enough that search algorithms can find them or common enough that they can't, depending on preference. Getting confused with other people that have your same name is a hassle.

And stay away from names that reflect low class or leave unfavorable impressions.

First is the well known phenomenon that people with names that are earlier in the alphabet are more often cited in scientific papers; someone on lesswrong changed their name to aaron aarenson or something because of that.

Second reason for names is signalling; some names or etymological backgrounds for names eg. Kevin or Chantalle (in germany) are very low class; whereas white-collar middle/upper class use greek or latin triple or even quadruple names. (Philipp Alexander Aeneas or I recently heard of a Nike).

*** From what I've read, the actual impact of a name on someone's life is pretty small, and the research is inconclusive. The main effects, if they exist, seem to come from names signaling that one is a member of a specific social group. And there might be an impact from having a really outlandish name.

So I'd argue the rational thing to do is probably to just pick a name that "feels right" for the kid. If you are a utilitarian, the utility benefit to you of being happy with your kids' name is probably going to outweigh any positive or negative impact on his life (provided you aren't set on naming him something like "Streetlamp Le Moose"). It also saves you the time, effort, and mental energy needed to actually do the research, which probably isn't going to provide you good data anyway because this is not a topic that can be easily tested. I mean, even if you discovered that, say, Davids did better than Nathans who were born in the 50's, what guarantee is it that the same would be true today? And I don't think a properly controlled version of that dataset exists in the first place.

So I'd say their method wasn't all that bad, really.

** It occurs to me that too few people approach the question of "how do we make a general intelligence" as "how do we make a computer program with moral relevance equal to or greater than a human", and vice versa.

*** I don't think "moral relevance" is a real quantity, even while being a moral realist. The morality that involves some creatures being /fundamentally more important/ than others, even while they can coexist in a single community, is not the true morality.

**** What qualities make humans morally relevant? I think an in-depth analysis of those qualities is key to making a good AGI. A lot of statements I see made about AGIs (such as the one you make elsewhere in the thread) seem willfully dense to me for that reason. If you can't make a "master algorithm" that can learn and generically make a good attempt to solve any problem put in front of it, then I think you're saying you can't make an AGI - but that's stupid, because we already have a (non-A)GI, a human.

***** People treat morality as the bit to focus on not because it's harder, but because if we don't get it completed /before/ we do the other bit, then we probably all die. And the other bit is more or less guaranteed to be figured out eventually.

****** I'm not talking about making the AGI friendly. I'm talking about making the AGI general and intelligent. And what I'm saying is that I think both of those things go hand in hand with making a being whose desires are worth consideration in moral equations (unlike a video game character or a microbe, to name two relatively uncontroversial examples; I personally think it's safe to also include plants and most animals in the "not worthy of moral consideration" category).

I said that there may not be a /single master algorithm/ that performs optimally on all possible tasks. There are a large number of universal tasks that, /given enough resources/, could learn /any/ task.

  What qualities make humans morally relevant?
#+end_quote

The fact that "morality" is being done by humans, put simply.

Also, yes. Psychology is most certainly a real science. And pointing at an example of it being done badly doesn't invalidate it in any way.

******* See below:

#+begin_quote
  Psychology is the study of mind and behavior. It is an academic discipline and an applied science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.
#+end_quote

See below:

#+begin_quote
  Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders. These include various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities.
#+end_quote

Hence why I blew you off in my first comment. It sounded as if you were trying to suggest that the field of *psychology* was illegitimate. Based on this comment, it's clear your issue is more with *psychiatry*, a related, but distinct, discipline. Not saying I agree with calling it fake, just saying that I'm much more firmly in the "psychology is a real science" camp than the "psychiatry is a real science" camp, for obvious reasons.

*** Cognitive Psychology is a field of interest for the rationalists here, and the building of FAI. I could see Munro adding a fourth podium to this comic and going a step further and talking about the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Milgram's Obedience experiment in the context of nuclear weapons.
