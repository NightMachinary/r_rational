I just finished the Worm podcast and loved it. I recently started HPMOR and am very much enjoying that as well. I am also currently subscribed to Wildbow's other works, Ward and Twig, though I am not listening to them yet until all episodes have been released and I can binge the entire series.

Are there any others I can subscribe to? My main concern is that between listening to Worm and HPMOR, I finished three other short audio drama podcasts (all under 30 episodes) in a little over a week, and wasn't impressed with any. So preferably, I'm looking for long, completed rational fiction podcasts, but I'll take all suggestions. Thanks!


** The Metropolitan Man is a popular rational fiction story with audio, on hpmorpodcast.com

Friendship is Optimal looks to have audio for it on YouTube that you could download.

*** I've heard of The Metropolitan Man. Looking forward to getting to that after HPMOR. Never heard of Friendship is Optimal. Thanks!

** You could try "We Are Legion (We Are Bob)"

It's about a programmer who signs up for cryonics, dies, and is woken up as an AI candidate for a von Neumann probe. Apart from the science used to provide the necessary acceleration and a bit of have waving to get things started, the science is all legit. It's a ton of engineering competence porn, and definitely a blast to read when it gets good.

*** That sounds really cool! Do you know if it's in podcast form, or just book for now?

**** You can find it as an audiobook on Amazon, the narrator does a great job of making every single one of the characters sound just different enough to be recognizable from each other even though they're all actually copies of the same guy.

** There aren't many that are complete and you named the only 2 i know of.

There's an incomplete 'the good student' podcast that just started

You'd probably be better off just looking at audiobooks for rationalish books.

*** There's a free podcast audiobook of The Martian! Maybe not explicitly rationalist, but the science is all rock-solid.

**** I'd be down for that! Didn't find it though in the Pocket Casts directory. Saw it on iTunes, but it was $27. Would you mind posting the link for that as well?

***** Having trouble finding it, and it turns out the narrator I heard is the guy who does it for Audible. Thinking I may have stumbled upon a pirated podcast, but I'll do some digging.

*** That makes sense, haha. Haven't gotten to the point yet where I'm willing to pay for audiobooks though, so I'd like to stay with free podcasts as much as I can. I searched the "The Good Student," but only found educational and college prep suggestions. Would you mind posting the link to it?

**** whoops, i saw a link that says 'X reads the good student' and assumed it was outloud for audio, its actually just someone's thoughts about the story while reading it. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/85iqv8/jakeb89_reads_the_good_student_111/]])

generally if you can't find the story, just append rational or webserial of fic to the end and it'll show up in google.
