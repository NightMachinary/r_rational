** As others have said, all the characters are OOC. The writing is not that good and spelling, grammar, and tense issues are common. The story content seems somewhat interesting so far, though, so it's worth a look if you like Evangelion.

** The Ikari conjecture was the first thing I thought of when I read the AT field description and purpose, this story takes it to a natural conclusion. Yay story. Philosophy is a bit pushy , so far reading 5 chapters. Everybody is OOC a little bit, no explanation so far. Will keep reading on

** Not my story, yes this is another Evangelion fanfiction, but this Shinji Ikari is less like the ones in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k]] and more like HJPEV from methods of rationality. A word of warning though, if you cannot stand HJPEV's constant disrespect of Authority, this story is even worse. That being said this Shinji Ikari is faster at gathering allies and political power than HJPEV. In general it feels like the whole world is taking the angel's threat seriously, so it's not just one character getting buffed and causing cascade of events. This Gendo Ikari does not put on a white hat, but he is the most understandable version of a ruthless manipulative zealot doing everything he can to save the world.

** This is a VERY ambitious project, and, to be honest, I don't think your writing skills are quite up to it. Ignoring minor spelling and grammar issues, your characters don't sound like their anime counterparts (Gendo should never use exclamation points except when he is barking orders), the descriptions are plain, and the rationalist themes could use development.

That said, I think you have potential. If you keep practicing, I wouldn't be surprised if you reread this story in 5 years or so, cringe, and decide to rewrite the whole thing into a form that does the concept justice. If you ever do that, though, please keep the original up; a lot of fanfic writers like to replace their originals when they do this, and it annoys the archivist in me to no end.

*** I hope you leave this review at fanfiction for the author, as I said earlier this is not my story.
