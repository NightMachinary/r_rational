Here it is, with the ink still wet. Only a bit over a week late this time, so I'm improving!

Pyrebound is a dark, original world fantasy serial with a setting loosely patterned after the Ancient Near East (Sumer/Babylon). Life is hard--they base their calendar around regularly occurring cosmic calamities--and virtually every part of human life is tainted with brutal power politics. If you want to start from the beginning, [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here's the link]]. Thanks as ever to all who read, like, comment, or what-have-you.
