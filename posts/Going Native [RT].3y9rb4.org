** This is frankly a /much/ better ending than the actual one for BSG.

*** A one hundred fifty thousand words ending.

Seems to me could be worth a few episodes, or maybe an entire season.

** It's caught my interest.

Do I need to know the source material to appreciate this?

Eh, I'll keep reading, but treat it like /in media res./

**** 10 chapters in, the BSG wiki pages on the characters filled in some blanks and helped provide context. I have only marginally more Star Trek knowledge(I think I've seen one of the movies?).

I am definitely enjoying it.

** Very good - I just finished. I have not watched either series, and was greatly entertained. I would definitely recommend this fic to others.

** I really enjoyed this. Good to hear that you don't need knowledge of either franchise. (For the record I've watched BSG but only a very few Star Trek episodes)

** Okay before I read this is it BSG classic or the more recent one?
