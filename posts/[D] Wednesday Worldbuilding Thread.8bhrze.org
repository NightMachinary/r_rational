Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I have already posted nearly the exact same comment to last week's Friday Off-Topic Thread, but in interest of having a different set of commenters, I'm posting it again here.

I'm working on this time travel story where the protagonist has the power to induce Stable Time Loops which means she believes that time is immutable in the sense of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rrW7yf42vQYDf8AcH/timeless-physics][Timeless Physics]]. The antagonist is someone with a different time travel power, but unlike hers he can change the past and thus sees time as mutable in a Branching History Model.

The [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/moral-conflicts][Good vs Good Conflict]] practically writes itself where the protagonist is horrified at the antagonist seemingly murdering trillions every time he changes the past and the antagonist thinks the protagonist could destroy the world if she abuses the Stable Time Loops to create an [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes][Outcome Pump]].

The part I'm ashamed to need help with...is the ending. I wanted to come up with a model of time travel that could permit both mutable and immutable types of travel and I've been having trouble coming up with explanations for how both can occur. Clearly a conflict can't be written if I can't explain how it's possible to have both versions of time travel in the same world.

There's several ideas I've already have thanks to the suggestions of friends and the mad genii who post here, but more would be greatly appreciated!

*** No need to be ashamed of struggling with your ending. Lots of writers struggle to figure out how to wrap everything up. Sometimes you have to write the story and just sort of figure it out, sometimes you already know how it's going to end. Everybody's different about that, and that's totally cool.

You could just treat everything like a many-worlds model. Your protag creates stable loops along a single timeline, while your antagonist creates new timelines but leaves the old ones intact. Time would be immutable along each line, but changing your line could change the past and future as you please. You'd have to find someway for your protag to stay with the guy in his same timeline. Unless she sees different versions of him.

**** Yeah, I'm not waiting to think of an ending before I start writing the story. I already have the first two (short) chapters written out.

I just wanted to know if anyone here could come up with their own ideas about two conflicting models of time travel and my favorite one was the one about everyone being in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8aa92m/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dwy3sdj/][simulation]].

Your idea where they both can do whatever they want to the timeline and only incidentally intersect has merit, but it doesn't feel right unless I have some idea for an underlying model of how the time travel works to permit such drastically divergent variations. It wouldn't be in the spirit of rationalist fiction otherwise.

It's still fine for now since I'm on a journey to 'discover' how time works with my characters.

***** I've got an idea, take it or leave it. Some models have time being cyclical. We follow a loop: universe starts, exists, dies, starts again. Same thing every time, nothing changes. But! You have your antag with the ability to change the past. He simply shifts the "wheel" left or right at a certain point and can travel along the wheel as he chooses. While your protag simply sets a smaller wheel within that wheel (your stable loops)

******* Yeah, I agree. It was a bit of a slapdash idea based off the Wheel of Time. This is why I generally don't enjoy stories about time travel or manipulating time as if it's some element distinct from the fabric of the universe. The only one I ever liked was Slaughterhouse Five.

After reading the simulation idea, I think that's probably OP's best bet.

** How would you design a lair for a rational supervillain? Obvious pitfalls to avoid and stuff you definitely want in there?

I am sure that people have dabbled in that before but I have been unable to find anything when searching.

*** I mean one obvious reason you might not hear about rational supervillain lairs is because supervillain lairs aren't as advantageous as they seem.

Generally it would be vastly preferable to keep your base of operations secret and be able to move if it was disrupted (or for other reasons). Thus giving it too many defences would conflict with making it inconspicuous.

However if you were going to have a lair that everyone knew about anyway then you'd be advised to make it similar to modern military structures like bunkers/military bases including their defensive measures and it might also be advantageous to have a battleship as your base since they have good defences and are mobile. However all these options assume you have billions of dollars to throw around, because if you don't then having a non-secret base within your price range will lead to you getting very quickly taken out.

Still even if you're absurdly wealthy having a conspicuous base doesn't seem worth it because if you're a proper supervillain then most likely modern militaries will take you out pretty quick if they can unless you're allied with another nation they don't want to start a war with.

** I'm trying to work out a FTL system for a sci-fi story I'm probably never going to write and I would like to get some feedback on loopholes or workarounds that I may be missing.

The goal is to have a whole bunch of tiny colonies that decided to break of from their parent nations and strike out on their own. I want the colonies to have contact and trade with larger multi-star-system governments while simultaneously making it infeasible for those bigger nations to invade/take military action against their former colonies. Here is what I have right now:

FTL travel uses a device called an aperture to establish one end of an FTL jump. You can either jump from one aperture to another or between one aperture and a sufficiently large (star-sized) gravity well. Since the latter option usually puts vessels /inside/ the star in question, it is really only used by unmanned drones to scout out new systems and put apertures in place there (you send in hundreds of drones until one appears in a location where it is not immediately fried). Once a foothold is established, a network of FTL jamming satellites is put into place around the star to prevent other parties from sending in their own drones.

To make a successful jump, the sending party has to first communicate detailed mass distribution scans of the payload to the receiving party which can then decide to accept or reject the jump. If the scans don't line up with the payload, the jump fails and the payload is ripped to pieces.

This all means that ship to ship combat mostly isn't a thing. You can scan ships for weapons once they arrive, so each system just parks enough weapon platforms around their aperture to blow apart any ship that comes through with more weapons than they are allowed to have (the allowed number of weapons is typically zero). The only moderately viable way for an outside party to take military action against a system, then, is to somehow get enough undercover agents into the target system to take control of the aperture control station and/or incite the local population to rise up against their government. Both options are expensive, risky and unlikely to work, so most parent nations decide to cut their losses and attempt to maintain some semblance of good relations with their rebellious colonies.

There is a few other details that I left out for brevity, but that is the basic gist of it. Anything obvious that I'm missing?

*** Can aperture-to-star jumps be targetted at specific stars or regions of space? If so, parent nations can set up in the star system next door and throw rocks. It might take a few decades or centuries for such an attack to land, but you can make the rebels' long-term future uncertain, to disincentivize future rebellions. Of course, the best way to avoid rebellions is to have loyalists already in place before it starts. If jumps can't be targetted, then I'd expect every port world to basically be in its own universe as far as it can tell, with no other ports anywhere in the sky other than the ones they pushed out.

How do incoming vessels send their manifest to the receiving aperture? Do the apertures need to employ trusted ships as runners to go back and forth, or can signals be sent by some other means? Can that other means be weaponized into a laser that fires across systems - to damage the receiving ansible if nothing else, and leave the other side blind?

How detailed are the mass distribution scans, and how sensitive is the jump to changes? Will ships die because a crewman had to run to the loo, or just leaned over to grab something? If so, I'm not sure if it's even possible for manned vessels to reliably jump. If not, expect people to get up to as much mischief as they can get away with by having 50 kg out of place. That's plenty to allow some nasty payload discrepancies.

Can anyone destroy any ship by duct-taping a pistol to its hull just before it jumps? Small organizations can use governmental paranoia to solve their own problems. Smart organizations can use this to temper governmental paranoia so that they can smuggle weapons in.

Will your scanners be able to tell that my shipment of ming vases are completely normal, non-weaponized ming vases, except they're made of antimatter? Or that the mayonnaise in the fridge is a biological weapon culture? Or that the 3D printer is jailbroken and can print guns? Or that my cargo shifting tractor beam has overpowered capacitors and can function as a cannon? Or that a hundred of the tourists on board are space marines, to be armed on the other side?

And that's just if I'm deliberately using "weapons". What exactly is the difference between a warship armed with missiles, and a barge loaded with unpowered shipping containers that can be released at orbital velocity? What's the difference between a particle beam and a rocket engine? Between a lethal megawatt laser, and the megawatt radar beam used by AWACS aircraft right now, which can absolutely kill you if it stops scanning and stares at you? Everything that is useful is a weapon.

Just a rock won't do, as the colony will see it coming and be able to knock it of course. At minimum you'd have to include shielding, engines and probably some weapons. My thinking was that putting that much effort into a plan that won't come to fruition until multiple decades (at minimum) into the future is just not worth the trouble.

You bring up a good point that just putting it in motion might be enough to disincentivize future rebellions. That is kind of a big problem. I hadn't considered making blind jump targeting random, but that is a very interesting idea and might very well be the solution for this problem.

#+begin_quote
  How do incoming vessels send their manifest to the receiving aperture?
#+end_quote

There is a separate mini-aperture connection that just sends over a standardized data storage device of some kind. Destroying an enemy aperture is possible though, for instance by sending a shipment of antimatter ming vases and detonating them on arrival. The problem is that all that will do is make transport into and out of the system impossible until it is rebuild (which is somewhat expensive, but not economy crippling) and ensure that a whole bunch of people won't accept incoming jumps from you anymore.

There is a reasonable allowance for error in the manifest, but crew does have to be strapped into their chairs for the trip. Scans that happen on arrival in the system are much more detailed and basically give you a blueprint of the ship. It's pretty hard to smuggle anything through, but there is still a human in the loop so you won't start an interstellar war by duct-taping a gun to the side of a ship.

Note also that they are scanning for ship size weapons, smuggling in side arms is supposed to be somewhat tricky, but not impossible.

#+begin_quote
  Will your scanners be able to tell that..
#+end_quote

Yes on the antimatter ming vases and the tractor beam (provided you use a different piece of tech, I don't intend to have tractor beams), no on the rest. In general, they'd be able to see what kind of modifications you made to your ship compared to standardized schematics. Of course anything can be a weapon if you are creative enough and assembling a fleet armed with improvised weapons and/or ramships would be a viable attack vector, but that still puts you at a significant disadvantage compared to the defenders (especially since you have to keep everything hidden from the local government while you're assembling). Cars are weapons in the real world, but most militaries still prefer tanks.

Tourists that are also space marines is the actual way people try to take over other systems, but that tactic does not allow the larger nation to fully take advantage of its much larger economy and industry (which was the intended purpose). In fact, the story centers around an experimental military unit that tries to solve this problem by answering the question of "how much force multiplication can we stuff into a single person?".

Biological weaponry is another excellent point that I hadn't thought of. Maybe there is some kind of interstellar ban on that kind of stuff, though that seems extremely hard to enforce. Hmm, I'll need to think about that.
