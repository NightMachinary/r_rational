**** But conversely, Joon's main skill - rapid onset of basic competence in skills that take natives years to acquire - has huge benefits for Fenn to have even a little bit of it.

If he's at Level 2 in anything, she can skip years of apprenticeship....heal (if inefficiently) with bone magic, light a dark room with blood magic, see into her own soul (and his) when he gets enough skill in soul magic, etc. etc. etc.

It's one thing to say they're soul bonded and she won't lag behind, another that she gets competence in each individual skill entry. That will be extremely useful to Mary. Also, half of Fenn's ranged skill is still pretty ridiculous for Joon...I wonder if she'll be able to spread those skill points across her character sheet when she gets a bit more soul magic?

***** Which brings up the thorny and awkward problem if whether loyalty actually measures true loyalty in a spectrum or whether any loyal feelings automatically bump up the arbitrary Loyalty number by x. It can even be loyalty to Joon as an asset, rather than to his person. How reliable is the number for Valencia (who can be possessed - it would be funny if the possessing devil were forced to adopt and operate under Val's loyalty numbers) or for Amaryllis (who once raised it several times with a few seconds of internal rationalization)?

I think that makes more sense if you consider Loyalty a representation not of a linear scalar magnitude, but rather of something like negative-log Bayesian uncertainty in goal-planning where reliance on predictive modelling of the trustee is concerned.

If that's the right model, you could raise loyalty very quickly by simply deciding to not let a few of your doubts about a person affect your judgement where goal-planning is concerned (i.e. decide on actions /as if/ the trustee were perfectly reliable and honest.)

It's not really about dispelling doubts; it's just about suppressing their effects on your behavior. Mary's really good at that.

** The soul mage is a "deviant" elf? Assuming that's not all just affected behavior to trick people, this is solid intel. If Juniper can research what "normal" elves are like then he can hopefully get a better picture of what what kind of person the soul mage is, which could help a lot in figuring out how to handle him.

Also, and this is probably just paranoia, it seems really convenient that the member of the party who's getting the quarantine treatment is the only one that Juniper is unable to vet via soul link. Plus, because Grak is getting treated like a leper the odds are negligible that he'll reach loyalty 10 before the current crisis is dealt with. Then again the soul mage couldn't have known who they were going to leave behind at the prison via teleporter, so this is probably just a coincidence.

***** He could, for example, have stored his soul in the nonanima. It's purpose-built for possession, after all. They would have then broken him out at the same time as Fake!Fallatehr and triggered the quest completion.

I don't actually think that's what happened. Fallatehr is Fallatehr.\\
But I think it might happen in the future. Once Joon trusts the thing due to its high 'loyalty', it presents an easy method for the soul mage to approach him as a wolf in sheep's clothing.

****** In that case the null pointer exception is because Fallatehr is using "hide soul" or some skill (hide your name from the world even from gazes on your soul").

But this theory must explain how fake!Fallatehr activated the pelehr. So the prediction is that then soul magic has some range in some capacity, or he taught it to some of his minions. Or it was done earlier when they were carrying the nonanima.

******* the change to the minions only occured when joon healed them. Fallatehr in any body could have adjusted their souls hours in advance I think.

I just went back and confirmed this in chapter 62. !Fallatehr touches them on the forehead and the recoil a bit but that could all be an act in line with his already demonstrated flair for deception. I still believe that Valencia is Fallatehr either by possesion or not (no proof that she is actually a nonanima).

Here's a thought: Why bother to do it if it changed nothing? Like, /maybe/ generic "sowing discord", but we're already not trusting Grak.

In fact, let's assume it /is/ true: what does that change? We'd know that Falletehr is untrustworthy and preferably needs to die.

Actually, perhaps what it /does/ change is that if there were some way of accessing Val's memories (for instance, perhaps giving her a soul and then using soul magic to look at the memories), then Grak's status could be verified and if compromised, then they could decide to kill Falletehr already.

**** I will say that the one thing we can learn for sure from the incident comes from Fenn and Mary. They didn't notably react or care at all. Given how rare anima allegedly are, that's... surprising. Possibly worrying? Seems like their anima perception is ingrained, and potentially something that potentially came from plays or media - Fenn's not much of a reader. That would make it possibly inaccurate (and Valencia is in no place to correct them).

Asking Fenn or Mary about anima in general seems like a good idea.

I also don't like Falletehr's reaction. It was a bit too smooth. I vote that she's telling the truth.

***** They should just teleport her to an area with a thick barrier between worlds, or use wards. Bam, more reliable witness (since loyalty probably means she is more likely to tell the truth). Also possible source of intel on Falletehr.

They could also possess her with a soul/demon that they know wont lie, perhaps one from thier flask of dead. Then use that to get at all the memories.

It seems like they want to treat her like a leper and ignore here even if she is trying to tell them something. Cultural blind spot? One that Falletehr may share? But perhaps not if he saw some experimental value in her at least and he doesn't follow cultural taboos.

***** His reaction to nearly everything has been smooth. Taking what's happened so far into consideration, I'd put low odds on Val's outburst being genuine.

Why did she wait until she was going to be taken away to reveal the "truth"? Because she didn't want to join Falletehr again or was afraid he'd do something to her without the gang seeing? It would've been far easier to voice her concerns when they were speaking in confidence.

The paranoid part of me sees her saying “You have to believe me, Juniper, please!” as especially suspicious. She's actively appealing to emotion, whereas she was withdrawn and meek when her Loyalty was rising. Something like "Juniper, please don't send me with Falletehr because x,y,z" would be much more effective, assuming she still thinks like a person and isn't mentally stunted (or possessed by a more devious devil).

****** That's a good point. An appeal to emotion after moving away from the "safe zone"? That's definitely evidence for possession.

Counterpoint, though - there's weak evidence from the point of view of a potential loyalty shift. We haven't seen sudden loyalty shifts cause dramatic changes in behavior before, but we've also not seen such a meteoric rise in loyalty either.

I'm still on the side of Valencia telling the truth. That's more due to a lack of trust of Falletehr than it is trust in Val at this point, but I'll toss my flag in the ground here. I'll also say that it's possible that that was a demon telling the truth in order to create discord.

** Valencias outburst is kind of terrifying, because it implies at least one version of her is indeed possessed. ..

"Juniper does not share our cultural values".. meaning the established horror of non-anima? See my point re: "Well, that is terrifying".

Interesting about the elves - so they trained Fenn as well as they could because the idea of half-assing anything is anathema to their entire culture.

Fenn! And her teasing of Amaryllis.
