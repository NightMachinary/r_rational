** So. From the appeance and effect of that thing I'm assuming it's a small EMP device? Evidently it didn't kill their phones, just the guys prosthetic

*** It's a leap and I have no idea how Turry would get them, but I was thinking nanites or other tech allowing Turry to take control of cybernetics

**** Nanites would be kind of an asspull, we haven't seen anything like that in the story so far. It tries to stay very grounded. If that is really Turry taking actual control of this guys cybernetics my guess is simpler that being hit by an EMP forced a reboot or something where the limb connected to the net and Turry was able to use that to introduce malware. Even more likely though is IMO that he wasn't even the target. Turry could not have known for sure that he would open the package.

***** Turry might have been monitoring the situation and waited for when he would be holding it. And considering how good Turry is at predicting humans now, it doesn't seem that much of a stretch that he could predict, at least with a high probability, that he would be the one to pick it up.

***** If Turry wanted to introduce malware, why would it provide an immediately apparent bug?

** Oh no. Prosthetics, in this world, seem to work off of the arm nerves directly, rather than being controlled by the contraction of some unrelated muscle.

Even with the obligatory protections to prevent short circuits from shocking the nerves/brain, I could easily see Turry using low-voltage stuff to make the victim feel "on edge," possibly making them tend towards violence/escalation earlier.

The interesting thing here is that it activated not when he pushed a button, just randomly. And his hand didn't crush the glass, his hand opened wide to drop it. The device broke its own glass. Why?

*** Look up how little home-made EMP devices work. It's basically a firecracker inside a coil, which is consistent with how this here looks. The "glass" could have been simply for protection during transport but cracked when it activated.
