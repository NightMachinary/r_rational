** Your question is not very clear. Why must we fix "/all things ... or none/" and why must objections be unique?

Your surveillance example doesn't make sense to me; if something doesn't work (and has costs) that is a *very* good reason for not doing it.

** Arguments don't map like that, though. The space of argument y -> conclusion x is not a case of y = x linearly. You can have many arguments for one conclusion, and many conclusions for one argument. Are you referring to specificity? Like, instead of "surveillance is not effective", one should say "surveillance is not effective at x, y, or z, based on evidence a, b, and c, and therefore I recommend a reduction or severe modification in surveillance practices"? Because if so I agree. That's basically the format of a scientific paper.

*** i think that [[/u/CouteauBleu]] has got it -- though im looking for something more that exist out there, but it doesn't seem like ppl like really focusing much on the quality of a reason, or if a reason if actually comparatively good

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/76aqzf/are_there_any_philosophical_ideas_terms_words/]]

--------------

im going to make a summary of all this eventually

mainly for myself, but maybe for everyone (well for those that want to be educated), not sure yet -- those that understand already do understand, and those that don't likely don't want to understand anyway so not sure yet

anything i say would be kinda pointless to them cos they're already locked into a system of thinking, and likely don't understand much about its inherent flaws

for further input and interest, could see comments on

You know you're being really arrogant, right?

It's not even a "it doesn't matter how you deliver an argument as long as the argument is good" thing, you're just legitimately assuming that you can separate people into two categories "People who reason logically (like me)" and "People who don't and aren't worth talking to".

It's childish and petulant; I've seen a bunch of people like that in LW-adjacent communities (I've been like that, it was partly what drew me to HP:MoR in the first place), and this kind of smarter-than-you attitude is exactly what makes people not take us seriously.

** I think you're looking for [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/13/proving-too-much/][Proving too much]]. If an argument applies to absurd ideas, that's evidence for the argument being flawed in some ways.

On the other hand, you're being very very vague. Saying "X is not effective" can be a valid or invalid argument against X, depending on context. Epistemology rules are hard to put into words, because then they sound absolute, but in practice you have to weight then against one another.
