** Just read through this from the beginning. Enjoying it a lot. The switches of perspective and new magic systems were a bit jarring at first but I like how it's drawn together into a larger narrative. I like the general idea of drawing from fiction, always felt like in settings where magic was powered by belief it was strange that ancient Egyptian gods were running about, but not modern fiction that people have much more investment in.

The relationship between the two main characters feels solid and realistic. They feel like smart people but without falling into the trap of ridiculously competent super rational protagonists some stories have.

I felt like the depiction of the military leader immediately falling into the hardcore religious interpretation of events was a bit on the nose. But I've not spent time in that area of the USA so couldn't say how accurate it is. Given the degree of redundancy built into these kind of disaster response command and control things you'd think there would be some kind of coordination remaining, even with all the magic outbreaks. But plausibly if there's an active enemy group trying to prevent organisation

In story speculation: I think the aslan entity implies that this is drawing on some kind of collective unconscious, with the "magic" individuals just acting as a conduit.

** ... '"You did not summon Lini the Druid or Seoni the Sorceress for your games, why hold my creator to some higher standard?”

I started at that. “Wait, are you implying that Haley is someone I-” I shared a nervous glance with my wife. “That doesn't make any sense, we've been together for a decade, you'd have to rewrite half our life story to make that fit-”'

Agh, I really hope Haley didn't get raptured and simultaneously magic-replaced in ideal form by Sean.

*** Haley never existed. She's just what Sean would have wanted to marry. Now he thinks his past memories of her are real, and so does "she".

...is what I really hope not to be true.

** I wonder what the restrictions on Haley's shapeshifting are. Exosuit for the squishy husband?

Also, you write a bit like a girl, as if Haley is the person you want to be. It's fairly subtle imo, but it's the impression I got.

*** Haley's shapeshifting is somewhat limited :

Change Shape (Su)

A very young or older gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.

She can't turn into ooze or make up a form.

**** Dopplegangers and changelings are humanoids, she could change shape into one of them then use their own shapeshifting?

Changeling doesn't seem to be limited to humanoid forms, just by their medium size so that should work?

Also from that description will she lose the ability when she's "middle aged"?

***** No, polymorph doesn't work like that in Pathfinder. You don't get any magical abilities of the form you turn into, it is effectively a skin deep transformation. You get certain listed abilities based on the list provided in the spell, but this is things like dark vision or scent, not major magical features.

And dragons have no middle age, dragons have 12 scaling age categories of their own.

****** Could you transform into a doppleganger already shaped into a exosuit? (Looks like changelings are totally different in Pathfinder) Or is it the same as old rules where you have to have seen the creature to change into it? "Perfect copy" is under "special abilities" it lloks like.

Another approach: Shape change into as weakly corrosive of an ooze as she can then engulf the husband (with a diving tank to breathe). The ooze should still have her magical toughness just like the human form does. If the seen animal is a prerequisite this could still be used in emergencies, because it's disgusting, with animals that can engulf humans. With her current size I think it would have to be some giant constrictor snake.

Sorry, I misunderstood the age statement thanks for clarifying.

******* You would not get the doppelganger's shapeshift ability at all, and even if you did, it also duplicates alter self, so it would not change anything.

You also can't change into an ooze. Only animals and humanoids with the dracionic racial change shape.

Once she gets actual spells, there are very good ways to protect others (protection from arrows works on bullets, add resist energy to avoid basically all the damage on average from a rocket launcher shot, or stoneskin, etc). At higher level spells, nothing is actually a threat anymore because you can contingency away or use Ghostform to become flat immune to non-magical attacks.

Also Time Stop, Gate, Wish, etc. They should go get a lot fo diamonds though.

Plus, dragons can use wish or limited wish to duplicate cleric spells to raise the dead. Death is nothing more than a slightly more effective status debuff at high levels in PF.

******* In addition to the points [[/u/JackStargazer]] mentioned, dopplegangers aren't Humanoids in Pathfinder, they're Monstrous Humanoids, which is a different type entirely.
