Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I'm having a moderate blast doing NaNo with my "urban fantasy with wizards who are irrelevant" thing. (It started off with the question: if wizards are real, why don't they do something? answer, at least here: because trying to do things means you die/get erased, so.)

Probably the single most annoying thing about writing it set "right now" (aka November 2020) is the general state of lockdown. I mean, it's the literally perfect setting for a coffee shop run by a cheerful millenium-old demihuman and her fairy goddaughter, but the coffee shop is closed! And suchlike and so forth.

Anyway, the main character is a total nerd, he'd fit in here pretty well, so I thought I'd ask: if you, say, had an undeniable magic experience (ran into a dragon and helped it shape itself into a human form) while moving into your new group house which turns out to be full of wizards, what questions would you ask?

(The first question he asks is about whether he'll owe anything for answers. The second question he asks is whether the soul exists / whether the self continues after death. The third question he asks is whether he has magic, and the answer is "the Sight, but no ability to otherwise wield magic or enact changes in the world".)

**** That's a good question! It's especially a fun one because nobody (or at least nobody who's talking about it) knows why in a fundamental sense, rather than in an immediate sense.

(the immediate reason why magic is secret is that attempts to be unsecretive about magic, change the world, etc, uniformly fail, often in lethal-to-the-wizard ways. You can't solve COVID with magic because trying to do so kills you. You can't collect the millions of dollars in prize money for having magic because your magic will fail you.)

** I've had an idea rolling around in my head for a while that basically boils down to, "What if Buddha/Zoroaster/Abraham/Jesus/Mani/Muhammad/Nanak/etc. was a rationalist and/or had additional knowledge of science/history?"

In other words, an alternate history where a fundamentally improved or even ideal religion is founded and spread, not falling into its OTL pitfalls. One could argue that this has been attempted in real life, that at least a solid chunk of historical prophets thought that [[https://xkcd.com/927/][this time]] they'd get it right.

Some would argue that religion itself is fundamentally incompatible with the goals of rationalism and will always be hijacked by bad-faith actors.

I still think it'd be interesting to explore a religion that would maximize the good aspects and minimize the bad ones. The assumption that religion can be good, it's just a matter of designing a sufficiently good one.

It's a challenging prompt, especially if you're not going to completely make it a wank-y/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_space_bats][ASB]] setting. Assuming one wants to go in-depth and realistic, there are a lot of butterflies to consider even with a PoD going back a couple centuries.

I have two main settings so far rolling around in my head:

- Modern alt-history. The ideal religion is born in the late 80s from early internet culture and as the internet grows, it spills out into meatspace, grows rapidly. One issue that comes up is that, even if it seems a bit cynical, any such movement would either by suppressed or co-opted by corporate and state actors whose power would be threatened by a widespread spiritual shift in the same way that Christianization and Islamization disrupted the livelihoods of powerful people in their time.

- Designing the religion first, then the actual setting, perhaps even not even having it take place on Earth at all, designing a setting from scratch. One idea I had was essentially a system of theology, ecclesiology, and ethics that would be built to be universally compatible whether you're evangelizing to bipedal hominids, a planet dominated by a fungal consciousness, big-brained cuttlefish, etc. Still maybe starting the religion around humanoids, having them be the evangelizers.

In both cases the actual details of the religion itself I haven't decided on yet. Assuming I'm doing it from scratch, I'd avoid merely syncretizing or tweaking something that already exists. Obviously it'd be borderline impossible not to borrow /anything/ from a preexisting faith.

So far I'm thinking a henotheistic religion (I have the placeholder name Halqam) whose scripture is basically a compilation of texts that each cater to a specific aspect. One of the books is a Pilgrim's Progress style narrative, except for the views of Halqam. Another is similar to the Old Testament, a mytho-historical account that depicts a dialogue between the Halqam god and their followers. Another talks about ecclesiology in great detail, leaving little to nothing up for future debate if at all possible. Another is essentially a discourse on morality on the scale of individuals. Another is a discourse on ethical governance/foreign policy.

So on and so forth.

The god of Halqam is the chief god, deserving of the highest worship, but emphasis on them not being the strongest god, but rather the one who has humanity's interests best at heart and who is the wisest. Rather than promising a blissful afterlife, Halqam believes in perpetual reincarnation, except there's no way to escape samsara, the world itself isn't something to escape, the goal of spirituality in Halqam isn't liberation, but exploration and sanctification of what exists.

This is my train of thought so far. These kinds of ideas seem applicable to an alternate Muhammad, I even got the name from an Arabic word which refers to a ring of people.

I'm open to hearing thoughts and questions.

*** The idea of founding an uplift religion focused on high utility is an interesting one that I've thought a lot about. There's a line from a poem by Emily Dickinson that I think is really relevant in that context:

=The Truth must dazzle gradually=\\
=Or every man be blind —=

"Truth" has no innate utility, its only value is in the utility that it confers. How useful would enlightenment values be in Judea 2000 years ago, or Arabia 1300 years ago? Not very. They would not be very well received. And if you include it anyway for future use, what's to prevent something like a council of Nicaea from dropping it because they don't like it, or because it makes no sense to a 3rd century fanatic? You can see that enlightenment ideals are not particularly compelling, in that despite leading to(or, more importantly, being attributed to such) the modernization of our society, they have no special hold over people as a whole. It has relevance because of its utility, but is not particularly memetic.

I think one commonality between all successful religions is that they have utility for rulers. Without Constantine and the Roman Empire, Christianity would likely just be another fringe, near-extinct belief like Tengrism, or a cultural relic with marginal influence, like shinto or taoism. Instead they saw its value as a tool and made it a fixture of the state, took the reins so it would not be used against them. Mohamed took that concept and ran with it, to the point where he enshrined his language, his country, and his culture (and even incorporated an existing competitor, the pagans in meccah, and made them a stakeholder!). Actually, Mohamed is the only prophet who had success /within his lifetime/, which is notable.

So Christianity was successful because it was highly transmissible in the lower classes(iirc it was commonly referred to as a "slave cult" by the romans), and was able to exist at the bottom of a hostile power structure and to separate the spiritual from the political. It was explicitly not a revolutionary ideology.

  Luke 20:25 - Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.

  and

  Matthew 5:17 - Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the. prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.
#+end_quote

Islam was successful because it was a near-perfect tool of arab colonization and cultural supremacy. In contrast to Christianity, Islam scripturally incorporated ways of ruling over people of other religions, rather than being ruled by them.

Tengrism is actually a very interesting case study. It was the religion of many highly successful steppe cultures, foremost among them the mongols and the gokturks, but rather than spread their religion at the point of the sword like Islam and Christianity, they themselves converted within one or two generations, time and time again.

A final thought: of all religions, the one most likely to have been invented by a time traveler is probably confucionism. It is above all else supremely pragmatic, making allowances for the fallibility of man and state, and providing advice on how to survive while serving the corrupt and the incompetent. A lot of its precepts still have a lot of utility to this day, like the emphasis on education, which has served east asia well.

The second most likely is Jainism, because it's simultaneously massively impractical and supremely moral.

Most don't even know or can explain what the distinction is. And the Berbers were no joke, they were a prolific people over a prolonged period of time. That's an incredibly successful instance of cultural subsumation, you've got to admire it.

"Alien space bats" ("ASBs") is a neologism for plot devices used in alternate history to mean an implausible point of divergence.

This may be the least believable thing in this post.

Have you /seen/ the sorts of trivialities that can get debated by a serious scholar? Even making a completely inadequate attempt at leaving nothing up to future debate is going to end up requiring a set of books that make your average set of encyclopedias look like merely an afterword...

**** I should rephrase. Talking about ecclesiology in enough detail to minimize the chances of future debate resulting in schism, dissolution, and/or widespread confusion. Not necessarily codifying the specifics of polity or day-to-day operation, but outlining where the church stands in relation to its theology, adherents, non-adherents, and how discrepancies about these issues should be approached.

Making a satisfactory outline would be highly difficult, but at the very least we could avoid the basic questions that have led other faiths to split, such as who is in charge after the signature prophet dies.

*** Make a religion that explicit forbids detailed communication about specific doctrine. The only way to transmit doctrine is a physical recording without verbal communication (ie. A book). The only exception is to inform someone that the physical form of the doctrine is vulnerable to corruption, and thus the reader's judgement in determining what is true is inherently required and considered a "holy duty."

What does the doctrine say? Doesn't matter. You've made careful consideration an act of worship, and promotion of literacy and communication beyond a face-to-face speech religiously significant. Sooner or later someone will interpret these conditions as allowing some degree of editing, and you've got people updating scriptures as time goes on, keeping the promotion of the core religious ideals present as time goes on as the nuance fits the time period.

**** This is a fascinating idea. Of course it leaves a lot to its followers at various points in time, disproportionately gives power over doctrine to those who are the most literate, and over time the faith could split in multiple directions, effectively becoming a category of reflection-based faiths rather than a unifying worldview.

Religion as a system of beliefs is highly sensitive to initial conditions. There was a lot of passionate debate in early Christian history about the exact nature of the Trinity and Jesus.

Even doctrines with superficially minor differences in otherwise identical sects caused significant divergence in other beliefs and practices as time went on due to the larger philosophical implications.

It was founded in the 19th century, and has had a consistent growth rate for the last century. The policies are mostly a grab bag of other religions. But it does seem to make an effort to be multi-ethnic.
