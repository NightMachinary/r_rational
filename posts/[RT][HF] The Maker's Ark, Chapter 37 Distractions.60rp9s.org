** Life on the edge of information overload, and a bit of foreshadowing of the next book.

This is a more 'rationalist' chapter than most, and shows something I think is useful to remember: You don't always have the luxury of knowing which details are important to the particular puzzle you're trying to solve, which are unimportant, and which are important, but to some other problem entirely. Life can happen from all directions.

*** Well, that wasn't worrisome at all.

Nicely done; I got to the end and thought "oooh...I should have realized that." The best evidence of play-fair foreshadowing.

**** Good to know--that's what I'm going for. I like stories with rereadability--especially ones that make readers go 'Whoa. Wait a minute, wasn't there a hint of this back in chapter X?' 8-)

*** 8-) I actually hit the exact 'week of' date this time instead of being late. I aim for every other Tuesday but I don't always succeed, and I'll sometimes put them up on Monday if they are ready early.
