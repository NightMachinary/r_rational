** Hey all! I'm still getting the next act in order, so in the meantime I tried my hand at writing crack and put up some crossover nonsense on fanfiction.net. Let me know if I should make a career of writing crack instead :P

*** A comparison to Unsong? I'll take it!

** More random filler nonsense! This time it's a rationalist parody of Worm, which I wasn't sure if I should add to the fanfic website or not since it doesn't actually involve Naruto.
