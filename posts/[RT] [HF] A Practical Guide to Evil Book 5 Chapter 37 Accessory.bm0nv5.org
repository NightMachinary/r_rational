**** I think this as well. Note that she didn't ask Cat what her trial was, she asked Cat

#+begin_quote
  “What did he offer you, in there?”
#+end_quote

She has no way of knowing the form tbe trial took /unless she was also made an offer by tbe Dead King/.

Cat guessed that would be its form, but given how much Saint was crowing about Cat being wrong, her best guess wouldn't assume Cat was right in her reading of the Dead King.

** This is off topic, but it seems everyone with a name is intimate with stories in general. So intimate that they know how to rig the game in their favor based on common story tropes. If this is the case, and assuming this has been the case if we look at how long the Dead King has been playing the game, wouldn't there be a Name out there trying to actively prevent Named from creating artificial stories?

Is this what the Bard's purpose is?

The stories are by their nature self-containing. Evil villain has ambitions, tries to achieve them, and the story slaps them down with a ragtag group of heroes.

**** I'd use your example actually. A trope is the heroic band of 5 taking down an evil villain. This is obviously no group of heroes. There are some heroes in the group, but they consciously fit themselves into the trope. quite obviously I might add. Now Cat's already getting a boon from Creation for having done so.

If there were this many heroes and villains all fake-playing the game, why wouldn't Creation catch on and create a new story about people trying to game the story system?

***** They're uniting against the biggest bad there is. They can get away by "fake-playing" the game because to do that, they still need to play the game. They may have their own reasons for doing so, but the whole point is that they're teaming up to defeat a great evil which gives them the narrative edge.

****** The could have united as 6 to take down the bad, but the story wouldn't be as big of a boost to them. Instead they fit into he narrative groove of 5 heroes to give themselves an edge. It's this blatant abuse of story tropes that I'm talking about. All the big Named seem to know stories intimately, they consciously change the things they do, say, and think just to get a narrator edge. After a while, this act in of itself because a groove in creation. The Named trying to manipulate the system. My question, is why, after thousands of years of this happening, hasn't this turned into its own meta narrative yet?

******* This makes my head hurt.

I think that, essentially, you can't make a "meta-story" groove because by acting in a specific way, you are enforcing the existing story groove. Choosing five people because the elevator only fits five has the same impact as choosing five people because the sixth would be a narrative hindrance. At the end of the day, you're still choosing a band of five, and that reinforces the trope which makes it so powerful.

******** I'm loving this conversation BTW.

I guess it comes down to Akua's dilemma. Action vs. Intent. Is the action of banding into a group of 5 against a greater evil considered enough? Or is the intent more important. The fact that they truly are putting aside their differences to seek a common goal, and internally, their intent is to work together to take the for down.

Based on what we've seen so far, actions themselves seem to hold more weight. If intent was greater, I'd imagine the Pilgrim would have failed long ago. For his whole scheme was born out of letting thousands die at her hand so he could place the final blows. Not a very heroic thing to do and doesn't seem to hold Narrative weight itself as he was working toward the rule of three.

In this case, there seem to have action and intent on their side, but I'm curious if the Narrative will ever catch on and make a name tied to stopping those cheating the system, like an Intercessor perhaps.

********* Interesting point on the action vs intent.

I think the Rule of Three specifically relies on action over intent to work---after all, Pilgrim's whole plan on defeating Catherine relied on him initially "losing" by relinquishing Black's soul. But if that was the key to long-term victory, wouldn't that nullify the whole ordeal by not being a loss for him?

If thats the case then there is no real difference between service to above and service to below, its just service to different expressions of the same thing, and that the Bard is just there to make sure the game keeps running.

*** I don't think everyone with a Name is intimate with stories, just a few of our primary view points, Cat, Amadeus, Neshamah, Grey Pilgrim, Bard, to a lesser extent Malicia. Looking at the various PoV [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/extra-chapters/][here]], no one really thinks in story beats nearly as much as Cat does. Akua and Hakram comment several times on Cats intuition in that regard being remarkable.

​

Coin, cup, crown; alliteration aside, and whether or not 'bedfellow' should be included aside, how is cup distinct from coin in this context..? (Unless 'cup' is a euphemism here for something very different.)

​

Cat has forgotten that she's already had this reaction ( “So this is what it's like,” I murmured. “Having a story like wind in your sail.” ) in Liesse facing Akua after seizing the pivot (chapter 68): 'I read it in the way she moved, that shifted. How she was going to wield the fire. It only took the slightest of adjustments to let it pass me. Was this how it felt, to have the weight of Creation behind you? How novel.'. Ah, and of course there's her experiences in Arcadia, using stories weightier there against various Fae.
