Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Still kind of churning my wheels on my "rampant plant growth" setting that I think I mentioned here a few weeks ago. I've decided on magical energy to facilitate fast and never-ending growth, combined with a wet environment, and facilitated by exposure to sunlight (as otherwise there would be plants that only subsist on the magic and the ecology would become too alien). Kudzu grows a foot a day, so that's the baseline, applied to bushes, trees, vines, and everything else, so quick that it's a legitimate threat to human civilization.

So, let's talk adaptations.

Adaptation 1:

The trees and vines are constantly growing, but rather than continually cutting them back, they can be braided, sculpted, and directed in order to make walls and barriers, effectively allowing the problem to become its own solution. This still takes time and effort, but can be done without much in the way of cutting implements. It represents people twisting nature to their own goals, men who are cultivators of the wilds.

Adaptation 2:

There are some places that trees and vines will naturally not grow, like large rock outcroppings, places that have exceptionally poor soil, high altitude, deep underground, sufficiently cold climates, or on the water. All of these represent fairly different civilizations, some of which aren't core to the setting itself (e.g. polar climate doesn't look /that/ much different). I do like some of this idea though, that there are people who have built up their own civilizations that are as far away from the plantlife as they can be while still able to have food to eat. It represents a fundamentally skeptical/cautious approach to nature that I think works as a nice counterpoint, men who are not "of the forest".

Adaptation 3:

Rather than sculpting or cutting the land, or going where the plants are not, it might be possible to simply go with the plants, allowing them to shape daily life. These people would be something like nomads, moving and situating themselves almost every day, carrying minimal and light shelters and little equipment. The most evocative of these would probably be people living in tree houses that are elevated with the natural growing to be out of reach of major predators and pests, but I can't actually find any historical examples of full civilizations using tree houses, and I'm not sure the peculiarities of the setting can actually justify them. These would be people that don't do much with nature, neither cultivators, battlers, shunners, or anything else. Limited room for advancement though, and presumably low-tech.

*** I really love this idea. My first thought when I started reading was "that's the kind of ecosystem that would support some awesomely huge creatures". As in, the size of dinosaurs and up. Especially if the magical energy that promotes life made it's way up the food chain. But even if it didn't, you have enough calories to support massive herbivores living in fairly close proximity. And with massive herbivores comes massive carnivores...

My second thought was thinking of the logistics of this ecosystem. You have these extremely dynamic plants that are going to be competing with each other for water, sun and soil. How dependent are they on these things, above and beyond the magical energy? Are you going to have a dense jungle of impassible plants, stacked dozens of meters deep, like a borg cube of plants, extending over the horizon? Would the plants die or go back to normal without the magic?

An interesting way to introduce tension to the setting would be if the magical energy would vary from place to place, so that there would hotspots of plant activity that would shift and threaten cities and nations. There could be massive advantages to being near such a spot(abundant food and resources, maybe even magical resources?), but also big potential threat if the zone expands or shifts, as well as the 'commonplace' natural hazards (eg. huge herbivore migrations, predators hunting outside the zone, plants having to be constantly contained).

I think you could also have a lot of fun with the alternate climates, rather than just saying that stuff doesn't grow out there as much. You could have huge underwater algae, for example, or deserts where cacti grow wild. Out in the cold... I don't really know, but you could always make up a fictitious plant that thrives in the snow or something.

**** I'm not sure how much I'm going to develop it as a setting, but I kind of want to get at least six or seven different biomes down, which will take inspiration from various Earth biomes or plants. It's possible that a sea biome or desert biome might make it into there, but I'm still kind of doing the broad sketches. Oceans, lakes, and seas are a whole different story, with seaweed rafts, floating islands of biomass, and stuff like that, but the setting isn't (yet) /for/ anything, so it's kind of hard to say whether or not they'll get an entry in the worldbuilding doc I'm writing. Regardless, there /are/ places that are inhospitable to plant life, though given the extra boost that plants are getting, there are far fewer places like that than on Earth.

(One of the things I definitely do want is a look at something like mangroves, but I don't think that fast growth actually aids in sediment accumulation, which is how mangroves make new land.)

*** In regards to adaptation 2, a concept I find really interesting is ecological succession. There are types of plants called "pioneer species" that are the first to inhabit areas previously inhospitable to plants. They break down rocks into soil, add nutrients and create conditions favorable for other less hardy plants, and then are outcompeted by the newcomers who are able to utilize the better soil conditions. Add a little bit of magic and I imagine nowhere would be safe from these guys.

*** How about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_garden][Devil's gardens]], clearings in the forest produced by ants that some plant species have "domesticated"?

#+begin_quote
  The ant Myrmelachista schumanni creates devil's gardens by systematically poisoning all plants in the vicinity except D. hirsuta, the tree in which it nests. The ant poisons the plants by injecting formic acid into the base of the leaf. By killing other plants, the ant promotes the growth and reproduction of D. hirsuta, which has hollow stems that provide nest sites for the ants; a single ant colony might have more than 3 million workers and 15,000 queens, and may persist for more than 800 years.[3] Although the ants fend off herbivores, the size of the garden is restricted by leaf destruction increasing as it expands, as the ants are unable to defend the trees beyond a certain point.[4][5]

** Here's a wack idea I've recently thought of. Background reading: [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685590/]].

--------------

Two species (coincidentally) evolve at much the same time to civilization-spawning levels of intelligence. Humans don't exist here. One is a bird derivative, with a small but incredibly dense and fast brain, optimized by evolution for the low weight and fast reflexes needed by avians. The other is cetacean that had a successful runaway mutation that greatly increased brain size, selected for because intelligent behaviours allowed the animals to game their mating ritual and hunt elusive prey better, but did nothing to speed their naturally ponderous brain.

The result is a contradistinction between what might be termed the clever, and the wise.

The avians have simpler language than we do, and struggle with the highly abstract ideas we use to construct our maths and our machines, but their intuition and wit is unparalleled, and they use writing and tools to compensate for their weaknesses. Their society moves quickly, flight hastening the spread of innovation and producing a globally semihomogeneous culture, as the planet quickly fills with their cities.

It's unlikely that such a creature could build an iPhone, but they should be capable of much of our history's less complicated technology. Their ability to fly gives them a different conception of territory and war than we might be used to; governments cannot rule from atop when each member is so freely able to move where it wishes. Citizens cannot be forced into a king's army, walls cannot fortify against immigrants or attackers, ranged weapons are of little use to anyone. Decentralization is the name of the game.

The cetaceans, blessed by a fluke of biology, have minds that can hold books in their heads, reason through the most complex of arguments without a note, visualize contraptions in motion and whole. They speak slowly, with deliberation---they could not follow the rapid pace of the avians' tongues---but what they do say is packed deeply with meaning, nuance, and entropy. They live in groups, each with its own culture, each enclave knowing its own small subset of the many languages and dialects available across the sea.

Their environment and physique are hostile to the development of large structures or written records, so their societies remain small. For sure, they discover and industrialize farming, they clear the waters of their predators, they build caverns and safe havens, but for the most part their lives are rural and philosophical. Left much longer, alone, most likely they would evolve back to the norm, living in the remains of a haven they could never hope themselves to build.

--------------

I'm going to cut my own comments about this short since this is already pretty long, but the question is:

*What happens when these species meet?*

What would a story set in this world, overseeing this discovery, look like? They have so much to offer each other, and so much need for the help. Unlike most such early species interaction, these societies barely even compete, and a war would be incredibly difficult.

*** I think war would be possible and it'd be a one sided affair dominated by the aviens, provided they have the technology to build prosthetic flight aids (think lift assist via balloons, wing extensions, possibly even booster engines) and depth charges. Depth charges are actually pretty simple, and I'd expect a flying species to have an easier time with the hard parts of flying machines than humans did. With those two technologies they can potentially strike any cephalopod community without the cehpalopods having much recourse. However since the aviens don't have the same concept of war we do, they might not think of it, but I'd expect the cephalopods will. So the aviens will likely be negotiating from a position of strength whether they realize it or not.

​

I'd also be curious whether it's an avien submarine, or a cephalopod super-lithos that is the vehicle for first contact. (ok I juts wanted to use that word) Who makes contact with whom could shape a lot of their initial relations however as it will affect what kind of initial mistakes get made and how widely knowledge of them spreads. The Cehpalopods would have a harder time repairing any insult they give against the aviens than vice versa due to speed and range of communication for example. And in both cases there are bariers to the visiting species immediately recognizing the home species as inteligent (the visitors have machinery capable of supporting them in a hostile environment which is a bit of a give away)

**** Cetacean, not cephalopod; dolphin-like, not squid-like. Cephalopod bodies would be much more interesting, but I didn't find any information about their neuron packing density, their brains are so different they don't fit the paper, and I don't think they have the kind of social structures, play, and methods of communication that some cetaceans are known to have.

I don't see the avians inventing powered flight; they're below-human skill at that kind of engineering, and it seems redundant for a bird. Eventually, maybe, but probably much later than first contact would be. Similarly, I don't expect they'd have popularized explosives, since primitive ones aren't very useful in air combat, especially if industrialized war isn't common. Flight might even mean they wouldn't invent advanced metalwork, since it's costly to carry heavy things.

Cetaceans would be a lot easier for first contact; maybe as simple as an adventurous avian setting sail, or a migrating cetacean coming close to a populated shore. The cetaceans would be smart enough to capitalize on the opportunity in full, even if the avians weren't.

***** Whoops, not sure how I misread that.

Though, I might suggest using squids anyway. IMO smart whales are over done and (some) chepalopods are pretty darn smart. Plus I think divers recently found what's basically an octopuses wilderness fort. A bunch of octopi built a giant structure consisting of their individual dens out of debris in a largely open stretch of ocean bottom, presumably for some sort of mutual defence benefit since they're usually solitary creatures.

​

Anyway about artificial flight aids.

I'm talking about a whole range of technologies that would run the species equivalent gambit from shoes to cars. I honestly would not rate a species as sapient if they spend all their time flying and never consider that maybe they could rig up something they could wear to change their aerodynamics for the better. And they could start with something as simple as harvesting feathers from non-inteligent avians they hunt that have different wing shapes and tying them together finding out which shapes are helpful by trial and error (should be a stone age technology for them). I'd also expect them to figure out hot air balloons if they have fire and canvas/paper, since a flying species should consider being able to make things neutrally buoyant in air for easy towing super useful, especially if their solution to conflict is to move away.

****** I'm not against cephalopods, they just seemed somewhat less plausible. Either is fine in the sense that you can write a story about it.

The avians are smart enough for flight aids, but evolution already made pretty effective birds so it's not clear how much improvement could be made by pre-industrial society. Farming feathers sounds practical, hot air balloons maybe not---in our world those were only invented in 1783, by a more educated mind than the avians are likely to have. A practical balloon needs a better heat source than a wood fire; we had floating lanterns long before we could fly in them. Their woodwork would be pretty good though, so I agree you would expect some technologies to be well ahead of the era.

******* The main advantage to flight aids would be that wing shapes are always a compromise among multiple competing advantages.

Evolution will have equipped the aviens with only one local maxima, useful in the environment they evolved. As they spread they'll find environments where otehr wing shapes would perform better (high cliffs with abundant thermals favoring wings optimized for soaring, vs flat open plane favoring wings optimized for generating lift by flapping, vs dense forrest favoring wings good for rapid maneuvering and diving, etc.) technology would allow them to adapt to these environments faster than evolution can. For a human equivalent see how in spite of having one of the better thermal management systems for the savanna of Africa we still invented clothes and came to rely on them as we migrated to otehr climates.

As to using human progress with aviation as a model for a flying species, I think that's fundamentally flawed. A flying species probably understands flight the way humans understand ballistics (having a rather good intuitive grasp of it even if they can't do the math, and probably not even realizing how complex the problem they solve every day actually is). So I'd look to out use of thrown/launched tools and compare based on similar construction methods to get a timeline for what a flying species does with flight technology.

********* It really depends. the fact that they can fly without the machine really changes things, as it means simpler machines that do one thing become more viable.

Mostly I'm imagining wing-gloves that add some weight in exchange for a change to your wing/tail surface area/shape, but you only ware them when it's worth it, gliders that only get used in environments conducive to gliders, and rarely something like a rocket booster to assist with getting heavier loads (like a glider) off the ground or to (briefly) make up for the speed shot-fall against other flying creatures.

I do however think they'd get balloons working. They'd have a lot of motivation to do so as it's be their equivalent of a hand cart, and finding an adequate fuel source is more a matter of access to resources than anything else. They probably need some metalworking to get really good balloons working but it's probably closer to bronze age tech than industrial revolution tech if you have a real economic motivator for needing to lift more than an armload of stuff into the air.

********** What are you envisioning these balloons to be made of and powered by?

Large, cheap, strong, and thin fabric sheets are hard to imagine without sowing machines, which are complex enough I'd say the avians wouldn't invent, and their lack of clothing culture (clothes are weight) would reduce the demand.

Coal seems to require a mining culture. So does oil. These seem much more likely to be popular in metalworking societies. Without ground transport most of the value of those resources goes away, too, and the avians aren't likely to have horses.

I'm not a textiles expert but I'm pretty sure you only need a loom and a spinning wheel to make textiles. Sewing machines are indesensible labor saving devices but their absence can be overcome with more labor or more time. Baloons being expensive isn't at odds with them being important.

​

For fuel, whatever is abundant of: charcoal, rubber, whale (possible conflict point) or otehr animal oil, tar, alcohol or vegetable oil. And again as the demand for better balloons drives their technology eventually coal and natural gas, or petrolium products mined specifically for building balloons.

​

Also I do think they'd develop clothing culture they'd just develop different clothing culture. Clothes are wight, but they're also useful. In particular it's a lot easier to put on an elaborate tail-dress when you go courting and take it off when you go hunting than it is to drag a peacock tail around with you all the time. Especially if they're using the flight aids I sugested which are practical sort of clothing, then the jump to decorative clothing that catches they eye of the otehr sex is a small one, and it doesn't take many genrations to start getting fashion trends as young people try to differentiate themselves form their peers and parents to get laid.

First of all, is this is a bad thing?

Second of all, how can I spice it up? I can interrupt with the POV's characters thoughts, but sometimes those thoughts are already just the things they say in conversation. I can write the other character's reactions and describe their body language, but I don't think I'm very good at describing body language. (Guess I should get better?)

I can set the scene somewhere interesting, which helps a bit, but after the introduction, there's not much else to say about it. I can have the characters doing some action and have the dialogue interrupted by descriptions of that action, but this often seems irrelevant to the conversation and adds extra noise. And sometimes, the characters are necessarily just in a boring meeting room anyway.

** I feel like this must be done before but how would you expect a litrpg setting to be different than a normal fantasy setting? I'll provide a ruleset here to have a world build by but if you have comments or thoughts that would apply to a different framework feel free to share those too.

1. People have classes and can only gain experience by killing enemies and by completing dungeons. Experience received depends on both the level of the killer(s) and the relative level difference but not on on the relative danger. People do not gain experience by training or doing classes related stuff unless it's killing or dungeon crawling.
2. Experience is split between those who were involved in the kill. The effort involved in killing the monster does not matter but there's a minimum threshold of doing at least one point of damage, one debuff or giving one buff to someone who does one point of damage. If multiple people of different levels participate in the kill, the lowest level members gains the least experience. This difference increases as the level gap increases such that when there is a large level gap the lowest level member gains basicly nothing.
3. It takes roughly 30 solokills of equal level to achieve next level. The power of classes scales superlinearly with class level.\\
4. Optional: Assume that ability scores and skills can be trained independently of class level but that it takes X weeks to raise a stat/skill from X-1 to X, i.e. it takes 3 weeks to raise a skill from lvl 2 to lvl 3.

*** Assuming that permadeath applies, the biggest factor is probably risk minimization. That is to say, people will be optimizing for the fastest *safe* way to level. This probably means doing things as a slow, boring grind with one overleveled party member doing the brunt of the work while low level hangers on sit back and apply ineffective buffs, ineffective debuffs, etc. Fights are also probably as lopsided as possible, with as many cheesy strategies as possible, e.g. monster farms where kills can be accomplished with zero risk whatsoever, heavily fortified chokepoints constructed by extremely high level characters who won't be counted as killers, borrowed/rented equipment that trivializes things, etc. If not all level N monsters are created equal, only the weakest or most easily trivialized monsters of level N will ever be fought.

(What you /don't/ get, unless there's a ton of work put into it, is people actually fighting for their lives in a dungeon.)

On a social level, you probably have a world that's dominated by a few people with a really high level, unless there's a level cap or level scaling is skewed such that reaching level N is effectively impossible for anyone (which doesn't appear to be the case per the rules). Depending on the specifics of leveling and the powers of the classes, you would expect either authoritarian rulers who each have dominion over some area and authoritarian underlings to manage smaller territorial units, or a grand unified empire controlled by the powerful with controls in place to prevent/screen people from ascending to their level.

Some classes are likely to be better than others for mundane use, and those are likely to be the most popular ones, but it depends on the specifics of which class can do what, how long buffs last, etc., all of which would need some definition (and probably iterative development, if you wanted to make a non-degenerate setting, or an interesting degenerate one).

**** If the cheese is good (and it probably will be), you might not find so skew a distribution of levels. Early levels will be easy because infrastructure can cope with low level monsters, so people will be killing well above their skill level and powering through the rankings.

The trope is normally that higher level monsters are less rote, more prone to unexpected variability, and much harder to contain, which combined with the sparsity of even-higher-level people means a lot more effort is needed to tackle those areas safely.

This only happens when there's moderate superlinearity, eg. n^{k} rather than k^{n}, since exponentials have a tendency to explode. If the industrial course gets you to level 100 (from, say, ~1k kills) in a standard education, high level ‘hero' types might only get to 300 in their lifetime from a full ~10k solokills, each requiring significant planning to do safely, and probably more since solokills are unsafe. x^{3} scaling would only make such people a factor 30 stronger than than the standard individual, for significantly more than 30x the investment.

The most value these elites would have would then probably just be power-levelling a bunch of people to level 200, and the cycle repeats again until the average person ends up leaving the system not because it's not able to power level them up, but simply that the reward isn't worth the time investment. The highest level characters are mostly determined by how long they've been grinding the ladder, and which of them are rich enough not to need to spend their time supervising people climbing the ladder below them.

For reference the meat industry puts a lot of strain to our environment despite the average meat eater only eats 70 big animals(pigs and bigger) during their entire lifetime. You have to go really nuts if you need 10k kills of equal lvl.

This does leave the question of how they're replenished, though. (Also, if people/humans aren't spawning they might evolve.) Do they come back (resurrection) or is it like cloning? (Can monsters have children?) Evolution doesn't strictly require sex, something like cloning would work as well. (With the caveats that 1) exact cloning might miss out on mutation, and 2) if you have the genetic materials, then you could bring back whatever you wanted, allowing for artificial selection, or just creating the same group over and over again. (Which could vary if your copying process wasn't perfect, and especially if you threw away the old stuff.))

Resurrection takes things in a different direction - what if monsters learn?

******** I don't think you can assume genetics and evolution because the level system makes no sense as an evolutionary target, nor is there an obvious ‘natural' magic that would seem to allow levelling to evolve sanely. It's easiest just to throw that whole framework away.

As to how monsters get replenished, I'd have just said they were spawned by ambient dungeon magic, because that's how games work.

Things get fucky if farmed monsters are human-tier smart even without respawns, and if they're not that smart it doesn't matter if they learn because they aren't smart enough to do anything about it.

It (genetics) affects, say, your starting base stats. (Provided that humans are still the result of sex, and not spawning, or being brought from another world.

Imagine Groundhog Day. They don't have to be /very/ smart. But they're learning from death. If they don't get it the first time, or the second, they will still be there the hundredth time. Knowing how to make fire isn't necessary to learn that sticking your hand into it hurts.

*********** The level systems we have in the real world evolved naturally.

Humans are a product of evolution, so in the same way a spider's web 'evolved' so do our games. Additionally wargames exist in a competitive environment with selective pressure driving their changes over time, and war games produced role playing games (speciation event) which is where these level systems used as a model for gamelit come from. Then adapting roleplaying games to computers got us MMOs (another speciation event), which were successful enough to be noticed by business and that brought gamification as motivation for actions in real life, and now China has a Social credit "level system" applying points gained from actions to an overall score affecting the real world.

​

If the magic to make level systems real existed we'd probably be a handful of decades away from a gmelit world ourselves right now assuming the magic din't derail our enter history (which admittedly it totally would have).

************ Levels existing in games and levels existing in physics are only nominally similar things.

Humans being handed ‘magic to make level systems' is a very different scenario, too, since you're positing an atomic magic that then would be implemented by intelligent minds, not evolution. Even if there is such a level system magic, /and/ it was something that evolution could find, /and/ it was well-specified and atomic (so evolution would optimize for it, rather than the underlying system), it would result in something completely different to humans.

************ I find this funny because in Latias' Journey by Ri2 (not rational but a still pretty good fanfic which I grew up reading as a teenager), one of the villains was Mewgle, who was an AI that looked kind of like a cross between Moogle and a demonic clown version of Mew. And Mewgle's goal was to trap all the other villains and heroes, including the Big Bad and the Big Good, in an mmorpg world of his own creation.

I will also note that game mechanics and stats are meant to be simpler easier to understand and track versions of real world phenomenon. And when something is simpler, easier to understand and easier to track, it's also easier to control. Perhaps a *sufficiently* power hungry authoritarian government *would* turn literally every part of life under their rule into something like an rpg. Maybe the only reasons this hasn't happened yet is because we haven't had any authoritarian rulers with sufficient power and power-hungriness to do so.

#+begin_quote
  This probably means doing things as a slow, boring grind with one overleveled party member doing the brunt of the work while low level hangers on sit back and apply ineffective buffs, ineffective debuffs, etc. Fights are also probably as lopsided as possible, with as many cheesy strategies as possible, e.g. monster farms where kills can be accomplished with zero risk whatsoever, heavily fortified chokepoints constructed by extremely high level characters who won't be counted as killers, borrowed/rented equipment that trivializes things, etc. If not all level N monsters are created equal, only the weakest or most easily trivialized monsters of level N will ever be fought.

**** Thanks for the detailed responds. Those are great thoughts.

There's no hard cap but per the rules but you would have to kill some number of equal level opponent(or the equivalent) which given that (A) the level curve will heavily skewed towards the lower levels[unless people really go to town with the monsters] and (B) that's a ton of beings to kill, I would expect there to be a soft cap. Perhaps a sufficiently high lvl dictator would train people up to her lvl[by having them kill people in a way that maximizes XP gain] to kill them for XP but that carries it's own risk[ and could make for it's own story].

Edit: Assuming no way of increasing longevity this soft cap would turn into a quasi hard cap. The few high level people would be busy building legacy and avoiding being killed by the other high level people, and thus would lack the time to continue the grind.

In a way that could potentially decentivize people from leveling since they would then be worth less XP and thus the grinders are less likely to go after them.

You mentioned the degenerate in your other post as well. What do you see as the degenerate conclusion?

*** Depending on how long buffs last, you might have career adventurers auctioning off the right to cast buffs on them before they leave town and go adventuring, to get a share of the XP. That could even evolve into a form of prediction market that predicts how successful their quest will be.

Since the XP doesn't depend on the danger, I'd expect to see adventurers seek out as many options to trivialise encounters as possible. For example, standard practice might include smoking out or flooding dungeons and to never engage melee-only enemies up close if at all possible. Perhaps this would lead to more specialisation in terms of roles, for example archers who refuses to take jobs where the enemies can used ranged attacks or fly, or tanks who only fight enemies who they're certain can't get through their defences. With that in mind, the most important role might shift towards scouting out the enemy, to ensure that the appropriate specialists are sent to the right locations.

2. A toddler being allowed to get the last hit on a bound monster, being told to invest in intelligence, and now having adult-like intelligence. Thus allowing said toddler to start the level grind way before their peers.
3. Psychotic serial killers being very high level and protective personal(guards/police) finding solutions to handle such high level individuals without relying on adventurers, either with ethical or less ethical means. Possibly being rewarded with the honor of killing a caught criminal for the XP.

** Imagine a world where Everyone has the same sense of humour.

Like, it's not that people /Generally/ find the same kind of thing funny, or usually agree whether a joke is good or bad. It's not some kind of cultural enforcement or mind control.

No, for completely natural reasons, Literally /Everyone/ has the same sense of humour, with visible deviations constituting maybe, say, a quarter of a percent of the population. Genetics, Nurture, and- as long as they understand the underlying context even vaguely- culture? They play no role. Thinking of a funny joke is like winning the lottery. And it makes you famous. Comedians are simultaneously revered for their universal appeal, and the hardest job in the world to succeed in. Oh, it used to be that you could be a good- on a local level- comedian just by being able to execute already well-known jokes which involve physical difficulties, but the rise of video put an end to that. Now being a Comedian requires a highly gifted mind and fast iteration time- or a large joke-research company backing you. It is whispered in dark corners of the world that the governments have all searched for their best jokes, and have them at the ready to distract enemy soldiers in wars.

Political parties still exist, for all an insult to either side amuses all members of the world. Advanced teams search for political jokes, which support their ideology. This is the best form of propaganda. Find a joke with inherent political implications, and fame and money are not your limit. you could lead a company- decide policy on the world scale, by releasing or refusing to do so.

[Vague story idea stub thing. is it good? bad? interesting? It probably wouldn't be easy to write a story about it- to be unique the jokes have to be centre stage, but I'm not sure what one would write about in such a case. But i thought it was an interesting idea, at least.]

** *Relativity*

Anyone up on their equations for relativistic acceleration?

Assuming that you have a craft of a constant 10,000 tons, and an engine that exerts a constant force of around 890 meganewtons (ie, a felt acceleration of 10 gravities), which equations do I use to find out how much objective time it takes to accelerate up to .9c, or .99c, or the like? (I'm pretty sure that it's more than just multiplying the subjective duration by the final speed's Lorentz factor, but I'm having trouble finding an intro to special relativity that doesn't shove the whole four-dimensional mess of calculus and matrices at the reader all at once.)
