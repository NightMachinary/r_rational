For the past 6 months, I've been writing a rational!Danganronpa fic(I've posted it here and received mixed responses) and I've hit a bit of a dilemma. Looking back at my first arc or so, I can see why people didn't enjoy it much: it's rushed, stilted, the trial's too clean and simple, and its all in all just not that good. However, my writing(at least to me) has improved markedly. Should I take time out from updating to go back over and repost an improved first arc, or should I finish out the arc I'm currently writing before I do so?


** It depends.

Understanding why something isn't as good as it could be and then fixing it is a crucial skill for a writer - one that a lot of people, especially those that post online, never pick up (understandably, because it's often boring). I'd suggest doing an edit or rewrite just for that alone.

It's not the best thing to do if you want an increased readership - you might lose some of the people currently paying attention, and a relaunch doesn't tend to be that great for any creative endeavor, but this is variable on how much improvement you think that you can do.

*** Rather than a full relaunch, I was planning to just repost the updated version chapter by chapter on FFN on the old story, perhaps interweaving the revisions with updates to avoid losing readers--would that ameliorate the latter?

**** That would probably work. As [[/u/rineSample]] says, there is a trap of endless revision that you don't want to get into, so just be aware of that.

** What are your goals? Are you asking what we want as readers or what you should do to be a better writer?

(As a reader, I typically don't actually read re-writes, even of stories I enjoy, unless I was gonna read it twice anyway and re-reading/re-watching meida isn't really ever a thing I ever do as an adult. As a writer, re-writing and refining past work sounds like the sort of thing which is vaguely skill-upgrading, I think?)

** Finish your current arc. For some writers, what can happen is that they get stuck in an endless loop of revisions, and write nothing new for their work.

*** Seconding that (personal experience as well.)

These days, at most, I would leave an author's note on the top of the first chapter, with an "if you don't like the first few chapters, don't worry, it's not all this bad!" (sort of like HPMOR's "people say it picks up in Chapter 5.")

Or, if you're feeling particularly petulant toward your past self, maybe you could consider writing a little /outline/ for the revisions you'd like to make, and linking your readers to that. Sort of hanging a lampshade on all the problems to prove to your new readers that you're now the sort of writer who would recognize them---even if you haven't had time to do anything about them just yet.

** Can you fix it within a reasonably short time period? Say, a week at your current rate? Then go for it. Otherwise, I'd skip it and take the lessons on to the next arcs and next projects.

** What would definitely not be a waste is rewriting the first two chapters to your skill's maximum, to get readers.

Beyond that, only revise if you have significant plot changes to make; just repainting prose is drudgelike, and a training story isn't worth that boredom for. Plus, presumably when you finish your next arc you'll be even better?
