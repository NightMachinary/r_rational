You are given a magical golden coin. This coin has a range of 3 meters, within which probability functions exactly as the people inside the range would expect it to.

Let's expand on this idea a bit. The probability of a given event occurring within the range of the coin is the average of the probabilities of said event occurring as provided by the expectations of the people within the range. The natural most probable outcome counts as a single additional person towards this calculation.

If three people are within range, and one of them assigns a 100% probability to a house of cards falling down in the next minute, and the two others assign 50% probability, and the actual chance is 100%, there will be a 75% chance of the cards dropping in the next minute.

The coin can only influence events within the three meter range. It also can only influence probability, not physics. Even if you find someone who's willing to believe 100% that you're a god the coin won't make you 33% god, because it can't.

The question is this: How do you utilize the coin once you acquire it? Do you go to Vegas and hire a hypnotist to brainwash you into winning slot machines 6 times out of 10?

** What /doesn't/ the coin know, that it has probabilities that you call the actual chance?

For example, let's say that I have a coin-flipping program on my computer run by a pseudorandom number generator (like a lot of computer programs are). When I look at the screen and click the button, I predict a 50% chance of heads and a 50% chance of tails. When a competent computer programmer looks at the code and current state of the computer, they can have (theoretically) 100% confidence of the outcome.

Me (50% heads), the programmer (0% heads), and the coin (???) are next to the computer. What is the true probability?

Or perhaps a better example: Someone flips a coin onto a table, sees that it landed on heads, then covers it with his hand. I open my eyes and predict a 50% chance that it will be heads when he takes his hand away, he predicts a 100% chance, and the coin (presumably) predicts a 100% chance of heads. Would that make a 83% chance of it still being heads when he takes his hand away?

Edit to add: Who gets to ask the questions? In my last example "what will be facing up when he takes his hand away?" returns different behavior than "will the coin flip itself while under his hand?"

*** For the purposes of the actual chance, the coin is omniscient. There would be a 0% chance on the computer test because there's no real chance of the computer changing its algorithm without being told to. The coin can't rewrite the computer any more than it can rewrite reality. The coin on the table would always be heads because the coin is already objectively on heads with nothing that could reasonably change that. Only probability is influenced, not possibility.

It can't change the outcome of a coin on the table (it is already heads or tails), but I can't see how it could change the outcome of a coin in the air (it already has a certain momentum, position, etc.) without rewriting reality. The same reasoning goes for a coin before someone flips it. Their neurons, muscles, and all the rest are already in certain positions, which will 100% result in the same outcome given the same inputs.

What if someone's probabilities are not only wrong, but /incoherent/? For example, there's a basket with 10 red, 10 white, and 10 green balls in it. When asked, someone thinks there's a 50% chance he will grab a red ball (either it happens or it doesn't), a 50% chance he will grab a white ball (...) and a 50% chance he will grab a green ball (...).

The same idea works with a lot of biases, such as rating the likelihood of something being "shiny and red" as more probable than "red" (whether or not it is shiny).

How does the coin deal with probabilities that are not only wrong, but incoherent as well? I can't remember the name, but there's a bias where adding details to a description makes people see it as more plausible than simpler descriptions that strictly contain them. (eg. people rate "finding a shiny red ball" as more likely than "finding a red ball" (whether it is shiny or not) and also more likely than "finding a ball" (no matter the color, or if it is shiny))

You can keep saying this, but it doesn't change the fact that many of the hypotheticals you are giving are situations not where something is truly random (which might happen in a quantum superposition collapse scenario ala Schrodinger's Cat) but simply a situation where people have insufficient information.

Let me give you an example. I stand outside your 3 meter bubble. We do 400 consecutive experiments with a house of cards. To control, we run a seminar before hand which convinces people that the house is 33% likely to collapse in each situation. In each example, the coin is on the table and the person (only one in range) is told to stand in front of the table.

I then use a 3.1 meter pole or similar to push over the table.

This happens every time. But it happens in a closed room, and the person is not allowed to communicate with any other test subjects.

This experiment I have laid out is deterministic. My stick will make the house (and the table) collapse 100% of the time unless I take a heart attack.

But the only person there in range of the coin thinks it is 33% of the time, and the coin changes the 'possibility' to be that much. Does that mean my heart randomly shuts down, as it could at any moment with varying low possibility? If it does, then it is picking futures with such low probability (while still being physically possible) that it effectively is changing reality, and is therefore useful.

If it doesn't, then it doesn't really work for anything useful, because studying it to examine the true probability, or forcing it to modify a known quantity makes it fail. So it's useless.

Also my stick example works in /every/ case of non-quantum phenomena, because the 3.1m stick is a sufficient knowledge of physics and the area around the coin to accurately model its path.

Even if you believe the universe is not deterministic, specific physical events are absolutely provably deterministic.

Shit always falls here at 9.1m/s^{2} , and an estimate that relied on something happening otherwise would either be 100% likely to fail even if the person watching it believed otherwise, or necessarily modifying the laws of reality.

Anything else relies on a woo misinterpretation of what is meant by 'observer' in quantum mechanics.

The table would always fall because even if you did have a chance at a heart attack, you would be outside its range. If you were inside the range then you would have an 11% chance of failing to flip the table, due to either heart attack or any number of other truly random things.

You still can't do any of that because you'd have to have enough people within a three meter radius convinced that you could do that, including yourself, as to offset the actual chance in the average. Even if you tell someone you're a god and they believe you 30%, you know the chance is 0% and so does the universe, so the final odds of you being a god would be only one in ten.

Anyway, people tend to doubt the probability of things that they view as physically impossible. Good luck trying to find someone who honestly believes that there's a 30% chance of you being a real world god, even when you can't show any power to back up the claim.

** I assume you are trying to say that the coin can only alter the probability of plausible outcomes, not add additional outcomes that are implausible.

In other words, if you go to a casino, you aren't going to be able to use the coin to make tarot cards show up in a standard deck, but despite altering physics, your coin can make different cards appear in different orders to give you good hands.

It stands to reason that you are going to need an irrational person to work with you to have any benefit. A rational person will probably not be very useful, unless they are legitimately ignorant about the events you are trying to influence. It's somewhat likely that a rational person will puzzle out more realistic odds than an irrational person though, making them less useful.

This generates a situation where it's most rational to work with an irrational person.

Recruit a gambling addict and start buying high dollar scratchoff lottery tickets. Gambling addicts are gambling addicts because they think they can win. The more they win with you, the more they think they will win. With scratch off cards, even if you know the odds, the gambler doesn't. Not really. So you know the chance is somewhere around zero, the reality is somewhere around zero, but in the gambler's mind, it's much, much higher than that. Average of zero + zero + ludicrous probability = ludicrous probability.

EDIT - After you prove to yourself that the coin works, the odds of winning would jump significantly, because your expectation of winning would go up.

ANOTHER EDIT - You can reinforce your gambling partner's dependence on you by simply letting them see what happens when you (and your coin) walk away from them. YOU know this will work. Once they see that their chances of winning drop when you aren't there, they will lock into you as their luck. That's when you go to Vegas and sit at high dollar slots. Be nice though, set them up a trust fund after you both have enough to retire, because they are never going to stop after you do this to them. You're probably going to have to fake your own death or something to get them to leave you alone.

And indeed, as the limit approaches 100% asymptotically, I find my power waxing without limit.

** As the others have mentioned, it mostly depends on what exactly you can influence and how. For example, if you blindly throw a bunch of cards and have them rearrange themselves into a stack as shown here: [[http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/comics/00000383.jpg]] ? Or would each card falling down count as a different incident and have to succeed separately?

If you write a program that actually just spews out pseudo-random gibberish at the press of a button, but manage to convince someone that the dummy interface lets you input an account name and the output will be the password corresponding to the account, would the program give you actual passwords?

How about influencing things that are outside the 3m range? If you throw a dice and expect it land on a 6, but dice rolls far away, will the coin work? The dice got all its velocity and such within the circle after all, so it could work. Similarly, if you play in a casino in Vegas which is more than 3m across, how much does the coin work then? How about lottery tickets? If you get a ticket, will that ticket have a higher chance to be the right one?

In any case, I'd learn a single neat trick, or cheat at a game, to convince someone that I can do certain things. Then I'd use that to convince them that I have learned, for example, to always roll the number I want on a dice. Once a few of these things are set up, I will expand to ever more difficult and unlikely events. Then

The 3m radius can be used to convince people outside the radius of what you can do without their scepticism influencing the result.
