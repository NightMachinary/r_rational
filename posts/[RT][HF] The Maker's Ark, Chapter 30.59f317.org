**** No, I have not. I try to avoid most current events in the Fall universe (it's set in 2013 in an alternate universe). There was an economic crash in 2008, though.

The ABMs around Moscow have been around for a /long/ time, and how exactly one might get fired at Black Swan will be in a future chapter.

** Fun to revisit the verse, although I wish it had been a bit longer. Not much happened, and I didn't feel like there was any advancement to plot or significant character impact.

*** I sympathize--pacing is a tradeoff when a novel is serialized a chapter at a time. When it's complete, readers won't have to wait two weeks to turn the page and find out what happens next 8-)

**** Ill take the slow pace anyday. I did a full re-listen back when the spear was mentioned and while I wasn't paying attention to pacing I found it thoroughly enjoyable.

Obligatory reminder I am waiting for an edition I can spend dollar votes on and while rare I'm pretty sure there are others like me. Bonus if you can get it in audio-book, even How to succeed in evil's authors works aren't that cheap as an audio-book but some of us buy them to not have the intro and outre music every 20 minutes.

***** Fall is currently being edited, and an ebook version will be my first focus. I would like to do an audiobook version at some point (I got my start in oral storytelling), but will have to see about the logistics.
