** I'm co-writing this quest whith dwood .

Years ago, you worked for Rocket Laboratories, on a team responsible for the cloning efforts to recreate the thought-to-be-extinct Mew. While on those teams your daughter became terminally ill. In your desperation, you were allowed to use the most advanced medical imaging technology of the time to create a full scan of her. Using her DNA, you had hoped to clone her body and bring her back to the land of the living.

Unfortunately, Mewtwo destroyed the whole lab, and set yourself and all of humanity back a full decade. Branded, and associated with morally gray research, no university or research lab in Kanto would accept your work, so you turned elsewhere, places where your name was less known. Application after application for new research position denied, you had nearly given up, when a letter arrived in the mail.

Second vote: Help Matthew run as much additional analysis on the human profiles as there is time for. A half hour before lunch interact with the Pokemon with Ashley and get them into a compliant state of mind

Third vote: Jez and Ryan run the expansion. Matt and I continue on the human profiles. Adjust the process on each Pokemon based on the new information from Jez and Ryan's experience, and from Matt's and my new insights. Enlist help from the IT guy and Skylar for the longer processes. Ryan and Jez work split shifts those days to ensure they are available for the start and end of the process.

Fourth vote: The numbers don't add up. 2 assistants can get paid but I have 3. 6 Pokemon chosen for expansion but I have 7. Rotom knows 5 moves instead of 4. What gives?
