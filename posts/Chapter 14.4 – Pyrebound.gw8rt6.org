** I want to thank the author for this chapter. It made me feel things. A mix of melancholy and hope.

*** Holy cow, that was quick. I was planning to leave the news to somebody else, since it's not really advancing the main plot and it's been a month coming. So I felt a bit awkward about putting myself forward with this. But it took a month because I started it five times, only to delete and start over. Hopefully the next update will be quicker coming.

All of which is to say, "you're welcome."

**** Haha, I've got your rss feed set up so I get notifications. I've been looking forward to an update, so I was excited to post it. I wouldn't be worried about not advancing the plot: character development is still development!

** What a terrible situation these people find themselves in. How very realistic for young parents.

Rams done a lot of growing in the past chapters. He's made a lot of progress. I can only hope that he is a good priest for his people, who uses his power to lift up his people.
