Seeing how Methods has ended, we might as well do another HP munchkin thread. This time there's a specific goal: become a god. Assume that you are already the undisputed god-emperor of humanity and wizards (not that one) via fidelius, felix felix, grey goo imperius, or any other the many other options available to you.

EDIT: your goal is to achieve omnipotence or the closest possible approximation. The world is not enough.


** The problem with this kind of thing is that canon HP mechanics were more or less pulled out of Rowling's ass as she needed them. They're not really complete, explained, or consistent.

In order to really, properly cease being 'mortal' you need to step outside the confines of canon magic lore and start making things up.

*** 1: Drink Felix

2: Make more Felix while Felixed

3: Acquire currency to buy more Felix ingredients

4: Once your Felix supply is secured, study magic and science as much as possible, with Felix on.

5: Begin experimenting under Felix

6: Continue experimenting until you ascend to godhood.

Preferably within a short amount of time, as using too much or for too long is really bad. Do not use Felix unless necessary or during one of the steps.

** Create a bunch of portraits of myself in this situation, creating a bunch of portraits. Then paint in something that gives them godlike powers within the world of the portraits. (Probably wouldn't work.)

I could probably set up a time-turner-based arbitrary answer machine using some sort of minions that couldn't be scared out of it. But ... precommitting to an action that would almost certainly cause a paradox seems like a Bad Idea if the universe timelessly prevents paradoxes from happening.

Can't hurt to look into whether you can pull off an intelligence explosion with wit-sharpening potions or /felix felicis/ or whatever, but I doubt you can - the mechanics of them are unclear, but it hasn't happened /yet/, so ...

Use magic to fork my consciousness - could use a Horcrux, if I have to, too lazy to figure out an easier way here - and use the various mind-affecting magics to turn one of them into a much better person. (Actually, assuming I'm not a psychopath, might be a good idea to do that to myself anyway to be a better God-Emperor to my subjects?) Chuck good!me through the Veil to whatever afterlife awaits.

Re-authorize long-term timetravel research (banned according to Pottermore because they're afraid of changing the past after There Was An Incident, but I just want to /see/ the past, pretty much) and find the Source of Magic, or whatever it is that created magical creatures. Copy that.

Check if Boggarts can create super-powerful magic if that's what you're afraid of - boggart!Dementors have fear auras, so maybe? But Lupin implied a boggart!Dementor was less powerful, so probably not.

The rules for magic-item creation are unclear, but they seem to be capable of pretty much the same things as regular magic (Room of Requirement can't create food, Fred and George made shield-charm hats.) So ... "only" teleportation, matter transmutation, and time travel. Oh, and mind control and creating servitors immortality and telekinesis and all sorts of magical sensors and... enough Moody-style cyborging up, with magitech created by mind-controlled Fred-and-George equivelents, and you're basically a god.

** Grindelwald was invulnerable because of a series of blood sacrifices while he fought Dumbledore. See if you can set up the same protection for yourself 24/7 at minimal cost, either by distributing it over 7 billion people, or else some sort of specialized spell engine (maybe transfigure a p-zombie person, then sacrifice it every minute?)

Horcruxes are a bad idea, but may be necessary. Each one splits your soul in half, so 2 gives you 1/4 of a soul, 3 gives you 1/8 and so on until 7 gives you 1/128 of a soul left. Souls are presumably good for something, so you may want to keep yours intact.

** 1) Brew Felix Felicis

2) Drink Felix Felicis

3) Use luck to create more Felix Felicis then your first brew.

4) Drink Felix Felicis, bottle the remainder.

5) Repeat from step 1. Soon you have infinite luck.

I don't know about how to get from infinite luck to omnipotence, but if it's possible I'm pretty sure grinding the hell out of your luck is the first step.

** I'm going to reference something [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] once said and answer in one word: /Aguamenti/.

I mean, Ravenclaw's Diadem will speed things up, but it's not strictly necessary. Though I suppose... I wonder if there's a spell that grants finite-time evaluation of a completed infinity... That's probably under DO NOT MESS WITH TIME, but it would grant access to much neater tricks than almost anything else ever.

And there's one magic trick I'll really have to try, just to completely fuck with the whole world. Transfiguring metric space to go non-Euclidean is basically just messing with gravity, which shouldn't be too hard since I'll know exactly how broomsticks and Hovering Charms do it. From there it's just a bit of ballistics.

The idea is that violating the conservation principles of mass and negentropy is really the only thing I actually needed /on top of things I can already do in real life/.

Likewise, "finite-time evaluation of a completed infinity", if you've been reading through GEB, should at least hint at being /so/ magical it violates /logic/ and grants omniscience in a puff of anti-logic.

****** Well, the laws of physics form a self-consistent whole, as far as we can tell from the universe not /showing us/ flagrant violations of logic, so if I can violate one thing that's normally a law, I can Munchkin it into violating any law I need to violate. And those are really the two /hard/ ones, that ones that put an upper limit on the hopes of any living creature, so those are the ones I'd want to be able to violate. Those, and, of course, the limitary laws of computation and information.
