** Aladdin and his Wonderful Lantern: Jafar obtained the lamp from Aladdin according to plan, and became Sultan largely unopposed. However, while trapped in the Cave of Wonders, Aladdin finds an Orange Lantern Power Ring. Cue increasingly insane Lantern vs genie-empowered dictator.

*** In the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin][original story]] Aladdin was given a ring with a genie to help him get the lamp from the cave. The Sorcerer (the original version of Jafar) managed to get the lamp from Aladdin, but not the ring.

**** I'm familiar with it, that's part of what gave me the idea :). Orange power rings are rather different, though; they're powered by avarice, and tend to drive their users crazy. Also, the original sorcerer did not exactly act optimally.

***** Have you read with this ring it's a Spacebattles, Sufficient Velocity and Questionable Content story about a mostly Rationalist SI with a range Power ring in the Young Justice universe. I've lost track of it due to work since it moved to QQ but it's why orange power rings are popular here as the plebotinum a rationalist could use to improve the world.

** A rational Orpheus is ascending from the underworld and trying to determine whether or not Hades has kept his bargain (allowing the shade of Eurydice to return to life by following him) without breaking the deal and looking back.

An equally-rational Hades has anticipated this and has put in his best effort to make this impossible to determine until the shade has emerged into the light, and has thus been returned to life.

  This video is an example of Gross's Law: [ a | a' ], or, the ease with which an opponent of a position can make that position sound absurd is directly proportional to the odds that the position actually /is/ absurd.

** Aliens want earth to participate in their Kaiju-esque robot fighting sport (giant robot boxing, basically), so they send brain messages (that are arbitrarily convincing) to the smartest member of our species, as determined by some sort of handwavey brain criteria. This person's situation is not great (maybe they are in jail, maybe just not a big deal), and now they have to scramble to get a giant robot put together before the aliens arrive.

​

I was just struck by the thought that being Noah immediately post-Arc-revelation would have been extremely weird ("Honey, this is gonna sound crazy, but how many animals, by the by, would you say that there are?"), and one could probably get a short story out of putting that viewpoint in a familiar 2019 scenario.
