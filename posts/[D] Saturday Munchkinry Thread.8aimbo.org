Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** A mad scientist has designed and spread an airborne virus that gradually overwrites an infected person's DNA. After infection, a person's physical appearance will slowly change to look more and more like an androgynous average human. Within a few years, everyone over 20 will look like the same person. Everyone under 20 will look like younger versions of the same person.

Effectively, people will no longer be able to recognize each other based on physical appearance: you could wear some distinct clothes/masks/etc and claim that it is you, but anyone else could wear the same clothes/mask/etc and pretend to be you. You could use passwords to identify yourself using cryptographic hijinks, but anyone who steals your passwords can pretend to be you.

What issues would humanity face as a result, and how could we overcome them?

***** Why do you lock your car doors? Do you lock your car doors because they will surely keep someone willing to dedicate time and effort breaking into your car out, or do you lock your car door so that somone looking for a quick grab n' dash from stealing your CD's?

The tattoo's solve probably 70% of Identity issues if they are managed well. 25% would then rest on the Tattoos simply being so similiar that it takes a bit of time to fully regster the person. Think about talking to identcal twins or dopplegangers. If you know the person well enough you could figure it out quickly, otherwise it may take some time. The remaining 5% comes down to people who would get permanent tattoos to impersonate somone else permanently. Assuming that the andogynous form has both the same fingerprints for everyone and also the same eye markings and DNA inprint, getting the tattoo makes you almost a perfect double. The issue comes up mainly for famous people at that point. Every government would likely have a tattoo body double for every high ranking officer in every foreiegn government as a saftetynet/espionage set up. I imagine anyone who is famous would probably get some micro surgery done on their eyes and keep it extremremely safegaurded so that no one knows what it looks like to duplicate. Basically the Tattoo works as a deterant, extrasecurity measures would be required for true security to be held.

The virus works by only changing physical appearance, internal function is unchanged. So they will appear to have both reproductive systems, but only one will be functional: men and women will look the same, but only men can produce sperm, and only women can produce eggs.

******* For the generation in which it occurs, there would be huge changes for 5-10 years as we get used to the new identifying features. Younger generations would largely bypass this and within three generations, the way we used to identify ourselves would be as novel and alien as ancestor worship. (Maybe that is extreme, but you surely understand).

The standard size for things would make some choices disappear. My mom is 4'10" or 147 centimeters but I am assuming that this androgynous form cause her to grow taller. My Father-in-law is about 500 pounds, so the question I have to ask is does that change? Is he still fat, or did he become skinnier? If we all normalize in height and stature, the daily needed calories would increase for some and decrease for others. You would see the biggest effect here in undeveloped areas where they are currently surviving on 700 calories a day and surviving because of their form, but now they need 1,200 calories.

Until tattoos become cultural identifiers, and possibly even afterwards because I imagine standard tattoos would take time people would become more empathetic toward one another. I believe studies have proven that we more prone to care about people who resemble ourselves and our loved ones, and now that everyone looks like us, we would keep that biological facet of our mentality and utilize it for humanity as a whole. Initially, racist/trans-phobic people would be pretty shaken up. I imagine something like 70% of those people would let the issues go, but anyone who held their beliefs and had them backed up by groups they are a part of could become radicalized pretty fast. I'm not just talking about southern american racism here though, but cultural ethnic animosity where you once could say, hey that guy is Ethiopian because... but now that feature is gone so you just don't know.

All media would change. Every comic book hero, movie star, etc. now looks the same. The way we share these stories would adapt as people learn to identify themselves in new ways. Anything pre-virus would probably rise in value but a few years down the road it may rise in infamy as we look back and wonder why we made fun of certain individuals based on appearance alone.

Everyone's physical appearance becomes the same. So they all get the same height and fatness. Once you hit peak fatness (where any more would make a noticeable change to your physical appearance), any excess food eaten just passes through your body without being converted into fat. The only exception is if you do something like starving yourself: then you look like a starving version of the person everyone has become, since the virus can't create matter out of nothing.

***** The fact that doing that is an incredibly bad idea? Whatever con you are running, you would now have a permanent record of having done it on your face. Excellent way to wind up behind bars, that.

This does assume that there is a register of taken tatoos, to prevent accidental duplication, so that having someone elses replicated is proof of ill intent.. but that is a given.

That then leaves you with the issue of making pleasing tatoos that are unique in vast numbers, but this is something computer aided design and lookup would help with a great deal. And of course some people will just want to not be mistaken for anyone else, and go with an entirely algorithmicly generated wreath of flowers (99 billion possible color combos, almost all of them look nice, and easily identifiable) while others drop major-art-purchase money on having someone try to put their soul into ink.

*** I have prosopagnosia (a mild form), and in short, I can't recognise people based on the way their face looks. I've had it all my life and people like me manage to function seamlessly in society (to the point where people just go through life thinking they're "bad with faces" rather than realising they have a qualitative difference in ability).

So for me, this homogenisation would pretty much put everyone on the level I'm at, and I think commenters are /probably/ overestimating this.

For starters: I can recognise people fine. I can recognise people across a football field by the way they dress, style their hair, and most importantly their gait. I think there is zero chance of someone impersonating, say, my husband well enough to fool me. A photograph, sure. But not a conversation. And they could certainly shave my husband's head and put him in an outfit he wouldn't normally wear and it'd take me a good 20-30 seconds to believe it was him, and every time I caught a glimpse of him in the corner of my eye for a day or so I'd have to consciously remember it's him and that I shouldn't cry out in surprise at this strange man with me.

People are talking about con artists getting tattoos to impersonate people and all that, but come on - do con artists learn how to perfectly imitate Melania Trump's voice and mannerisms so they can hire a model in a wig and makeup to waltz into her penthouse and steal shit? Like, if you've seen RuPaul's Drag Race, you can use makeup to make you look like pretty much anyone. (Again I have prosopagnosia but I get the impression the likenesses are very good). Sure, people impersonate celebrities all the time and get good restaurant tables or something - but nothing on the order of what you're implying might be possible here.

The issues would be on the order of stuff like sports, modelling, acting. If the DNA was all the same we'd have easy organ transplantation, which'd be nice.

**** Well yes, impersonating someone in front of people they know well isn't likely to work. Even if they are completely blind and deaf, if they know someone very well they are going to notice something is off. After all, every interaction is really a sort of password (a private memory shared by only the people interacting), and every inside joke or trivia is basically a cryptographic hijink that let's you know who you're interacting with while not giving away the joke (passwords) to other people watching.

I was thinking more along the lines of impersonating someone in front of people that /don't/ know them well. For example, impersonating someone while robbing a bank. That way the police starts chasing the person you impersonated instead of you. Or impersonating someone in front of their employees/clients/investors/etc. Lots of people have to interact with plenty of other people that they don't know very well, so impersonating them in such situations is quite likely to succeed.

You probably won't be able to get into the white house, but you could do things like impersonate the president and pretend there's a conspiracy afoot where the "you" at the white house is a fake and you're the real one, and then you could rally people to do things in the name of the president.

I'm aware of this, but the issue is one of ease. To give an analogy, suppose that one day all pick-able locks magically fail to lock. Well, pretty much anyone can learn to pick a lock, so that might not sound like a big deal, but you can bet there will be a large surge of crimes until the locks are replaced with working ones. (If there isn't, then why do we even have locks?) Hence the need for permanent tattoos and tattoo registries in the original scenario.

** Background: High Fantasy Setting, likely a Wuxia Setting. The Universe has become wholly unbalanced. Humanity has systematically managed to subjugate almost every type of creature, and yet humanity has not progressed. Pre-industrial, mystical martial arts society is ruling and has ruled for some number of millennia. The stagnate stability humanity has created has knocked the Universe's chaotic aspects into disarray, and therefore a new creature is birthed from the imbalance.

The Creature/Power: A Cuckoo bird is notorious for its Brood Parasitism, that is, preying on other creatures by tricking them into raising their young. The Cuckoo Bird will lay an egg in the nest of another bird, and this other bird will unwittingly raise the creature as their own. Often the Cuckoo youngling will even kill the biological young of the bird that is raising them. The Mystical Cuckoo Bird is the Universe's attempt to give an upgrade to nature so that humanity can be overthrown, and the stagnate balance can be undone. The Mystical Cuckoo after it dies breaks down its soul and uses it to modify creatures around it ultimately seeking to evolve them and remove humanities stalemate.

Rules:

- The Modified creature only affects the species as a whole if it matures to adulthood and breeds, and also if it's children do the same.

- The Modified creature gives a 10-20% upgrade to a predator that consumes it.

- The Modified creature's spiritual prodigy must be in an embryo state when the soul is upgraded

- The modified creature's spiritual prodigy must be within a 50-mile radius to receive the upgrade. The closer the receiving creature is to the modified creature the better upgrade is received.

- The receiving creature must be a higher trophic level than the modified creature

- When a Modified Creature dies, it produces 16 joules of modification energy.

- Primary consumers use 1 joule to upgrade. Secondary consumers require 2, Tertiary consumers require 4, Quaternary consumers require 8, quintenary consumers require 16, and so on and so forth. There is a possibility that some creatures may have extra joule needed because of innate aspects like human level intelligence, cultivation techniques, legendary/mythical status, etc.

- The Biological children of the modified creature do not spread the modification spiritually, only physically.

Example of a modified creature: Rabbit->Horned Rabbit. Voltage Wolf(Ability to build up immense static electricity in fur)->Magarmored(Iron Fur controlled with magnetism for offensive and defensive purposes.) Wolves

A small clan of humans had the brief opportunity to study the cuckoo when it was first born and have created a cultivation technique modeled after the cuckoo's ability. How do they rise to power and safeguard/advance humanity in the face of this calamity? How have they adapted the Cuckoo's ability to best suit humanity? Assuming the Human's don't realize the amount the Cuckoo's Soul Prodigy have spread for 15 years, how screwed is humanity?

*** To answer that, we need to first identify the upgrade costs. Every level up the food chain doubles the cost, but what level are humans? We eat just about everything, so we can be placed pretty much anywhere on the food chain except the bottom. If we all become vegetarians, will it be easier to upgrade ourselves?

If not, humanity is in serious trouble. The fact that other species will be evolving far faster puts us in an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienators:_Evolution_Continues][Evolution]] scenario, but without the plot armors to ensure our survival. The primary consumers will get upgrade after upgrade, leaving everyone else in the dust. Depending on how far up the food chain we are, by the time humans evolve to something better, rabbits will have gone all the way to hulking superpowered behemoths with 1km instant-death aura. They'll become strong enough to fight off all their predators and monopolize their food supplies, so every thing above them in the food chain dies off from starvation.

If we had technology, we could still do something like mass cloning modified creatures and mass eating them to rapidly upgrade humanity. But seeing as this is a pre-industrial era, the only hope is to wipe out all life from the mystical cuckoo. Set fire to forests/grasslands/etc. where the cuckoo effect has been observed, as well as any nearby ones. Then send out hunters to wipe out every last living thing in the area. Our only hope is to press our current advantage and wipe out all other species before they can out-evolve us.

**** I definitely see what you are saying, but I don't think the low levels on the food chain would improve too fast simply because the changes must go up the food chain. So when the rabbit dies, the modified creature that follows must be a second level consumer, not a first. I forgot to outline that when the top predator in an area receives an upgrade, or when there are not enough Jules for a top predator to receive an upgrade, the modifications expand outwards and start over.

Humans are probably level 4 or 5 consumers, but with the cultivation techniques, they may be able to get around some of the other requirements.

***** Actually now I'm confused. Could you explain exactly how the upgrade energy is flowing? What does the Mythical cuckoo bird do exactly? Is it breeding its own new species? When you say a modified creature gives a 10-20% upgrade to a consumer, what exactly does that mean? I just need to eat 10 modified creatures to get an upgrade? Will predators that eat way more than they need evolve way faster? If creatures can only pass on energy to their predators, how do the primary level creatures even get their energy? Also, what happens if you have two species that eat each other? That can happen in nature, especially since many animals have really weak and nutritious babies.

** Background: We're in the Naruto universe, but there are two laws/principles for how chakra can affect genetics.

1. Areas in which high levels of ambient and/or foreign chakra are present in an organism's environment during their gestation have been shown to dramatically increase the rate of mutation. Example: the forest of death.

2. There has also been an observed connection between the intermingling of two organisms' chakra over many generations of cohabitation leading to a sharing of genetics. For organisms of the Kingdom Animalia to share genetics through chakra, they must at least be of the same biological phylum (does not apply to the Plantae kingdom). An example of this is the Inuzuka clan whose people have acquired more carnivorous qualities and their canine counterparts that display higher than average intelligence and an overall increase in size.

Now we've got two groups that can take advantage of these two laws with their ability to use chakra to manipulate the speed of gestation/maturation and behavior/movement of a specific branch of organisms.

- Mokuton users whose branch of organisms is the entire Plantae kingdom.
- The Aburame clan whose branch of organisms is the entire Arthropoda phylum (I'm aware this isn't canon).

Basically, either of these groups of people can place two different sets of organisms (a male and female of each organism) within their domain of control in close proximity to each other, force reproduction, increase the speed of gestation/maturation, and repeat. The result is a rapid production of multiple generations with each having a high rate of mutation and a chance of genetics being integrated from one organism to another. By discarding offspring with undesirable traits this should allow for rapid and directed speciation.

So the question here is what sort of interesting mutants would be worth creating by abusing these laws/principles and what type of worldwide consequences might result from them. Assume oxygen levels, arthropods, and plants are all consistent with our world.

*** Plan to take over the world:

1. Create a plant that does not release oxygen when it photosynthesizes (it just stores it inside itself for respiration or something).

2. Grow it near other plants, causing their genetics to mingle and so they also stop producing oxygen.

3. World oxygen levels crash, everyone suffocates to death except you and your clan, who have started living in an airtight greenhouse with oxygen producing plants that have not been infected by your mutant plant.

4. Once everyone else is dead, create a second mutant plant that reverses the effects of the first and spread it throughout the world to bring the oxygen levels back to normal, and take over all the ghost towns left behind by the other ninja clans that suffocated to death.

**** Three problems:

1. Mutations are still random, and since there is no known plant that stores oxygen this ability would have to arise by chance rather than proximity integration. So getting any nonexistent feature to arise could take an indefinite amount of time.

2. The thing where genetics between two organisms integrate is both random (no guarantee that other plants would get that characteristic) and takes many generations so without a mokuton user nearby this might not spread on its own. Although they could plant seeds and speed grow them in mass quantities I guess.

3. Where's this oxygen being stored? If it's stored in pockets/sacks it could be released by cutting the trees open. If it's stored in the cells, is this thing even a plant any more? It's likely these plants would also be very flammable maybe even explosive.

You have the following, somewhat weak, superpower: you may choose a small volume (at most as big as a large human, approximately) and mirror it about any axis. The mirroring is instantaneous, but takes more energy (from your internal chemical energy store) if you have to overcome a potential energy barrier (e.g. if a piece of stone is partly inside the region and partly not, cutting it requires energy to break the forces holding the stone together). What can be done with this (other than winning Randi Prizes and the like)?

*** After a quick google search, I found a [[http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=49792][short story/science lesson]] that answers your question.

In short, yes, mirrored people will starve to death. They can still drink water and breath air though, so it will take a pretty long time to kill them that way. Long enough for them to realize what you did to them and try to punch you until you undo it. Punching works even when mirrored, unfortunately for you.

If you wanted to use your power to kill someone, it would be far easier to just spam mirror tiny volumes of space inside their bodies. The energy cost for cutting them open like this should be fairly small if you keep the volumes small, but the effects should be quite deadly. [[#s][Examples:]]

The most obvious use of this power is to be a chemist. There are still plenty of molecules out there that we don't know how to make or are ridiculously hard to make. With your mirroring power, you half the search space since any method you find to make a chiral molecule lets you make its mirror molecule. (Though it wouldn't work for the achiral molecules.) With every new molecule comes new potential applications that can help benefit humanity. (Though most will be useless.)

But there is another use: Faster-than-light Teleportation. If you mirror a volume of space with an item on one side, it instantly teleports to the other. Effectively, instantaneous mirroring is faster than light travel. I'm not familiar enough with physics to immediately see the ways you could abuse this given that your range is limited to the volume of a large human, but I bet there's plenty.

If you did it while they're asleep and it doesn't wake people up, it might be a good way to kill people undetected. I mean, doctors wouldn't even think to test for mirroring, would they?

Eventually, there will be enough circumstantial evidence that someone will check for mirroring.

****** I feel so stupid now. It seems so obvious that you'd be able to tell the mirroring thing... pity because "slowly dying of starvation despite eating food as normal" is a great 'horror' premise.

******* It can still be used as a horror premise, if the victim has no idea how they were mirrored or how to reverse it...

*** evil stuff:

- mirror people and blackmail them for food. (without revealing your power) maybe make your own village

- going through walls? and robbing places. building tunnels would be impractible?

non-evil stuff:

- science expirement: brain research: will people now only be able to read mirrored text?

- industry: mirror a chiral molekule. there are probably some molekules that mirrored versions are more expansive to make. So just sell them in bulk.
