** So while I wouldn't say that this series is rational, it's got a fair bit of the thrown into another world of magic fantasy that people here seem to like.

Also the author is the same guy who wrote /Time Braid/ and /Perilous Waif./

Just be warned that he has a fair bit of sex and oodles of harem fantasies involved in this book.

*** I read the first 1.5 books in this series expecting fantasy adventure, with sexy times on the side.

What I got was sexy times all the time, with some really mediocre fantasy adventure on the side. I felt there was a bit of dues ex machina happening too.

*** He really spent a lot more effort on perilous waif, and it shows.

** I'm almost finished this book. I feel like it's a bit of a departure from the previous books in the series. If I were to graph the chauvanism expressed by book, it would be peaking with this last one. Maybe one day the MC will meet a woman that doesn't drool at the thought of his dick!

I also don't like how alanna turned out to be so special and overpowered, and I especially didn't like how she's just a shortcut for the author to just lazily vomit exposition at will.

This book is really scraping the barrel, imo, and I already had a pretty low bar for this series.

** I was waiting for this, but Amazon is being retarded again:

#+begin_quote
  This title is available to UK customers only.
#+end_quote

Yet, when switching to a VPN server in UK, it stops showing the price and a purchase button, and instead tries to make me buy the abominable Kindle subscription.

Looks like I'm waiting for a torrented rip again while I'm perfectly willing to throw money at you. Why do you do this to us (and yourself), William?

** Ok I need more. Is there any other decent power fantasy where we build up a powerbase?

*** If you mean literally build a base, then I can't think of any.

For plain power fantasy books, I recommend:

- Black Prism by Brent Weeks
- Blood Song by Anthony Ryan. The first book is very good, but the sequels get progressively worse
- Harry Dresden Series - Rough start, and too episodic at times, but good enough

Do you have any recs?

**** A lot of fantasy that dabbles in power escalation feels like walking up the down escalator. Dresden is a case in point: in the first 4-6 books, if I remember correctly, the beginning of each book feels like nothing was gained in the previous book. It's pretty depressing to feel like "we" went through all of that only to end up still at the bottom of a hill instead of making noticeable progress.

Daniel Black, for all its faults, does not suffer from that problem up through Thrall.

**** not much.

HPMOR is technically a power fantasy.

​

The last sovereign is an h-game but it is better written then most books.

****** Oh yeah, I read that one already. The last book was a bit rushed, but really good. I'm the first one that recommended those books here, actually, a long time ago.

** I gave up on this series halfway through the second book. I thought I could endure the blatant self-insert power and sex fantasy but it's just too... blatant.
