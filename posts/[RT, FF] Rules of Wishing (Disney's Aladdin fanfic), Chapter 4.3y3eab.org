** This isn't the most amazing chapter, but I'm attempting to get back on the horse and this is a prerequisite to the next one that I actually want to write.

*** I liked it! I actually had the impression the story had stopped after chapter 3, so glad to see there's more to come

**** It didn't so much stop as stall. Everyone got so overpowered so fast that I was going "ah shit how can I have a satisfying resolution to this?". I subsequently figured one out but it took a while to get back into writing.

** Not as good as the other chapters... but the other chapters were absolutely brilliant, so this chapter is still well above the average for fanfics.

** If this were fully fleshed out and 20,000-80,000 words long, this could be one of my favorite rational fics.

On the other hand I hope you'd finish it quickly so I'd get to see the resolution.

So questions:

1. How long will this be?
2. When are you going to post the next chapter?

*** 1. The next chapter is intended to be the last. There may be an additional epilogue. I am giving some consideration to rewriting the whole thing into a full story instead of a series of scene fragments once I'm done, but am not yet certain I will.
2. Hopefully in the next couple of days.
