Hi all. Following the positive reception to my spiritual crossover of HPMOR with Rick and Morty, I was inspired to elaborate on it.

** I feel like EY made Quirrelmort's fascism too cool and suave. Your fanfic does a perfect job of tearing down that image by putting his fascist rants in the mouth of Rickelmort.

** Haven't watched any R&M and don't know anything about the show's characters except what I could infer from this, but still found it hilarious. Thank you!

*** If you liked this, then you'll probably like R&M, but I recommend looking at the IMDB scores because the writers /really/ drop the ball sometimes. (For example, Season 1's "Raising Gazorpazorp" is basically just telling the same joke again and again)

*** I don't understand how "a lack of originality or laziness" can be taken in a way that isn't a personal attack.
