Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Ok I want to rant about the movie Annihilation.

Just the whole process they take doesn't fit any remotely reasonable mission plan or scientific method.

There's this "shimmer", a barrier created by something that is expanding. "Every team or drone they ever sent inside has never come back".

Ok, well, that doesn't sound like the inside is very habitable. So the logical thing to do would be to create a huge variety of drones - clockwork drones, film cameras on a pole, hell just a really long stick - and try to get /something/ back from the "shimmer". (a clockwork drone is basically like a small 4 wheeled vehicle with a mechanical spring motor and some mechanical logic. It would basically be programmed to drive around a little, scrapping some sample scoop against the dirt on the other side, then come back)

Say you can't get any information back no matter what you try. Well then you don't send people in. Or if you /do/, their orders should be to try to leave the moment they find themselves inside. Not 'explore the place and then presumably die'.

Also if whatever is creating this barrier is so powerful it can stop you from getting any information from inside, and it's expanding, this is a serious existential risk to humanity. This is not something to keep secret for 3 years. This is "crash plan to abandon the planet" kind of scenario.

(presumably if the barrier is going to take decades to swallow the planet, you could build Orion drive colony ships and get millions of people and lots of infrastructure off-world to the Moon or Mars before the end.)

There's still time!

I've been thinking about how one might write a story driven by action, violence, physical conflict, etc between reasonably rational agents. People who should be smart enough to see that violence is not the way to resolve their conflict (except for this narrative circumstance, apparently).

Getting caught up in emotions, misunderstandings, self-defense... these seem like cop-outs because they're obvious narrative devices. Likewise for, say, rational agents fighting in a combat school to learn how to better fight external threats that aren't rational (or are too alien, or whatever). This lacks genuine threat. Stories that subvert and/or deconstruct violence don't count either. The lesson is very clearly 'violence isn't the answer!'. Let's assume the audience already knows this.

Video games, for example, have a hard time with the topic. Wanting you to believe your character is good despite monumental levels of violence because "the gameplay is fun" is enough to hand-waive the violence for most people. Or it's rationalized that the opponents are mindless or corrupted or some other lost cause.

So! How might one write a story driven by violence between reasonably rational parties, without cop-outs or excuses, but also doesn't glorify the violence? How might we construct an action-driven scenario (for e.g. video games that rely on the gameplay loop) where violence really does have intrinsic and instrumental value? Are there good examples?

(does this break the rules of the Monday General Rationality topic? it's about writing rational fiction, which is a real-world activity...)

*** Limited resources and greed/need. You need a situation where violence is the only way for at least one actor to be satisfied.

A common way to organically create conflict in video games is to provide a limited resource of some kind and to allow fighting to control it. By monopolizing the resource/area by force a group makes more than they would sharing it.

**** This seems to cut close to self-defense... unless the resource is generated by fighting, and is transient enough that it cannot be easily stored in any other way except within oneself?

Is the resource essential to life? Or it has undeniably high utility but the cost is violence/death? Death magic cult.

Hmm. This feels like a thread to keep tugging on.

Maybe we must bring these questions to worldbuilding/munchkinry threads.

They're not cop-outs. They're basic realities of the human experience. That's why they crop up time and time again, throughout fiction. They reflect real life.

Now, I could start a big argument about how even "rational" people are driven by emotion, but I want to focus on misunderstanding instead. You call it a cop-out, because of course no truly rational person would ever misread or misunderstand a situation. They're too wise and enlightened for that.

But that's fucking nonsense. No-one has perfect judgement. Everyone makes mistakes. You are conflating "being rational" with "having perfect information", but they are not the same thing. Two characters might be perfectly rational, reasonable people, but if all they've ever heard about their counterparts is that they're greedy, selfish, sons of bitches, they're going to act on the basis that said information is true.

Now, you might argue that a rational person would take the time to verify that what they heard was true. But human beings do not have time to scrutinize every single shred of information they receive. If we did that, we would never get anything done. Sooner or later, we have to have faith that our sources are correct, and not mistaken or lying.

Even if the characters did take the time to meet, so they could judge each other for themselves, that still doesn't protect against mistakes. Human judgement is incredibly biased, in ways so subtle that they are almost impossible to notice from the driver's seat (as it were). For one thing, the human mind is biased towards maintaining existing beliefs. So even if the characters tried to analyze each other as fairly as possible, the fact that they've already been primed to see each other as assholes is going to colour their readings (and probably not for the better).

/And even if/ the characters took the time to verify what they'd heard, /and even if/ they were capable of judging each other as fairly as possible, any number of things could still get in the way. Their flight could be delayed. A family emergency could arise. Their horse could trip and break its leg. A malicious third character might sabotage the meeting. The best laid plans gang aft agley, after all.

Now take all these problems, and put them in a situation where time is of the essence, and the characters have to make a decision now, /now,/ *NOW.* That is where tragic mistakes occur - at the intersection of misinformation and pressure. Rationality will not save you there.

**** Yeah, I don't disagree with anything you said. The things you're describing are definitely valid and very real sources of conflict, but not really what I was aiming for. I think the misunderstanding is my fault because I was too brief in my post - trying to get in before the thread post was over a day old - so sorry about that.

Good that you're fired up about this though! I think many novice writers overlook the conflict opportunities you're describing because they have the luxury to think about the narrative when their characters don't. They fail to get into the mind of their character in the moment.

What I failed to articulate is that I'm thinking about how to construct conflicts that would result in violence regardless if there is emotion or time pressures involved, and regardless of the actors' rationality (to the extent that rational agents with time to apply their cognitive abilities will still conclude that violence really is the answer in this context).

If you read through my post again you can see that I mentioned video games as an example, used because such campaigns of violence are prolonged and the characters often do have time to reflect and think about their circumstances. The other posters fortunately understood me and gave some good examples along the thread I'm trying to pull on. Hopefully that gives you better context.

*** Violence imposed by above? Like in a Battle Royale sort of setting, or even a Practical Guide to Evil one, where the gods intentionally push the world toward perpetual cycles of violence?

**** This works, but I'm left feeling unsatisfied... I reckon because it still feels like an excuse, and I would feel bound to make the story about reforming the nature of the setting itself. I'm not familiar with A Practical Guide To Evil but based on the TVTropes description I would expect the story to go in that direction.

Perhaps I'm trying to make the conflict between people at its origin. I don't know yet.

Nevertheless, this /works./ So I must spend some time thinking past my first thoughts here. Thanks.

***** No problem. Keep in mind that if all you want to do is avoid /glorifying/ the violence, it's not hard to make the characters aware that it's suboptimal, but just unable to find a better solution due to factors outside their control, like a truly limited resource or clashing fundamental values or a limited time frame in which to act.
