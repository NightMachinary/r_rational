** This post was removed by Automoderator after having passed a threshold for number of reports. I was going to reapprove it (and possibly wait for one of the other mods to come make a decision, because I have conflicts of interest), but it's been deleted.

Generally speaking, I think discussion of works falls well within the purview of this subreddit, though I'd prefer if it were somewhat rare, especially since the web serials already have so much more of a presence than shorter works, and they're the ones that will tend to dominate discussion. I also tend to hold these discussion topics to a higher standard than I do posts about fiction, since it would be easy for this subreddit to be swamped by low-effort discussion posts; the less thought and effort you're going to put into criticism or commentary, the more likely it should go into some other thread, especially for the web serials, which have threads posted at regular intervals. (And don't forget to be mindful of spoilers, since not everyone reads or has read whatever you might be posting about.)

*** Why do you find discussions like this valuable after a work is beyond a certain threshold of popularity? If this really was an issue it would've been echoed long before in each chapter's thread.

I could see how this would be valuable in an attempt to figure out why a story failed to gain popularity but otherwise..?

You as an author shouldn't feel the need to satisfy or even give much thought to this minority point of view because if you did then you would make the story worse for your main readership and make yourself feel bad because you might feel you were wrong to write it the way you did. Which you were not.

**** I didn't find this post to be particularly valuable to me, but I also don't think that it was /meant/ for me. It also falls a little too much in the "this is a thing I didn't like" rather than being "let's talk about the themes and messages of this work" (though this is subjective, and I can't reread the post to see how much of that might be me projecting).

If /I/ were going to make a post about a work, especially one meant to stand on its own, it would be something along the lines of "What are the sexual politics of /Worth the Candle/?" with a bunch of citations from the text, reading of sub-text, etc., and I would find /that/ valuable, because understanding how people read a work is an important part of getting better at writing, especially if it gives you a chance to see where people have misread things. And if it were for a work other than my own, I would probably also find it valuable as a reader, because I'm into that sort of analysis.

** In cases where the leading male character is surrounded by many women, for the purposes of titillating a male audience, I find it extremely off-putting.

Regarding "Worth the Candle", I find it similar to watching Chris Tucker in films. In /Rush Hour/, I cannot stand his character. He is loud, obnoxious, and his sense of humor does not match mine. In /The Fifth Element/, I love his character. He is loud, obnoxious, and his sense of humor does not match mine. The difference is that in /The Fifth Element/, everybody surrounding Chris Tucker has the same reaction to him as I do, being incredibly annoyed at him. This changes the joke into a meta-joke, with his character being the setup for a joke, rather than the punchline.

In "Worth the Candle", the social dynamics have not at all seemed like those of a catch-them-all style harem story. Joon is shown to be in conflict with the game-layer wherever he has moral qualms with it. Frequently when he has a heart-to-heart and sees a message that a loyalty score increased, his reaction is one of disgust. The intrinsic motivation for getting to know his friends resulted in an extrinsic reward, cheapening the experience. Similarly, Joon's anger at the achievement [[#s][]] shows the main feature is not one of Joon being in a harem story, but his disgust at being treated like a self-insert male protagonist into a harem story.

Add to that the parallels between Joon and Arthur, and Joon's worry/dismay on hearing of [[#s][]]: Joon is worried about what sort of a person the game-layer and narrative is trying to force him to be, and is trying to avoid being a self-insert protagonist in a harem story.

*** I mean, in Fifth Element Ruby Rhod is a character who makes perfect sense in both from a Watsonian and Doylist perspective. In universe Ruby is a flamboyant media personality who serves as a microcosm of how weird and exaggerated the future is, so his behaviour makes sense for his character. From a narrative perspective his comic relief is contextualized by him being a fish out of water mixed up in events against his will or consent, so his presence in the story feels more natural.

The presence Chris Tucker in Rush Hour by contrast is bizarre on both. From a narrative perspective he serves no other purpose other than comic relief to back up Jackie Chan's Wu Shu heroism with "comedy" (which is unnecessary because Jackie is a perfectly viable comedic actor) without brining anything to the table to resolve the story. From an in universe perspective you have to wonder how the hell Tucker *made it through the academy* let along became a Detective acting the way he does, his existence in the narrative is pure fiat and he's only there because Chris Tucker is a popular comedian with a distinctive voice who will help get butts in seats.

So it's pretty easy to see why a viewer or reader might react negatively to certain story elements in some context and not in others if it a. fails to make sense from an in-universe standpoint to the reader and b. fails to justify why it needs to be a part of the story to the reader.

  There are some things that I find outright distasteful like Joon's early claim that he finds it easier to care about the safety/well-being of females than males but which as far as I've seen went unremarked upon in the community. It completely changed the way I relate to the character since.

Really? I mostly found that admission an admirable display of self-awareness. I think most heterosexual men find it easier to care about the safety & well-being of attractive females in their immediate social vicinity. That's just biology. Being aware of it doesn't make it worse.

**** The issue is twofold. First, a community which cares about a work does not want to see their community spaces become ones which are hypercritical of the work. Second, my personal empathy and socialization make me really uncomfortable with purely critical negativity mines being left in author-reader dialogue spaces, and authors and other content creators often express a strong negative impact from comments unhealthily critical or hostile to their work. In light of this being the second non-main-chapter-discussion post on WtC I can think of, and also within a few days of the last one, which also read as critical but which at least generated some other discussion, I am particularly inclined to pushback.

Had your post included any of your other comments in this thread, that you love WtC enough to donate, that

It would not have read as a request for people to complain about WtC and, e.g., fall into the "X and Y are bad about the protagonist, therefore they are bad about the work as a whole and about the author" attractor which so much complaining about authors' works often does. What you did post, however, in light of your other comments, I now read as tonedeaf. It is for that tonedeafness, I think, that you're receiving this response from myself and a few others.

** I think most people didn't really find it odd that Joon admitted that because it's an incredibly normal thing for most young men to think. Not to say that it's healthy, or that the culture that produces that state of mind shouldn't be changed, of course. But the culture does exist, and the mindset it produces is so common as to be considered the default.

But another part of it is how much you appreciate the meta of the situation. Everything Joon is encountering is, to some degree, orchestrated by the DM. So we have that additional layer of separation between the events of the story and the author, and we can talk about what the DM was thinking instead of what the author is thinking. And that sort of thing is definitely not everyone's cup of tea.

If there were negative comments they would have been about how that doesn't make sense for his character, not for him being sexist. Because, as I said, we live in a world where some degree of chauvinist masculinity is the norm.

The idea that those two aspects of sexism in modern culture somehow can't coexist and be acknowledged simultaneously seems pretty absurd.

But yeah, maybe next time instead of just assuming someone's politics and saying you disagree with them without any explanation until repeatedly prompted, you might want to consider leading with some more open-ended questions to clarify the situation?
