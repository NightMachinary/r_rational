I'd want to uplift dogs as part of that process, because I suspect we can /benefit/ from bringing dog sensibilities into our social structures. The wild animals most like us, outside of the primates, are probably wolves, and dogs are are already partway between wolves and humans.

The end point of the uplift process is going to be a pan-terrestrial species, some of whom are descended from humans, others from dogs, others from otters and dolphins and bonobos and hyenas and who knows... whose lives and inheritance are mediated through silicon (or some descendant computational substrate) as much as carbon, by data as much as DNA.

Look, if dogs have anything to teach us that we would consider good, it's part of our CEV even if they never existed. We don't need to uplift them to learn from them, they don't even need to have existed for us to learn what we would have learned from them, if we're doing our jobs properly in figuring out the CEV.

That is an unlikely outcome. Hell, you can't find that consistent a goal set even among humans. Are you suggesting that we should work towards that kind of uniformity? That's kind of creepy, to be honest.

I'm confused how I can lose you there, of all places. It's pretty much [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition][the definition of CEV]]. If there is something good we could have learned along the way, it's part of our CEV. Note the "could have": if you actually need to have the things around in order to learn from them, you can't calculate the CEV because there's good advice which doesn't happen to be personified on Earth. If [] have admirable traits which we should want to include in the future, we should include those traits in the future regardless of whether [] is a species which actually exists.

#+end_quote

Overeager reductionism. Just because all atoms are part of one computer, doesn't mean that all atoms are identical, in spite of having the property "part of computer". Human preferences not being uniform or otherwise heavily externally optimised appears to be part of the CEV.

But sure, let's run with that, suppose dogs wanted everyone to be morally uniform. Wouldn't that be horrible to make part of the Terran future? Shouldn't we just ignore them and let everyone be free? Wouldn't that dissatisfy the dogs, because those damn humans are wasting their resources on individuality and a tolerance for moral error? Wouldn't we be sad that the dogs were dissatisfied, given our capacity for empathy? Wouldn't this be a strictly worse world than one where the dogs (sapient and modified or just modified or neither) are happy, we are happy, and there never was a conflict of interest between sapient creatures because we didn't blindly upload an alien species or force a living creature to change its morality.

I can't help it if you misinterpret my usage of CEV in accordance to the one and only commonly used definition of the phrase. Calling your misinterpretation axiomatically correct for yourself and then insulting me for using the common definition doesn't exactly help resolve the conflict either.

Stripping "CEV" out of my claim, I am saying that we don't need actual dogs, especially not sapient dogs, to determine what dogs would want to do, by the time we have the power to uplift species (=> we can design sapient brain architecture which preserves simpler species' values => we can make a friendly (?) artificial superintelligence). If any part of their morality seems like a better idea than what we had come up with, we can adopt it without actually needing to listen to them because we can simulate them or find more simplified algorithms for searching morality space.

If the result of all that processing is that the world is best off with all species merging into one, then we should do that, but for now, with my limited knowledge and Occam's razor and limited imagination, I'll just say what I can say: not bloody likely.

Not uplifting all dogs doesn't do that. Even killing all dogs doesn't do that. Destroying all information about dogs might do that, but it seems unlikely because there is such a flood of information in the natural world that it's probably redundant somewhere. Destroying all information about all non-human life might be sufficient.

To put it more clearly: all information to make the perfect ethical strategy/CEV (according to you) is contained within you. For all combinations of the state of knowledge and the possible choice, the you can already select the best possible option (according to you) using nothing but your brain.

The non-existence of dogs may change the state of your knowledge and therefore your actions and possibly even your believed moral statements, but the CEV operates under the assumption of perfect knowledge, and I don't know of any evidence of value drift that fundamental in human history. Meanwhile, attaining sufficiently detailed information about dogs to reconstruct them still seems likely in case of a well-meaning xenocide, and an obvious certainty if they are merely not uplifted before we get fAI, which obsoletes our moral knowledge.

#+begin_quote
  I am objecting to the society in which that happened. You are objecting to my objection.
#+end_quote

Objectively false. Check the comment history.

#+begin_quote
  I am supporting my argument.
#+end_quote

In that case you're guilty of a false dichotomy. The fact that irreversible actions (unlike exterminating a species, which can be reverted with a little 21st century bio-engineering and a full DNA sample) limit future choices has no impact on whether we should take the positive action of uplifting dogs, which you're arguing for.

Neither destroys information for the CEV. They are indeed big, but they are just elements of a xenocide, not a permanent darkening of the future. People can learn to like dogs again and find dogs to like, if killing them was a mistake.

And that is a dumb attitude. You're not giving any information other than your incredulity and possibly your insecurity about your ignorance.

For the record, it's simple reductionism. People can act like independent moral entities - they don't need to talk to people to come to a judgment - so they contain a complete set of moral processing. Everything else they receive as information from the environment, which is part of 'knowledge'. Humans run on physics, so the moral processing is complete, between knowledge and the brain that processes it.

If you believe you don't know the answer, you will make a decision in ignorance, potentially to refer to a (real) friend for guidance. The problem where you remember your friend's answer is a separate one with a different state of knowledge, with a different resulting choice. The problem where you remember trying to contact your friend, but having them not be available, is another one. You may also want to include dogs in your decision, which results in strategies of trying to probe dogs, and then strategies where you know the dogs' minds, which are therefore occasionally different than if you didn't know the dogs' minds.

******** FWIW, I would be more comfortable with baseline dogs, especially if we're assigning massive amounts of resources to each person. They can be engineered not to suffer needlessly, and otherwise optimised, but I don't know if dogs want to be smarter^{1} , or even if they did, if the consequences of satisfying that desire (redistribution of resources to honour their wishes, potential moral incapability, etc.) would make the decision a net positive. Meanwhile, a reasonably happy and non-suffering pet seems like a very good use of resources, especially in meatspace where they cost less than a static house.

Meanwhile, would an uplifted dog be what you want for yourself? Keeping their subservience through the uplifting process makes /me/ uncomfortable, but without it would they want to play fetch, learn tricks, shower you with affection, etc.? It seems to me that a large part of the reason of having dogs rather than more/slightly wealthier humans is lost when uplifting them.

It's ridiculously unlikely a priori, and while I agree that your arguments constitute evidence, I don't think it's enough. House elves, shpexish obsession with territory or hierarchy, or other failure modes may still exist.

#+begin_quote
  This view of ... flaw in CEV.
#+end_quote

True moral disagreement seems to me to be the most fundamental possible disagreement on distribution of resources. Let go of that, and what basis do we have to do anything the way we like?

  Dogs easily ... integrate them.

Probably agreed without uploading (see above), but with uploading I doubt they'll fill their former niche.

****** I don't think any of the real suffering reducers advocate stubbed toe type utilitarianism. Brian Tomasik is one of the prominent suffering reducers and leaning towards negative utilitarianism and he mainly argues that negative utilitarianism is justified in the case of extreme suffering like getting fried to death in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_bull][brazen bull]]. That type of suffering might be so bad that it would be better to not have been born and it would require very large amount of happy experiences to outweigh it.

#+begin_quote
  There's at least one threshold of suffering (and maybe more) such that if someone suffers more intensely than that threshold, that suffering is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_preferences][lexigally]] worse than any amount of suffering less intense than the threshold.

******** I think it's better that it's left unmentioned. I don't have to like the puritanical asshats for it to be a good story. I should have said "that's the other thing that bugged me about the /society/". My headcanon is that they could but choose not to for the same reason we still have the war on drugs and the war on science and all the other horse exhaust that simply wouldn't be there if a fraction of the people with decision making ability were even vaguely sane.

*** I don't think that this particular story is encapsulated in the twist. There are some stories that are, ones where the twist is meant to be the entire thrust of it, but this was more a story about cultural norms, pain and suffering in animals, and the question of whether it's ethical to keep pets.

***** The "dogs are real dogs" and the "there are no real dogs" twists weren't the twist. There's lots of SFnal backgrounds where coming across real dogs would be surprising (Niven's "Svetz" stories, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, some of Asimov's futures) without it being due to a bunch of idiot negative utility freaks with no imagination.

I mean it wasn't certain by then but the thing is named 'Dogs', though I suppose I may just be innately biased towards that sort of twist and just happened to be correct in this case.
