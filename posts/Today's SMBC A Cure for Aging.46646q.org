**** A lot of these steps that are presented as inevitable logical consequences are really arbitrary and make no sense. It's just followed through because the comic /must/ arrive at some kind of "this thing we thought was awesome actually sucks" twist ending.

***** It's a standard motif of SMBC to take an initial idea and then follow it from absurd next step to absurd next step (e.g. just clicking on random comics, I came upon [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2584]] ). They're not really supposed to be plausible.

That having been said, this particular comic I felt a bit less funny than others of the same motif.

***** Agreed. I'm actually not really sure why this was posted/upvoted, as there doesn't appear to be anything rational about it. My suspicion is that this post's popularity is because of the comic's end-of-death premise (which this community and the larger rational/LW communities have latched onto) and because images and quick humor are easily digested by readers.

****** I definitely posted this more because of the speculation on a topic that the community finds interesting than a feeling that it was rational. However, I don't think the steps he chooses are arbitrary and non-sensical. Out of the infinite possibilities a premise like this spawns, the author picks the ones he thinks have the most potential to be funny and absurd. I definitely think that there are some points that even I hadn't given thought to during discussions on immortality: the biggest one being that infinity does weird things to human value systems.

****** Because branding, i think. Smbc is a known/respected name, so it feels nicer when they give attention to a topic of interest relative t some smaller comic.

***** It's.. a joke. Weinersmith chooses mostly logical steps along the way and produces the most absurd outcomes he can because that's funny. You're taking it too seriously. Stahp.

**** I get the same vibe. It's like Zach has to try too hard to contort his ideas into funny punchlines. Not like it happens too often, but it is there.

** I'm never sure if webcomics like this or xkcd are fair game as top-level posts here. Let me know if this isn't cool. I really liked today's comic though, and I think you will too!

*** Rational Webcomics are fine top-level posts! We'll see things from SMBC, Dinosaur Comics, and sometimes xkcd in here occasionally. In general, if it's a link to rational or rationalist fiction, it's good, regardless of medium.
