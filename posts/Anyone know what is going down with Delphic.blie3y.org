Haven't seen anything since late March. Anyone know if anything is going on with the author?


** It has been 42 days, but chapter 26 to 27 had taken 37 days. I think it's fine. Most likely, good ol' IRL took priority again.

** Not trying to hijack your post but would you recommend delphic? I couldn't get the part where they found out that his best friend of many years was a spy and the cheesy introduction to all his real life friends. Felt kind of barebones. I also didnt like how the a zcientist stated that its impossible for a super power that deals with the brain/intelligence but delphic is obviously one example of one.

*** I enjoy Delphic because it is an enjoyable, "what if" scenario. What would one do in a situation where you can view anything past or present. How would you prevent knowledge of your talent getting out. It recently entered back into my memory given the current situation in Good Student, which is currently dealing with a remarkably similar situation.

Also the author [[/u/9adam4]] has poignant details that stick out in their writing, food scenes in particular. If I can find some quirk of an author's writing I like, I'm hooked for more. It is that little spark of genius or well-executed creativity that keeps me going, knowing that with enough nurturing, it will become a nice fire.

**** Totally agree with you. Reactions in Delphic are reasonably subdued. Compared to, I'm really sorry about this, Chinese webnovels, they are a fresh air. I'm tired of characters who immediately plot for revenge on the slightest slight. Over the top reaction should be saved for over the top urgency (LOL, is that a phrase?).

*** One of Hector's major faults is that using his view has distanced his sense of personal danger. He often doesn't feel that his actual body is in danger from something since his "view" is never in danger. So he doesn't react appropriately to threats or consider that people might actually be targeting him. His friend being a spy was just part of that. It's just something he never considered might happen and was thrown in his face when he figured it out.

I'm personally not a big fan of the current story arc with Kim. It kinda feels like it's getting away from the "superhero" part of the story and into too much romantic character development.
