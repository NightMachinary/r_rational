Pretty much this. I am incredibly in favour of all things Sliver. I <3 my Sliver deck. This has Slivers in it and is written by a person whose work I enjoy, therefore all is good.

** This is a quest that I just started over on SV. The premise is that you are a new-born [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397585][sliver queen]] in a land of shifting realities and constant war. The Chaos Lands touch everywhere and everywhen, but they are nowhere and nowhen themselves. People and places drift in from outside and then, sometimes at least, they drift out again. The laws of reality change whenever there is a Chaos Shift. Our protagonist, a cuddly newborn omnivorous fast-spawning killing machine, must survive while surrounded by ogres, orcs, elves, and that M-113 APC that just wandered through.

Slivers are an MtG borrow, but the Chaos Lands are original.

Okay, you've totally sold me on this.

** Well, I've always wanted to know what it felt like to be an extinction level event.

If you have any MTG related questions feel free to PM me, I basically live in [[/r/magicTCG]]

*** Okay, question about Dredge. Can multiple cards with Dredge activate on the same draw? Say I have three Golgari Grave-Troll's in my graveyard as my draw step begins. Can I put 18 cards in my graveyard and recover all 3 trolls?

**** +Yes. Dredge is a replacement effect and can trigger separately for each draw. The card Breakthrough used to be used in dredge decks because it gave you 4 "draws" and then let you re-discard the dredged cards.+

Edit: Never mind, read that wrong. You need one "draw", per dredge trigger, but can dredge multiple times to the same effect. So Ancestral Recall would let you dredge three times off of one spell, but your draw step only lets you dredge once.

** I'm on there as "rangerscience". Tots wall of text'd.

In my ideal world this will remind me of various games I played in college - various degrees of free-form RPGs.

Most valuable things in those games? History books, followed by weird.

Edit: WOOPS. Missed a key hyphenation - free-form CIV-rpg's. One time I played the only person in world making trains. Three months of play (about a year in game?) I had superheroes, crazy mutant war dog mounts, and blimps - but I would routinely risk it all for /one. more. history. book./ Helped the world underwent a /clearly/ human-triggered catastrophe a few centuries earlier and the people who knew the most (and probably did it) took the brunt of that and so were all dead and in ruins.

Good times.

*** I'm there as me. I don't think history books will be all that helpful, given that we are in a world which has no coherent history. Besides, we can't read them without researching languages.
