“Have you ever considered that maybe Kennedy wasn't actually that good of a President?” I asked.

Al stared at me in disbelief.

“I mean, okay, his death left a huge impact on the history of America. But if we look at the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the Cuban Missile Crisis, he doesn't come off looking like too great of a leader. And I think there's a strong argument to be made that none of Johnson's positive contributions to America, especially the Civil Rights Act, would have been possible with Kennedy working alone. I mean, you're on Medicare, right? Johnson was the most proficient wielder of senatorial power and he had the political power of the Kennedy assassination behind him. I save Kennedy, not only am I risking nuclear armageddon, but I'm also risking undoing all of Johnson's good work.” I held up a hand. “Again, Vietnam aside. But if we're talking about Vietnam, it was Kennedy who decided to overthrow Ngô Đình Diệm. Not to mention backing a coup d'état in Iraq.”

“Sixty thousand American men died in Vietnam. Millions of Vietnamese. It was Johnson who started that insane escalation. You want me to just put that aside?” asked Al. Anger was starting to show through beneath his exhaustion.

“Are you trying to tell me that the Vietnamese conflict wouldn't have happened without Johnson escalating? That war was already brewing in 1958.”

“You'll be going back to 1960, not 1958,” said Al with a shake of his head.

“Well whichever it is,” I replied. “Saving Kennedy can't possibly result in all the Vietnamese being saved, because the Vietnam war still happens either way, it's just a question of how involved the United States is. I don't really imagine that letting the Viet Cong run roughshod with the backing of the Soviet Union results in substantially fewer deaths. What you're talking about is better for American men, sure, but American men don't have more moral worth than Vietnamese men.”

Al ground his teeth in frustration. “I thought you were the one. When I saw you there, I thought ... Jake, I'm too old to make the trip again.” He stopped and changed tactics. “Look, if it doesn't work out, you can just reset everything again.”

“You want me to potentially waste three years of my life just because I've got a dead-end job and I'm freshly divorced?” I asked. I should have been more insulted. “Look, you've been feeding me beef from 1960 for years now, haven't you ever thought about going bigger with it? You sell burgers for a dollar instead of five dollars. Why not pocket that extra four dollars and put it toward malaria nets, if you really care about maximizing good?”

“Malaria nets?” asked Al. He was more puzzled than anything else now.

“A million people die from malaria every year,” I replied. “You want to go back in time and retroactively save millions of people in a pretty ill-advised and uncertain way. What I want to do instead is use the time portal to make millions of dollars which we can use to save millions of people in the present.”

“It's not the same,” said Al. His face had sagged. “The past is different, the effects ripple outward, they compound each other.”

“Al, there's no such thing as the past,” I replied. “Fifty years from now, this is going to be the past, and whatever we do here is going to ripple out into the future. If I could make a million dollars now, then I could translate that into maybe a hundred thousand lives, or the QALY equivalent.” I paused at his stare. “Quality-adjusted life year. So if the death toll of the Vietnam War is a maximum of two million on both sides, I'd need what, maybe twenty million dollars to match that? Do you really think that I can't make twenty million dollars using this portal, and do it a lot more easily and reliably than trying to stop Oswald or whoever was really behind the assassination? Especially if, as you said, time doesn't like being messed with? I can avoid the whole time paradox issue entirely by simply using past-future arbitrage.”

“You're different,” said Al. “Something's different about you. Something changed the last time I went back, something changed you.”

“Okay,” I replied. “But I'd have no knowledge of who I used to be, would I? Really, we should try to figure out how malleable history really is and how sensitive to small changes. Obviously it's not that sensitive, because I'm still the same person, and I was born in ‘78. The odds of a specific sperm and egg creating an outwardly identical person are astronomical, but apparently the butterfly effect has limits.” I began pacing around the room, wrapped up in my own thoughts. “I think before I go in again I'll go grab a copy of English wikipedia, that's only about 11GB. I'll bring a hard drive through with me, make some innocuous change, then come back and download it again to run a diff of the two. That should let me isolate a lot of macro scale changes really quickly.” I looked up at Frank, who had a sour expression on his face.

“How do you know how to do that?” he asked.

“It's not that hard,” I replied. “The file size is going to be an issue, but come on, I teach computer science.”

Frank shook his head. “It's all wrong.” He pushed up from his chair with a groan. “I've got to go back.”

I moved to block the doorway. “Then what happens to me?” I asked. “If you go back, to reset everything back to the way it was, do I just disappear? You're trying to replace me with my doppelganger?”

I wasn't too surprised when Frank began to reach for his gun, but I suspect that my alternate self hadn't been as big of a believer in concealed carry. Al had been weak, exhausted, and slow. I'd been on edge since going through to the past, and Al's paranoid talk about the assassination had only heightened that. I shot him before he could shoot me, or worse, erase me from history, and I threw up soon afterward. I'd never killed anyone before and I'd never thought that I'd have to kill Al.

As soon as the shock wore off, I started making plans. I'd just inherited a portal to 1960, I just wasn't going to use it like Al had planned I would.


** (I haven't actually finished reading 11/22/63; it's sitting at 43% on my Kindle and I don't really have the desire to pick it up again. I watched the first episode 11.22.63 on Hulu though, and it reminded me what a terrible time traveler Jake Epping is.)

*** I finished it, and I disliked it quite severely. I wasn't miffed by the time travel, I was miffed at the characters and plot itself. It's a long book but I kept pushing on, expecting it to "get good" but like chaosmosis said, it dissolved into bad metaphysics instead, and I think I felt personally offended as a result.

** If we are going to be talking about stories with time-travel shenanigans, I must mention [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?54354-All-Night-Laundry-THREAD-1-Chapters-1-4][All Night Laundry]].

For anyone who is curious, the main character was a writing teacher not a computer science teacher so that was probably the difference that Al affected.

Great post alexanderwales!

** That reminds me of how comparatively well time travel was handled in X-Men: Days of future past. When they decided to do the time travel they were aware that they were effectively killing all living humans. But they considered it worth the price because their world was so fucked up. Maybe they should have asked those other people who they were killing but at least they didn't make the decision easily. They only did it when all hope was lost.

(However, the screenwriters lost a good chunk of my admiration with that whole "we need to keep the connection with wolverine" even though Wolverine wasn't doing /anything important at all/.)

That bothered me for a bit, but I got over it. Yes, they could have sent him back for a few hours, got him to drop messages to the right people and then let the butterflies take their course, but they couldn't know what he was actually doing.

They maximized their chances of a good end by giving him more time, so they gave him more time. Also, it's not like their lives were valuable for anything /else/ in their soon-to-be-erased timeline.

** As a huge Stephen King fan, I've resisted reading 11/22/63 for years now because it's been greatly hyped as one of his most recent best and I've found most non-rational-fiction stories about time travel to be terrible. I guess I should give it a shot, if just to appreciate how much better it could have been.

*** Having read and loved it, the time travel really plays a small role in the plot. The scene that [[/u/alexanderwales]] changed is the crux of it; we really only think about the time travel at the beginning and at the end of the book. I would say it's worth a read.

**** Yeah, I think I'd agree that it's one of Stephen King's best. My problem with Stephen King has always been that he's a discovery writer who doesn't do enough to clean up his works after they're written. I first noticed this in /The Stand/ and when I started reading about Stephen King's process I went "Oh, that's why that was that way". I think there's a lot that /11/22/63/ does right, but I kept getting that same sense that Stephen King hadn't gone back and done enough editing to streamline things after he'd done his first pass. There's good atmosphere and the prose has a lot going for it technically, but the plot just didn't seem tight enough to me. I don't think I stopped reading because of that though, something probably just drew my interest more and then it seemed like too much work to start back up again after I'd been away from it for a month.

****** Writers can be usefully put across a spectrum with people who meticulously plot things out at one end and people who make it all up as they go along at the other end. George RR Martin calls this distinction "architect" and "gardener", the Writing Excuses podcast calls it "plotter" and "pantser". "Discovery writer" is just another term for someone who's feeling out at as they go along. In reality, most writers are impure (they do both) but there are definite trends.

Stephen King is firmly at the discovery writer end of the spectrum. His method (as stated in "On Writing") is to create some compelling characters and see where a challenging situation leads them. His method for writing "The Stand" was to write a chapter, end it on a cliffhanger, then write another chapter from another viewpoint, and continue on like that, occasionally dipping back into a viewpoint he'd already hit to resolve a previous cliffhanger then end on a new one. Eventually the plot gets where it's going, the viewpoint characters come together ... and then Stephen King gets some terrible writer's block and nearly gives up because he doesn't know how the book ends. This is one of the reasons that Stephen King seems to have trouble with endings (and the same is true for /many/ authors who have trouble with endings, especially people who write web serials, which are usually not tightly plotted).

For contrast, Brandon Sanderson is a meticulous plotter. He plans out his whole book before he's written a single word and figured out the shape of the plot with all the story beats well in advance. He goes in with a plan and then executes that plan as well as he's able.

(My natural tendency is to write by discovery, but that's left me with a lot of drafts that have difficult problems by the late-middle, so I've made a commitment not to write things until I've pinned down the climax and ending.)

** I think 11/22/63 is awesome, but I didn't really think about goal optimization while reading it. It's pretty clear Jake could achieve a lot more if he was smarter about the way he treated his goals, but he doesn't do anything incredibly dumb. Otherwise, the writing is enjoyable and the story is interesting.

*** My guess is that attempting to change time goes terribly and the moral is that we shouldn't try to screw with time, but that guess is mostly informed by reading a lot of other time travel fiction and seems like it would be a little cliched. (I wouldn't be entirely surprised if it ended with JFK causing nuclear armageddon, but I have no idea whether that's something King would write.)
