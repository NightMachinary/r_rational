Edit: Also, there's basically no research concerning what happens when you instantly clear all psych disorders from someone with no side-effects or drugs. That is going to be author fiat, because short of actual wizard magic, it's all anyone can do.

***** It will cure addictions, clearing both physical and psychological withdrawal instantly. It will also cure any underlying problem which may have led you to become addicted in the first place. There is, after all, a growing body of research which shows that drug addiction is often a symptom of social isolation, depression, and other, similar issues. However, if you ever decide to shoot up again despite the original reasons being gone, it doesn't protect you from becoming addicted again if the circumstances are right.

  If I touched, say, Kaiser, things would go downhill for the E88 fast.
#+end_quote

This implies that Kaiser's activity, or maybe his racism, is /primarily/ driven by some form of mental illness...

This power is gonna get awfully controversial awfully fast.

In fact it looks like your comment section has already gleefully restarted the eternal "what counts as a mental illness?" argument. With guest appearances by Asperger's, sociopathy, and minority sexual desires.

I'm both anticipating and dreading the times where you'll have to drop Word of God on the grey areas.

** I asked about whether people were interested in this on Friday, and a few people responded. I was already writing it, so I've started putting it up on SV.

Taylor got a shard called Conflict Resolution. Her powers prevent her from having psychological disorders, let her see disorders in others, and let her cure all psychological disorders on touch. Expect more feels than fights.

This is the first time I've written anything, but I've put a lot of thought into this. Constructive criticism welcome.

Something about not tagging something, or including "inappropriate" content or something? (Looking through the thread I just linked, it was something having to do with unmarked spoilers.)

********* He broke the Spacebattles spoiler embargo for Star Wars: the Force Awakens, and got a one day ban for it. SB was really strict regarding anything that was looked like a SWtFA spoiler for a while there, and did not allow any spoilers (even properly tagged ones) outside of a special forum, had a bunch of site-wide announcements about it, and came down hard on anybody anywhere near the line. As I understand it, Mr. Zoat has a really long, unbroken daily posting streak, and at least part of jumping ship was to keep the streak going.

In his own words from the Story FAQ on SV:

#+begin_quote
  *So... Spacebattles?*

  On the 30th of December I received a one day ban from Spacebattles. This was due to me posting the following:

  'I've seen the film, and I'm still not sure how a government backed paramilitary counts as a rebellion.'

  This fell afoul of the then Spacebattles policy of coming down hard on anyone talking about a film that may possibly involve... Wars. And maybe Stars.

  My opinion is that this was complete overkill, and after my appeal was rejected I decided to move the thread to Sufficient Velocity. It will not be going back.

*********** It's entirely in keeping with how SB was running their moderation for Star Wars stuff. Any spoiler, however slight, if made outside the appropriate forum, qualified. Here is what I [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-2121#post-20295073][wrote]] at the time:

#+begin_quote
  I see why mods did what they did, and it was within their bounds to do so. It also seems to be the case that NOT banning Zoat while other users were banned for similar infractions would in fact be making an exception for him. I understand the temptation there was (a temptation to which the moderators yielded) to treat everyone equally and ban Zoat. That being said, this is your guys' house. You make the rules, you enforce the rules, and there was nothing stopping you from saying "Zoat gets to technically break this rule in a small way, because he's an important member of the community." Some would say that such a solution is bad. I'd say that it is always the right choice, especially given his contributions. I'm sad to see him go.

  These rules were made in service of man, in service of SB, that they might help us. They are not your masters, they are your tools-- a means, not an end. Never forget that.

I really liked Amelia. It's the best Panacea fixfic, that /starts/ with her going full Nilbog, and escalates from there.

Cenotaph is really good. Taylor's father gets killed by Bakuda, things go down from there.

Weaver 9 and Manager are both good, though they do end early.

**** These would all be near the top of my list, though /Manager/ is a little lower than the others. /Cenotaph/ is great, but IMO the trilogy keeps getting stronger through /Memorial/ and /Legacy/ (in progress) - there's some brilliantly executed development of themes as well as top-notch characterisation and technical skills second to none.

If you can handle unfinished stuff, Ryuugi has left a number of brilliant short pieces which died too soon - /Zenith/, if you have to pick one, and /Here be Dragons/ (finished!). /Copaceptic/ is probably the best post-canon fic, blending slice-of-life with... other... elements.
