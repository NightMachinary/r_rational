*Summary:* Red had always loved dragons. He wanted them. He dreamed of them. He desperately awaited the day he'd get a charmander, something that would one day reign as a mighty charizard.

Glad you enjoyed it. Typo - Fixed.

** Welp, guess there's no way to ask this, so it's gonna be semi-spoiler time.

So... is the new Mon a shiny...? Or is it an 'altered type' like the one we saw before, with a different second typing? Because, you know, a Psychic/Dark one of those would be *amazing*.

Just curious.

*** I was thinking dark/ghost or psychic/ghost. Ghosts tend to be the ones associated with taking people over or causing negative emotions out of malice in the pokeverse.

**** I don't see her losing her Psychic abilities at all. She still has them and it's a fundamental part of her nature. Psychic/Ghost sounds pretty cool, though.

*** In Ascension-verse, shiny is a divergent-species that has diverged to cause a color varient.\\
And that's it.

What has happened to Mia is far more than that. Dark is not evil and Mia is not turning into a Dark type. Remember, emotions are under the purview of fairy types. And negative emotions are also emotions. It is the gardevoir line that cannot normally consume them. Mia will most definitely change and gain new abilities. She is already beyond the normal purview of her species. Imagine an empathetic monster you fight in battle that literally consumes the pain, fear and other emotions as well.

At the end of the chapter, when Red observes Mia's Skirt, it is noticed to be somewhat more special than just being black.

Furthermore, the assimilation of Not!Mia isn't the only change that Mia underwent. She also understood something when she was shattered within the mindscape.

*Power is a state of Mind.*

This part was intentionally vague, but what exactly happened here will be explored as the story progresses.

**** Considering our previous example of divergence results in a color change, it's quite reasonable to assume that something is similar here, especially as her color scheme is similar to that of the shiny Mega form. It's almost like she's in a partial transition to that, but not fully in it.

Never claimed that Dark is evil, just like never assumed Fairy included emotion. Emotion in Mon has always been associated with the Psychic type--For instance, see Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf. It's hard to remember something that was never known. Now, if emotions are under the Fairy purview in the Ascension-verse, then either I haven't seen that stated until now or I must have missed that in the work itself.

I *asssume* she is now more Human-like, in that she can have (and consume) both positive and negative emotions, something her evolutionary sisters are incapable of. Certainly makes her stand out as unique.

I look forward to more interesting revelations!

It hasn't been explicitly stated, but it has been implied. And yeah, you can have a colour change as a result of divergence. But what shiny is, is a bit different. Its more along the lines of the most common colour divergence.

> especially as her color scheme is similar to that of the shiny Mega form. It's almost like she's in a partial transition to that, but not fully in it.

True. This will actually get explore later. But the color scheme is more representative of Not!Mia, than it being shiny.

Glad you enjoyed the chapter

** And all of this before his first badge, this is gonna be the easiest playthrough of kanto ever.

Also, oh no poor mia! Look what you did to my girl! She went off and became a lovecraftian horror! I'm hopeful that all of the baggage between her and Deliah and red will get resolved soon, but I'm starting to doubt that this is that kind of story at this point. Red and Ritchie's stories up to now have both been sufficiently dark that I feel "..." Red is gonna start making appearances sooner rather than later.
