[[/r/rational]], what's on your wishlist?

Also, if anyone knows any cool trivia or facts about nuclear weapons or related technology, let me know so I can work it into the story.


** Too many stories solve things with violence for my taste. I think it's overdone, and is usually either forced or in conflict with psychological realism. Since I recently rewatched /Log Horizon/, it stands out to me as a great example of the important stuff getting solved by a bunch of people sitting around talking, and sometimes spending lots of money, even in a context where by convention the audience expects all conflicts to lead to violence.

[[/r/TheRedPill]] is indeed rational as generally defined by this sub: The users there use a generally effective model of human interaction to achieve their desired goals. The problem is that their goals very often conflict with the goals of others, hence the controversy. They want power and dominance over their romantic partners without having to reciprocate anything in return. They treat relationships like a Prisoner's Dillemma, and advise defecting. Many people (myself included), find this morally objectionable.

There are rational ways of dealing with relationships that involve both parties co-operating, which, as anyone familiar with the Prisoner's Dillemma can tell you, is the ideal outcome.

People's values, not people's STATED values. In fiction it's fairly easy to know the character's values, either by the writer telling us through internal thinking or by simply watching the characters' behaviors. In real life it's much more difficult, and people's stated values are often very different from their real values.

And our (men) chance to understand the real values of a given woman is limited by our own biases, emotional investment and our insane sexual desire.

Yeah, I've read that. It's so full of irrational and downright falsifiable assertions that it's fairly repugnant to those not steeped in the ideology, like many posts that Red Pillers hold up as enlightening.

What those inside of echo chambers don't really understand is that the reason outsiders don't care about their justifications for their beliefs is that they're operating on a basis of knowledge and axioms that are already refuted. Like debating with a Creationist, further argument past a certain point is simply irrelevant: if I really wanted to drill into your beliefs and get you to put a mathematical number on what EXACT portion of the female population you feel fits your beliefs, and then walk you through an experiment that would help you lower your estimate again and again to realistic numbers until TRP's whole philosophy falls apart, I'm much better served by simply pointing the poor epistemology out and hoping that I've planted a seed: I don't have the time or energy for anything else.

  Alright, to be more specific: the alpha and beta male theory is based on junk science. They followed wolves recently released from captivity with no proper socialisation to come to the conclusion they came to, instead of looking at actual wild wolves that have had time to build up a stable and functional pack structure. Despite this and its poor transference over to human relationships, it's touted as the be all and end all of understanding male and female relations.

Neh, and if you had read the "The Rational Male" book you would have understood: the meaning of the word "Alpha" in human relationships is different from its meaning in the animal world.

  The subreddit itself and the subculture that follows it appears to have no respect for women, and comes part and parcel with ideas that lead to a frankly dangerous and risky approach to consent. It's reactionary, feeding on people's feelings that the current dating game is unfair. Normally that would be fine, but it goes too far in the other direction in a way that even pickup culture never really did.

Again, amoral. It might hurt people's feelings, no doubt (why do you think the professional victims, the sjw, are so pissed off with it?), but it works, so you have to ask yourself: would you rather have a tool that allows you to reach your goals (sex, women, companionship, respect, professional success) or a tool that feels good but it doesn't (being the "Nice Guy", the eternal second, or third, or twentieth)?

Millions? The subreddit currently says about 150k, and that number is inflated by their ban against anyone commenting without subscribing.

Anyway, statistically speaking, this could happen to individuals out of sheer bad luck. Due to the incredible number of people in existence, there are undoubtedly some guys who grow up with shitty mothers, shitty sisters and aunts and cousins, shitty female classmates and teachers, etc, until the vast majority of their understanding of women is informed by their experiences with the worst kind of women.

Thanks to the internet, these guys can now find each other and create an echo chamber with true misogynists and abusive men who reinforce each other into a victim mentality to make it seem like they're the only ones who see The Truth and everyone else are just politically correct, blind sheep.

But "millions" of men who can only count such women on one hand do not outweigh the hundreds of millions who are surrounded by smart and caring women who defy the strawwoman that TRP has built to represent the vast majority of them, let alone our own experiences.

#+begin_quote

And here's the rub. Here's why there are ~150k men who continue to fall prey to confirmation bias and the availability heuristic: because all it takes is finding one woman out of dozens for which it works to convince them that it's The One True Path. And if that means being abusive, well, they can shut their ears and assure each other that everyone else are just blind haters, because treating people like equals is hard, and getting sex when and how you want it is immensely biologically rewarding.

I noticed that there is a RedPill for straight men and one for gay men. Why doesn't there seem to be a RedPill for straight women and lesbian women? The intro article explained that men need more help finding partners than women do. But as far as I am aware, even if it's often not to the same extent as men, women do have relationship problems and difficulties finding partners just like men do, and would benefit from rational analysis of relationship dynamics just like men do.

Ways to do this include introducing a character who is not your main character, and have them fight a dramatic conclusion to their story, fail and possibly die horribly. Otherwise there's the option of showing something climactic or interesting from the future of your character, then cutting back to the actual start of the story. There's other ways as well, of course.

** Rationalist techniques and mindset. While a rational and consistent world is great thing, I prefer more of the original hpmor thing with different modes of though, problem solving, deductions and rule manipulation and discovery by logic.

So more of that please. And it would be great if the protag was someone who actively goes out to do something, rather than getting into problems by circumstances, destiny, luck or for plot reasons. That is to say an actor rather than a reactor type of guy (girl/gorrila/gramma/godzira or whatever your protag is)

** Focus on increasing one's Wisdom over one's Intelligence Score. A lot of rational fiction often involve the protagonist trying to improve their intelligence or taking the time to learn skills relevant to the plot. I want to see a character who is deliberately striving to become more mature and to grow as a person rather going all mad-scientist.

I get that to be rational often involves learning how to decide and achieve one's goals, but many protagonists of rational fiction tend to be very 'narrow minded' where they focus overly much on their goals without too much focus on other ways to improve themselves even if it won't help overly much for their goals.

Sorry if it's a bit ramblely. It's a subtle thing I've been noticing a lack of in rational fiction and I'm not quite sure of the best way to explain it. It's just that I often see 'rational' characters coming up with intelligent solutions of clever munckins, but I rarely see long-term planning and most protagonists are /reactive/ towards some outside problem rather than being proactive in self-development and making use of more mundane solutions in tandem with the fantastic.

I would explain this as "protagonists of rational!fic often appear unjustifiably confident of their goals or that they know their goals", and agree it's a common failing.

Remedies it would be nice to see:

- characters who are confident of an /eventual/ goal (transhumanism FTW!), but not sure how to get there (eg political orientation)

- characters deciding that they have insufficient information to meddle in the affairs of $whatever (with positive marginal expected utility), so their time is better spent on a /less important problem/ which has a relative attention-deficit

- a character arc which is /just/ personal development; eg $minor_char decides that they need life experience they don't have and can't get yet before making $major_decision

- a general theme that wisdom must not be a dump stat. INT might be how you achieve your goals, but wisdom is how you decide what your goals /are/. Probably needs some serious anvil dropping on the fallibility of humans, who usually literally don't know what we want.

- someone acting prematurely, and realizing actually-too-late that they ruined things by doing so. Failure-through-inaction is the normal aesop, but I think rational fic as a whole goes too far the other way.

** Well, this probably doesn't really apply to a "thermonuclear magical girl story," but what I've realized I've been missing from my rational fiction lately is enough focus on the protagonist's rage against the injustice of death and the constant wiping out of so much knowledge and human potential, a viewpoint which might lead a protag to take morally questionable or even arguably evil actions in the interests of putting an end to this far greater evil.

So many rational stories just kinda skip right past the "ending death" bit, until it seems like it sort of happens in the background or as a adjunct to the character's primary goals. I want to read a character who feels a cold hand of ice gripping his/her heart whenever they realize (which should be /all the time/) that anyone they love or even someone they only talked to once might well be gone tomorrow, all of that person's knowledge and experience wiped away as though it never existed, just nada, nothing. I want a character who feels hot rage when he notices that everyone around him is going through life accepting this horrible fact, pretending that it doesn't exist or believing in fairytales of religion in order to try to ignore it, or even, god help them, twisting their psyche into such ugly shapes that they can call it right and good that everyone dies, and call it wrong to want to live forever, and say that it is the fact that life is fleeting that makes it worth living.

It is this, this mindset, this character, that drew me to things related to rational fiction and transhumanism. Zoltan's protagonist in /The Transhumanist Wager/ might read like some kind of neo-nazi half the time, wandering around and demolishing various straw man arguments conveniently served up to him by cardboard cutout antagonists, but I can forgive that because the major point of the character's motivations is rage against the dying of the light, rage and horror that anyone would devote their time and resources to something other than holding on to life tooth and claw, to turning every resource humanity has towards combating this greatest of all injustices.

And yet, in rational fiction really only HPMOR had much of this in it, and even there it's just one of several goals. This is what I want to see more of, this is what makes my heart pound in excitement more even that that period of unbounded possibility that comes just after the protagonist has acquired superpowers or the equivalent, more than seeing someone munchkin something seemingly useless into great power.

I notice that pretty much all the stories I really like have this element in them, even though sometimes it doesn't come through in its full form as rage against death. Vernor Vinge's stuff has this in it in great measure, sometimes only hinted at but always present in some form, mixed with deft portrayals of enhanced intelligence as something that you can't look directly at and comprehend, but instead only see through its effects and implications. /Worm/ is about someone who just won't give up, no matter how horrible things get, and while the parallel is never quite explicit, by the end the protagonist might as well be facing the anthropomorphic personification of senseless and unstoppable death, and doing everything possible to bring it to an end and to compel everyone else to also devote all their energies to this end, whether by ethical means or not. And similar parallels can be made for almost all fiction I consider moving.

** An issue I've had with a lot of rational fics is that they have a kind of on/off relationship with narrative satisfaction. The stories often like to subvert your expectations, but it sometimes results in the story failing to deliver on what I want it to. HPMOR is on of my favorite books ever, but I can't disagree with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/][the review]] [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] wrote explaining why the ending is disappointing. Not that he's innocent, I freaking hate The Metropolitan Man because it was the exact opposite of what I wanted from a Superman story. Just because you can deconstruct a cultural icon doesn't mean it's enjoyable to read, especially when compared to reconstructions like All-Star Superman or Superman vs. The Elite that respect the character and what he represents while modernizing him.

Because of this trend I'm nervous about finishing Worm or checking out Wildbow's other work. It had an amazing start and really interesting characters, but I stopped reading after I finished Prey because the story had become unpleasant to read. Character development seems to have been put on hold while everyone's busy surviving constant attacks by horrific monsters that the heroes are powerless to stop. The author said he actually rolled dice to see who'd survive Leviathan's attack on the city, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim][which I think is completely contrary to a compelling narrative and characters.]]

Personally I think the author was exaggerating or lying about that to at least some extent. Maybe he did it for some of the secondary characters, but the primaries? I've read Worm twice, and the story doesn't exhibit that kind of randomized structure. The main characters have strong plot armor until it makes sense that it should fade, and Wildbow even provides an in universe explanation for the plot armor.

I /strongly/ recommend finishing Worm. IMO the climax and ending is by far the best part. Yes, there are a few missteps like the time skip and the strong conservation of danger/mook effect that eventually afflicts the S9, and also the part with Echidna which is too long and drags, but aside from those Worm gets better and better as it goes along and the ending is (again IMO) sublime. And as a comparison baseline I also hated the ending of The Metropolitan Man with a fiery passion. Worm's ending delivers on all its promises and then some.

As for the rest of Wildbow's work, I didn't really like Pact. Many elements seem like the worst parts of Worm. Wildbow said he had personal problems while writing it that interfered, and it does read like that. Also, the terrific epic scale ending of Worm set up certain expectations in me for Pact's ending, expectations that were not fulfilled.

I'm waiting on Twig to be completed before reading it.

***** I'm not sure exactly how to answer. Different people seem to have different definitions of "character development." I certainly felt fulfilled by the character arcs by the end. I felt that Taylor resolved a lot of her problems by the end (and also with her dad), except for a few lingering issues which retained to feed directly into the ending. Regent never had that much character and while he gets some development it wasn't that much. Imp gets a lot of development, much of which you may not notice unless you look for it (/wink, wink/). Grue, well, I think you might be disappointed by Grue's arc, although I feel that was intentional for a certain purpose in the story. I'm not sure about Tattle. Lots of things happened, but I'm not sure if she really changed that much. Panacea very much goes through hell and then comes back out again. Bitch -- yes, she gets what you want.

Unfortunately as far as catching a break, if you stopped in Prey the worst is yet to come. The Echidna arc comes a little bit after that (although the part in between wasn't bad if I recall correctly) and I felt it was the worst part of the story. It went on too long, was fatiguing, wanted to be frightening and yet lacked a sense of danger because Echidna wasn't really an Endbringer, had way too much fighting, etc. But after that things get much, much better, both as far as writing and in catching a break and solving personal problems.

**** SPOILERS AHEAD

The problem is the final arc. Superman publicly murders a crime boss because "I was standing there, hating him, and thinking how much better the world would be if he were dead." It wasn't in defense of anyone nor did he attempt to hide it. He even confesses to Lois that he'd spend relative days thinking it over before deciding to commit murder. He ended up regreting it, but this is where the story spirals downward. Lois joins Luthor and decides to pretend to be in love with Superman to trick him, a plot point that is creepy on many levels and was such a stupid plan Superman sees through it easily. Then he has the final confrontation with Luthor and dies through a plot contrivance that barely makes sense. That's it, story's over.

I can accept Superman killing villains. I actually like Zod's death in Man of Steel. He killed Zod in defense of innocent people after Zod had announced he'd never stop trying to kill others to spite Superman. Here, THE SUPERHERO unambiguously committs murder. I hate this fic.

No, this is /not/ how it works. RF emissions only interfere with similar wavelengths, and the effect is only really noticeable at radio or microwave frequencies.
