** Can we /un-/recommend something? I've just finished the first two books of the "Arcane Ascension" series after seeing them posted here and elsewhere as rational fic. I would just like to warn anyone else thinking about reading these- they are many things, but rational they ain't.

They're about a boy in a wizarding school, replete with the standard lit-rpg tropes of monsters and classes and power levels and dungeon crawls. Sometimes these things can be really fun, especially if the main character really breaks the world over his knee and the narrative gets to explore some deeper issues. This story seems to promise something like that, but never delivers. The main character always /intends/ to learn or grow or be prepared for his next challenge, but he is railroaded so hard that he basically has no initiative in the story. Super-powered villains, laughably out of his league, are always countered by super-powered good guys, laughably out of his league, who then take him aside and give him his next objectives at the conclusion of every battle. He (the main character) is intensely, aggravatingly passive, and despite being raised as a noble and a duelist his whole life has basically no knowledge of people, places or events in the world around him. He doesn't plan, barely experiences any character growth, and is just generally intensely dull and unlikable when held up against any of the side characters.

In short, it reads like someone wrote down their World of Warcraft adventure. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the writer used to work for Blizzard and Obsidian). Plot elements (keys, dungeon rooms, monsters) and narrative tropes (his fear of touch, his fear of overusing his power, long tedious explanations of runes) are overused to the point that they easily fill a third of each book and I found myself lightly skimming. At no point does anyone come even /close/ to the standard of rationality, and it's intensely frustrating that the character's power set (Enchanter, basically can create any magic effect or item as long as he knows the runes/can power it) which is so /easily/ broken, is never really taken advantage of at all.

Read these books if you want to pay several dollars for a bog standard fantasy school adventure. Or just go play an MMO, you will have the same experience.

*** Good to know, thank you.

I started reading it, but the combat annoyed me too much, too unrealistic even though it's sort of trying to be. The author is trying to do it, but he doesn't understand enough to pull it off. Dropped / paused it at chapter 3. Don't know if I'll get back to it anymore though.

**** It's got a very anime style of combat. Arrogant villain shows up, finds a million reasons /not/ to just take care of business, an ever-growing roster of heros shows up, gets obliterated one by one. The main character musters his gumption and does something minor but clever which leaves the villain open for the final /real/ hero who then actually defeats them.

Unfortunately he repeats this trope so many times that it becomes a little comical, and he never kills any of the villains or heroes so they just begin piling up and the story sags under the weight of a million high-powered characters with unspoken agendas.

Plot kept getting slightly comedic when it should be getting real, and characters were /really/ generic outside of the MC. Extremely unambitious story, I can see the appeal the same way I see the appeal of xianxia, but I can't see myself reading it to the end.

****** Off the top of my mind, The Emperor of Solo Play: Korean vrmmorpg, time-travel-restart, late start, no starting capital, OP MC, semi-vengeance plot (with an satisfying alternative conclusion), unique character build, the usual jazz.

The characterisaction and language style speaks distinctly of a translated korean novel, but compared to similar novels in the genre, it gives a surprising amount of respect for realism. There isn't as much overt self contradiction.

Of course, this is far from simulationist; expect a powercreep story revolving entirely around the MC.

** *Request* /(I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8wb5nt/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/e1v2oka/?context=0][this]] 6 months ago with minimal luck)/

 

I'm looking for stories which are *grimdark* and/or have very *gray morality* and/or have *villains* as the *protagonist*, while also having *smart/driven main characters*.

 

A few varied (but limited) examples:

- [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] (although all of Wildbow's work probably counts)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]] (one of the best HP fanfics I've read - smart and depressing)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/83726-how-to-succeed-in-evil][How To Succeed in Evil]]

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917233-snow-glass-apples][Neil Gaiman's Snow, Glass, Apples]]

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179186-the-dire-saga][The Dire Saga]] (Though I stopped reading after book 3)

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257970/][The End of the F***ing World]]

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877057/][Death Note]]

 

Things that fit on paper but I didn't care for as much:

I've also tried a few asian translated novels like [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world][Warlock of the Magus World]] but (possibly mainly because of the translation) to me they read like written by stereotypical overly excited 13 year old gamers though some of the concepts seem great at first. So maybe there's something that can sate my thirst there, although I am starting to doubt it. I also tried [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11706669-the-first-law-trilogy][The First Law]], and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202544.Devices_and_Desires][The Engineer Trilogy]] based on reccomendations when I asked last time but they didn't care for it. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Tanya_the_Evil][Saga of Tanya]] was also reccomended, but at least the anime didn't hold my attention for too long. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer][Goblin Slayer]] I liked a bit more but it abandons most of what makes it interesting episode by episode.

 

I guess things like Breaking Bad, Blackadder, American Psycho etc. mostly count, too so if I find something else in that direction, I'll be okay with it.

Edit: A lot of promising responses so far. I'll make another post like this one including them after 6 more months.

âœ“âœ“âœ“grimdark\\
âœ“âœ“âœ“gray morality\\

I assume you know of [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/233453-the-books-of-the-north][The Chronicles of the Black Company]]? Their highest ideal is to fullfill their contract faithfully, regardless of how evil their employer is. Very groundbreaking for its time. The first two books especially seems to fit your requirement to a T. After that they vacillate between doing good and evil.

âœ“âœ“grimdark\\
âœ“gray morality\\
âœ“villains as the protagonist\\
âœ“âœ“smart/driven main characters

--------------

How about [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen][Malazan]]? It's an unmatched achievement in worldbuilding and it certainly qualifies as grimdark. It demonstrates how exquisite worldbuilding and a long running narrative can elevate storytelling immensely. It's truly unlike any other series before or since.

âœ“âœ“grimdark\\
âœ“âœ“gray morality\\
âœ“âœ“villains as the protagonist(s)\\
âœ“âœ“âœ“smart/driven main characters

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/64473-the-broken-empire][The Broken Empire]] series may also apply. Not my favourite(too edgy), but it has a lot of partisans, so maybe it's just me. The author has two other series which I liked better, but they are not as fitting.

***** Malazan and Black Company are two books that tend to get disclaimer with their recommendations.

Black Company was a seminal book that inspired a lot of the fantasy that followed it, including most notably The Malazan Book of the Fallen series. It has a lot of tropes that people might find cliche nowadays, but that's only because The Black Company /created/ those tropes.

Malazan has probably the roughest start of any exceptional series I've ever read. There is no ramp up in complexity like is common in these type of novels, Erikson drops the reader in right off the deep end of the pool. If I hadn't had several very strong recommendations and nothing else to read at the time I don't know if I would have made it through the first book, or even the second book. It's only with the end of the second book that I started to really appreciate it, and then the third book, Memories of Ice, just blew me away. Fifteen years since I read it and it's still one of my favourite books of all time. And the following books were also exceptional, and two others remain among my favourites.

I tried reading this, but at least in the beginning the book seems to have a bad case of "tell, don't show" with regards to the main character.

Deadwood. Small town in 1800s following relevant people, some of them evil.

The thing is, these type of stories aren't popular with most people so they are rare. It's also difficult to keep them interesting, either the MC succeeds and it get's boring and ends, or he fails and dies / goes to jail and the story ends.

â€‹

There's a solo D&D series on youtube, 'Dicing with Death', most of the mcs are evil and they've had many. That's exactly what you see there. Most of the time the MC dies, sometimes they succeed and they have to put the series aside because it becomes a timeskip, self indulgent, "boring" story about a powerful character that will never die, slowly and patiently gaining more political power. Which as you can imagine is not the type of thing people want to do when playing D&D.

â€‹

Frankly I'd like to see them run with it, but they won't =/

(it also kind of breaks their universe because they have different series set in the same world, with characters that can interact with each other, so you can't have one character going 1 year into the future while the player in the other series doesn't).

*** A Song of Ice and Fire(Game of Thrones) I think is the best possible answer, nearly every character is morally gray and it's an all around excellent series.

Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Vlog is good, it's only about an hour long and is free.

Code Geass is a classic anime that I think is pretty gray.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/87619/biblical-monsters]] is a 10 000 word MLP fanfic that I think would count. The only MLP knowledge you really need is that Celestia is a white pony who's the semi-divine Princess of the ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/242635/split-second][Split Second]] is another MLP fanfic that I think counts. It's been a while since I read it and I think it does require more MLP knowledge, so if you don't like MLP I wouldn't recommend it. But if you do like MLP it's pretty good.

The Witcher book series might work. I don't think the protagonist is that gray personally, but might be worth a shot.

*POTENTIAL GoT SPOILERS BELLOW*

So, I tried GoT when it first came out but was sick at the time which made me not care for it (or anything). Some time passed, and I got spoiled too much over the years with hearing names of characters who die (the fanbase seems very bad with avoiding spoilers). Still, I always approvingly thought that at least it is neat that the pop-fantasy work of this generation is gray, with complex characters, no goody two shoes protagonist etc. Then at some point I saw a few episodes with friends and was deeply disappointed that they centered around a dude that was an obviously Lawful Good MC, possibly a polished Aragorn - Jon Snow. Since then I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.

Yup, enjoyed it when I watched it as a kid.

Still, he's a good guy. Most of the story is him being like "um guys can we stop fighting amongst ourselves and worry about the ice zombies that are going to kill us?"

(The show, for the most part, has done its best to strip down and simplify the characters, or make them not resemble their book counterparts at all.)

I've never actually seen the show, just the books, and it's not at all what you described in the books at least. The series does not revolve around any one character, they are probably about a dozen characters it rotates POV between. In fact, the fourth and fifth books happen simultaneously, just from the perspectives of about 6 characters each. There are a few protagonists who are pretty lawful good, but they still have to kill people, lie, and make moral compromises. And the other POV characters like Arya Stark and Cersei Lannister are a lot worse morally speaking, probably leaning closer to evil than good.

*** Have you read anything by Joe Abercrombie?

Half A King is the first book in a trilogy that focuses on a viking-like world, and while I've yet to read the third book (I've got it for over Christmas) so far I've massively enjoyed it. It's dark, the main character is pretty villainous without being so bad that you stop rooting for him, the world is horrible, and the main character needs to be cunning because he can't match people physically.

The Blade Itself is... hard to summarise, but also sounds like the sort of thing you're after. One of the main characters is a crippled inquisitor, one is an arrogant born-to-rule swordsman, one is a not-all-there berserker, one is an ancient wizard whose powers are failing.

** I've been reading /The First Law/ recently, and it's quite good. I assume most people here have heard of it before, but if you haven't it's a dark fantasy deconstruction of traditional fantasy tropes. The mysterious wizard is a bitter old man who's manipulating everyone, the dashing nobleman is a stuck up asshole, and the grand quest ends in failure. I enjoy it, though I do find myself hoping the author eventually writes a series set during the Old Time which tells the story of the conflicts of Euz and his sons in more detail.

Speaking of that, does anyone know of a good fantasy series like that? Something set in the early age of a traditional LotR-esque setting, before magic started fading. Ideally trilogy-ish length.

I also just finished /Raven Stratagem/. It was every bit as good as /Ninefox Gambit/, and I recommend the series highly. The setting is fascinating, and the author does a good job creating the appearance of rules without getting bogged down in the details. This sub in particular will probably appreciate that the heroes win by manipulating the rules, rather than simply overpowering their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12411007/1/This-Transient-Floating-World]] early days, yet but it seems like this might fit the bill (read to chapter 11)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11813418/chapters/26652618]] the protagonist in this one might be too passive for your tastes, and I eventually dropped it because the premise was an intelligent and deductive protagonist but that doesn't really happen...

To be honest i haven't read many fanfiction/novels in general so as to recommend any. Do I do know a few althought they don't share the themes from the request in my earlier comment.

One that I really liked was "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6154638][The Hill of Swords]]" which is pretty popular so you might've already read it. Fate/Stay Night and ZnT crossover. It's far from perfect but it's pretty entertaining and completed.

Another one would be "[[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/gaemon-redux-si.438278/][Gaemon REDUX]]" over at alternatehistory.com so you'd need an account to read it. It's a GoT SI OC during the events of the Dance of Dragons. It builds more heavily upon the magical side of the world and it's in general a great read. Currently updating.

For original stories i'd say [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/5701/savage-divinity/chapter/58095/chapter-1-new-beginnings][Savage Divinity]] (not a Rational/rationalist fiction at all) which starts a bit more in theme with my earlier req. request. MC is reincarnated and wakes up as a child slave working in a mine. He suffers much much more than the MC from Lizard Brain and while he didn't completely break, the mental scars he was left with are more pronounced and last through the vast majority of the story. Fair warning, he suffers from massive self-steem problems and fucky metal health issues which, because the story is written in first person, makes him an incredibly unreliable narrator.

While I admit that the story may have its share problems, one of the things I really commend the author for is how he manages to make each different POV /feel/ like a completely different character.

It has a very good first chapter, followed by several slow chapters where very little happens. This may leave the impression that it's a slow story with a passive protagonist, but the pace picks back up for a thrilling adventure. Note that I say adventure: despite its name, it's a romance/adventure story, not a mystery. The deduction is written in very good style, and it's thrilling and exciting, but it's not a solution to a puzzle the reader had a chance to attempt first (Mayu's first chapter exposition is a good example).

If you liked the first chapter, I'd recommend you to read further in (perhaps skim a few chapters after 2 until it picks up again). If you didn't, then you probably won't like it.

** Can I sell anyone here on giving Brandon Sandersons new book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward][Skyward]] a try?

It's Sandersons second take on a YA novel and this time it actually feels like a YA novel. The basic summary is that it is about a hotheaded girl whose family is at the bottom of the social ladder (because her father deserted during a major battle) and yet wants to become a fighter pilot, which is roughly the highest status job in the highly militarized sci-fi/post-apocalyptic society she lives in.

It is also about a million times better than it has any right to be given that summary. I don't know if I would quite call it rational fiction, it's rational in the sense that the characters are acting according to their own incentives and biases, but the main character is not particularly smart and lot of the plot revolves around her working around the biases of other people as well as her own. It /is/, however, a story with fleshed out characters and a coherent world that somehow still manages to be extremely tightly written.

*For the people that stopped reading at the words Brandon Sanderson*: This book manages to get around one of the major criticism that I have about him, namely that the first half of a lot of his book is dreadfully slow. Skyward has a very brief introduction into the world and the characters after which the pace kicks up and it just kinda keeps on going at full speed right up until the end.

*For the people that stopped reading at the word YA*: Yeah ok, maybe give this one a pass. Skyward is incredibly good, but unlike Sandersons other YA series this one (despite all the high tech dogfighting and deconstruction of militaristic societies) /is/ at its heart clearly about a teenager trying to figure out her place in the world and that's obviously not everyone's cup of tea.

When I went to his signing Sanderson called it his dragon egg story. It's an amusing and apt description imo. The actual dog fighting is pretty interesting though, short use recharging inertial dampners used in planes are an interesting idea. The powers reminded me of Gundam newtypes.

** Request: Can anyone recommend me /good/ crossover fanfics. 'Good' here meaning by the standards of people who came to this subreddit because they were fed up with the certain type of bad plot and characterization that rationalfic writers try to avoid. So no crackfic please, no matter how hilarious.

If I get to make more specific wishes, what I'd love to read is a story where one or more (can also be many more) /intelligent/ characters from a technologically less developed world (anything before widespread industrialization) find themselves in a more modern world (somewhere between industrialization and modern age equivalent or at least near future sci-fi). If back and forth travel s possible that's also fine. Either setting can also be real world history, but doesn't have to be. Magic existing in one or both worlds is also fine. Really the main point is that the "inserted" character(s) move into the future as opposed to being SIs in the magical dark age, but that they are not dumb knights attacking "beasts" (cars) as they often do in those kinds of movies.

So... Anything that applies to the first paragraph is welcome. Anything that hits the second would be extra awesome.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] - Not really a crossover, but I think it fits the spirit of your request. It takes this anime that is itself a deconstruction of the "Magical Girl" genre and makes it into a far future transhumanist military hard scifi. Basically, humanity's government goes on to use the magical girls' physics defying powers to first explore and colonize the galaxy, and then to fight an interstellar war of extinction against a technologically superior Alien species. Great stuff, and some of the authors writings on the philosophy and musings of morality of transhumanism and its politics are honestly better than a lot of professional scifi that I read. The worldbuilding is fantastic. I think you can get by without having watched the show if you read the plot on the wikipedia page.

*** I recently read These Games We Play by Ryuugi, an RWBY/Gamer cross. I haven't watched RWBY at all, and I'm pretty sure that the majority of the worldbuilding and twists are non-canon compliant, so you won't be missing much. It's a really well-written power fantasy with a compelling plot and enemies that don't just let the protagonist walk over them, obstacles scaling with the main character's growth.

The unreasonably fast development of the protagonist's skills as well as the scaling of enemies are justified pretty well in-story, both because of the fundamental premise of RWBY and also other reasons that become revealed as you read on. The nature of the Gamer part of the story isn't handwaved away or presented as an OOC phenomenon---Ryuugi manages to explain everything seamlessly within the the setting.

I'm not sure it's rational, but it's close enough to count, given the inherently unphysical nature of the Gamer.

** /Request/: Good comic books

I am looking for any good comic books as long as it is action/sci-fi/fantasy/superhero in some way. Not really looking for rational stories (doubt there is much out there) just ones that don't into the usual cliches and don't have dumb-when-it's-convenient characters. Basically stuff that [[/r/rational]] might like. But even trying to pick from what's considered the best my success rate is mixed.

What I've read so far (sry for the wall of text):

/Black Hammer/: Good characters and deconstruction of archetypes, will keep reading.

/The Sandman/: It's too much of a scatterbrain series with some good ideas and some more poor ones and it really tries not to have a main plot. I liked the Nada and Lucifer storylines but not much of the rest of the cast.

/Watchmen/: Liked it for all the usual reasons: great engaging plot, great characters and themes. Doubt there is much else like it.

/All Star Superman/: Overall a decent series but it has the reputation for being one of the best and "true to character" Superman stories so I ended up being underwhelmed.

/X-Men by Chris Claremont/: I read the Dark Phoenix Saga some years back and I wasn't impressed. Recently restarted from Uncanny X-Men #94 but I find it too cheesy. Is it worth continuing?

/X-Men Age of Apocalypse/: I quite liked the issues focused on Cyclops and the Four Horsemen but most other cross-overs were very poor quality (and there where a lot of them).

/New X-Men by Grant Morrison/: I really liked the characters of Emma Frost and Xorn but the U-Men and the new teens were so mediocre.

/Astonishing X-Men by Joss Whedon/: Absolutely great stuff in every way: characters, art, dialogue and a plot that's unpredictable but not off the charts crazy. Best X-Men story I've read /by far/.

/X-Men House of M/Messiah Complex/Second Coming/: House of M was good but the followup was a very average storyline that's forgettable. It seems to me I should avoid cross-overs.

/Uncanny X-Force by Rick Remender/: gorgeous art and a good team-up but the actual storylines were so-so. Ended up dropping it in the Otherworld arc which was terrible.

Some things I have problems with:

1. The villains are too often... cartoony and evil for evil's sake. I thought superhero comics are now aimed at an adult audience and were supposed to have better antagonists than MCU/DCEU?

2. Action seems too chaotic. Like if there are 5+ characters fighting I really lose focus of the action and it all seems a mess. Do I get better at reading action over time or what?

In terms of the translation itself, it's about average for the new wave of translated webnovels. There are errors but they don't detract from the story too much... but I may be a little biased having read so many poor translations. If you're new to the scene the errors will be more jarring.
