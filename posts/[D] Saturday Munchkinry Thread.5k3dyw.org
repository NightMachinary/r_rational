Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** How to defeat a rational hivemind that can hijack the body of anyone it's ever touched? Victims cannot remember anything they do while hijacked, may be hijacked indefinitely, and may always be hijacked once compromised. A compromised person only compromises others by touching them if they are currently hijacked. The only tell that someone is hijacked is that they lack their real self's episodic memories. You do not know where on the planet the hivemind is, only that it exists. The hivemind knows that you exist, too, and also doesn't know where you are. The hivemind is only aware of the world through hijacked people; it can't see through the eyes of people who are merely compromised, though it knows whether they're still alive. The hivemind can only die if there are no living compromised or hijacked people.

*** The hivemind wins (by controlling over 90% of people) within three months, no matter what you do.

Losing episodic memory is only obvious to people who have some reason to know you, and you generally wouldn't stop them from touching you.

Let's say that the hovemind starts as one person in rural China. Hour 1 has their entire family hijacked. They visit neighbors and get everyone in the village by the end of the first day. Since they are all the hivemind, they act "normal" again despite being hijacked. A few go to each of the neighboring cities over the course of a week, infect a couple ticket handlers or something, and hijack them the next shift. They then infect and hijack busfuls or planefuls of people, who infect entire offices/schools/airports.

Once they are in every airport (including hijacking the employees) they take over cities in the same way, including the media. With no outcry or publicity (except for a few crazies who are quickly silenced) they take over the main functions of society, and then take over towns, farms, etc. very quickly.

You're pretty much screwed.

*** What is the role of the player in this scenario? Is the person an average joe, the absolute ruler of a country, or somewhere in-between?

How much general knowledge is there of the hivemind? Would an individual recognize a slight memory loss or unexpected physical contact as signs of infection? Seeing this on a scale from "unknown power with a population who believes it to be impossible" to "previously fought a war against the hivemind, and every schoolchild worldwide is given detailed instructions on how to respond".

Does the intellect of the hivemind increase with the number of people hijacked/compromised? Alternatively, is there a maximum number of people who could be hijacked simultaneously?

Are the goals of the hivemind known?

Is it required that at least one individual be hijacked for the hivemind to remain conscious? Phrased differently, if the hivemind no longer contains hijacked individuals, only compromised individuals, is the hivemind in an effectively comatose state, and are there any conditions that could "wake" it again?

**** The player is average and has no notable social power. The player is also the only person aware of the hivemind's existence. The hivemind's goals are unknown, but it's psychologically human, aside from its increased ability to multitask scaling with multiple hijacked bodies (reminiscent of Taylor in Worm).

If the hivemind only contains compromised individuals, and no hijacked individuals, it's still conscious, but it effectively has to "go in blind" - it has no new sensory data with which to decide which available people would be an optimal choice to hijack.

***** In this case, I'm not sure if there would be any way to stop it. No matter what the goal of the hivemind, flexibility and number of compromised individuals would be an asset.

- Remain blind the majority of the time.
- Briefly hijack a person to see their surroundings. Nobody remembers everything they are doing at every moment, and so this would not be noticed even if somebody has knowledge of the hivemind.
- If another person is near them, hijack again, then compromise by touching them. Otherwise, repeat again in an hour.
- Once a sufficient percent of the population has been taken over, hijack everybody and forcibly touch everybody remaining.

The hivemind would effectively be modeling itself as an infectious disease with no cure, next to no symptoms, and a very high infection rate. The only way to prevent this would be with a short-term goal, which would require the hivemind to reveal itself.

****** This is exactly what I would do as the hivemind.

It might be more fair if the player gets some special power and/or gadgets which allow them to

1: identify whether someone is compromised regardless of whether they're currently hijacked

2: uncompromise someone without having to murder them

Even then, in a world with billions of people in it, there's no realistic way to find everyone. There needs to be some sort of limitations, like maybe there is only one town or city where it can use its power and it has some goal there it's trying to accomplish.

*** I'm not really sure there's any way to prove to people in power that this a real threat without already being in power yourself, it would just be too hard to get anyone to take this seriously. Provided the hivemind doesn't do too many stupid things I don't see it being beatable, but having the non-episodic memories of hundreds or thousands makes incompetence unlikely.

Given I don't see you stopping this your best bet is probably to attempt to get into a dialogue with it given there's probably not to many competent people for it to communicate with who actually know the situation. Maybe try to figure out it's goals and make sure it takes over the world in the best possible way, without just hijacking everyone in the world.\\
There are after all a great deal of considerable utilitarian benefits to consolidating the world through world domination, provided you can actually effectively control things and aren't incompetent and/or malicious.

*** This doesn't seem too hard, actually. The odds of victory are definitely stacked against us, but that just makes it interesting.

The biggest hurdle is the lack of general knowledge of the hivemind threat. For the first phase, this can, however, be ignored. The hivemind needs touch in order to spread, so the goal is to make physical contact taboo. I would do this by starting a plague. Get people to wear gloves, masks, etc, while in public, and close down those places where large groups of people gather. Perhaps even convince the public that this highly contagious illness causes memory loss as well.

The next step is to expose the hivemind. This requires laboratory examination of compromised specimens. Through random sampling, we can place people in scenarios where they have been instructed to behave contrary to the nature of the scenario. If the hivemind hijacks such an individual, it should become immediately obvious, and research can proceed from there in the normal manner. Of course, much of this is impossible without working with a trained team, and telling team members what we're doing risks informing the hivemind. We may be able to use compartmentalization to reduce the risk of the hivemind figuring out what we're up to. Even if the hivemind figures out what we're doing, it might not be able to stop us from exposing it anyways.

Once the hivemind is exposed and the touching taboo established, we're in a typical puppet masters scenario, and can proceed accordingly.

*** /(Other important things to ask would be: 1. how long is this hivemind's lifespan, 2. can it reproduce, etc. For instance, if it can live from centuries to millennia then it doesn't even have to switch to possession mode only for short periods to not be discovered --- it can start compromising babies, and keep them hijacked right until they die from old age; compromising all the new babies it comes in contact with in process as well. Eventually it will have agents in pretty much most, if not all, important governmental positions.)/

Well, depending on the information I have regarding this hivemind's personality and the behaviour it displays, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_for_Lya_%28novella%29][I may actually decide to aid it at conquering the world]] (or just not act against it, if it doesn't need my help). It would likely be in its own interests to be a benevolent dictator, and a benevolent and wise dictator would likely do much less harm to this planet's ecosystem and human civilisation in general compared to regular modern governments.

If I /have/ to somehow defeat it for some reason, however, I think I'd choose doing some of these:

- /(how much do I know about this hive mind, its current activities, its origin, etc? How do I know all this stuff?)/ Sell most of the property I own, anonymously hire a ghost writer and a PR agent, and weave all my unique knowledge about this creature into the produced book series. Some fans will go investigating its existence for fun and may accidentally discover some of its agents. And even if they don't, the story will still be useful to the general population once the hivemind /does/ eventually come out of the bag.
- 1. share my knowledge about this creature with someone crazy enough to believe it and clever enough to fight against it if I end up dead. 2. Try to make contact with it and establish myself as its supporter → gain its trust → 2.1. gain definite evidence about its existence and capabilities → simultaneously send that information to as many relevant representatives of different governments as possible, 2.2. find out where its core is located → try destroying it.
- try figuring out how it's communicating with its puppets, detect the signal, and triangulate its location.
- try hiring a group of hackers\software engineers to steal and analyse CCTV footage. Maybe hijacked bodies walk funny or behave funny, and that helps us find them. This will either show us where they are more prevalent or just help us find some individual compromised\hijacked people for surveillance, data mining, and research.
- if the hivemind is psychologically human, then maybe once it /was/ a regular human, and somehow managed to gain these new transformative abilities. In which case I'll try investigating how that was possible and replicate the effect on myself. One hivemind v.s. another would be a more adventageous battle to me, especially if the other hivemind doesn't know yet about my existence.
- start a cult of believers in its existence, write a Bible-like manual that's listing how to avoid getting compromised yourself (e.g. no personal contact with other people, staying away from places of high population density, a bunch of security measures, as much anonimity as possible, cell/chain-of-command structure, conspiracy of our own, etc). Though if all other options fail, this will be one miserable walkthrough by the time the hivemind takes over the majority of the world. This could be used for one of those crappy “prologue” chapters for time travel stories though.

** You have the Swappinator, a steampunk device with two bronze hat-like appendages, each connected to the main, rabbit-sized unit by thick coiled wires each about half a metre long.

Should you flip the lever on the main unit, the two largest brains under each of the hats swap their collective minds. How do you take over the world?

- "Brains" refers to biological clusters of neurons that biologists (of our world, uncoerced) consider to be brains.

- "Under" roughly encompases a 20cm diameter sphere below the hats. A brain does not need to be fully inside this sphere; as long as it touches, it counts.

- A brain may swap with itself, which does nothing.

- The process takes about 5 seconds, during which the swapped minds are effectively incapacitated. If the process is interrupted, both minds die.

- A mind can handle being transferred to any body, and its sensory input, to the extent that the original mind could. Your intelligence, memories and mental state are otherwise unchanged (though you may be weirded out). Physical restrictions on thought are bypassed; a human can swap with an insect, for example.

- Any physical damage to the brain you had before transferral no longer affects you, and any damage to the transferred-to brain now affects you, but lost memories and skills are not returned.

Presumably, a chain of deals gambit to get into the "best" body is the primary goal of the device namer. However, the supervillain "Brain Drain" has found their new favorite toy, using it to root out the corruption of the Academic Elites! Politely doffing your hat has never been so threatening!

Gasp! <Enter local hero's name here>, the Dean has eaten all the University's cheese, and there's a threatening note about lab rats, mazes and experimental ethics! Help us!

(There. That's the "Cut Lex Luthor a Check" option out of the way.)

edit: Also, you have technology that swaps "specific substance inside of another substance", can you generalize it? Heart surgery, for example? Or, maybe mining operations by swapping a small bit of gold in a rock with a gold vein in a mountain? Also, what happens when two things are vastly different sizes? Can fit massive brains into tiny skulls? Like, a whale and a hummingbird. Does this functions equivalent to teleportation technology? Maybe use bigger receivers and longer cable to swap people or cargo? If so, is the 5 seconds a feature of the length of the cable, or could a longer than 5 light second cable allow FTL signalling?

**** Swapping with nothing is equivalent to an immediate interrupt: death.

Swapping seems to be entirely non-physical, and you don't actually remember how you came to acquire this device, so it's probably not possible for you yourself to reverse engineer it. You're pretty sure you've never heard of anyone else having one, though.

Brain size is entirely ignored here. Any mind can fit in any brain.

You don't know why it takes about 5 seconds, but it's pretty odd to assume it's breaking the speed of light without, you know, having proof. If you want to build a 1.5 billion metre wire to find out, go ahead, but it seems like a lot of work for little immediate reward.

*** Using a trusted confederate willing to slum it in an animal body, I make a ton of money performing feats that would be impossible for any actual animal.

From there, I can /probably/ get in touch with someone rich, who I can get under the hat at gunpoint. I put them into the body of some kind of animal (probably a tortoise because they live a long time, can't easily kill themselves, and can't escape simple enclosures) and put either myself or my trusted confederate into their body. I bleed them of money in untraceable ways that I presumably have time to learn about, then have them invite over a close friend of theirs who we can repeat the process with.

At some point I have enough money to keep my rich people in "treatment"; it's actually some docile animal in that person's body whose care and feeding is dealt with by hospital staff. The animals are kept at a different facility, where they're fed and cared for through some automated system that I can service myself.

Further, even a rich person probably can't get the president to wear a dangerous looking hat without the bodyguards getting grumpy.

Your mindreading ability includes ability to see what they are currently thinking, the ability to examine their declarative memories (e.g. examine their recollection of what happened at their tenth birthday party, or what they saw in the memo they read an hour ago), and the ability to understand things or use skills they have via their implicit memories (e.g. the ability to speak their native language or any other languages they know, the ability to drive a car or ride a bicycle if they can drive a car or ride a bicycle, et cetera.

However, the most interesting actions would depend on what knowledge you can gleam that I don't already know the general shape of.

Obviously I'd also research into the cause, limits and manner of this ability. I'd get, at minimum, a CT scan, measures of fields (EM, gravity, etc.) around myself, an X-Ray, measures of latency of communication, and tests if anything blocks this ability, either physically or mentally (eg. tiredness, drugs).

Simple solution - teleport off the train along with a bicycle. Keep your feet off the pedals at first, and make sure you arrive in a fairly clear space (like an empty road).

Little bit trickier to teleport /onto/ the train, due to the lack of empty roads on the average train...

***** I'm assuming the Guardian does a certain amount of covering major political events; speeches and suchlike? If not, they certainly have contacts in major media houses who do.

The teleporter could try turning up in the audience of some political speech (or other event where news media will be present), and teleporting from one end of the crowd to the other in the background - while a news team is filming, of course. She can then provide evidence by asking the reporter to look at the original footage of that incident, and pointing out where and when the teleportation occurred.

This way, the camera handling and post-processing are all in the hands of people who have no motive to edit or manipulate the footage, and are likely known (at least by reputation, being in a similar field) to the reporter(s) she's trying to persuade.

*** How limited is the distance, how much can the teleporter carry, how often can the teleportation be performed, and does it require any specific equipment at the destination?

Goals:

- Public visibility. The more view the public has of your character, the harder it would be to disappear.
- Public credibility. You want to be having interviews with major newspapers, not tabloids. It needs to be something the becomes part of the background of how the world works, not something surprising.
- Socially acceptable role. You want the public to care about your character. Having a public that clamors for investigation would be the worst-case scenario. People accept what is normal, so you would want to choose a job that already exists. Courier jobs are accepted. Bank robberies, not so much.
- Detectability. The more detectable you are, the better. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, but you want your presence to be able to be excluded from crimes, or else your PR goes awful. If anybody on their cell phone can detect when you teleport (radio waves?) then it becomes easy to have anybody know that you weren't involved. If you do get imprisoned on a remote island, the public would still be able to find you. Last, it makes you useless for black ops, where plausible deniability would be key.

A good way to start would be with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Dollar_Paranormal_Challenge][Paranormal Challenge]], for an immediate $1 million. This would be spread wildly enough that you'd start to get publicity and credibility, and could start having interviews with larger publications.

From here, you want to transition to being essential to some community. For example, if your average speed is high enough, being a courier. Delivering radioisotopes to hospitals would be a steady job, and gives a good PR boost for fighting cancer. Alternatively, with a sufficiently high carrying capacity, you could be the drive mechanism for a power plant. Lifting 1 ton of water by 100 meters provides 1 MJ of energy. Do this 500 times per day, and you have lifted enough water to run a small town's power plant, at a fraction of the cost of coal.

The problem is there's no clear place to draw the line here because pretty much everything is too complicated to actually hold the pattern in one's mind, so you /have/ to allow quite a lot of vagueness but it's hard to say how much.

As for the part about the transfer area needing to be enclosed, since it works with the imperfect seal of cupped hands (and the seal is formed by the outer layer of the skin which is dead cells) it ought to work if you weaved your hair into fabric then made larger structures with that.\\

A loose translation of the source material that inspired this SMT: "An interdimensional entity wants to create new entities it can relate to, so it put together a basic training program to start some simple three-dimensional life-forms on the path to learning how to edit realities, starting with a reasonable set of simple-to-use macros in small training spaces. Which allow for making catgirls, because apparently catgirls are an interdimensional constant."

So if Our Hero were to eat a mouse and sent it to their pocket dimension, along with sufficient random biomass, they could give a mental command to turn it into a catgirl, and end up with a catgirl with the memories, skills, and personality of a mouse. ... Be a bit hard to get it back to reality without turning it back into a mouse, though, without further trickery.

***** Ah so it kind of sounds like it can only build stuff by copying qualities it's either seen before or that are easily imagined/already existent in the user. A user can easily make any possible humanoids because their psychology is pretty identical to their own in space of possible minds. Plus they can make things with the minds of animals by copying a existing animal mind, with the degree of change from the template being probably limited by similarity to the user and sample size.

Given the obvious first thing to do is build containers to allow you to bring through larger objects. The users who are competent will probably quickly begin creating lots of copies of themselves. Which raises the question, how do they get their powers? If it's due to any intrinsic quality, then once they start copying themselves they can have exponential clone growth. Of course given the powers seem to have granted by an alien god it may be a one off thing.

Still even if only one fork gets powers once you have a container, you can probably create multiple clones every minute, quickly amassing an army. However if you can tamper with what kind of humanoid body and mind you make then you can probably do better by creating clones that are improvements on yourself.\\
Assuming you're limited by the narrow range of human minds and humanoid forms, you would still do quite well. You could just max out every attribute creating an army of totally loyal super charismatic, genius, super soldiers. Hell once you've made the first genius it would make sense for them to actually be in charge since they're more competent, you would then spend all your time just making what the smarter people told you to make.

Given some of the nearby comments, I conclude that the interdimensional entity is going to want to limit the munchkinability of that particular strategy, to try to reduce the number of interdimensional-equivalents of Unfriendly AI. So the entity is probably going to tweak the rules for most versions of the experiment to require the user's living body to be the only such container possible. ...

The pocket-holder's built-in macros only have a limited sample-set of data to draw on; going straight for an intelligence explosion would probably require the holder to explicitly specify the necessary neurological hardware.

I was starting to wonder whether, and how long until, someone would display that level of ambition. :)

The interdimensional entity's goal is for the graduates of its program to be reasonably trustable and trusting entities, rather than all-ravenous singletons; it's come across far too many of the latter. So it abandons that universe to its fate and tries again on a new parallel timeline, with a slightly modified program: the only self-modification initially allowed is a relatively slight amount of stretchiness to relevant tissues, in order to allow the main part of the modification: If anyone with a pocket dimension wants to have their physical form changed more than that, they have to find someone else with a pocket dimension who they trust enough to edit them.

("And if /that/ doesn't work," thinks the interdimensional entity, "I'll try sharply limiting the size of the pockets, and have them slowly grow according to a rule that's as hard as possible to try to figure out and game.")

***** Are abandoned universes destroyed or left in the hands of the singleton? If the latter, or the manual doesn't warn of it, this second scenario is just a race for who can first capture another and modify them into a trustworthy editor, followed by the previous answer.

Keep track of the media on whether another nilbog goes public. Find superior alternatives to the global ecosystem that await your commands, but take care not to spend too many [[https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][anonymity bits]] by doing it particularly to the /local/ ecosystem. This assumes that cryptography is as for silicon robots - that examining a member of such a modified species does not necessarily allow you to command every member.

Obviously, still make a carefully hidden clone brain think tank. Also an alibi clone, but give it a self destruct option in case it would be examined, or obliviate it of the power's existence, or perhaps both if possible.

Try to find out spacewhale's selection criteria on a scale from random to every smart nilbog knows every other.

The third scenario works the same way except it's not quite as mission-critical to capture another. Depending on the rate of growth, this one ends in a dyson sphere or regular old AGI.

Actually AGI is also an option in the former case. I wonder how long a think tank of the correct person would take to solve FAI.

Also to be considered is that every nilbog is a nuclear power from the outset, and whether any of us can kill all of us, even those that tried to prepare against it.

Small amounts of chemicals that react with each other so you can blow holes in things, melt through things, etc. Preferably things that don't react with water or the oils on your skin though, as that would suck:

Really my most interesting and sort of out there idea was having medicine/drugs. Your stomach technically qualifies as being enclosed by your body, so you can pretty much always dose yourself with whatever you need.

In a worst-case scenario, where you've been captured by someone who knows about your power and has made a reasonable amount of effort to restrain you, keep your mouth open at all times, etc probably isn't able to keep you from dosing yourself with whatever fits in your stomach or, absolute worst case scenario, your veins.

***** "few places"

Almost everywhere is space. The bag of holding contains mostly silicon, trace metals, and infinite negentropy. This isn't just a lot of rocks. It's an unquantifiable amount of rocks, enough rocks to dyson all the suns, enough rocks to extend the lifetime of the universe indefinitely onwards.

****** It's only an unquantifiable number after an unquantifiable amount of time. In practice it's merely a small number of rocks, at a consistent but unimpressive rate.

I suppose if you're keeping it until the end of the universe, the rocks might be more useful, but it probably still won't sustain a massive colony.

**** The rocks are each slightly smaller than the bag opening, so about as quick as you'd expect them to funnel out given a random distribution. Sometimes two will try to come out and they'll get lodged, etc.

**** Assuming you wanted it thrown into the sun, rocks would pour out at a steady pace and be incinerated one by one. Or possibly more likely, the bag would be compressed by the stronger gravity so the opening would close and no more rocks could exit.

***** How does gravity work in such a scenario? Is the gravity inside the bag normalized to the surrounding gravity, or is it normalized to earth's gravity? If the latter, things will get pretty hairy pretty quickly, because the outward flow rate will probably be /huge/. If the former, the bag will probably go into a permanent supernovae (perhaps stopping when the sun is destroyed, I dunno). FYI, that is a VERY bad thing.

The rocks, of course, would not remain rocks. They would turn into superheated plasma. But then what? Does energy escape into the bag? If so the thermodynamics will be pretty damn odd. If not, how does the local sun physics react to a bunch of cold things spilling out?

OTOH, it's feasible that the bag would just float on the outer layer of the sun, because as a whole it's less dense than the rest of the sun. That might be the saving grace.

** There is a Harry Potter-inspired text RPG I play. Not English, so can't link the ruleset here.

GM will reward me with XP for each three new features of a spell or a potion I discover. Only positive knowledge (what it can do) counts, not negative (what it can't do).

Here's one that looks promising:

Potion of Levitation

Properties: violet liquid, tastes like apple-carrot juice with garlic

Effect: the character can levitate for 10 turns. In combat, he gets +1 action because of the acceleration.

Duration: 10 turns, starting from the turn when potion was drunk.

Counteraction: slowing spells (Impedimenta, Fatigo, Immobulus) stop levitation and the character has 2 actions per turn. (Two of those spells by default do -1 action, resulting in only 1 allowed action).

Brewing details: skipped

Side effect: -5 health-stamina (for scale, lvl 1 has 25, and a lvl3 like me -- which is the average -- has 45) for the duration. If the character has drunk a potion before the combat and it's effects are still active, you cannot drink this potion.

It's incompatible with water breathing potion, results in poisoning.

[[#s][Poisoning]]

[[#s][Time scale]]

For context: in combat, each turn consists or two actions.[[#s][Unnecessary combat system details]]

The question: design the experimental set. My char has some money, I have 2 of the potions and I guess can get 5 or so before DM will say that the shop is out of stock for me.

And before you ask: yes, there is a height limitation -- tested already. It's not even that high, but enough to get out of physical reach - however, ranged physical attacks are a thing.

**** Thanks for the help!

As a general rule, potions do not work on inanimate things. Except undead maybe. I will try dripping it on a feather, but that raises the question, why isn't the bottle floating.

Yeah, the DM has some notes on hidden features, and will answer any experiments from headcanon. (Or kill my character if I annoy her too much)

****** Transfiguration is nerfed, but I suppose I could catch animals easily.

Partial doses and mixing are both good ideas, I suppose I will try that even though I strongly suspect mixing 2 potions will result in poisoning anyway.

**** Nice idea. Broomstick combat just makes it harder to aim for both sides, resulting in dice rolls. Being able to cast 3 spells for 2 in this regard is an advantage.

If I can steal a broomstick, I'll try it. (Diagon Alley has been suffering from a zombie outbreak for at least since 2007, so can't buy it there.)
