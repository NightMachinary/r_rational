** Sweet. I've been waiting /years/ for this game. Still no estimated release date though.

*** Yeah, I kind of expect the game to just appear completed on Steam with no warning whatsoever.

But I'm glad that Marc has never made any promises on the release date, so I can actually be sure that if he ever does post one, he will be very certain to release it on the given date.

** For those who may not know, [[http://miegakure.com/][Miegakure]] is an ongoing Work In Progress to build a puzzle game where you move through 4 dimensions. It's been in development since 2009, but it looks like its release may be arriving soon!

** Ah yes, /Miegakure/.... Looking real cool, but...

At this point I might as well be taking bets as to weather or not it will come out before Half Life 3.

*** I'll take that bet. Miegakure getting outside funding means that Marc has some outside forces to account to, to actually release it sooner or later and he has completed multiple levels/worlds of the game. While Vale on the other hand is notorious for constantly delaying releases.

So I'd be willing to take a low-value bet that Miegakure will release before Half Life 3.

Them releasing by 2018 (Half Life's current expected release)? That's a different bet!

**** Wait, Half-Life 3 has an expected release date now? I figured that I'd have to revived from cryogenic suspension before I could see Half-Life 3.

******* Huh? Oh I was doing some stuff on that site at the same time, so I just posted the wrong link by mistake.

But what do you mean it's horrifying?

******** Oh, I thought you were always browsing sites embedded in an iframe, via some weird sort of webproxy. (Which would lead to pasting the webproxy's link by accident.) Good to hear that was unfounded.
