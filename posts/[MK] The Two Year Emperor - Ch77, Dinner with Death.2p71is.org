******* Afi is powerful, paranoid, and not omnicidal. I'm worried neither about him deciding to destroy everything nor him getting mindscraped. Anyone on the Prime Material Plane should be safe from black holes from his corner.

***** I think the gods are going to be pretty hush hush on the subject of "Thing that can kill a god". As to the Mindscrape, it is mind-affecting. I can't see why every person who has been through FLEA wouldn't keep a permanent Mind Blank on for quick and easy immunity to that, plus a contingent Mind Blank and or Programmed Amnesia in the event of a Mindscrape.

It's really the most dangerous spell available.

** i wonder where you're going with this now- i just spent the past few hours catching up from about chapter 40ish. I really feel like the stories been finished, the worlds been saved etcetc-

however, some questions:

how long until Jake's 2 years are up?

is this the end? are there any plot points needing to be resolved still?

what skills did you develop as a writer during the writing of this story?

(and i'm really considering purchasing your short story)

*** The author addresses those exact points (at least the two story related ones):

#+begin_quote
  how long until Jake's 2 years are up?
#+end_quote

Each section of the recent chapters have the current date of Jake's reign when the events happen so...

#+begin_quote
  is this the end? are there any plot points needing to be resolved still?
#+end_quote

Chapter 72 talks about the state of the story with regards to Jake and the other nobles. In short it's they're so massively overpowered now that there's not really any actual threats left so Book 2 is mostly about the regular people who are suddenly powerful, also Suze and her dealing with the mantle of Death.

*** u/eaglejarl:
#+begin_quote
  how long until Jake's 2 years are up?
#+end_quote

101 weeks as of the end of chapter 71. The events of Book 1 took 20 days.

#+begin_quote
  is this the end? are there any plot points needing to be resolved still?
#+end_quote

Chapter 71 was the end of Book 1...actually it was the end of Books 1-3 if you go by wordcount.

This is not the end. The rest of the story relates to the fallout of Book 1 -- the reconstruction, and Suze's growth into her new office. There might be some reappearances of old villains, as well. (hint, hint)

I have an additional 'story' entitled "Not a story: FAQ for The Two Year Emperor"; you can see it if you go to my profile page. I would link to it but Fanfiction is pooched right now. All of these questions and a bunch of others have been answered there. You might want to follow that 'story' so that when I update it in future you'll get the new Q+A's.

EDIT: It's back. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10838202/1/Not-a-story-FAQ-for-The-Two-Year-Emperor][Here's the link.]]

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Foreshadowing, editing, and pacing.

Cool, I'm glad to hear it. One note: it's on sale through SendOwl. SendOwl is a service that manages the digital download and any necessary retries. The actual credit card processing is done by Stripe, which is the standard payment processor used by plenty of high-profile sites.

I mention this because a few people have balked at putting their credit card details into a site that they hadn't heard of before. At some point I'll likely turn "One Hot Night" into an ebook and sell it through Amazon, but that time is not on the current horizon. Also, when I do it will cost more than the current $1.99.
