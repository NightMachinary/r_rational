** In the end, Charlie and Wonka never got out of their pickle.

...

If Mahuika doesn't vape anymore, is she even still Mahuika?

...

On the one hand, her lack of true autonomy, perfect willingness to follow the instructions of others without misinterpretation and refusal to engage in anything too complicated makes her a suitable human substitute for a world-controlling AI and/or preserved vegetable god.

On the other I just want her to feel the feeling for Marama.

Maybe they can go stargazing with Tide's family.

** This has been one of the funnest and most gripping rides I can recall reading. Hot damn. The masterful tone shift starting with the Keerthi chapters, suddenly realizing that you are very much trapped in a cursed mansion under the control of an untouchable lunatic who wants you dead. The contestants struggle to resist until they're picked off, leaving Tide to try her best to pick up the pieces, but of course she can't defeat this almost-empty shell, and all of the masks are destroyed, the endgame has begun. I will admit, the sudden tone reversal into this heroic "all of the contestants are alive and awoke a rebellion throughout the factory to learn his exact plans and try to stop him" stuff, that still felt a bit out of place. Same could be said of this fairytale epilogue. Buuuuut, I can't bring myself to care too much, because seeing the heroes win, and seeing the murderous little fuck from the beginning marry Keerthi, the beacon of goodness herself, and be ashamed of his former self, it just feels very nice. Definitely gonna try to spread this one around.

** That was...truly wonderful. It was a wild ride from start to finish, and I think this may be one of, if not my favorite fan fictions I've ever read. I could attempt to nit pick, though most of the story makes no sense, so I really don't think it would matter. My only real complaints is that there's not enough of it, and that there were a lot of unexplored plot threads (Chillenial Lee, the kid who created the AI, the president, etc.). Finally, I'm not sure if I would have had the final chapters...kind of go off the deep end, but it was enjoyable regardless.

Also...how are you holding up Gazemaize? I know you were experiencing a lot of problems, though you deleted the chapter mentioning them so I won't say/ask too much in the way of specifics. Hopefully writing this story and your fan's support helped you get through some rough times, and I hope things get better and you find a point in which you receive some stability and relaxation. Thank you making me feel feelings and for writing such a plexicated and gloriumptious story!

** I think I found a very clever reference at the end there.

There's a book called a Girl named Poison, which has similar themes of a character becoming the world's 'author' and interacting with 'people' she creates.

Much like chili and the chocolate factory, the story went through several huge tonal shifts. It started as a girl running from an abusive household, to a heartwarming adventure with the guy who saved her, to eldritch horror as all the puppets she created as author begged her to take care of herself; since if she dies their entire world ceases to exist.
