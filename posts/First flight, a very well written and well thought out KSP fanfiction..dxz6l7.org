I found the worldbuilding wonderfull with some very nice thought put into alien life, although mostly it's unrealisticly humanlike but I don't think that's a big deal if the world still makes sense. Somewhat slow paced.

** Best KSP fanfiction I've seen so far is the first part of SevenEves.

If you stop after they get to the moon fragment you really won't lose anything important. The rest is typical late-Stephenson mary-sue stuff.

***** Ah you see but those aren't Phone and Phone Bad

The whole "kids today tweeting instead of surviving the apocalypse smh smh" plotline was real boomer brain shit, and so was the way the two factions just became a continuation of the cold war after what's her face decided to just Be Evil for no particular reason.

And then later they have a realtime augmented reality pilot HUD headset with no more processing power than like a z80 or something because kids today are just spoiled by all the clockspeed or whatever.

******** In 1985 I was already looking forward to today. My favorite SF novels predicted the Internet, in various forms. I got into the always-online thing as soon as I could, even if that meant a Palm VII and you could only access special "WAP-enabled" websites.

This quote from an interview is telling:

#+begin_quote
  The Gargoyles in Snow Crash are kind of in a different category from the Metaverse users, because they're using what we would now call an augmented-reality device. But I think we sort of are there already with smartphones. The real question isn't whether it's going to happen but how artfully it's going to be done, and can we make it better than it is now? More social, more elegant, and just more conducive to healthy society, healthy interactions? The practice of going around hunched over a rectangle in your hand is completely normal now, and when I see somebody in a car or walking down the street hundreds of feet away, I can tell that they're texting just by their posture. We all can. It's what we've turned into because of the particular way that we're connected through technology. I'd like to think it can get better than what we have now.

So I guess he was already a luddite, just hiding it.

********* Thanks, that's a fascinating article. I think it's more complicated than just being a Luddite. But then, so were the Luddites themselves in the first place. They weren't smashing machines because they just hated machines, they were smashing the machines their bosses were using to oppress and impoverish them.

There's definitely something to that speculation in the article, "My best guess is that he was somewhat tired of hearing us engineering geeks rave about Snow Crash as a grand vision for the future. That may have something to do with Snow Crash being a dystopian vision." Snow Crash isn't Star Trek, it's not supposed to be something to look forward to, not something to actively try to create. And Stephenson's spent most of his adult life watching his darkest predictions for the world come true.

********** The world of Snow Crash is messed up, but there's technology in Snow Crash that evokes a good deal of hopefulness. And what's messed up about the world of Snow Crash appeals to some people with terrible visions.

On the other hand, if you'll permit some speculation.... there's also a lot in Star Trek that's messed up. The way they treat AIs is horrifying. Data is a thing, not a person. They have much more effective AI technology than they admit if it's so easy to generate AI in the holodecks. It's like the big computer systems are at the verge of awareness or even over the edge and only held in check by “safety protocols” and it's some big secret nobody's willing to admit.

On the gripping hand, William Gibson doesn't see the world of Neuromancer as a dystopia.

*********** The star trek world also seems to have all the tools needed for immortality, but as far as I can tell they actively avoid exploiting them for that purpose.

********* I honestly agree with that quote and not sure it means a particular dislike of smartphones though I can see how it could be evidence for that in a wider context. I think that the amount of technology is more of an opportunity than a problem but I also think that the culture surrounding it is flawed and often tech allows us to enable bad habits because of how we use it. I think governments should put more money into researching how to fit tech into a healthy lifestyle or build one around technology.
