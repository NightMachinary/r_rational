*Summary:* Red had always loved dragons. He wanted them. He dreamed of them. He desperately awaited the day he'd get a charmander, something that would one day reign as a mighty charizard. Unfortunately Red ends up with something quite different. Something cute. Something... cuddly. In a world where size is power and innocence is weakness, it will take all of Red's power to survive.

** This is a new fave. I was slightly worried it would be gratuitously violent from the first few chapters like some of the 'pokemon for adults' fics I've read where it starts to border on sadism, but this story treads the line well imo.

Already looking forward to the next update.

*** Well there is some violence, but not for violence's own sake. And we try to balance it with humour and character interactions. Glad you enjoyed it.

** Of *course* it ends right before the battle! "Pewter Gym at last", indeed.

Still, loving it so far. Team Misfit FTW.

** This sure was needed after not one but two heavy emotional arcs (I find it hard to believe that the story before viridian forrest was about the gang just goofing around on their way to pewter). I kinda wish it went on for a little longer tbh. Just a whole chapter dedicated to red spending time with his new pokemon and to have Mia, Scyther, and Growlithe get acquainted with the group.

I find it hilarious that red just wakes up to being rich without ever realizing how close he was to getting buried in a legal nightmare by the guy that paid him. Also, woohoo, assbutt be coming back!

Its also a funny coincidence that this story and origin of species have a concurrent story thread about a soon to be revealed mystery pokemon. I keep thinking that porygon is gonna make an appearance here, even though that makes no sense.

Loving the story, see you all next time. Stay safe!

*** Thanks for your review!\\
We initially planned to have the gym this chapter, but in the end we just kind of wanted to let Red relax. A break from the last two acts, which were quite intense. So we focussed on character interactions and some lore. Some never made it into the chapter (for example at first Mawile robbing the shopkeeper of pokepuffs and then getting irritated when he kept following her and subsequently trying to make him leave by paying him with one of his own ---was a scene in itself. But ultimately, while Scyther's thought process was a little heavy and things did happen, this chapter was about Mawile doing Mawile things, Shellder doing Shellder things and Growlithe doing what he always does (Fall in love with someone who is really not good for him)
