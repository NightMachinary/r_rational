** I like this new mix of heroes and villains, it's got a vibe going with it. 50 bucks someone tries to get Masego sloshed and dresses it up so when he awakens it looks like he slept with Archer.

*** I don't think the Dreads have any tradition of inheritances. Rather, the position is always /seized/. I don't think we've ever heard of a child taking it from a parent, even.

**** IIRC when Cat was learning about history early in the story it was mentioned that there was one like of Dread Emperors that did inherit it from their parents, which lasted for three generations before their enemies completely destroyed them and murdered the entire family.

**** That's a good point. I forgot about that. A child taking power from a parent is a pretty classic story though. I'd figure it would have to have happened at some point.
