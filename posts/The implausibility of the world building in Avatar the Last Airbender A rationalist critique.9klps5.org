*1. Bender Homogeneity of Nations*

This critique actually arose after I tried to world build a world of various magical powers along sect lines, and ran into a problem which in retrospect seems as glaring as day, but which is otherwise not easy to notice.

To draw an analogy, imagine you had four nations: Tailor Nation, Smith Nation, Carpenter Nation and Mason Nation, with each nation populated solely by craftsmen of the namesake of the nation (ie all the tailors in the world are in Tailor Nation, etc). In this kind of world, Tailor Nation would have a desperate need for smiths, carpenters, and masons; and similarly for the other nations. e.g. For Tailor Nation to get a Smith would be of enormous economic benefit to the nation - they'll finally be able to smith tools! Each nation would hence try to attract people from the other nations, and because of the demand for these other professions, smiths, carpenters and masons would want to go to Tailor Nation since they'd earn more there than in their home nation. They'll then start moving to these other nations until ultimately the distribution of these professions would be the same across all the nations. And if people are not allowed to go to another country, each country would want to train professionals of each type. This is just a result of economic incentive. And as the professions become spread equally to all four nations, the four nations would stop thinking of their nation as being of a particular profession.

The world of Avatar has a similar situation. At the start of the war, each of the four Bender types is represented only in one country, and they can't replace each other in their abilities, and there's uses for each of the Bender types. Earth benders in the water nation could produce lasting homes. Water benders in fire nation could carry away superheated waste water from their industry. Fire benders in water nation could keep the water nation from freezing to death as well as jump start the industrial revolution elsewhere, and air benders in fire nation would enhance the quality of their metallurgy from blowing hotter fires. Because of the potential benefits of doing this, benders should go to where they would be in higher demand and the four nations would go out of their way to recruit benders from other nations, until ultimately all four nations have the same proportion of each Bender type. And then you'd no longer have a Fire Nation, a Water Nation etc. the Fire Nation wouldn't be the only industrializing nation, it wouldn't have such a strategic advantage over the other nations, and it wouldn't be strictly fighting non fire benders, it would instead be soldiers of all four Bender types fighting against soldiers of all four Bender types.

In such a setting, then, when the avatar fights against the fire nation he would be fighting against not only fire benders, but air, water, and earth benders, who would be able to team up to perform surprising or synergistic tactics, and thereby be a much more significant threat to the Avatar. Given that the Avatar's primary advantage is the versatility of his abilities, any nation that fielded multiple types of benders on the battlefield would easily be able to vanquish any nation that didn't, which would be a military driver for all four nations to diversify their Bender types (if the economic incentive for some reason didn't suffice), or would lead to the replacement of any nations insisting on a single bender type, with nations that had a mix of all bender types.

Even if the nations were single element at the start of the story, the fire nation should want to impress benders of the other types into its own armed forces because of the tactical advantages doing so would offer. Even if the benders are unwilling, if the fire nation captured their family and threatened to torture or enslave them should the benders refuse to cooperate, I would expect at least a portion of them would agree to do so.

That's what you'd expect from even the most basic understanding of economics, but the world of Avatar doesn't look like this, for no good reason. The very fact that the world of Avatar has nations along bender lines is the most damning indictment of the setting as implausible.

*2. Walls*

The point of walls made of stone is to provide secure, sturdy shelter, including protecting one's belongings from getting stolen, or from being attacked. But in Earth Nation, literally every bender is an earth bender, meaning any one of these people can treat your house like it's rice paper. Any of them can go into your home and loot your belongings, or kill you in the middle of the night with little or no advance warning. In Earth Nation, therefore, all the people who aren't destitute would make their homes out of something else - like wood. But that's not what you see in the depiction of Ba Sing Se. And in Water Nation, literally every bender can bend away the ice walls of your home, making them all the perfect thieves and assassins... so any Water Nation dweller would build their home out of something else for better security.

[[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Bending_arts#Inheritance][Bending is at least partially spiritual rather than genetic.]] If some isolated firebenders move to the Earth Kingdom, they'll be influenced by Earth spirits, and some or all of their bending children will be not firebenders but earthbenders.

You can make a case that there should be a constant, gigantic stream of back-and-forth migration between all the nations to make up for the deaths of immigrant benders, or that each nation should have within itself persistent pockets of immigrant benders large enough to sustain their own spirits and cultures and therefore their own bending---but mass migration across huge distances doesn't seem very realistic for low-tech, agrarian societies, and it may be that even city-sized pockets of immigrants are insufficient to supplant the native spirits without violence done against the native environment by the invaders. It seems much easier to say: "Barring the wholesale destruction of Earth people, culture, and environment in the area (as executed in the Fire Nation colonies, and as attempted across the entire Earth Kingdom by Phoenix King Ozai), the spirits in the Earth Kingdom are powerful enough to convert most Earth Kingdom inhabitants to Earth affiliation, and all or nearly all benders born in the Earth Kingdom are earthbenders."

Yeah but remember that bending is still fairly rare. A bender usually won't be unemployed and as bending is still partially genetic, benders are often children of other benders and almost always require a bender to teach them how to actually use their powers. The chance of a bender coming along that can use their powers effectively and also has no connections/opportunities to make a better life for themselves legally is very low.

People typically don't become criminals when placed in situations like this. There is corruption and people abusing their position but petty crimes and murders aren't common from benders, certainly not enough that building houses the hard way is worth it for the absolute majority of the population.

***** I wish it was. I really, really wish it was.

​

Unfortunately, it isn't actually so. Rather, technological development was simply far faster in the four nations than it was in our own world due to their particular brand of magic lending itself very well to industry.

​

First off, a major inhibitor in technological advancement has often been energy consumption, and progress stalls until new energy methods come along to allow for progress to continue (I've even heard it go so far as to have people day that 'Industry is just the story of humans getting better at making fire'). In the world of ATLA, there is no such inhibitor, as there's entire countries that can create fire out of nothing, who can power waterwheels by waving their hands, and move literal tons of raw materials with virtually no effort. As such, transport and energy difficulty are both vastly reduced with this system. In addition, at about the same time as their Industrial Revolution, Metalbending was also on the rise, which only further allows industry to move on at essentially light-speed.

​

So it is indeed possible that they could have had an Industrial Revolution taking them from circa 1800 to 1920 in 70 years- given all their advantages, though, I'm almost surprised they didn't get even further. I will still agree with you on the 'why' part, though. In a world with Benders, technology is largely redundant.

****** Perhaps I misrepresented my stance. If you are determined enough, it is possible to come up with /how/ it would have happened. After all, munchkining powers is like half of what this sub does.

The main issue I have is that it is entirely illogical for a world that relies entirely around very specific kinds of magic to develop precisely to 1920's Earth technology. Throughout the entirety of ATLA, every part of the technology was clearly developed from the perspective of a world that has these magical powers in it. Why, then, does Korra essentially throw out all of that effort and reduce everything down to "technology is identical to Earth, just we use Benders to generate power instead."

If I didn't know better, I would interpret Korra as particularly lazy fanfiction, rather than the "official" continuation of the series.

This is true *right now*. The vast majority of doors are incredibly easy to lock-pick (without using superpowers). People could turn their home into Fort Knox and /really/ protect themselves, but they don't because the cost of building a safer home is greater than the risk of some nutjob breaking in. I imagine it'd be the same in the Avatar world. Building an earth/ice home is much cheaper (and easier to repair) than building it out of some other material. The risk that some bender will go crazy or go on a stealing spree is always there, but for the majority of people it isn't a big enough concern to justify the cost of building a house some other way.

** I think you're drastically underestimating the impact of tribalism and nationalism in primitive cultures. The vast majority of people in each nation would have a mindset of "other nations are inferior". An earthbender would think that anything a firebender could do, they could do better. You don't need to be a firebender to start a fire, or an earthbender to build a wall. Also, and in relation to your second point, benders were quite rare. There weren't enough of them to change entire industries. The defining attributes of the four nations were cultural, not what they could bend.

I don't agree with your analogy of tradesmen. Every nation needs something akin to tailors, smiths, carpenters and masons, but the usefulness of the different benders is much less well defined.

You inadvertently pinpointed the core issue with the worldbuilding here: civilian applications of magic were not thought out at all. The 4 bending schools were meant to represent earth martial arts. Yeah, there aren't many useful applications for them on Earth, because they aren't magic, they're just fancy ways of waving fists and pointy sticks. But transforming them into magic gives a /ton/ of useful applications, and some of them were well defined, i.e. healing. Every kingdom's ruler and major noble would desperately want a water bender healer, and bigotry be damned. I'd say every nation would want an earth bender for an architect of their royal palace, but ironically earth's nation's architecture was the blandest of them all.

At the time of the show, the Northern Water Tribe was rather xenophobic, and the Southern Water Tribe had no healers to spare. The Northern Tribe only allowed women to be healers, and kept close control of their women. Is it at all likely that a Water Tribe healer would be allowed to leave? And if they left without permission, doesn't it seem likely that they would be dragged back? An escapee would need to cunningly fake their death, and then make it to an employer, who would need to treat the healer with enough respect that they could trust the healer not to kill the patient out of spite. And with the amount of racism and xenophobic paranoia we see in the show, that seems unlikely.

Yes. First, there were other waterbenders besides the polar tribes. Second, you're taking the world shown to us as a given, whereas OP (and me) is arguing that it's impossible for the world to come to that state. People trade and people love being paid. Healers would be showered in money and favors. There's incentive to regulate that, yes, but to prohibit? In any way, prohibition doesn't work, we know that very well from the real world examples.

Which is why I went on to address the scenario of an escaped waterbender healer who does get hired. There's a trust deficit caused by cultural xenophobia and suspicion of outsiders, which would prevent use of waterbender healers by any country rich enough to hire them.

I'm not ruling out:

- a mendicant waterbender moving from town to town, healing people.
- a mendicant waterbender moving from town to town, encountering King Bumi who has stubbed his toe, healing his toe, and then moving on

What I am ruling out is:

- a mendicant waterbender moving from town to town, encountering King Bumi who has stubbed his toe, healing his toe, and then being invited to Omashu to live a life of luxury: the waterbender would sense a trap.
- a mendicant waterbender being acquired by the Dai Li for the purposes of healing the Earth King, because the waterbender would object so much that the Dai Li would be opposed to allowing this unruly outsider to enter the Earth King's presence.
- a mendicant waterbender being captured by the Fire Nation Army and being forced to heal Fire Nation soldiers: the Fire Nation Soldiers would anticipate that the Water Tribe healer would have been trained in the arts of war, and would sicken the soldiers in order to allow the Water Tribe healer's escape. Thus, the Fire Nation soldiers would not use the healer.

*** Are we including Korra in this as canon (I do!!), because i think it supports OP in many ways. Given how all the characters go through DBZ style powerups (lighting and metal bending is now common) and we see the rebirth of all the legendary bending so much so that it's common place, I like to attribute this to the benders coming together and learning from each other. No longer an intellectually stale artform, I'd argue that lightning bending is a thing from merging air and fire (lack of control over power is a thing of air and Iroh), lava bending is from fire and earth as an example (control and unleashing of power)

Mako and Bolin are brothers yet one's a firebender and the other is an earth bender. I can't believe that two brothers who are so close would have such a different culture. Not to mention that Katara and Aang's kids developed Water and Air (and nothing) despite having a very mixed cultural upbringing. I'd argue culture is a thing of societies and two children from the same family wouldn't develop so differently if it was cultural. This implies genetic to me (though not quite your point), and raises a question of causation vs correlation. Are their personalities influenced by the type of bending they can do or the other way around (Meelo being an air bender raises a few questions)

Finally, Korra the avatar was bending multiple types of elements as a child (besides air)

The main characters only had one non-bender which gives us a very skewed idea of what the proportions are. Combine this with all the powerful recurring characters being benders, you get a very skewed sense of the world, either it's awfully unfair to non-benders (a la Amon) or most people are benders and the characters are representative of the underlying population. Besides Asami, the non-benders are mostly comic relief (think Sokka, Bhumi (aang's kid), the crazy merchant in Korra), so you can see how this is a very reasonable reading that bending is actually quite common. We have no explicit statistics nor do we see an inherent class system (outside of Amon's season) to read otherwise.

#+end_quote

I think you've got his point backwards. His point was not that certain cultures produce certain benders. His point was that the nations/benders don't intermingle due to the differences in culture.

I don't know how much of Korra you've watched, so spoilers for that ahead. The nations started out as cities/alliances of cities, with each being on the back of a lion-turtle that provided a certain kind of bending. At this point in the history, there was no intermingling due to the general danger of travelling as well as (iirc) prominent xenophobia. By the time that intermingling became viable, each nation/culture had been shaped by the bending that they had available/their location in the world. So we got the nomadic Air people, tribal water people, etc.

It's not difficult to imagine that, until somebody went out of their way to found a city that was basically an embassy for every nation, they stayed largely separate because of their cultural/philosophical/etc. boundaries.

**** You can't have it both ways. Either we're talking about the time before the hundred years war, which was well before the start of the industrialization of the fire nation, or after it when the political landscape is vastly different.

Benders aren't useful because they are rare. And powerful benders are even more rare. The show obviously focus' on lots of characters who are benders, but I think it's made obvious that they are a relatively tiny minority. There might be plenty of benders in the few big cities in the world, but most people are farmers in tiny villages that might have one or two benders. Aside from fighting, there's not much at all that benders can do that a handful of men can't accomplish with a days work. And there are a lot more of those groups of men than benders. It's no surprise that the economy of the world would be based on them.

That, combined with the tribalism that comes from generations of families living in one place, means people are far more likely to focus their efforts on their home village rather than traveling and seeking their fortune in the wider world.

Rationalism as a genre is usually focused on an individual or small group due to the simple fact that most people aren't rational. In fact, the average peasant is probably pretty stupid. Religion, mysticism, tribalism, heck, most war in general, isn't rational, but they are all staples of most fictional worlds histories.

#+end_quote

I'll pass on this. Bryke went out of their way in the director's commentary to mention that the aesthetic of Korra was strictly rule-of-cool and not exactly thought out. (I mean think about it, [[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Mecha_tank][metal-bending mechs]], really?) If I wrote fanfiction of it, I would work it in because it was interesting and 1920's style settings are hard to come by, but not because it was rational. Likewise, seeing as knowledge of electricity in the original canon is nonexistent, I would also ignore schizo tech in the first Avatar that was used for a one-off gag. Ba Sing Se might have plumbing, but it probably doesn't have toilets.

The fire nation was only early industrial revolution with coal and steam: fire nation ships have what look like [[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_22ZYl0hFu5U/SLJ_RIeesvI/AAAAAAAAASs/9RyDnKO7tcI/s1600/inside+the+fire+nation's+ship.jpg][gas lamps]] in them instead of electric lighting; in most shots fire nation residential buildings are only two to five stories tall, this is consistent for every nation except the air nomads, who, ironically, seemed to be the only ones to build primarily with stone. ([[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/a/aa/Sector_bajo.png/revision/latest?cb=20131226144759&path-prefix=es][Even Ba Sing Se seems to be mostly wood]], at least in the lower-class areas - it's only Omashu that uses stone heavily in both its architecture and infrastructure.) The Earth Kingdom is very clearly a set of at least two kingdoms, because we know both Kuei (in Ba Sing Se) and Bumi (in Omashu) exist. There might be some kind of hierarchy here that we don't get to see, but it's safe to say they're probably feudal. The fact that bending doesn't seem to be used to great effect in construction in the biggest city in the Earth Kingdom leads me to believe that there just aren't the same proportion of Earth benders to civilian as there are, say, water benders to civilian. In fact, the most non-benders we see in a given place are in the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom, and the most benders we see are in the Air Temples during the Aang's flashbacks. I'd put good odds on the civilizing factor of large societies dampening the influence of spirits or something of that nature.

Also:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The usefulness of benders is tough to pin down because most of them are conscripted into the military. It's obvious that at least some earth benders push carts for a living, but every available water bender at the north pole is probably serving in their army or as a healer. The same is probably true of the fire nation. And I can't really see any /industrial/ applications for air bending. I don't buy the whole conceit in Korra that lightning-benders could generate enough energy in electricity to meet even a fraction of the demands of an industrial society; the same should hold true for fire bending to fuel a steam engine or water bending to push a turbine - it might be good enough for /transportation/, like how the fire nation uses their hot air balloons, but probably not for industry. Think rowing a boat versus hand cranking a shaft to generate electricity. Even if it was, benders require years of training and probably don't enjoy monotony, in /addition/ to being rare, so you'd have to pay them tons of money. Which is why the fire nation was enslaving earth benders to mine coal for them rather than just fueling their growing economy with their fists and sheer rage.

I think something you're not considering is that while wooden walls might make theft from benders more difficult, it doesn't actually stop them. An earthbender can knock down a wooden wall, and a waterbender can slice through one. If you're poor, would you prioritize defending against rare benders when that defense is more costly, not particularly effective, and destroyed if they damage it sufficiently, or would you go for walls that can be raised and repaired in seconds and do the normal job of walls as well? The comparative costs and advantages don't make sense, especially if you don't have many valuables to steal in the first place.

I think theft would also be less common, since anyone you find in their home could kill or ensnare or with barely a second's notice, including the elderly. If your grandma never leaves the house, which would be common in rural/poor societies, a thief can't risk that they're a bender.

These aren't the same concerns rich people would have, but they could also have wood or steel surrounded by walls of earth/water that can be easily rearranged and repaired.

Also, since moving earth and ice would be so trivial to anyone who can afford to hire a bender, hiding your valuable possessions in underground vaults that are difficult to find would be easy. Toph is unique in being able to sense the shape of the earth around her, even if it's a teachable skill, so hiding valuables could be done fairly simply. If a thief wanted to get at said valuables, they would need to rip up the entire floor, which could take time and create noise to alert any guards or neighbors.

** I'm trying to think of equivalent situations in real life. The first thing that springs to mind is the Chinese embargo on silkworms. They managed to keep an incredibly valuable resource from falling into the hands of other cultures for a surprisingly long time.

Of course, that only lasted so long, and, subtle as silk moth eggs are, they're easier to spot than bending ability.

What about actual prodigious abilities? There are definite hotspots. The fastest runners in the world disproportionately have their origins in a single tribe in Kenya, the Kalenjin. A startling number of the scientists who worked on the development of the Atomic bomb attended the same high school in Budapest. An astonishing proportion of the greatest motorsport drivers in the world are Finnish.

While there's undoubtedly an innate hereditary component in the speed and endurance of the Kalenjin runners, they're not particularly genetically distinct from their less exceptional countrymen. It's therefore hypothesized that what's actually exceptional is their culturally instilled pain tolerance, engendered or at least exemplified by their absolutely brutal coming-of-age rituals.

If the Ashkenazim are innately more intelligent than anybody else (and all those Hungarian-highschoolers-turned-nuclear-physicists were Ashkenazim), it's hard to ignore that this seems to come at a price; they're undeniably more prone to genetic disorders--and indeed, the carriers for the recessive genes that cause some of these disorders may correlate with higher I.Q.

Another, more solid example of genetic mixed-blessings is sickle-cell anemia. Those who carry recessive genes for sickle-cell but don't have the double-dose necessary to express the disease are more resistant to malaria than people who have no genetic markers at all.

Finally, Finnish drivers may be so over-represented in international motorsports because Finland is a very dangerous place to drive. It's characterized by icy, hilly, wooded rural roads that are quite treacherous, and Finland has very high standards for licensing drivers.

So, what might be some reasons for regional differences in ability that wouldn't promote diffusion into a broader population?

With the Kalenjin, it appears to be culturally-specific rituals that carry a high enough cost not to be picked up by outsiders--the monastic asceticism and childhood tattooing of air-benders might be somewhat equivalent.

Congenital abilities coupled with costly drawbacks might only persist in areas where the environment mandates those abilities-- malaria resistance in one portion of the population at the cost of sickle-cell anemia in another portion is unlikely to be a trait that would persist for long outside of malaria-plagued regions.

The famed Ashkenazi intelligence may be related to either of these factors, or both; a costly in-group cultural focus on literacy or a genetic propensity for intelligence that comes at the price of higher rates of genetic disorders--either way, the anomaly is unlikely to persist outside of the insular community that puts an unusually high value on intelligence. Also worth considering--this intelligence was eschewed by industrial nations that /really/ needed it--the Germans and the Soviets--for purely cultural reasons.

Finally, the Finnish ability to drive seems to be engendered solely by the necessity of their environment, though I'm not familiar with much anthropological study of the subject.

Of course, all of these abilities are far less dramatic than "Can you casually hurl boulders around or conjur flames from thin air with a flick of the wrist, Y/N?"

But I think it's reasonable to imagine that such factors could play into an Avatar-like culturescape.

To my knowledge, we've never seen a avaricious airbender; the cultural asceticism necessary to develop airbending might not be compatible with a personality that finds contentment stoking blast furnaces in a Fire Nation factory.

Waterbending seems only to manifest in regions where it's necessary for survival--polar ice caps and swamps. Maybe a single recessive gene for waterbending yields Katara, but if you get a double-dose you end up with someone with horrible mental deficiencies like Sokka?

The most obvious explanation for the heterogeneity of firebending is old-fashioned xenophobia. This could explain why other bending styles aren't pursued within that culture and why other nations seem to lack the genetic basis for cultivating that skill. Sure, the other bending techniques might've been useful, but costly cultural signaling is an astonishingly powerful force. As far as we can tell, the Norse settlers of Greenland /didn't eat fish/, presumably because of cultural taboos because no other reason seems sufficiently insane.

As to your point on walls...didn't a lot of Asian cultures use rice paper as a major construction material, just because it was cheap? I'm pretty sure most medieval peasants in Europe didn't have locking doors.

Come to think of it, my back door is made primarily of glass, and I (a rank amateur) can pick most residential locks in under 30 seconds.

Criminals aren't deterred by the actual robustness of building materials. They're deterred by the social consequences of crime. Likewise, building materials aren't selected for their ability to keep other people out; they're chosen for their price, resistance to the elements and other functional considerations.

** Only got time for a new nitpicks. Given that both Water Tribes in the show live at the poles, they have no need for earth benders. In their world, ice already is a lasting, durable material that they have perfect control over, and any earth is buried so deep under the ice, that it is never seen.

Immigration on the levels you are speaking of here, is also probably incredibly difficult for people at the start of the series. Most people, benders or not, are simple farmers living in simple cities. Mass transport simply doesn't exist, and the only people with good ships or technology are the Fire Nation. In fact the Fire Nation was poised to use their tech to usher in a new age of movement and cultural blending... But they choose to use it to go to war with the world instead, so we don't get to see that happen.

Of course oncre the war is over, the presence of all that technology makes cultural blending much easier... And that's what Legend of Korra is about.

Neither did it exist in medieval times, but given the massive potential to turn a profit, people would have underwent the journey.

**** But who says that one single firebender would be able to teach benders in the Earth Kingdom how to firebend? Where would that person find students? All the new, young firebenders would be born back in the Fire Nation, where they would probably have access to much better tutors, and all of the benders born in the Earth Kingdom, would be Earth Benders. The original canon is a bit fuzy on this regard, when it comes to whether bending is spiritual or genetic, or some mix of the both, but even in Legend of Korra where significant mixing has occurred, people who can firebend still have at least one firebending/fire nation parent. Bending isn't just a skill one can learn, with elements just being trades (which is where the original metaphor fails). One's ability to bend, and the element one bends, are both innate qualities, that cannot be changed (which is what makes the Avatar so special; only they can bend more than one element).

Also, my main point is that, from what we see from the Poles in canon, it is extremely hard to find any earth. In fact, from what we have seen, there might not be any Earth there at all; from what I remember from the show (and Korra) there are ice tunnels and caverns that go significantly deep underground. The only Earth I remember ever seeing was in the spirit gardens which, being spirit gardens, could just have been magical areas created by the spirits, for the spirits. It seems likely that the poles in Avatar are both like the North Pole in our world; two floating masses of ice, with no actual rock or stone underneath.

And also, why would a society of primarily water-benders want earthen walls, instead of ice ones, when they live in a society where ice never melts, and they can use their water bending to repair ice walls a lot easier than they could earthen ones? Earthen walls may be sturdier, but given how easily a single water bender can manipulate their ice walls to create stairs, doors, pathways, etc... is probably a lot less economic for a society's whose main concern is foreign invaders, rather than internal strife.

And if bending is at least semi-spiritual (as it is heavily implied to be in canon, and by the creators comments after the fact), most earth benders would greatly dislike living in a place so acutely cut of from their element. At least for Earth - Water Tribe transitions, I think there are too many barriers in place to make that any kind of profitable, especially considering the fact that there might not be any earth to bend at any of the poles in the Avatar universe, and that the Water Tribe doesn't really have any use for earth-benders when it comes to construction.

I think the original Trade metaphor has muddied the waters a lot. 1 fire-bender, or water-bender, or earth-bender, couldn't move to a new nation, and open a school teaching their style of bending and start a business and create a whole new industry. Not only would they have to bring with them a lot of their country men, in order to preserve the genetic aspect of their bending (so that it passes on), they would also have to transplant significant amounts of their culture as well, in order to make certain those kids born with the potential to become benders, actually become benders. And at this point, the leadership of wherever hey are moving to might start seeing this endeavor less like a business venture, and more like a foreign power trying to set up a colony.

Plus benders are actually quite rare in this setting, to the point where, in the original canon, a semi-average sized village might only have one or two, and it was actually plausible for the Fire Nation, in acts of war, to try and exterminate/round up all the benders in an area to try and kill off the ability.

So you would need a lot of transportation (to transplant enough people to start a self-sustaining micro-culture), and a whole lot of incentive to convince highly spiritual people (benders), to leave a place immersed in their culture and spirituality, and go somewhere foreign. And I argue that that kind of transport technology was only created by the Fire Nation... right before they went to war. And that kind of incentive, was only created by Aang when he, as the Avatar, beat the Fire Lord, and started campaigning for the need for the nations to come together, creating Republic City.

You're like the guy who asks why the Jedi don't teach everyone how to use the Force, except there are four flavors of Force here and only one person at any given time can use all of them.

Earthbenders can't learn how to bend fire, water, or air. Non-benders can't learn how to bend anything at all: bending is something you've got or you don't, and if you have it then it's a matter of learning how to use it well, just like you can teach running to a person who has legs but you can't teach “has legs” to someone who doesn't have legs.

So you'd still see stuff like rulers paying a lot for a water bender healer to come around, but by the time of the show a large war would have resulted in the borders going back up and each nation reverting to a single style.

That's because the Chinese had arable farmland and thus cities (which makes having horses a lot less useful than on the Mongolian steppe) and thus the ability to have a centrally planned kingdom.

** I think your first point is the strongest. I'm not particularly sure how useful fire and air benders would be, although being able to make sailing ships go far faster would be handy, but earth and water benders would be extremely useful. Water has healing, which would be amazingly useful in such a society before the invention of antibiotics and anaesthesia. Couple that with their ability to pull fresh water out of the air in the middle of the ocean, and catch fish with almost trivial ease, and water benders would be amazingly wealthy and welcomed in every corner of society. Earthbenders could build homes, levees, roads, bridges, wells, mountain paths, just about anything structural that a society could need. Their ability to reshape terrain on a large scale if given enough time would also make them indispensible for any nation that wants secure borders.

*** I think with some high level techniques yet to be developed that firebenders could be the most offensively powerful class of bender.

Firebending isn't just about fire. It's about heat, light, life, and explosive power. If an earthbender can make instant lava, I see no reason a firebender couldn't shoot a plasma beam or something.

Airbenders could probably do stuff with vacuums and shock waves, which is obviously pretty powerful if you can make them have the force of a grenade or more.

Personally, I'd rank earth and fire benders as strongest, followed by air and then water. I know water has bloodbending, but most people can only use that on a full moon if ever. On the other hand, shooting blades of sharp ice through the air is pretty good, so as things stand (currently airbenders can't do powerful explosions with air pressure) I guess the bottom spot would indeed be taken by Air. Water is more deadly on a small scale, but if airbenders can figure out air grenades then they join the big boys, and Water just doesn't seem capable of the large scale destruction the others could without many benders. It's too targeted.

**** All 4 Bending Arts are dangerous if you know how you want to use them. With water comes the power of erosion and you've seen water jet cutters right? Those are basically erosion tools highly focused to a massive degree in the use of water though small, but with water benders you can basically scale it up without requiring larger equipment. And since water is a liquid in most occasions as well as it being a fluid, its motion is highly dangerous which leads into erosion and much more. It can cause rain, it can dehydrate, it can blood bend, it can suck the water out of plants; why not out of humans, you also have the ability to basically flash freeze things the instant you freeze water around it (this can affect blood as well). Then there's the problem in where humanity/man might follow our world's rules in survival, 3 days without water is a death sentence and if you're able to take away the water then you take away the motive to move around be it militarily, survival, or for travel purposes. IF you can affect water in a myriad of ways, why not basically affect the rain, snow, or hail to where it becomes razor hail. (A Phenomena seen in Gears of War, not the bending things into razor hail...)

I'm just saying with the right ideas, water can be just as dangerous as the other elements. Erosion is dangerous why do you think we have to repair/maintain things so much.

** In Last Air Bender we're seeing the tail end of a hundred years of war which wiped out the Air Nomads, and devastated the Southern Water Tribe to the point they're in a post apocalyptic state with no ability to properly train their one remaining water bender, fostered extreme nationalism in the fire nation, and hate of the fire nation in pretty much everyone else. The only two powers who could in theory be swapping benders at scale in any form otehr than forced conscription of conquered people would be the Earth Kingdom and the Northern Water Tribe, but the Northern Tribe appears to have reacted to the sacking of the South with isolationism and trying to keep out of the line of fire. And the Fire Nation seems to (weirdly) have naval superiority over the Water Tribe so travel is dangerous.

Even then we do see some remnants of internationality bending. The Foggy Swamp water benders live in Earth kingdom territory and practice a distinct style of water bending, and the Sand Benders live in an isolated desert and appear to have learned to mimic some air-bending like methods with earth bending. The Kioshi warriors use fans in their martial arts, which in context looks a lot like they're adapting Avatar Kioshi's air bending to non-bending styles.

​

Then in Legend of Korra, we see exactly the kind of muti-disciplinary bending and industrial boom that wasn't happening during the war and we find out that bending isn't straight up genetics as people with no known air nomad heritage start spontaneously gaining air bending.

​

As to walls.

I expect cost is more important than resistance to direct attack by a bender, for much the same reason we still make windows out of glass, and most doors can be battered open with a hand ram. Especially since the kind of design it'd take to make a house that can withstand a giant flying rock probably doesn't come cheap or comfortable. Historically buildings are usually made out of what's readily available and designed to withstand local weather more than to be vandalism-proof.

And now the bridge to the spirit world thing is /literal/. What used to be a story vaguely based on real Asian mysticism completely detached itself from that inspiration.

** I think OP needs to bring Korra into his argument. A lot of what he's brought up seem to be supported (in a roundabout fashion, maybe even needing a fan theory or two) by Korra's season.

Things like the insane development of tech in Korra (which I attribute to the mixing of ideas), the resurgence of legendary bending, to becoming common place (metal and lightning are good examples, but we also see Bolin lava bend, Zaheer fly, Tenzin's daughter Spirit bend? and of course Mako gender bend).

I'm not sure about the spiritual aspect of bending. Aang and Katara's kids were Air, Water and nothing (until he became air powered too). Bolin and Mako were earth and fire despite being brothers and super close. Given the mixed culture of republic city and mixed marriages why did Bhumi (who seems very similar to OG Bhumi and Bolin) not become an earth bender. Why is Meelo who doesn't seem like a typical air nomad not become a earth bender. Why do children of non-benders not seem to develop bending powers more often (I think Toph is a good counter example, but then we have Asami). How does Katara develop ability in so many different elements barring air till she get's some training?

I agree that racism and lack of transport technology explains a lot, and the Fire Nation can in many ways be read loosely as an allegory of British occupation of Asia (Earth Nation), which is why there wasn't a lot of movement, but OP does bring a lot of points. In india, spices, wealth and sand were siphoned to britain, china got the opium treatment and had it's tea and gunpowder formulas stolen, most of SEA was occupied by the Brits. In this world, when you could have people that could divert water and build walls, I'd have expected far more slavery. Or if that was abhorrent, the situation of the gulf where poor workers are paid a pittance to risk their lives. Technology asymmetry should result in some serious exploitation.

Finally, the avatar is a problem here. Given his/her huge cultural significance, it's a bit trickier to be racist when you have a mythical figure who's had equal representation over history. They're much more connected than the current world and it should've prevented racism at the top at the very least, if not among common people. If there was limited transportation, there'd have been no contact and thus limited contempt, if there was transportation, there should have been more contact and if racism was a thing, attempts to conquer. Maybe the avatar prevented this, but it was very short sighted to not keep the various countries on an equal footing so as to not require his presence (and we can see how Aang ensured reduced tensions between the various tribes).

I was gonna say something like this too, but I also decided against it because it's [[/r/rational][r/rational]] after all. But what the hell, I'll say it anyway.

I don't think posting a critique of the worldbuilding on a children's show is super interesting. Frankly, it's just not surprising or interesting if a children's show has holes. (Actually, the other reason I almost didn't say anything is that Avatar /does/ have much better worldbuilding than most, so in this particular case, it is much more worth discussing these things than, say, /Steven Universe/, which is a great show but you can drive trucks through the holes in its worldbuilding, which makes it hardly worth discussing unless you're actually proposing major fixes.) At any rate, I think it could be worthwhile to make an Avatar rational fic exploring the economics of house building or cultural diffusion in Avatar-land -- but just posting a list of things wrong in the avatar world and then denouncing the worldbuilding as "implausible" just has me rolling my eyes, especially because those things are more complicated than the OP makes them out to be, as demonstrated by the ample discussion on the thread. ((1) is mostly explained by nationalism and the fact that it's war-time while (2) is mostly explained by the fact that actually, plenty of houses in the world /are/ just made of wood anyway.)

** You're right of course, but we have to try for apologia now.

Well, you can keep out non-benders, and more importantly animals and the weather (which is the original point of a wall - for most of human pre-history irl, a human made wall was an ephemeral structure and did not really keep a human out).

I think the reason this works in canon is that people don't use bending for technological progress until we get to republic city. Before that, bending is pretty much just a fighting style, and it doesn't even seem to matter /that/ much which particular fighting style you have. We don't even have confirmation that bending is used for housing construction, for all we know they're building igloos and mud huts in the non-magical way using the available material.

Also, I think it might be worth considering that terrified humans were living on the backs of lion turtles for protection until /just recently/. So arguably, the civilization of the Gaang is actually brand new.

So maybe they were all basically isolated tribes until fairly recently?

It's hard to square that with the level of technological progress in the Fire and Earth nations, though.

Another potential point is that bending might be /very rare/ for non air nomads (how much of that is because non, and only appear infrequently and randomly in people who live in a climate that predisposes for it...and we just think their are a lot of benders because the dramatic story arcs follow benders. Wasn't Katara the /only/ water bender in her tribe? And Sokka seemed to think bending was pretty mysterious, not an integral part of society.

An airbender bends the air around them. An earthbender bends the surrounding stone in the area. A waterbender needs to be close to a body of water to bend water (barring some advanced techniques). If you put any of these three in an area where they have no access to their respective elements, like an earthbender at sea, then they are essentially powerless.

Fire does not follow these rules however. Firebenders don't need to have a source of fire to use their powers. They simply /create/ fire out of nothing every time they use their powers.

I found this endlessly annoying as a kid because it's inconsistent and breaks the established rules of the setting.
