When the great flood came, Tel's family and the rest of the villagers fled upland. Now they must brave the massive waves to make it aboard Noah's ark. But though the villagers curse them for it, Noah and his god have no intention of letting anyone else on board.

*** Did you ever read the version written by Julian Barnes in the short story "The Stowaway", in his collection "A history of the world in 10 and a half chapters"? In that one, Noah /is/ definitely a prick. And a drunkard. And an idiot.

** I like. It is a very interesting and rather disturbing story, but, I have to ask... where you /trying/ to do a little give and take for both sides of what was going on, or were you focused on only expressing one point of view?

'Cause man, I gotta tell you, most of the people in this story are *DENSE*. When Tel asks Noah what is god is the god /of/, I half expect him to answer with "Natural Selection".

*** Why do you say they're dense? Monotheism wasn't all that common in the past - in fact, early Jews were probably /henotheists/, meaning they believed there were other gods, and JHVH was merely their own, in outright competition with the others to make his people triumph. So it's pretty natural for a person of that time to imagine a god to be god of... something, like storms, sea, or whatever, given this display of power over weather and water.

**** You're assuming I'm saying they're dense because of that one question, but that is not the case. I say they are dense because of /everything else that had happened up until that point/. They repeatedly do downright boneheaded things, then terrible things happen to them, then they go right back to doing boneheaded or hypocritical things. I mean, seriously, I could make a comprehensive list of the stupid if you like. The "what is the nature of your god" question and its assumption is surprisingly reasonable given everything else that has occurred.

Also, technically these people weren't Jews yet. Only the later descendants of one of the brothers would qualify for that, down the line. But it's alright, because in the OT, they end up pretty dense as well. Being rescued from bondage out of Egypt only to turn around and make a giant golden calf to worship, for instance, was perhaps not the brightest of ideas. Which actually makes this story /better/, as it seems to reinforce the theme found in the source material that people often make some poor life decisions. Although this one seems to focus less on the 'evil' bit and just portray them all as confused people.

*EDIT* - So Many Typos.

*** yea I didn't want Noah to be a storybook villain, hence I presented him as a person who wanted to do good but couldn't.

**** He /is/ doing good. He's simply not doing everyone else's definition of it. Also, to quote a TvTrope, "Good Is Not Nice".

Still, good story. I'm glad it wasn't totally one-sided, though I'm thinking it ended up being a lot more balanced than you had intended.
