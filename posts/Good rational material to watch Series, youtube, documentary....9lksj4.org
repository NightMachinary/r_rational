I know it's a reddit for "fiction", but the "rationality" reddit is dead and I don't know where to ask.

â€‹

Do you guys know any good rational videos/series/documentaries, fiction or non fiction, that are worth watching? Something that can even slightly help broaden thinking and teach something new, including Youtube channels and National Geographic documentaries.

It does not have to be strictly related to rationality, of course.

** Rationality adjacent podcasts I like: * [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rationally-speaking/id351953012?mt=2][Rationally Speaking]] - Julia Galef interviews scientists, philosophers, organizers, etc. about their work and how it relates to rationality.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-after-on-podcast/id1265002699?mt=2][The After On Podcast]] - Rob Reid, sci-fi author and entrepreneur, interviews scientists, techies, and leaders. It started with interviews related to the tech and concepts in his books, but has grown beyond that. The interviews are higher quality than Rationally Speaking, but less directly rational.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-future-of-life/id1170991978?mt=2][The Future of Life Institute Podcast]] - does interviews about AI, ethics, extinction risks. The topics are mostly interesting, but the audio is disappointing and the hosts are monotone.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bayesian-conspiracy/id1085426180?mt=2][The Bayesian Conspiracy]] - co-hosted by the guy that produced the audio book for HPMOR. It's much more conversational than any of the other podcasts.

Other podcasts that are not rationality related, but are fun and educational: * [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318?mt=2][99 Precent Invisible]] - my absolute favorite podcast. Covers anything and everything about design in the world around us.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/science-vs/id1051557000?mt=2][Science Vs]] - From vitamins, to ghosts, to nuclear power, what does the science say about common knowledge and fears? It's an excellent and fun podcast, if you can survive the puns.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-allusionist/id957430475?mt=2][The Allusionist]] - All about words, their meaning, origin, and how they're used.

**** If you're referring to my comment I had the exact same thought as you lol.

I was wondering though why you don't want this subreddit to, at least, talk about politics. I would hope that if any non-partisan community could discuss politics without getting heated it would be one that specifically advocated for rationality over emotions?

As a side note though, I don't really see how my comment, if you were referring to it, has many right-wing political channels recommended? I did split the partisan and non-partisan channels, and believe i split the recommendations evenly, if not even slightly left leaning? Unless you are counting Sargon, Peterson and Bret as solidly right leaning, then i guess just difference of opinion.

Well, Sargon's with UKIP, and Peterson and Brett have both received lots of positive coverage from the right wing - ContraPoints has done at least one video on Peterson. Overall my point is that the pursuit of critical thinking and good storytelling isn't inherently political, and I dislike politics being brought into neutral spaces as it tends to be divisive.

****** I guess it does. My wish is that it wasn't so decisive, but i completely understand and respect the community rules so will refrain from going into issues.

For those 3, all 3 are liberals. (as in the proper definition of the word, not the party). UKIP is the only party in Brittan atm which prioritizes liberal values, and isn't even that far right if at all. On multiple occasions Sargon has polled his audience and its almost every time it's 50/50 left-right. He calls himself centrist and used to call himself left leaning.

In general, lately the right has gone more libertarian and the left more authoritarian. Being libertarian focused has made them seem more right-leaning and left-wing authoritarians and right-wing liberals want to perpetuate that since it helps their strategy. 10 years ago all 3 would be called solidly left-leaning. So in public opinion i guess you could call them right wing channels, but by the traditional definitions of the words i think that is false.

***** I understand why many communities make politics taboo. Like religion, there's so much identity and ideology caught up in politics that people have great difficulty changing their minds and often feel alienated over disagreements regarding it.

The purpose of rationality is to become capable of changing one's mind and thinking clearly to evade such problems and come to an understanding of issues that we care about. So in theory this community should be good at discussing politics. But in practice, very few people are so accomplished in rationality that they can see past their political beliefs, so any such discussion is bound to end poorly.

Also, if anyone else has any suggestions please do gimi, especially on good educational things.

Now, don't get me started on actually good anime or TV shows... Actually there is only like 10 or 20 of those.... Maybe next time.

****** I'll be replying to all 3 comments here, so I guess ([[/u/Action_Bronzong]])?

Ok to the lectures; Have you watched them? Because if you have you would realise that:

1. The lectures were recorded before the controversy, it's a standard university course, and no one had an issue with them until now. I have taken psychology courses and listened to other professors talking on the subject (I believe a video including your other recommendations too) and they all seem consistent. If you want to take the word of some people politically opposed to him who now claim that it's mostly pigshit and not check for yourself then I guess we will just agree to disagree, if you have checked for yourself please show me examples of what you are talking about. I would very much like to know what was wrong for my own sake.
2. Yes, 1% if politics. Whenever he goes off on a tangent it's most often about myths and stories, and how they relate to his field. Whether he is portraying the stories accurately or not is irrelevant, it's a learning tool and the science is sound (the science is not derived from the stores but the stores twisted to fit the science). If you watched the lectures yourself, you would also know that whenever he does venture into politics, it's non-partisan. He talks about the types of people (as shown through studies and research) who fall into different "wings" and why they are BOTH important, not why any side is most important than another.

To your first comment, would you mind giving some examples in what you think is ignorant about religion climatology and gender politics? To my non-political recommendation it would be irrelevant because he doesn't mention those in his courses, but I am curious as to what you are referring to.

Lastly, about the wiki:

...I'm at a loss for words. This is the introduction:

He is the author or coauthor of more than 90 [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Peer-review][peer-reviewed]]articles on clinical psychology, social psychology, and personality theory.[[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-3][[note 1]]] [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Inverse_stopped_clock][However]], Peterson is better known because of his [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conservative][conservative]] views on [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Religion][religion]], on [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Trans][trans]] issues, and on [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Feminism][feminism]]. His statements are notoriously incoherent and ambiguous, which allows him to [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Handwave][handwave]] criticism as mere misrepresentations of his views.[[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-CurrentAffairs-4][[3]]] Peterson's fanbase is extremely dedicated and overlaps with the [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Incel][incel]] and [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way][MGTOW]] circles, though he is not a member of either.
#+end_quote

Right off the bat, in what is supposed to be a piece of news, not propaganda, resorts to adhomenim and poisoning the well! "and overlaps with the incel and MGTOW circles" Holy shit, this wiki should be ashamed of calling itself Rationalist! what the actual fuck? The author is obviously implying that those two "groups" are some kind of evil, and using a correlation fallacy to try and poison the well. As if it also says something about mental health institutions that their customers overlap with incel's and MGTOW's.This is such an obvious hit piece, I can't believe it.

Even this piece has to admit that " However, in November 2017, he had 4510 citations with an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-index][h-index]]ðŸ“· of 38 (see [[https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7403426180][Jordan B Peterson - Scopus preview]]). An h-index of 20 is considered "successful", and 40 "outstanding"." (which is 39 now) That he is an experienced, recognised and trusted professional in his field, and I think I trust field of science over a propaganda piece.

The rest is very interesting and, where it reports facts, accurate, but so obviously biased its embarrassing. It's obviously designed to target non-religious, left-leaning, anti-discrimination, anti-sexist, readers and imply he is against all those things demonstrated with valid quotes where he criticises issues related with each of them. Being each of those things (so either disagreeing with him or not being happy with the logical conclusion) AND listening to him I can safely say that his criticisms of those are perfectly valid and absolutely not ignorant or misleading.

For example: The whole part about religion. He says that religion gives people stability and they perform better with it. I'm an atheist and I can tell you he is completely correct! and so what?

â€‹

Guess if you would still like to discuss specific points I would be glad to, but I think most of this is cleared up if you actually listen to what he has to say. and especially interested in what I mentioned above what you think he is ignorant or lying about.

This was my reply to oliwhail

The reason he is controversial is because of his political opinions, chiefly: strongly pro-free speech, for equal opportunity, anti equal outcomes, acknowledges average biological differences in people exist, which all immediately puts him against the mainstream trend and hence "controversial". The reddit rules say no American politics though. Not sure if this would count because pretty much all politics is American politics so i won't expand beyond here. Strongly recommend his lecture series and if you foray into the politics, at the very least watch his interviews. (I recommend after the lectures)

**** I think my support of him would be in a similar vein as Peterson's. A friend i have who is fairly right-wing had a similar complaint about him, and my response to him was as follows:

I actually agree with you he isn't the smartest guy, and is not very 'middle class'; so 'bogan' as you said. He also isn't very extensively 'traditionally educated'. Neither of those three disqualifying him from intelligent discussion.

What he is though is very, VERY well-read, and very well debated (by this i mean he has had much, much, more debates and discussions on his opinions than your average 'middle class' or 'well educated' guy or girl) and most importantly; his opinions have CHANGED over the course of time due to the discussions he has had. This alone would put him as someone important and beneficial to watch irrelevant of your 'side'.

I would also claim, that if you did watch his content, you would notice that he TRIES. Whether he succeeds at being intellectually honest and accurate or not, he tries to be, and when he isn't, often his audience will tell him, and often he acknowledges it, corrects the mistake, and sometimes changes his opinion. I don't know about you but according to me, integrity like this is the most important thing when it comes to content i want to be listening to.

Just as a general note as well; to anyone why doesn't think sargon, or peterson, are worth your time: Can you name me any actual 'right wing' channels which are? Any which you would say are intellectually honest and should go on that list instead? If you can't then I would strongly urge you to re-consider where YOU get your news from, because i hope you understand how ludicrous it is to believe half the world is unprincipled trash. If you can then please do tell me who you think is good, because i find the people who strongly dislike those two tend to be the same: don't listen to anyone or anything that isn't 'left wing' and believe that those two aren't.

If that isn't the case i would love to hear your opinion on them as well, who you do like, and your reasoning!
