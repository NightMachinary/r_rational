*** I've already read everything [[/r/rational]] thinks is good enough to actively recommend, I think. (And the whole thread history of the subreddit. I was desperate!)

But I'm not really looking for recommendations /of rational fiction/---like I said, anything that a member of this subreddit considers to pass that bar, they'd just make a post about.

Rather, I want to know, from anyone who is both a subscriber here /and/ who has spent more time than me browsing KU, whether there's anything worth reading /on it/, according to /their tastes/, even if it doesn't meet the bar for being recommended as rational fiction /per se/.

(Or, to put that another way: I don't want to /filter/ the space of all books to [[/r/rational]] standards; that's already what's being done here. Instead, I want to ask anyone who has already tried to apply the /[[/r/rational]] reading-preference-function/ [i.e. their own personal tastes as a central example of a subscriber here] as a sort function to the KU library, what their top picks are.)
