Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** So I was thinking about how to punch a clean tunnel all the way through a neutron star, and the obvious solution is to use a really fast black hole. Any matter that goes inside the event horizon doesn't come back out, and if it's going more than 0.99c, I think that it won't have time for its gravity to greatly influence the surrounding material, ergo: Smooth perfect tunnel with minimal collateral damage.

(Which immediately collapses, but whatever.)

The problems are, I don't know how to account for extremely high jerk when calculating effects. And, very large objects moving very fast produce gravity waves, and I have no intuition for wave mechanics at all. I know that wavefronts can build by constructive interference, which might make nasty tidal effects further out than I want. I just don't know. I'm also not entirely clear on the effects of relativistic mass on a black hole's Schwarzschild radius, but kugelblitzes (black holes formed from energy density of light) suggest that the radius comes from relativistic mass, which includes kinetic energy.

So my question is this: If a 1 * 10^{26} kg rest mass black hole moving at 0.99c went straight down through a skyscraper without directly hitting any supports, what would happen? I think that it would carve a bottomless pit two meters across, but I don't know if the building would be left standing, or how far away it would be safe to stand when a hole suddenly appears with a thunderclap for no obvious reason.

Pretending gravity is instantaneous, you would only experience more than 150 Gs of acceleration as long as the black hole is within 6,000 km of you, and it would enter and leave that range in 1/25 of a second, which seems within human mechanical shock tolerance, I think. Especially since the force is applied smoothly over the entire body, rather than delivered through discrete external points of contact. But the /peak/ acceleration could be a few quadrillion Gs, which may limit survivability. Now, gravity isn't actually instantaneous, so the black hole is almost keeping pace with its own gravity, and you're not going to fall up towards it for most of its approach. Intuitively, its upward and downward accelerations should cancel in the end. so you might get hit with a huge upward hammer blow when it gets to you, then get pulled downward more softly over a longer time.

It seems like it /should/ be possible for it to go fast enough that its gravity just doesn't have time to destroy you, even if it is momentarily putting everyone on the planet in a car crash. At worst, I'm pretty sure it won't destroy the Earth probably. If it doesn't work, is there any way to fix it?

*** I tried doing the math, and I /think/ I got something that works. What I got is that the total impulse on an object X distance away from the path is ~1.6x as much as if the black hole had been sitting at its nearest point for as long as it takes to travel X distance.

For example, if something was 1km away from the path, and the black hole is travelling at 1 * 10^{5} km/s, then you could model the effect on it as the same as it sitting at the nearest point for 1.6 * 10^{-5} seconds.

** I've been playing lots of three of Zachtronic's puzzle games recently, and they're really fun and excellent. They establish rules, then force you to exploit the rules to solve problems efficiently. They are very good at teaching ideas about logic and planning and optimization and so forth.

The three games I've been playing are:

Spacechem - based /extremely/ loosely on chemistry (more of a chemistry artistic motif then any real chemistry). Involves bonding and debonding atoms, fusing and fissioning atoms, to make inputs into desired outputs, using a system of relays, detectors, grab-and-drop plans, etc. Solution usually involves making a certain number of desired outputs from inputs.

Infinifactory - Move blocks around to make and modify things in 3D, creating assembly lines of conveyors, pushers, welders, detectors, lasers, and all sorts of other tools. Set up an assembly line and watch it go.

TIS 100 - The assembly language programming puzzle game you never knew you wanted. Using a grid of extremely simple computers with an accumulator and a ram storage for a single integer, write code to do things like detect edges, multiply, find min and max of sequences, etc.

They all provide heaps of fun just trying to solve the puzzles at all, but then after that you can try to make your solution better - either faster, or using less resources and building blocks. They teach a lot of ideas about planning, programming, logic, and so forth, in the course of the action of the game.

Infinifactory even has a hotkey to make looping gifs like [[http://i.imgur.com/UoEk9R4.gifv][this one I made of one of my solutions]]

******* Perhaps I'm being unfair, but I don't feel my take is either unreasonable or irrational. Making Sasuke a sadistic torturer was a deliberate character choice, and a major change from canon. Making him use physical means was another choice; he's got the Mangekyou Sharingan, he can torture someone for three days in the span of a second, without doing any physical damage. It's been a long time since I read it, so perhaps I'm misremembering, but I recall significant sexual overtones to the torture scenes. The scenes were, on the whole, unnecessary--the curtain could easily have been drawn. The level of detail in the scenes was definitely unnecessary.

Ergo, my suspicion that something else was going on.

As to my opinion not being rational -- I started with a prior and adjusted based on evidence. In my post above I said "I think", not "it was", implying a probability. In what way was this not rational?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/22][Sakura had already shown herself able to break the Mangekyou's illusions by shifting to her aspect of light,]] so Sasuke couldn't risk using those to brainwash her. Even under extreme physical duress, she still managed to let one aspect of herself escape through her mindscape to warn Naruto, so I think Sasuke was justified in using such extreme measures. In any event, I myself never noticed any sexual connotations in the torture scenes, in any of my six read-throughs of the story.

*** On the Greek side, I'd have executed a Grexit a long time ago. There's no advantage to staying in a monetary union that prevents a natural devaluation of currency (important for recovery in a bad economy), while simultaneously enforcing an insurmountable but undefaultable debt with little relief and punishing austerity. On the European side, I'd encourage Greece to stay in the union while offering considerable debt relief and minimal austerity. (Or just let Greece leave, if I didn't particularly care about it.)

The problem is none of these parties are anything resembling rational actors. It's kind of impressive, actually. They're failing in ways that perfectly selfish agents wouldn't even /consider/, since perfectly selfish agents are at least rational enough not to act directly against their own self-interest. Greece in particular has been charting new ground in politco-economic failure. From [[http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8949925/greece-syriza][Vox:]]

#+begin_quote
  Greece had two awful choices: Stay in the eurozone and be crushed by fiscal and monetary polices set by the Germans, or leave the eurozone and be crushed by a financial crisis. [Syriza] managed, horribly, to combine both of the original two options into one political-economic disaster...

  As O'Brien writes, “Syriza's strategy, insofar as there was one, couldn't have been much more of a failure.” If anything, that's too kind. Syriza's strategy, insofar as there was one, uncovered a method of failing that was much more complete and all-encompassing than anyone had thought possible at the start of the process.

At this point, the only improvements I see for the short-term are a sudden change of heart by the Germans, or a Greek election putting a new party in power. Until then, it will probably be ongoing disaster as usual.

*** I think austerity is unlikely to benefit Greece's economy long-term, and indeed will deepen their recession. I think it's in Greece's best long-term interests to exit the euro, and it would have been even better for them had they done that earlier. Short term it would hurt them, and probably any politician of theirs who made that decision would be effectively ending their career, but they would stabilize eventually and get something approaching a stable economy. I think it's beneficial to the others on the Euro if Greece stays in. I don't know if the harm done to Greeks by it's staying is outweighed by the benefits to the others, such that from a utilitarian perspective I should urge Greece to stay in - I am not an economist or domain expert in these matters.

Default and staying in the Euro is much better than creating a drachma due to their [[http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/balance-of-trade][pretty large trade deficit]], if we're especially nice and suggest that the Drachma will devalue to say only 25% (rather than the 10% figure thrown around) imports will suddenly cost 16 billion Euros rather than the 4 billion they are paying now, and their exports will be worth 500 million.

Obviously they are hoping that they will be extremely competitive and somehow either avoid that much devaluation (unlikely) or pay for it with more debt (who is going to lend exactly to a government not backed by Europe? They don't have a primary surplus big enough to cover the trade deficit).

The best thing was in 2008/9 when it was clear what the crash was Europe bosses should've gotten around the table, decided which countries were going to default, what they were going to default on, and how much, then announced bond buying for countries to stop contagion and gotten on with it. Unfortunately the dragging out of this process has benefited no one.

They can't really default any more so it's probably just going to be Europe financing their debts while they struggle to get back on their feet in austerity.

The free capital, trade, and labor flows across the borders of the European nations has generated an enormous amount of wealth for everyone involved. You get some issues for economically weak nations that need control of their own currency to deal with their poorly run government budgets, but even if you, say, let these countries default on their obligations and bumped down their credit ratings a ton, it still seems like the EU has made everyone way way better off than before. Whatever reasons countries had for getting involved, they've inadvertently made it possible to have much better european trade and labor mobility.

Heck, if anything the problem is that the EU doesn't have enough centralization of authority. This is a discussion for another day but it seems like... the EU is like the best thing to happen in terms of wealth creation in the developed world in the past 30 years?

I wouldn't say that competition is required for growth, but rather is a catalyst. After all even with no competition, NASA is still sending probes out into space. In fact, we just recently sent a probe close enough to Pluto to get for the first time, detailed close-up photos of the dwarf planet.

Also, which would you rather have, no competition or an alien civilization so advanced we can't compete against it?

#+begin_quote
  The universe is a large place, and there's plenty of time to grow and explore it, and meet our many friends waiting among the stars.

  We just need to use our lives, given to us by those that came before us, to create the right world for those that will follow us.
#+end_quote

I don't really understand how any of it could be called /meaningless/. What, after all, is this /meaning/ you ask for? Mostly, it's a two-way causal relationship between you and things that are emotionally relevant to you, things you care about.

If you just suffer from a lack of ability to care about things, well, that's clinical depression. It's not the way the universe is. It's a map-territory confusion.

Lovecraft was writing at the end of the "death of God" period in the humanities, before Dadaism, existentialism, and postmodernism really came into their own. However, I think we can today mount a much better reply to the "death of God" than they could:

You observe that the universe doesn't contain a Christian, Zoroastrian, or Judeo-Islamic style of "god": an omnipotent and sometimes anthropomorphic creator-being with a desire to engage in social relations with humanity, the most common such relation being hierarchical rulership and worship. Except that the Christians and Jews think God /loves/ them, in a really neglectful, abusive, sadomasochastic way.

Ok. There's no God. So /the job is open./ We "mortals" are the biggest, most powerful beings in the room. Except that we've all seen just how awesome a "mortal" can get when they acquire loads and loads of optimization ability:

So the question is not, "what does the universe intend for me?". It doesn't intend, so it doesn't intend anything. This doesn't make life meaningless, because meaning comes from relations, and "the universe" is just not the kind of thing that can engage in human-style social and emotional relations at all.

The question is, "What sort of cosmic principle am I?" Which god, or whose angel, are you?

That undoubtedly sounds frightening, and also religious, and therefore depressingly solemn. Who wants to live in a universe of never-ending cosmic duties? Of course, Duty is just another principle, and as a /final/ principle, before which /all else/ should be moved out of the way, it's just not very good, is it?

[[http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun][What's the point if we can't have fun?]]

And what would the point be if you were a lone cosmic principle? "[H]oly boredom is good and sufficient reason for the invention of free will," said the God-Emperor Leto II! Luckily, you're not a /lone/ cosmic principle at all: you're surrounded by /other/ cosmic principles, /other people/, whether they're more or less realized as such.

You ask for meaning in life? You're surrounded by it! The very fact that your universe runs on /causality/ makes it, inherently, a /participatory/ universe in which /you have your part to play/. "There are no ordinary people", and that means that you are inherently a unique and important thread in the tapestry of the world.

You are a powerful, significant thing in the universe, so much so that the only thing even remotely capable of thwarting your power is /more of that same power/, as wielded (at the moment) by other beings of your exact kind. What is beyond your reach? Nothing! All the lights in the sky and all the time in the world are open to you, to all of us, to grasp and share.

I can provide some supporting evidence, if you'd like. In his private letters, Machiavelli never mentions any satirical intent behind /The Prince/. While there is an apparent disparity with his love of republicanism in /The Discourses/, the times had changed: his beloved Republic had collapsed, and now a tyrant was returned to power. He's very clear in /The Prince/ that he's not arguing that tyranny is better than democracy, but being realistic -- seeing the world as it was, not as he wanted it to be -- and then describing good rules (ie, how to provide stability and prosperity) for tyrants, should one arise: as it did. During his exile, he was thinking about how the Medicis could /not/ fuck it up (since he was always thinking about political theory) and so he decided to write it down. It was a treatise driven by what he had seen in the conditions of 15th century Italy. Sure, it's covertly cynical in that he's working out the details of a system he personally disagrees with, but it's not satire.

** I need some math help.

Imagine a sphere (actually an oblate spheroid). Imagine a few thousand points on it. These points can be defined by polar coordinates (which requires a pole, a polar axis, a radius, and an azimuth, the first two of which are constant). All these thousands of points would be derived from some formula. For a simple example, let's say the radius increases by the [[https://oeis.org/A000045][Fibonacci sequence]] while the azimuth increases by the [[https://oeis.org/A000040][sequence of primes]]. That would mean that our coordinates would be:

- (0, 2°)
- (1, 3°)
- (1, 5°)
- (2, 7°)
- (3, 11°)

And so on.

So what I want is some mathematical way of generating polar coordinates such that a person looking at /only the marked locations on the sphere/ would be able to work backwards and discover my method of generation. They should be able to do this even if they have no idea that I'm using a system of polar coordinates, they have no idea where I'm placing my pole or polar axis, and they don't have any idea what number system I'm using. The "discovered" formula should exactly match my formula with no ambiguity. Ideally, the formula would create repeating coordinates after generating a few thousand locations.

The problem is, I don't know exactly what properties the formula needs to have in order for this to be true. I'm totally fine with two solutions to the formula, but three or higher doesn't work for my purposes.

(Background for the story this is for can be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/3daqgk/making_a_solvable_puzzle/][found here]], though it shouldn't be at all necessary.)

Actually, I would work out a Lissajous figure with a known length, and then pick a sequence of points that follows the figure and is a large relatively prime fraction of the length. Say the length is 3,000,000 kilometers, then make the first point 2,930,000 kilometers in, then the rest of the points are ((n/293)%300)/10,000 kilometers along the path.

***** You could have the strength of the points vary along the path, so a larger area gets switched for points nearer the origin. You could have one point not associated with transfers but with some other effect, because it's so powerful there.

One possibility, natural philosophers have noticed that the variety of species along the remote Rasselbock Valley is anomalously high, and that's because when the trigger happens there it's powerful enough it pulls in whole herds of alien animals.

*** To clarify: Your protagonist only has (all?) generated points on his map but not the order the formula generated them? And does the formula only specify the location or also the mapping between points on the worlds?

In general it sound like you want a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator][Pseudo Random Number Generator]].

PRNGs have an attribute called a "period" which is the number of outputs after which they start to repeat.

Candidates would be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator][Linear Congruential Generator]]

Or a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_feedback_shift_register][Linear Feedback Shift Register]]

Both these generators are not cryptographically secure. Which means they deviate from perfect randomness. They generate patterns and with enough points can be broken.

For the mapping a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function][Perfect Hash Function]] could do the trick.

Other thoughts would be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29][RSA encryption]]. No patterns but your protagonist would have to factor a large number to uncover the pattern. (Granted there would be less intermediate steps and the number would have to come directly from the gods/ancient civilization or something).

Cryptography in general is full of interesting concepts for such stories. I'm currently writing on my master thesis for IT-Security. The topic is about secure pseudo random number generators in software.

**** What I have right now, subject to change:

- There are three worlds, A, B, and G.
- Every =x= days, there is a transferal effect that swaps two chunks of space-time between two of the three different worlds (/A to B, B to G, or G to A/).
- Each transferal in the sequence is between two different worlds. (/ex. if you see an A to B transfer, you know the next transfer two days later will be B to G/)
- This transferal effect is centered on a different location each time.
- After a period of =y= years, the locations repeat, but with different worlds (/ex. if the transferal effect was A to B, when it happens at the same location eight years later it will be from B to G, and eight years after that it will be G to A, and eight years after that it will be A to B again/)

So ... the point where I need help is /after all of this is known/. The protagonist has a map of known transferal locations, along with the times that they happened. He knows the frequency of transferal (=x=) as well as the period of the pattern (=y=). In order to finish his map of /all/ transferal locations, he needs to find the pattern (alternately, he might have a map of all locations, but still wants to know what underlying mechanism decided on those instead of others).

What I want is for the "key" to this pattern to be a location; once you've solved the generation method and can duplicate it, you should be left with a bunch of numbers and a place. You should be able to work backwards from the data in order to arrive at the algorithm (and therefore the location embedded in the formula).

It's probable that what I want is a PRNG, but I don't know enough to know which kind I'd want. Ideally something solvable by hand and simple enough to be included as a description in prose.

***** Okay so a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) works like this:

X(n+1) = a * X + b (mod m)

So you have m which would be your period (y). Which is also the number of distinct teleport locations.

Then you have the parameters for the LCG which are a and b. This could be your end location. (but a,b can not be chosen completely arbitrary).

Then you start with a seed (any integer < m) and put it in the formula to get the next number.

So the first location determines all locations. And you can start at any of the locations on the map to find all others.

You can get x,y coordinates on a map out of the random numbers with x = X mod width and y = (int) (X / width)

That should be generate a pattern given enough points. a and b are also determinable. Even unknown a,b and m is doable but harder.

In the Valdemar prehistory, two mages named Urtho and Ma'ar were fighting a big war. Near the end of this war, one of them comes up with a super weapon that will (IIRC) detonate the magic used to make magitek. Urtho manages to make it half-backfire, or something. These guys are both Urza-tier, so the resulting explosion leaves craters [[https://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luzxz9GVxG1qa73dwo1_500.png][the size of countries]] (Urtho's is in the south) and sends out concentric shockwaves for months. The Pelagir Forest on the map? By the present day, that's the amount of land the hawkbrothers hadn't managed to cleanse yet.

Thousands of years later, circular sections a few feet in diameter are being swapped over long distances. The group of people who are all about math and technology take the reported locations and determine that the places and times correspond to two interfering concentric /converging/ circles, one on each of the ancient fortress sites. They determine that the storms are increasing in strength, and they send an expedition to Urtho's tower (Ma'ars being under a lot of water) to try to stop the final strongest storm from killing a bunch of people, especially the Shin'a'in nomads who live in the plains in the crater around Urtho's tower (we learn in this book that their goddess told them to live there to guard the tower) and damaging the leyline system that concentrates magic.

After concentrating some of the biggest names in the series in the tower, they find a way to save Hardorn, Valdemar, Karse, and Intel. (You will note that that's not a lot of terrain. Things got pretty bad elsewhere. The (evil, eastern) Empire, where they routinely used magic as a logistics element, was not a good place to be in the immediate aftermath.)

Other notes: yes, the magic shockwaves travelled around the planet several times.

** I live in Palo Alto and am thinking of DMing another campaign of Dungeons and Dragons. It's set in my homebrew [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11386854/1/Story-and-Rules-of-Wyweria][campaign setting]] that I've used once before. If anyone's in the area and would be interested in playing, let me know. We use Pathfinder and currently have two players.

The campaign will be set during the Age of Legends, a time during which many small kingdoms were ruled by individuals of great power. Every King was a powerful Monster or mage of some sort, someone who could establish absolute authority over a certain area. The last campaign was set in Avaria, the kingdom ruled by the magelord Avar. For the most part, Avar was a "good" magelord, who cared almost nothing for the day-to-day lives of the inhabitants of Avaria. If thieving or banditry ever got so out of hand it impacted his ability to collect taxes to spend on spell components, or prevented merchants from reaching him, he took a few moments out of his day to smite the criminals. He only really cared about territory and relative peace, but that's pretty good as Magelords go. ?

The PCs were a mercenary group typically employed by merchants for protection. They had run-ins with other mercenary groups, with the government forces, with criminal organizations that were functionally indistinguishable from the government forces, and with Holy Orders who had inscrutable goals. None were as inscrutable as the Elves who had a completely foreign system of ethics and law.

The adventures will mostly be run as linked one-shots-- episodes that your adventuring company works through. Ideally, at the end of each session, we've finished whatever short-term things have been opened up that session while advancing the overarching goals and plots of the player characters. I have a number of adventures and story hooks prepared, and of course there's also fun to be had generally exploring the environment, interacting with NPCs and each other, etc.

Generally, missing any single session shouldn't leave you out of the loop or not make sense from a story perspective-- it'll be segmented into "jobs" that your company does, for profit or for personal reasons. The end of each sessions should mark the end of that particular job. If someone is present for one job but not another, it's entirely reasonable that that character was taking the week off, or busy working another job, for that session. This will prevent weirdness that comes from characters popping in and out of existence.

This format tends to serve pretty well for the purposes. Typically the idea would be to meet on a weekend morning for a time of 3-4 hours, though depending on people's schedules we may change things. It has historically been difficult to find a time people can play for 3 hours regularly other than Sunday mornings or weekday evenings (and weekday evenings are very susceptible to schedule issues).

In any case, let me know if you're interested and in the area!
