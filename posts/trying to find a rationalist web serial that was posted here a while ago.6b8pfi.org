The premise was the MC woke up one day with his consciousness inside a bush; he was transported from modern day to a fantasy setting; at first he cant even move then learns/grows/adapts. Had some obvious plotholes/ MC holding idiot ball tropes but still enjoyable. It was published on wordpress. No idea the name I read it sometime between 6 months ago and a 1.5years ago(not sure)


** The [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-hedge-maze-is-you.19308/][closest thing]] that I can recall reading that fits your description. It's a quest about a newly sentient hedge maze in a fantasy setting. I didn't finish it, but the starting was interesting.

** I saw one where he was inside a mimic, inside a dungeon, all he could do was eat what was in front of him... don't recall a bush
