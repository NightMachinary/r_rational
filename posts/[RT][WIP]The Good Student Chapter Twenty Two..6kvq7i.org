** Ok, nice I liked the chapter. =) The plot progression still feels fast but now it has at least concluded some aspects and given that the mages dont seem to be proactive, as well as the archmage taking a break it will finally slow down a bit. And hopefully Nics life will now return to a more mundane lifestyle focusing on the character progression and worldbuilding around him. Right now the whole school still feels way to 2 dimensional and will need some storytelling , same goes for Nics new friends.

** The 'one last night' is ominous, one way or another.

I am variously intrigued, and happy that doom is planned for and hypothetically avoidable rather than only tragic.

Wondering about the King, the question of 'when is too late to cut', and whether the Archmage bears lingering mental effects...

** PS, now that's it's hosted on Gravity Tales: Their ad side bar causes a lot of issues. Open up the Chrome console and run this: =$('.side-nav').remove()=. Or, grab and use a plugin to disable Javascript on the site.
