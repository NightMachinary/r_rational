** Just started reading it. I would advise your friend not to have white text on a black background. It's good for short-term reading, but it hurts the eyes for extended, concentrated reads.

*** Weird, I greatly prefer dark backgrounds, especially when reading on my phone. Is there actually any evidence about this being harmful or are you speaking from personal experience?

**** Both. I read it in a book on advertising. Here's a [[https://www.joedolson.com/2006/08/on-the-readability-of-inverted-color-schemes/][little blog post about some studies]]. But also, try setting the kindle app to white text on black background, and read for about an hour. When I turned away, I could still see a faint patch of black with white lines over it. Nothing permanent, it went away in a few seconds, but it was still a little bothersome.

*** Will do. Do you have any suggestions as to what color or colors would work better?

*** can we get some sort of summary, or teaser? I know it's only two chapters, but I have a pretty large fanfiction backlog regardless (roughly 30 chapters) and I doubt I'm unique.

** Summary:

"Had Marc Antony changed any aspect of how the last day had happened, he would be alive. But, as things tend to do, the day happened the way it happened, and Marc died.

He woke up in class earlier that day, and unbeknownst to him, set events in motion beyond any scale that he could imagine."

*** That's not a very good summary, it's more like a cover blurb or something.

***** Not really, genre, timeline, setting...all those would help even if you had to put some of them in spoilers. As far as I know I'm reading a story about the Roman general right now. Which is bad because this is relatively new and doesn't have a large lead.
