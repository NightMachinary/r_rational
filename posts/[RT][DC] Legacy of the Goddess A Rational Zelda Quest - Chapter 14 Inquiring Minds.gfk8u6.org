** ...I can't tell if the Master Sword keeps getting mentioned to foreshadow its entry into the story, to explain to people familiar with canon why it's never going to show up, or to /frustrate people like me/ who want to know which of those two options is the correct one.

** Hrrmph, some thoughts on our enemies.

Ganondorf:

We have no idea what this guy wants. It's alarming how nothing we know about him. We know some of his past, and Sheshan indicates that he's collecting Triforce of Power fragments, but that's about it.

Collecting Triforce fragments is like leveling up. It'll be helpful at whatever you turn your hand to. But it doesn't really narrow down his goals all that much.

If we are still of a mind that he was behind the invasion and the assassination attempt on Zelda, then that is a few more data points, but they are entirely coherent with him just trying to collect Triforce fragments, and so they don't really give us much more than that.

Shesan calls Demise 'the power behind Ganondorf', but we don't know when/how they made contact, or why Ganondorf would serve it. When he ruled the Gerudo he had more conventional ambitions than something that killed Hylia would probably share. What's the basis of their alliance?

Demise:

This thing is an even bigger question mark. In the vision the barrier around the world is being cracked by a smoke fist coming off of another world with its own barrier, but it isn't clear if Demise is that smoke (dragon, face) thing, or if it is a thing of the Void around both worlds.

It wants the triforce. That's about all I feel comfortable saying is certain about it.

​

So, if we are doing any more questions for Sheshan this time...can we ask what she knows of Ganondorf's motivations, and most particularly anything she might know about how/when/if he hooked up with Demise? We are currently like a soccer team trying to play defense that doesn't know where it's own goal is. If we are going to stop these guys, we desperately need to figure out what their victory conditions actually are.

  “/Why/?” was all she could think to ask. “What does it want?”

  “I don't know,” Shesan said, forthright.

  “How did it defeat Hylia, then? How do /we/ fight it?”

  “/I don't know/,” she repeated.

  “No,” Link said hotly. “There has to be something! You have to know /something/!”

  Shesan regarded them, and Zelda could feel herself being weighed and measured under the scrutiny of her gaze.

  “There is something it wants,” she said tersely. “And it seems to be willing to throw away anything and everything to get it.”

  “And that is?”

  “The Triforce.”

Already asked about it in the previous chapter. That's pretty much all she knows about it.

** *Voting!* ... might be weird this time around.

We are maybe planning to do a live DM session over Discord to explore the Obsidian Spire with Link and his Sheikah squad. This would be a 2-3 hour event that would allow much finer grained player agency than just "do prep, follow a long list of protocols, hope for the best." Results would be aggregated and expounded upon in the next chapter.

There seemed to be decent [[https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/588230711987798026/706113807658778705][support for this on Discord]], but we are not fully committing to the idea just yet. Please let us know your thoughts on this below.

If we decide against it, this post will be deleted/replaced with a normal voting post and we will adjust accordingly. If we decide to go through with it, more details will be posted to the [[https://discordapp.com/invite/B5abMg8][Discord]].

--------------

Your previous Void Power total was 2069.

Fi spent 200 VP using two ethereal avatars, and 23 VP on telepathic communications.

Fi spent 82 VP by way of rejuvenate on non-marked individuals during the course of research.

Fi used 32 units of her stored magic on non-marked individuals during the course of her research. She also used 68 magic restoring Link (who used Siphon to transfer magic to his squad). Total: 102.

Fi converted 120 VP to magic to restore the magic total to 400 as per the SOP.

Fi used 89 VP Compelling the horse at Link's behest.

Chapters 13 and 14 spanned 3 days, and during that time you earned 128 VP from Zelda and 104 VP from Link.

You have earned 165 additional VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus.

*You currently have 2291 Void Power.*

*** I like the idea in theory - I enjoy that style of gaming. My primary concern would be whether playing in real-time would cause our characters to come across as less component than they are in the standard Quest, since standard Quest play allows for both the players and the QMs to take more time on decision making. It's much easier to make obvious mistakes in a real-time game.

Basically, I'm worried that those of us playing in the Discord session could get us all killed doing something that we wouldn't normally do in the Quest itself.

I think I'm /generally/ for doing it anyway, and I'd want to play if there's room and I'm available at the time, but I'd want to know more about the QM philosophy for how the Discord session is going to run.

I'd also be interested in knowing if we'd be using the same rules set as the quest itself, something different that is designed for real-time play, or maybe a mix.

Think "text adventure game" except with visual aids and also the possibility for some back-and-forth with QMs and more leeway/flexibility in decision points. The way we would handle it would be players providing high-level direction to Link, which we would interpret generously and have Link fill in the details. "Go to this area and try X while avoiding Y" as opposed to "turn left," "go down the corridor," "open the door," etc.

In general my philosophy with QMing/DMing/whatever-ing is to not burden players with having to worry about minor details and incidental mistakes ("gotchas", if you will). Rather, I believe challenge should come from open-ended difficult problems that require making complex trade-offs and have no easy answers.

Of course that changes a bit in a literal dungeon with predetermined paths and puzzles, but the guiding principle remains the same. Any mistakes you make are likely to be strategical or tactical in nature (depending on the context), rather than "whoops we forgot something really obvious and now Link is dead." Most of the work on our end would be done upfront to ensure the challenges hit at the right level.

***** That all makes sense. My main concern comes down to whether or not a purely QM-driven version of Link and his party would have a higher success rate with, say, solving puzzles than the actual player base would with those same puzzles.

That being said, it seems like QMs would probably have fun with it, and the players would probably have fun with it, so it's probably worth doing.

*** Some feedback on the planning incentive bonuses for VP to help you all calibrate on how we're scoring this. This is taking into account both the c13 and c14 plans since c13 didn't span enough time to accrue VP.

#+begin_quote
  How well did you progress your goals?
#+end_quote

Our estimate here is 9/10. I don't expect a single plan to progress goals much more than you did here, short of actually acquiring Triforce fragments, clearing a dungeon, killing an Exiled King or three, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Did you take any risks, and did they pay off?
#+end_quote

4/10. Heading into the Sunseeker Encampment was tense but not actually dangerous or risky.

#+begin_quote
  How interesting was writing/worldbuilding for us?
#+end_quote

5/10. Median outcome; not really particularly interesting or uninteresting.

#+begin_quote
  How frustrating was writing/worldbuilding for us?
#+end_quote

3/10. This is based primarily off of the fact that the plan was just a laundry list of questions. We understand the desire to obtain information, but in the future we would really prefer you not just ask every single open question you have when meeting NPCs. This is mostly because it makes it difficult to write interesting content and also hampers our ability to pose interesting decision points when most of our focus is on figuring out what said NPC knows in order to answer the questions.

In the interests of transparency, I will likely outright veto plans similar to the c14 plan in the future. It wasn't as egregious as it could have been, but it still resulted in us having to write another short chapter before the story can progress while still allowing for meaningful player input.

#+begin_quote
  How much did we enjoy the discussion?
#+end_quote

9.5/10. Quite a bit of interesting discussion and participation this time around.

#+begin_quote
  How easy was it to figure out what players wanted to do?
#+end_quote

7.5 for the c14 plan and 10/10 for the c13 plan. Overall 9/10.

--------------

This results in an overall score of 39.5/60. This results in 165 VP per day out of a possible 250 per day.

** Not sure if anyone has brought it up, but there is a slim (but real) possibility that ganondorf isn't working for demise (or if he is, it's because he was misled, or he is doing so against his will)

In short, we may have a diplomacy angle if we ever do get to talk to him. Not likely, again, but it's possible.

Also, there's basically no textual evidence for this, but I'll hazard a guess that the central ideal for fragments of power is “conviction”. In short, once he has a task to complete or a goal to reach, he does anything and everything possible to achieve it.

  Mark of Harvesting Divine Power

  Spend up to 25 of my personal points on additional research toward Lesser Marks of Transference with their scope reduced even further. This further reduced version is called Mark of Harvesting Divine Power. (Some old discussion of the Lesser Mark of Transference spell here and here for ease of reference.)

  Spell description: Mark of Harvesting Divine Power places a mark upon an individual that passively generates additional VP based on the person's activities. This has none of the other functions of a Mark of Transference; it only generates VP. This still requires consent from the target, similar to a traditional Mark of Transference.
#+end_quote

A report: I do not believe it to be possible to develop any meaningful alterations on the Mark of Transference without a substantially more nuanced approach. To my understanding, the Mark of Transference works by suffusing the target's essence with a large quantity of Void Power. With sufficient power, cascading changes to the target's essence occurs, which results in the state with which you are familiar.

In summary, I am unable to select from individual "functions" of Mark of Transference to develop Lesser Marks.

#+begin_quote
  Byrna's Armor

  Spend up to 25 of my personal points on researching defensive magic. We have previously researched the Cane of Byrna's defensive function, determining that it may be replicable, but seemingly at extreme cost. Attempt to research a weaker version of this function, using the Cane of Byrna as a part of the foundation, as well as observing the properties of imbued armor as a second point of data. If possible, figure out if it is possible to construct a defensive spell with a function similar to the described one below:

  Spell Description: Byrna's Armor. While active, utilizes VP to defend the target against attacks. This requires an initial expenditure of VP to activate, as well as a maintenance cost to remain active. The efficacy and duration of the spell are both variable based on VP expended.
#+end_quote

I have been wholly unable to replicate the effects of Imbued armor using Old Magic. Further, I am not currently aware of any mechanisms by which I could use Old Magic to serve a defensive purpose in any capacity.

An additional note: I do not currently have access to a Cane of Bryna. If you could provide me with an instance of said object, I would be able to study it in more detail. A description of it alone is insufficient to generate additional points of data.

** *Announcement*

We kind of fumbled on giving players any meaningful decision points at the end of the last chapter, and we also aren't ready for a realtime DM session. In the interests of moving the story along, there will be another short chapter between now and ~Wednesday that will have additional actionable info we weren't able to get to. No vote necessary. /Probably/ no one important will die.

Status of realtime dungeon crawl is still TBD but we are leaning towards "no." Our thinking is that as this requires substantial prep and commitment on both sides of the curtain, we are not justified in changing up the format to this degree if collectively everyone is only lukewarm at best on the idea.

If you really want this to happen, now is the time to make your arguments.
