Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  White smoke rises in a cloud,

  Light and silver parting the sky's blue.

  I can hear the rustling grasses,

  See the heather of your hillsides.

  The world of my dreams.

  Babbling brooks,

  Flowing crystal through eternal glades -

  Peace and freedom..

  The hour will come when my sins are forgiven

  And I meet the dawn in the midst of your hills.

  Taking up a staff

  I will travel, a wanderer

  Through the land of my dreams

  Where the cries of the eagles

  Spreading their wings

  Over the stone cliffs

  Speak of peace and freedom

** Recently, I was very surprised to see in my daily +Goodreads+ Kindle Deals email* a [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25746699][story]] whose protagonist had the (involuntary) power of being forgotten within minutes by anyone who saw her. Is this (dis)ability more common in fiction than I'm aware? This is at least the fourth time I've seen it, after [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198][/Background Pony/]] (protagonist Lyra Heartstrings, involuntary), [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/story.shtml][/Radiance/]] (minor character Allirea, voluntary), and [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][/Worm/]] (minor character Imp, voluntary). (Insert accusations of sexism against science-fiction/fantasy authors for constantly giving invisibility powers to women.) See also the tropes [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/The_Nondescript][The Nondescript]] and [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Perception_Filter][Perception Filter]].

*[[https://i.imgur.com/jrAWbbS.png][Goodreads Deals is being discontinued in favor of Kindle Deals.]] Amazon, which owns both Goodreads and Kindle, obviously doesn't like it when Goodreads sends out links for buying books from B&N and Google. However, since e-book prices are set not by sellers but by publishers, it doesn't really matter---I'll just have to manually go to bn.com whenever I'm alerted to a Kindle sale for a book that I want, rather than being able to immediately click on a bn.com link in the email.

Anyway, /The Sudden Appearance of Hope/ is in my opinion significantly more akin to /Background Pony/ than to /Radiance/. It constantly bounces back and forth between the one's pretentiousness** and the other's coolness, but overall it definitely feels more pretentious than cool, especially when you take into account the cultural and political jabs that the protagonist thinks to herself with some regularity. IMO, it definitely doesn't deserve more than three stars.

**IIRC---I haven't read /Background Pony/ in /quite/ a few years. (It's hard to imagine that, at some long-past date, it temporarily was my favorite story, above even [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]]. I probably should get around to reading it for a third time.)

(I find it extremely pathetic that the phrase =mens reus=---[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea][obviously erroneous]] not only to anyone who knows Latin but also to anyone who reads legal opinions---was retained in /multiple/ places by the editor. How hard is it to look up a two-word foreign-language phrase on Google?)

*** Invisibility superpowers and similar are often metaphorical, and the most common metaphor is marginalization. It really shouldn't be a surprise that it's a power most often given to women. The last place I recall seeing the power was /The Laundry Files/, where this was made quite explicit.

(/Soon I will be Invincible/ was also pretty blatant about it's commentary, but that was stock invisibility.)

** I've been considering the effect of translation/subtitles on meaning, especially for music and movies. It often seems like translated media is more intelligent or meaningful.

It makes intuitive sense that meaning is lost when translation occurs, but I suspect that additional meaning gets added in--so much so that subtitled things appear to have extra meaning.

Consider:

- Written words generally convey more complex ideas than spoken words.

- Bilingual translators are likely very intelligent, and capable of adding meaning.

- The act of interpretation (particularly of lyrics) requires inferring hidden meaning.

- Translations try to add allusions that make sense for the culture they are being translated into. (Warning, TV Tropes: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation][Cultural Translation]])

It seems to me that the act of translating music or video into written subtitles tends to add more meaning than it subtracts. It's like anything with subtitles was ran past a bilingual ghostwriter.

Although, when I think about it... things that are translated might also experience a selection effect. Who would bother translating something that's meaningless?

Or perhaps it just seems more meaningful because trying to extract meaning from it faces the added difficulty of cultural differences. There are aspects to the media that the original culture would take for granted, so perhaps the added complexity of keeping track of that stuff makes whatever it is seem deeper.

I really hope it isn't the case that most foreign stuff seems intelligent because my culture is... less intelligent.

*** First, I'd recommend /Le Ton beau de Marot/, which is about that kind of thing, by the same guy who wrote /Gödel, Escher, Bach/ (Douglas Hofstadter).

Second ... I think it really depends on the translator and their goals. There's are, obviously, selection effects for which works get translated, so I would expect translated works to on average be better than works without a translation, probably by a considerable margin.

But beyond that, some translations are "bare bones" in that they seem like they've just been run through a translation service, and /those/ generally feel like they subtract meaning. I watch a fair amount of Korean dramas, and sometimes entire /plot points/ require outside explanation, because whatever person did the translation failed to explain the cultural context of what was happening, or the wordplay that the scene hinged on. I've seen translations that /don't explain a Korean homophone which isn't a homophone in English/.

So, I don't know. I feel like translated works are a mixed bag, in that translators and the effort that they'll put into translation are variable. The selection effects for translation should be in the direction of better works being selected, making them comparatively good when put next to the baseline, but meaning isn't always at the forefront of the translators mind. (At a guess, 'I need to finish this translation so I can get paid' motivates a lot of translators who do half-assed work.)

**** Thank you for the recommendation.

Yeah, skipping the wordplay is like scraping the icing off the cake. "Why's this foreign cake so tasteless?" It isn't, you aren't getting to eat it right.

I give up on bad translations... so perhaps there are multiple selection effects here.

** I just read the Asimov novelization of Fantastic Voyage. I had seen the movie a while back, and it always bothered me how they treated atoms of miniaturized matter and unminiaturized interchangeably depending on what the plot demands. Asimov does a pretty great job of rationalizing it. The novel was written after the movie, so he didn't have a lot of control over the plot details, and you can kind of tell he thought the whole conceit was pretty ridiculous, which makes for some rather hilarious reading when he blatantly lampshades how it all really shouldn't work, yet surprisingly does by somehow creating an image of the atoms in hyperspace.
