So I finished reading book 1 of The Two Year Emperor, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][available for free as the author promised here.]]

[[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] also mentioned in that thread that book 2 would be released after polishing, anyone know where I can grab that? The link to the draft he provided is dead now.


** Apparently this mirror by [[/u/elevul]] is still up: [[http://www.mediafire.com/download/1km9vv259bd913i/The_Two_Year_Emperor_-_Eagle_Jarl.epub]]

I just copied the link from a different thread, but let me know if you don't want it around, EagleJarl.

** It was for sale at some point, I don't know where / if it can be purchased these days.

Just FYI, it has a very different tone than book 1.

** I'm flattered you're interested.

No polishing was ever done, I fear; never got to the top of the projects list. I do have a few new books since then, however. :> The latest one is "The Patchwork Realms: Arrival"; it's still in progress, with 8 chapters available [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30636/the-patchwork-realms-arrival/chapter/464681/chapter-1-arrival][on RoyalRoad]] and a ninth sitting on my hard drive, hopefully to be finished today.
