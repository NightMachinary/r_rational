** Yet another reminder:

There is NO moral, ideological, or philosophical bullet SO large that SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE won't bite it. And that someone... is this story's author.

******** IIRC, the author is a person who considers ponies to be innately superior to humans (naturally peaceful vs. naturally violent), and is generally a little nonstandard in thinking. Some years ago, she endured a fair amount of harassment from some members of the /Friendship Is Magic/ fandom due to her controversial /Conversion Bureau/ stories, which many people viewed as twisting the concept of ponies and Celestia into a disgusting misanthropism--notice the very large numbers of dislikes on most of her stories.

  Lately, I have been called a misanthrope for this. I have been accused of supporting 'genocide' of the human species. There have been death threats, threats of bodily injury, and ongoing attacks against my family's servers and my own mail.

*** I'm not acquainted enough with the /Conversion Bureau/ canon to have an opinion on it (none of the stories looked interesting enough for me to read), but I bothered to give a favorite/follow to this short-story collection in particular because it has several stories based on /Friendship Is Optimal/ as well as several set in the /Conversion Bureau/ universe.

**** /Conversion Bureau/ is [[http://www.3plusplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/This-Heretic.jpg][EXTRA-HERESY]] precisely because ponies and pony fanfics are normally so nice and likable. As noted on the Disgraces page, the /most vehement/ enemies of Xenolestia are the canon cast of FiM... and the Emperor of Mankind.

**** To clarify [[/u/traverseda]] 's comment: The lols are because someone actually seriously requested such a label. Actually I think that is literally the exact label they mentioned in their request. The overall vaguely mocking effect seems appropriate.

** The shadow-communication strains the sense of disbelief somewhat: allowing something from one prison into another (whether a letter, a symbolic gift, a shadow with a recorded message, or absolutely anything at all) seems at odds with the complete-isolation setting, so I would have imagined that would be accomplished by somehow subverting Pip's special access instead.

I did like the idea of getting person-level complexity (and more) within the prison by building it from first principles (rather than top-down simulacrums), and I especially liked the portrayal of someone taking those resources and thoroughly enjoying them instead of feeling isolated and depressed.

** /tl;dr:/

The setting is the /Twilight Zone/ episode /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nice_Place_to_Visit][A Nice Place to Visit]]/: the (self-insert) protagonist is in a personal Hell where she wins at everything she sets her mind to, with no possibility of a challenge, and only empty, manufactured shadows (plus a single genius demon assistant) are available for the alleviation of her boredom.

The protagonist forces the demon assistant to study all her writings and all existing books referring to the Singularity, works out a loophole allowing manufactured shadows to be used to transfer information between isolated souls, creates a slightly-modified CelestAI with AI-shadows as a base, and transforms the entirety of Hell into Equestria, populated with both human souls and self-aware shadows.

***** Sure, that's implied, but it's good practice to conceal spoilers such that a person has to deliberately read/see them, rather than see them and have no choice. I don't know about you, but I can generally not fail to read a word in the moment of seeing it. I'm sure others are the same.
