/Black Mirror/ is a Twilight-Zone-style scifi anthology series from Channel 4 in Britain.

*Why should I watch:* Each episode is different, but they all explore a different technology, more than once delving into AI, uploading, and transhumanism. The stories explore how people will use new tech, for good or for evil, and new tech will change society. It's the best television I've seen in a long time.

I hesitate to label this series as "rational," since few characters act 100% logically, but there aren't any idiot balls being passed around. There is no black-and-white morality anywhere, and all the characters are remarkably sympathetic (assisted, I'm sure, by the excellent acting). Either way, /Black Mirror/ deserves a mention here.

*How to watch:* There are seven episodes, ranging in length from 45 to 75 minutes; they're available for streaming both on Netflix and on the less-reputable web. Be careful to steer away from discussions and spoilers, though. In the style of /Twilight Zone/, each story is very reliant on plot-twists and perspective-shifts, but the authors do a good job of making each state-change appear naturally, so there's no Shyamalan-esque breaking of suspension of disbelief.

*Warning:* The topic of the first episode, "The National Anthem", is quite icky, and I don't want to spoil anything, but the topic is named (thankfully never shown) in the first five minutes. So watch the first five minutes of S1E1 (available on youtube with 360p and Spanish subtitles [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUjVFaJzA0A][here]]), and if you're intrigued, keep watching, but if you're really turned off just jump straight to S1E2, "15 Million Credits", which is where the series really hits its stride.

I mention this because a lot of people get turned away from the series by its first episode, when really it's atypical. "The National Anthem" is by far the most squick and least scifi of the series; the other stories are very different in topic and tone. So be better! If you turn away from the show, at least do it informedly!

** I don't think anyone really acts in their best interests in any of these episodes. The ones that jump out to me most are [[#s][S02E02 White Bear]] and [[#s][S02E03 The Waldo Moment]]

However, I definitely recommend the show to practically everyone. The episodes are all self-contained, but I don't recommend starting with the first episode. Each episode has its flaws, and I can't quite figure out which one to go with.

The Waldo Moment was probably my favorite episode, but that's not the best introduction to the series (it's a bit of a break from the usual pattern). Maybe The Entire History Of You (S01E03), which was the best-received episode (and yes, quite good, and definitely in the full spirit of the show).

Edit: I'm less than half an hour into the most recent episode, White Christmas, and this could very well be the one to start with. It's great, has a pretty good twist. And then, of course, you have Jon Hamm. He is just a phenomenal actor.

*** [[#s][S2E2 White Bear]]

On that note, have you seen the Christmas special? Hours after watching it, I'm still horrified.

**** Currently watching it. The first major twist was great, and now the current part (37 minutes in) is definitely horrifying me. [[#s][spoiler]]

[[#s][45 minutes]]

[[#s][Just finished it]]

To everyone: Watch this episode first. It's the best of the series so far. I have huge hopes for the next season/series.

***** Sparked some really interesting discussions on [[/r/blackmirror]] about whether we should feel bad for Cookies - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/2pvmug/why_does_everyone_feel_sorry_for_the_cookie/][the amount of people]] who think it's silly to empathize with [[#s][spoilers I guess?]] is insane. After I left that episode thinking, thank god we could never do that, and then I was forced to realize that yes, some - most - people /would/ do that ...

The episode was quintessentially /Black Mirror/, and I'm with you on being extremely hype for S3. Whenever it will be.

*** It is surprising how little of an effect depression has on the ability to think rationally. Primarily, it screws with self-worth systems; certainly, it does a lot of damage to think rational about /yourself/. Source: depressed.

**** Well, luminosity is a rather important part of thinking rationally, especially considering how, at least to me, the main point of "rationality" seems to be recognizing what tools you have at your disposal and the best way to implement those tools. If you can't adequately recognize the tool of "I'm good at so-and-so task," then you might have some difficulty utilizing that.

***** To clarify: depression doesn't hurt your epistemic rationality that badly, but utterly demolishes your instrumental rationality.

****** Exactly. I suppose I might place a bit more importance on instrumental rationality than epistemic rationality, then.
