Hi All

I am a fan of magic School/sci-fi school fiction , it reminds me of my own school days.I would really like a rational fic in this setting.

Few books I have read

Mother of Learning

Sufficiently Advanced Magic

Pok√©mon Origin of Species ( the setting where young kids learn and apply )


** Did you read the sequel to Sufficiently Advanced Magic?

**** Andrew Rowe's other series, the war of the broken mirror also does a kind of magic School/training school in the second book.

** Not sure if it's Quite Magic School, or magic prep school, but I found [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student][The Good Student]] rational-ish and defiantly competence porn, though I'm not sure if it's a solvable as HPMOR is.

** Not books, but you may want to keep an eye on *Ikenfell* and *Witchbrook*, both in-development magic school RPG's.

** There is, of course, [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], with many possible recommendations, some less rational than others.

** The Magicians is a rational-ish take on magic school. Magic is /very/ difficult and /very/ dangerous, and all the students and professors have mental issues. There are two sequels which drift away from the magic school aspect, because they've all graduated.

*** I read the first book but stopped after that because of the irritating protagonist Quentin, liked the TV show though

**** Honestly, he gets even worse in books 2 and 3. There are very few characters in these books who are genuinely good people that I wouldn't mind hanging out with. I like the books despite all that - the trilogy feels pretty real.
