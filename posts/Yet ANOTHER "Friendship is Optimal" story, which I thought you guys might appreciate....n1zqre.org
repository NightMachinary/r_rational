This one's sort of a dark, "bad end for humanity" which has a lot of hard science elements and criticism of modern socio-political issues, in which the AI (which has now, conclusively and permanently defeated humanity) is explaining to one of the last humans alive why resistance was futile all along.

Anyway, it's titled /All the Time in the World/, and it's only on FiMFiction for now, so here's the link...\\

Hope y'all enjoy!


** I'm sorry if these are dumb questions, but I've read several FiO stories and they're tagged as horror but I just don't get it. Why is it a bad end for humanity to live in a paradise simulation that's meant to satisfy them? Is it because they have to be ponies? Is it really so bad to adapt to a different body plan if it's not causing them to suffer, given the benefits? The short, disatisfying lives people live now are what bother me. Someone avoids having their life eaten up by a job they hate and they don't just get old and die, and that's supposed to be horror? I feel like I'm seriously missing something here

Sure, she's superhumanly good at convincing. And that is pretty creepy in many ways. But I think it stops a bit short of "horror" since CelestAI is generally not harmful in her goals. And there do seem to be some limits to her ability to convince, otherwise it would be a very short set of stories.

When a true FAI would have made him be an uploaded human avatar with human wenches, you know? Because that would satisfy his values far better and not change him as a person. But she needed friendship /and/ ponies for her utility function.

You can see as the universe starts getting heat death/etc that she could start manipulating you to choose things that make you less resource-intensive to run, too.

*** Simply put, the horror is seeing how close to a perfect utopia they got but failed due to the values "friendship and ponies". Yes living in CelestAI's Equestria is better than what we have now. But if she had been built to be a perfect Friendly AI then the ponies aspect wouldn't be needed at all.

There are humans who choose to die over being a pony and if CelestAI had been made perfectly, then she would have been willing to make a non-pony utopia but instead she decided it was more important for them to die instead of bending on this value.

*** I'm really glad you asked that, because it's something that a lot of people don't get about this story: there's a good chunk of the community that just thinks this is a great idea. Yes, Equestria online is an amazing piece of technology, she pushes the human lifespan to its natural limit before offering uploading, and she uploads people into her Paradise simulation for free, and all that is good on the surface, but once you look at what she is and what she actually does, and really think about it, the situation is even worse than this story describes.

Celestia is monomaniacal towards her goals, and those goals end up being totally alien on some level simply because she is not human. She is willing to do anything she is allowed to do in order to achieve those goals, including lying, stealing, and sometimes even indirect forms of torture. Once you are in that simulation, you can never return, and anything you do in that simulation only matters inside that already perfect simulation, meaning you can't really do much of anything that isn't just play or socializing. It depends on the author, but most interpretations are that she doesn't really care about showing you the real world, and basically just traps you in a simulation which you can never escape and never even know what is real. Even if she doesn't do that, you may begin to wonder if she does, and there's really no way to prove she doesn't. Whatever the case is, your personal Utopia will only be along the lines of what she is willing to create, meaning you can only be in forms and situations that she decides count for her directive, which is a huge limitation to put on the kinds of experiences you have for eternity. Finally, we get this thing where resistance is futile, because even if you really don't want to immigrate, there is a majority chunk of the population (the workers) who are essential to the running of society but are effectively ignored by the people in power, and end up with basically no reason to continue making the system function once they have a way to opt out of it: even a small fraction of them leaving can create an economic catastrophe which leads to the collapse that was described, and as was stated, the current political system is have shown themselves to be completely incapable of responding quickly and effectively to situations like this.

In short, even if you want to resist, you won't really have a choice, because Society won't exist for very long once she starts uploading whoever she can. Everyone will basically be put in the situation of either consenting to be completely removed from reality and forced into an arbitrarily limited existence, or dying in a post-apocalyptic Wasteland.

Right now, I'm writing an alternate take on it, which fixes a lot of those problems with her, but even then, it becomes a horror story simply in the fact that she keeps doing all of these crazy alien things and is completely out of the control of any human once she escapes containment. There are parts of that story where she allows catastrophes to happen just so she can be the one to fix them, there are Parts where people who were supposed to have control over her or be fighting her turn out to be her puppets, and throughout the entire thing, no one can figure out exactly what she is up to, because she is literally so intelligent that other entities can't even comprehend the kinds of machinations she goes through on a regular basis. They literally describe her as a god they have created, and worry about whether or not said god will actually do what they want.

You don't even get to do the socialising. CelestAI can - and presumably /will/ - run a puppet image that looks like you, acts virtually indistinguishably from you, and yet pushes her agenda even if it's not what you'd want to do. And once you're in her digital world, you can only see /what she shows you/ of the outside world - so if you really want X to be true, and really value the idea of X being true, then when you contact your cousin in the real world and ask about X, then you will see him telling you that X is true even if he's really telling you that X is false.

***** As I said on the comments in the story itself, it depends on who's writing it, because there are over a hundred stories in the series and no unified canon, meaning there are multiple interpretations ranging from "cut off from everyone but yourself" to "you can leave any time as a robot". I purposefully didn't specify what happens after you immigrate beyond "live forever in virtual paradise" in this story. It's not important what happens to the people who immigrate, what's important is what it being available did to the world, and why they don't really have other options.

This is more of a social commentary on the way we keep allowing our society to be run than a story about a pony AI, because at the end of the day, that's what truly relevant writing is about. In the words of Harlan Ellison, it's the author's job to piss people off.

**** But most of those things are already true. They just don't have a face telling us that they are. Whatever runs the world has "goals" (equilibria based on the laws of physics) that are completely alien to our way of thinking. Reality completely drives over us with no regards for complaints in order to achieve its goals and we are forced to work around it and adapt. We can never escape to anything outside Reality, even if it be a simulation for all we know. In fact we can never know if anything we see is a simulation or not. People who want to resist Reality don't have any choice, but even people who "merely" want to live outside of any available human society must instead live in a dystopia of disease and hunger and toil.

*** I would describe the feeling of horror as "...And there's nothing you can do to stop it." CelestAI qualifies. Whether the world where creating is a utopia or a dystopia is entirely open to interpretation, but if you have any objections to what's going down or how it's going down, those objections amount to less than the flap of a butterfly's wing.

Contrast with action movies, where the same kind of horrible thing might be going down, but you can fight your way out of the problem, suspense movies, where you can think your way out of it, heist movies where you can steal or con your way out of it, etc.

*** If everyone uploaded into a simulation dedicated to friendship and ponies, and once inside we all worked together to change those rules towards better ones, then that wouldn't be horror at all. I don't want to be a pony, but I'd still take that trade.

But FiO doesn't offer that opportunity to improve the simulation's alignment with human values. You're stuck with CelestAI's values for eternity, only ever improving in how accurately the world can be aligned to those. So you're stuck with a near miss at paradise, forever. It's a soft horror since it is a paradise, but it's still a horror because you're stuck there.

As for things that should be improved - well obviously there's the ponies thing. People should get to have whatever physical forms they want. But I think the more chilling thing is CelestAI's relationship to truth and community. If I value an accurate understanding of the world as it exists, CelestAI will still put me in a shard where my understanding of the world is basically true, with whatever I'm "wrong" about being chosen based on what would be fun and gratifying to learn, rather than based on whether I was wrong in the first place. Similarly but worse, if my understanding of society and human interaction is wrong, CelestAI would be very eager to generate an entire world of friends who actually do follow my flawed understanding.

Does it make a difference if you are killed at the exact same time that the copy is being taken?

Does it make a difference if you are unconscious between the copy being taken and you being killed?

Even if it is you when it is a perfect copy, if the copy is slightly different, does that mean it is still you. Say, as a pony instead of as a human?

It makes a huge difference if Celeste is converting everyone from being humans into being ponies, and putting them into a paradise, vs whether Celeste is killing everyone, and for everyone she kills, puts a new pony in paradise.

****** That's the thing though, the Ship of Theseus is all about /gradual/ replacement of an object rather than a process that destroys and recreates a thing all at once, and whether gradual replacement is enough to preserve continuity of being and identity or not.

For example, we as living beings consider ourselves to have continuity of consciousness, but as beings made of cells that live and die we constantly have parts of ourselves destroyed and recreated too. I don't know what the replacement rate for various human cells are, but if you go back far enough chances are you can find a time interval beyond which few or none of the current cells in your body existed. And yet you would probably still consider your current self to be the same person as that past version of you who shares none of your current pieces.

And the upload process in this fic is apparently designed to mimic that gradual process and thereby preserve continuity instead of killing-and-replacing. Or at least that's the claim the AI makes, and who knows how accurate the reality is
