Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Could someone sugest some powers for an story idea I have. I was thinking a magic sytem mainly made up of the type of powers you would find in [[/r/shittysuperpowers][r/shittysuperpowers]] would lead to an intresting world. Any power sugestions idealy need to have two attributes:

1) The power is pasive, it is something that happens to the holder of the power and not something they can decide not to use. There should be no power were it's downside can be escaped by simpley never activateing it.

2) The power needs to be situational. idealy to the detriment of every day life.

Some powers examples.

[Tiny intagablity]: This powers holder is intagable to any solid objects that can fit in a 4cm diameter sphere. This was made to avoid being shot with low calaber bullets.

[No Girls Allowed]: If this powers holder say the words "No Girls Allowed" any girls in ear shot of of that are teliported out of ear shot. The area in ear shot of the user when they said the words will atomaticly teliport any girls who try to enter to the apposite side of the area. This effect persists until the powers is activated again.

[Flint skin]: If this powers holder's skin touches human skin (incudeing there own) it produses a large amount of red hot sparks. The holder is immune to the sparks but not to the fires prodused by the sparks. This was made to start a fire.

[The sunny road]: If the holder of this power comes to the conculsion that they have made an irrevocable mistake an ilusion verson of them, that only they can see, will appear. This ilusion will be and do exatly what the user would have done if they had not made the mistake.

[Creepy carpet]: Any fabric the powers holder touches will become intelligent and can fly. The amount they can lift increasses with size but they are slower the larger they are. The intelligent fabric will love the powers holder dearly. They will also be posesive and become murderously jealous to anyone they consider a 'love rivel'. This mostly means other sentient fabrics but can also aply to other humans.

[Alarm stop]: When sleeping or trying to sleep a milimenter deep field that blocks all sound will be created around the holder of this power at skin level.

*** [Forced hijack]: At all times, the holder of this power pilots both their own body and the next-closest human body. This power does not come with any sort of multi-tasking ability, so it's easy to use in a clumsy fashion, or to fail to keep track of what's happening to both bodies. Whoever the power applies to is effectively locked in while being controlled - the power holder is not getting any input from them on what to do.

[Self taunt]: The holder of this power has a mind-reading ability, allowing them to hear the inner monologues of people around them! However, they only get to hear negative thoughts about themselves, and if someone /isn't/ mentally criticizing/insulting them, the power will just /make up/ plausible negative thoughts as filler. Basically, mind-reading, but warped and embellished to make the power holder think everyone hates them.

[Lucky strike]: The holder of this power warps probability, making it impossible for them to die - circumstances will always contrive to prevent it. However, the power-holder feels constant pain proportional to the probability of death the power is acting to avoid - so, for example, they'd survive getting into a bad car accident, but it'd be excruciatingly painful even if they weren't actually injured at all, because they /almost/ died so much and the power did a lot of work to avert that. As the power-holder gets older, they will inevitably wind up in increasingly poor health, immobile and in unimaginable pain because they should be dropping over dead every moment.

[Laser show]: "Freckles" drift aimlessly around the power-holder's skin, each moving at a speed of about an inch every few minutes. These "freckles" constantly produce lasers pointed outwards at the surrounding environment. These aren't sci-fi laser weapons - they're simple laser pointers, with invisible beams (outside of fog, anyway) that produce visible colored dots on the surfaces of walls, objects, etc. Just like these simple lasers, though, they are capable of blinding people if pointed in their eyes, so they do have /some/ use as a weapon. The power holder is thankfully immune to this.

[Psychic scream]: Any sound the holder of this power produces will be heard at an uncomfortably loud volume by everyone in a radius of several miles. This includes speech, but also things like snoring, sneezing, coughing, footsteps, /eating/...

**** I don't understand the lucky strike one. Does the power prevent ALL damage, or just life ending events? Could a guy tie off his leg with a tourniquet and saw it off? If he got in the car wreck would he come away unscathed or would he accrue any injuries that aren't actually going to kill him?

What would happen if he tried to kill himself? An increasingly improbable series of events that would save him, and eventually put him in too much pain to continue trying?

***** Just life-ending events. It makes all damage less likely insofar as all damage makes death likelier, but he still /can/ be damaged as long as it doesn't kill him.

And yeah, an increasingly improbable series of events would save him if he tried to kill himself - unfortunately for him, I think one of the simplest ways to resolve this would be for the attempt to fail but disable him badly enough that he can't try again.

*** [Skinbreather]: The holder of this power, instead of breathing through their mouth or nose, does so through their skin. However, if any part of their skin is covered, they will feel discomfort in that spot, as if someone had put a wet cloth over their face - but only in that area. Only a small part needs to be uncovered to breathe properly, however.

[Homeostasis]: The holder of this power has an endocrine and circulatory system that is always at human norm if possible. This means that chemical changes will only occur if that is what the average human at their age and gender has at that moment. No adrenaline, perfectly normal puberty, can't feel the chemical facets of emotions. They are resistant against attacks by poisons or hormones, but can only feel intellectual stimulation - and even then, it's not necessarily enjoyable.

[Fifth step]: The holder of this power can only take steps in groups of five. These can be as large or as small as they want, but their must be five in a row. When locked into stepping, they cannot be bodily hijacked or prevented from stepping in any manner - they will blast through solid concrete if it is the only way they can take additional steps. If their is a concrete wall on only one side, however, they will just turn around to take the next step.

[Scorpion's tail]: The holder of this power can vomit scorpions under their control at will, and will also do so if they would vomit normally. They can only have one scorpion living at a time; any additional ones will arrive dead on being vomited up.

[Target Practice]: Everyone will feel minor annoyance towards the holder of this power, but they can't feel anything worse either. Generally gets along without making enemies and hopes he isn't spit on by some random guy on the street. He tries to be nice.

*** [Spellcheck]: the user can cast magic spells, but the spells xan only be composed of words that are commonly confused due to homonym, homoglyph, or AutoCorrect. Changes to those forms of perception in turn change the availability of spell words. For example, =they're there= could be an effective teleport spell, but only for enbies or groups of people. =i speed= would make something's speed imaginary; =I speed= would accelerate the user, =eye speed= would enhance visual perception, but if a more-intelligient autocorrect rule were enacted, the use of =i= and =I= would go away because the confusion diminished, and that moght take out =eye= as well.

*** [Personal force field]: At all times, the holder is surrounded by a force field that blocks solid objects from coming closer than 1 cm from their skin, including the ground and clothing. Forces exerted upon any point on the force field are evenly distributed upon the holder's body, and angular momentum is evenly applied to the holders' body when those forces are offset from the holders' center of mass. Good luck with the body paint in lieu of clothing, the liquid diet, and the complete loss of any usefulness for fine-motor skills.

[Future sight]: At all times, the holder sees the future as it will be 10 seconds from now. The holder cannot see the present. Other senses (touch, hearing, smell, taste, proprioception, etc.) are unaffected. Basically blindness with a perk.

[Obvious telepathy]: The inner monologue of anyone within 1,000 ft. is reproduced as an audible sound coming from 5 cm behind your head. Other people can hear the sounds, and your own thoughts are broadcast as well.

** I'm working on a new story based on the idea of transplanting the idea of Succession Games with games like Civilization or more specifically in a Masters of Orion-type of game, but I'm cutting away the explicit game-ness, although the space mechanics and combat will be much more game inspired but a bit hidden.

A Succession Game is where 2 or more people take turns, playing the save game for some defined amount of time, and then passing control on to the next player. The whole fun of it is seeing what the other people have done with the save, how their style is different and so on.

In Roman history, 2 Consuls were elected to serve for a year, alternating month by month, who was in control. So I decided to do a Roman space power, with the two Consuls serving for 5 years each cycle before going into Hibernation / flash-frozen.

The main character will be the second consul who wakes up after the first consul has established their first space yards, colonies and ships, etc.

I've decided to put a lot of focus on the idea of the hibernation, presuming that at some point in history a large amount of the population were placed in suspended animation, and the scientists who freeze and unfreeze people are part of a power block that can counter-act the consuls to some extend, and limit their ability to serve beyond their 5 year turn.

I'm still playing around with the ideas, and where the conflict will come from. My characterization ideas are based on a succession game I played in Space Empires 4 with one other person. I always loved the idea of building out these durable defenses on each planet, and really focusing on small unit buildouts with infantry and mechanized troops, weapon platforms, mines, satellites and fighters defending local colonies.

The optimal way to play Space Empires 4 was always to mostly ignore that stuff (except perhaps mines) and build large ships, so I'd like to build a setting that allows for both, or somewhere in the middle. The character I played in this semi-roleplayed succession game was very militaristic and focused on Esprit de corps and elite units, so I want to contrast those characteristics in the MC with the other Consul being mainly a ships and colonies focused person who goes to the other extreme.

I've established a lot of ideas around the Roman themeing in the process of planning and plotting out the first few chapters.

I've already been reading about the three lines of the Roman legions which I want to incorporate, and I'm working on writing thematically appropriate ship names and people's names for the setting but there's a lot more work to do, and I need to justify why the "Succession" rule (of alternating 5 year terms) wouldn't just fall apart.

*** Do the two consuls repeat? It doesn't sound like it, and if so, you could say the posting is actually a punishment. "Do well as consul and your prison sentence will be reduced by twenty years." or "Consuls get their exile from the Core Worlds lifted."

In Boatmurdered, the conceit they used was that no-one actually wanted to be in charge of the place, because it was a terrifying nightmare, so they were always conspiring to find a replacement. However, the place was remote and they couldn't just conscript a local, and that made for enough time between rulers to build up a story.

**** They repeat. Obviously not forever.

One of the Consuls is connected with the Senate and powerful families, and one (the MC) is connected with the Temple of Juno. I've got a lot of backstory involving Temple warrior traditions. I've had a character idea in my head for years that I'm fleshing out for this story.

I originally was going to just write it, but I decided to play it out with different styles for the two Consuls with Space Empires IV Proportions mods which makes colonial development realistic, as it takes a long time to develop a colony, and you can either make it a less effective colony with basic mining facilities, or go the slow way and build cities and such.

Proportions AI isn't any good, so I'm playing the other spacefarers as well. I'm still in Consul Seleucus' first rule, focusing on building bigger ships and getting the first colonies established.

I'm making all my alien spacefarers more complex than just Alien omnicidal maniacs. I've got a hyper-religious society, a very anti-social loner / isolated society and a more peaceful society.

** So for a creative writing class, I recently wrote a short story where in a semi-postapocalyptic United States where technology is failing and getting replaced by magic, the preferred mode of transportation, at least, for postal workers delivering packages, are enchanted mech suits/combat exoskeletons that jump from place to place by processes I explained only tangentially (something something springs, something something flywheels, something something magic-momentum converter.) The magic in these suits also handles the other inconveniences caused by bouncing through the air at speeds faster than a locomotive, such as getting killed by the acceleration or the windchill.

Now, obviously, this idea is totally ridiculous, and I'm not going to bother trying to explain why the government doesn't use this tech to make superior forms of land transportation. However, I do at least want it to be plausible that this is the "least bad" form of non-riverine transportation. I've included the following setting details:

-- Staying on a road too long gets you eaten by "land sharks". -- Flying is impossible. (I don't bother explaining this, except with something about shape-shifting clouds).

Are there any other details I should include in revisions to make it seem plausible that literally every other mode of overland transport is somehow worse?

** Writing skills question:

it's easy to say "... six months later ...", but it's difficult to make the reader /feel/ that time has passed in a story. Does anyone have thoughts of how to get the reader to feel a great deal of time passing, without having to write, say, six months' worth of content?

My current thought is to do a "time passing montage", kind of similar to how an old Disney movie might show the pages of a calendar falling off while the trees outside turn orange, lose their leaves, get covered with snow, grow new leaves, and bloom, and then fruit grows. But with text it would take a lot longer to communicate something like that which can be put across in like 30 seconds on a screen.
