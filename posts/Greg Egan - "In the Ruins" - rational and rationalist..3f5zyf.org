Well yes, but that's why it's satire rather than "Everyone's dead, Jim."

***** I meant more that in most of the classic examples, you get a sense that this is the state of the whole world - eg /1984/, /Brave New World/, etc - whereas here it's just a country that many people don't like anyway.

I mean, there are /already/ very large and powerful countries where things generally suck, and that's normal (for them, which is bad) not a dystopia.

****** Actually, in /1984/ we ever saw or heard anything outside the UK. For all we know, it could have been a North Korea-style failed state.

Yes, but my original comment was a deliberate exaggeration for effect.

** I'm not really a fan of how heavy-handed the story is. It reads as a caricature. And... the word "nerd" apparently bothers him? I mean, I see his point kind of, but I don't feel very persuaded by it. I mostly like Egan though, but I'm afraid the stories I like most are the least rational.

*** It was the heavy-handedness that reminded me of this subreddit. I mean, you wouldn't describe HPMoR as "subtle" would you? ^^

It IS an insult, you know. That some of us use it on ourselves is just like all "reappropriations" of words. Call yourself a nerd all you like, but if you don't consider yourself one, please also don't use it to describe others either -- not unless you want to belittle them.

** From sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
#+end_quote

The ultimate if a bit crude application of this principle, I stopped mid story and grabbed a piece of paper to work out the solution. And the final connection to higher dimension rotation is undoubtedly satisfying.
