** Some fireworks for your Fourth of July, American readers!

Well, here we are. Just a couple days shy of two months from the first post. 110,000 words later we're not an end, but perhaps the end of the beginning. This thing has been absolutely meteoric- I think we're at something like 14,000 views now between AO3 and RR, and the positive response from all of you has been truly overwhelming. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

There will /not/ be a hiatus, but I have gained a lot of sympathy for authors who take them at the end of big narrative segments. Praise be the backlog, it will sustain us in our time of trial.

As far as story length and how much longer this might go on- well, the first arc was 7 chapters, the second was 17. We've got a couple loose end intermissions coming, and then I've got at least 2 more arcs that /have/ to happen. Judging by that rate of expansion, the next will be between 27 and 40 chapters, unless I just completely lose control of it which- yeah, I can see that happening. So we're probably not even 1 quarter of the way through to my original planned ending. And nothing about this has gone to plan. So likely we have a good few months to go, still.

It's only going to get weirder. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you there!

*** Both one of the most consistent and highest-quality works on this sub. Thanks for your writing! I'm frankly amazed that you have so much more planned--this arc was climactic enough that I could imagine it as the story's end, given an epilogue--but clearly we have a long way to go.

Are the story-things supposed to be borrowed from Worm's Entities, or is that just convergent evolution of immortal cosmic entities?

**** Thank you!

You know how cosmic entities are these days, you've seen one you've seen them all. But I don't think I've made any Worm references (yet).
