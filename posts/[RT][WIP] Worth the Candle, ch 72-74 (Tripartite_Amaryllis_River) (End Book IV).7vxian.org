** My apologies for how long this took, but in my defense it's 20,000 words across three chapters. I don't plan on doing that again in the future, mostly because the rereading and editing takes so long that I basically skip a day of actual writing (and this is still like 1/4th the length of a novel, so will probably have loads of errors).

Beyond the implied author/reader contract that gets heightened when money is involved, a fair amount of the stuff in this story is personal, and while I've made some effort at disguising it for the eventual day that anonymity was broken, I'm not sure that I can ethically accept payment without at least some weakening of anonymity.

I'll figure something out, and probably have a decision at the start of Book V in a few days. The smart way of thinking about it is that by not accepting money, I'm basically paying money to be independent/anonymous ... and while I might be able to justify that at $20 a month, I don't think that I could reasonably go higher.

***** The introduction of Patreon has slowed down every single serial I've seen except Wildbow's (Mother of Learning being the most glaring example). I think introducing /structured/ payment tends to ruin the mindset of quite a few serial writers, since then it feels like a job, as you said.

I think a tip jar is the best solution, but of course it's up to you. You can set up a company Paypal if you want to hide your identity, and I don't understand your ethical argument. You are delivering a great service anonymously so why shouldn't you get some voluntary reward in the same way? Even if you go the Patreon route, a ton of game developers there stay anonymous all throughout, in my experience.

** Got to say- those chapters made me deeply uncomfortable with soul magic. More than I was already, anyway.\\
It's scary especially because it's becoming more and more likely to be /a common thing/ in the /near/ future, as technology (e.g. new drugs, magnets disabling parts of brain, greater and greater insight into human mind) and... infrastructure (everything collected on us /got/ to give an edge to a future manipulative AI or some/one/) now can already achieve a large degree of that.

  ‚ÄúI'm trying to find the seam of common cause,‚Äù said Amaryllis, which fell just short of being a bald-faced lie. She remembered what it had been like to think that Fallatehr was all-encompassing, and that gave her a handle on how to frame her arguments here. True manipulation might come later.

  ‚ÄúFallatehr spoke of it in terms of stability,‚Äù said Amaryllis. ‚ÄúThere's nothing grounding what Grak feels about Fallatehr, so it should evaporate more quickly, if I understand it right.‚Äù
#+end_quote

Honestly wondering to what degree does a soul modification change a person permanently- sure, unsupported changes revert, but it's a two-way pull, and new memories aren't erasable, and those often have the emotional component.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied Grak without elaboration. I let him sit and massage where the ropes had been digging into him. ‚ÄúI was ... I had purpose.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúServing Fallatehr,‚Äù I said.

  ‚ÄúIt wasn't service,‚Äù said Grak. ‚ÄúIt was wanting something more than myself."

Some insight into Grak's mind, which frankly makes me sad- being mind-raped making an /improvement/ in some way suggest a really bad state of mind, which I can relate to.

It certainly doesn't help that Valencia is... her own kind of monstrous, mysterious and overpowered, and released upon world at large.\\
In fact, all of them are ridiculously overpowered, one way or another. One safety blanket are limitations of author's capability and willingness to torture our hero (or anyone, for that matter).

Let's also not forget the fact that pretty much everyone in World of Jun shares certain character traits (relatively high emotional stability, easy grasp of rationality and self-control, the clear and almost clinical manner of speech (though it's conversational still- not really a criticism, just can't find more accurate expression)), which makes the setting even more dangerous.

Enjoying it overall, though. It's high-level play all the way through, laid with munchkinry, careful deliberation and healthy paranoia. Also good characters, in case I made a different impression.

Rambling, but yeah, some thoughts.

** That wait was the worth it! (It being the candle, I suppose).

Wow, chapter 73 threw me for a loop at first. I was thinking to myself "Wait, have we ever had a chapter without Juniper as the narrator?" and was just about at the point of being worried enough to start flipping through old chapters when I reached (((the explanation.))) It actually made me laugh with relief!

It was a good end to the book and arc, but I'm left wondering if we're done with Parsmont. It feels like the team doesn't have any reason to stay, but the introduction of the Abswifth makes me think that the Bendon has to make an appearance somehow.

So, we've now solved an issue pressuring Juniper since chapter 27 (or really, chapter 25). Whew! Feels like forever ago! What will the next plot be?

- Figure out a way to save the Six-Eyed Deer?

- Find out more about Nellan?

- Leveling montage?

- Find a more permanent base of operations?

I'd guess Nellan to be Fenn's child. I think most readers probably expect this, as it'd then be natural for her to value Nellan more than Juniper. But she showed distaste at having children since they'd be hybrids that'd be treated horribly by both elves and many humans. So if not her child who else could Nellan be? A childhood friend that she feels more loyalty towards than even Juniper?

*** They could have worked with him and come away richer for it, I agree. From how Fallatehr was talking to Mary it seemed like he truly did intend to learn about Jun in exchange for teaching him, after which they'd both go their separate ways.

However, a big problem (aside from Jun's entirely reasonable inability to establish trust/expose his neck) was that there was a fundamental, insurmountable wall between Jun and Fallatehr in terms of their values. Jun is a morally normal/above average individual. Fallatehr was, or at least came across to me as, a very charming/intelligent but still Mengele-esque sociopath.

Jun working with the guy in good faith would have required him to abandon certain of his core values, a big one being what he sees as his personal responsibility to not unleash evil/suffering on the world. This inclination was incompatible with letting Fallatehr continue to practice his soul magic.

IMO there was never really any other way this would have ended once Jun learned of how terrible a person Fallatehr was. Killing the guy was the the right course of action, barring a way to quarantine him or disable his soul magic. Not letting the guy gather more knowledge was also the right thing to do, because he couldn't ever have been trusted not to use it to attack Jun.

PS - Just goes to show how well the author wrote this villain, because I was also kind of rooting for him (in a visceral/knee jerk kind of way) all the way up until the end.

If we imagine quests are assigned at appropriate times, this one started with the breakout, so it /probably/ wasn't missed while Juniper was in his own soul. Maybe the game just didn't want to force his decision by showing him the quest? That seems crucial.

I'm in the camp of readers who might be saps and still sort of hoped a mutual resolution was possible, but even if they could trust him, I think you're exactly right. They could never trust him to /be good/.

I hope that Joon practices with modifying bodies on animals, because if he can get good at it he can fix any injury, or improve his body in any number of ways. At the very least he should be able to sharpen his senses, make himself more resistant to damage, and change his appearance at will.

Channeling the razor, it's easier to say Fenn grew attracted to Joon-the-sap and he's been a moralizing influence ever since. The tower would have accelerated her awareness of that.

** I really enjoyed this book, and this wrap-up was excellent, though I have this nagging feeling that Fallatehr's plan was weak and if he should by all means have won if he played it straight.

If Fallatehr expected to be seen through quickly, and it seems to me that he should have, and he was actually OK with indirect forms of learning, why wouldn't he have apparated to another continent with his hostages and negotiated indirectly?

He took a huge amount of risk in order to soulfight Juniper, but then did very little to prevent the obvious countermeasure of stabbing. If you're going to sacrifice your strongest assets, eg. Amaryllis' loyalty, to engineer a face-to-face confrontation, you should have good reasons to believe that controntation is more favourable than you could have organised without the element of surprise.

*** I think it was crucial that Fallatehr was acting on bad information: He thought that Juniper had no access to soul-magic, and so wouldn't have the additional clue that Amaryllis' soul was untampered with.

Juniper acted as he did because he realized that the impostor wasn't Amaryllis, and having been able to examine her soul shortly before had to have played a big role in that. Fallatehr may not have been particularly exposed before he approached Jun, in which case the deciding factor was Jun's fortuitous misleading of fake!Mary about regaining Essentialism.

If we accept that Fallatehr would have won had Jun not mislead fake!Mary, then his mistakes, though a bit of a gamble, don't seem so outrageous when he held the cards that he did.

Also keep in mind that Fallatehr was *fucked* from the moment he altered Amaryllis. He had no way of knowing that Jun had a perfect counter to soul magic used against Amaryllis and may not have been convinced by any lukewarm words Grak shared about Narrative, but once that bridge was crossed he needed to either kill Jun or become Jun's ally. Both of those options are only available in person.

Honestly, what Fallatehr /should/ have done is altered his values to be the perfect companion to Jun in hopes of making himself trustworthy and indispensable and maybe into a Companion, but it is hard to believe his pride would have allowed for that.

***** You are misunderstanding. Once Fallatehr has Amaryllis, he has a very different take on the Narrative than he got from Grak, and due to the soul link his options become closed off. The Narrative makes it clear that he cannot survive long term as Joon's enemy, and that he will almost certainly end up dead. His best hopes then are for an amicable resolution, which is exactly what he seeks in person. His last resort is to hope the Narrative does not give Joon guaranteed wins and that he can kill him, which is the path he is forced to take when negotiations fail. Unless Amaryllis is wrong (and he can see just how formidable she is) there is no middle ground. Even if Fallatehr's credence were only at 50%, that's not a risk you take with immortal life, not when he knows he has Joon beat and that they /can/ work together. Given how Joon laments that Fallatehr really seemed earnest, I think we can assume that Fallatehr's credence in Narrative, whatever it was, was sufficient.

*** It was more comprehensive in the original draft, with the various scenarios being planned for and argued about, but it felt like a lot of faff, especially because those scenarios would be revealed in 73, where there's zero tension, and I've never really found post-facto explanations to read that well.

Like, "Fallatehr was standing beneath the light specifically because that was a place that Grak had warded to protect him, in case of ambush" is all well and good, but if it's explained after the fact, and pointless to the narrative, rather than as a "turn" in the beats of the scene, what's the point? (The point is to show some cleverness, or make sure there's not a 'plot hole', but I kind of go back and forth on how much that's worth it -- I'm obviously not shy about including things because I think they're neat, even if they're not plot relevant.)

Fallatehr's perception/read is that he has literally all of Juniper's teammates captured and at the knife, and that the result will be submission and/or breaking to the strength of coercion ... but his last effort is to invoke the name of Amaryllis, and Juniper just stabs him anyway, despite this (from ch 73):

Fundamentally the issue is that, if this is your expectation, immediate direct confrontation doesn't give you anything that bargaining at a distance doesn't. Fallatehr could have stolen away every companion and traded them piecemeal; not doing so implies that Juniper would be /more/ willing to submit in a short-term confrontation than over a long-term bargain from a weaker position. I don't see Amaryllis making that judgement.

This holds double given Fallatehr gained rather significant assets with, eg., the teleportation key.

A remote negotiation would take longer and has other points of failure. He's overconfident, he's very curious about Joon and thinks his plan gave him the best chance to get to him.

His actual plan was basically reasonable so "he didn't want to" is adequate explanation for why he didn't use another theoretically better plan you've thought of.

** I am glad that this arc is over. In a lot of fiction I enjoy the whole mind control element and how it impacts politics/interpersonal relationships, but Fallatehr just wasn't very engaging. I tend to like it in more emotional/character driven stories so maybe that's the issue. That isn't to say that I didn't like all the other parts of this arc. The action sequences and worldbuilding aspects were really fun.

I look forward to seeing what long term consequences this arc has. I kinda hope Fallatehr planted some 'bombs' in the Grak's and Amaryllis's souls, I can't imagine that a soul mage with centuries to hone his skills and who was one of the best soul mages in an empire with the best soul magic would limit themselves to only increasing his own value in their value systems (regarding the quality of the second empire's magic: ok, I'm not sure if this is literally true, it's just the impression I got and nobody in the story is in a really good position to check and see if the second empire had the best soul magic out there.). Regardless, I think that the soul magic will definitely have long term effects on Grak and, to a limited extent, Amaryllis. I also expect that Fallatehr managed to fuck up world politics in some (probably minor) way. Additionally, He probably had time to enthrall random people.

Moving on to a more exciting topic, Valencia. In many respects she's like a child. She's probably never before had the opportunity to make decisions and is learning how. I can't imagine that fight to the death going on right in front of her eyes helped her develop in a purely positive manner. It seems that she is in the process of developing her moral code/center. None of the other characters seem aware of this? I think mistakes will be made and I hope that they don't have disastrous consequences.

We haven't seen much about the locus/six-eyed doe yet. To be fair they haven't been part of the story for very long and haven't had much opportunity to act besides. I do worry that we are reaching the point where adding more companions just means that other companions won't be developed or their development will halt, which would be a shame. For this reason I hope that Valencia is the last member of their kharass (barring somebody like Arthur). Of course I could be underestimating cthulhuraejepson's skill, in which case I'm worrying about nothing.

*** I don't think +Disney is going to go make /Fallatehr: A Candle Story/ to answer our unasked questions+ there was a whole lot more going on with him as a character, but I thought he made for engaging /scenes/. Seeing how the party struggled against his threat was the point even when he wasn't nearby, and I thought it did that well.

He was a cunning negotiator with Amaryllis, odious to Fenn, and a teacher to Juniper.

  I haven't known very many people. Most of them were Fallatehr.

The truth of that sentence is bad enough /out/ of context. I bet he'll still have some impact through Valencia.

I wonder how?

There are some constraints. He could teleport anywhere - so no location constraint. But he has his immediate circumstances to think about: no "fixing the world" when he has to escape very soon. He wouldn't have access to random world leaders, but he might be able to get to Bendon since it seems like the two leaders of the city don't rely on guards.

Things that might be of immediate use E.g. scheduling cavalry to come later, or gaining some special resource (that he didn't immediately use).

I would have be some way of immediate (at least value). Perhaps

** There's something about the slow reversion/decay of Soul editing that doesn't make sense to me... I though the whole point of soul editing was to change the baseline "normal" state of the soul - which would imply that the edit now becomes the new normal.

I can rationalize it partly if some changes are in conflict with some other changes, i.e. Amarylis' value on self preservation conflicting heavily with her Fallatehr boner - but that just seems like a poor editing job that created an unstable set of values. A skilled soul mage should be able to edit multiple values into a new equilibrium that doesn't decay - say by lowering the values which conflict with the intended edits. A ham-fisted way to do it could be by creating a meta value of "values the person/state I was in before meeting Fallatehr" and set that in the heavy negatives; whereas a more subtle way to do it would be to look at existing values in the soul that conflict and lowering all of them to a certain degree until a stable equilibrium of new values emerge.

Another way to do it would be to just wholesale copy over the soul mages' existing value system - delete or set to zero every single value in the poor fucker and copy over everything since you know that is a stable equilibrium.

*** Recall that only Joon gets an actual character sheet with neatly arrayed lists of values and numerics for them, and then only for his own/Companion's souls. (He had to keep looking at his own soul as a map to do anything at all with the rib donor's).

Your complaint seems to be more with the idea that soul mages can't avoid decay than that unstable edits should decay - but not only does Fallatehr say that he has made his prisonmates stable, we're also told exactly why Fallatehr would make the fewest changes possible to Grak: Amaryllis was analyzing Grak heavily and convinced that if Grak had changed she should be able to tell. By NOT changing Grak except for loyalty, that Grak was changed can be almost undetectable.

*** We're not told much about the mechanism of the soul or soul editing except that it's simultaneously malleable and resilient. The best (imperfect) analogy I could find was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape-memory_alloy][shape-memory alloy]]. It doesn't make a new "normal" inasmuch as it distorts the shape, and the soul appears to have its own memory of its blueprint. Or like the immune system, any abrupt changes would be marked as abnormal and attacked.

** Did anyone think that amaryllis managed to bump her loyalty? That's why her. Blood magic and unarmed combat were so strong, she got boosts from joon's skill?

** Hey! I've been working my way through this from the start over the past 48 hours. Loving it a lot. And finally at a point where I can engage with comment threads.

re these chapters, it was really great getting to see things from Amarylis's perspective. Would be great to have things from the others as well. I liked the way you played around with the secondhand narrator thing
