The story is told from the perspective of a girl that only wants what's best for her country and is ready to go down the rabbit hole to see it through. Can't say much more without spoiling it, but it makes use of a lot of the themes you mentioned.

**** Seriously. It's a series that's longer than Harry Potter (and closing in on A Song of Ice and Fire), has extremely consistent thrice weekly updates, and EE may well be putting out his best work right now. (Though admittedly we've probably said that at a lot of points in the series like Ubua at the Battle of the Camps, Ratface's Ex, Black at the Vales and too many more to count)

**** I like it a lot, but I'm a huge Sanderson/cosmere fan. There are Wild West-y parts, but overall it's much more "Victorian steampunk but with magic." It also feels more lighthearted than the original trilogy, which might be partly because it doesn't take place in a tyrannical theocracy under ash-filled skies.

**** The 2nd Era is Hella fun Brandon has managed to tone down the grimdark and ha gotten /much/ better at character development and progression, the original trilogy is fantastic but has its flaws, I would say that those flaws are compensated for in 2nd era, though it is a very different type of story. Honestly, Brandon is always talking about how he wants a Mistborn video game, but if he just jumped over the original trilogy, and set the Game in the backstory of the 2nd Era MC, it would be /fucking amazing/ who wouldn't want to play Mistborn / Red dead redemption?

*** Dexter is fun example of "lawful evil" because he literally works for the police department. (Kinda season 1 spoilers:) Dexter's "backstory" is basically about his lawful good father realizing that Dexter is an evil kid, and realizing that that if Dexter is going to be evil, he can at least be /lawful/ evil. Also, in later seasons, Quinn sort of becomes a foil for Dexter as a sort of "chaotic good" character, culminating in season 7 when he murders a mobster after learning that he raped a girl. It sets up an interesting dichotomy with Dexter, where Dexter is cold, calculating, and by the book, while Quinn is impulsive and moody; Dexter works to control his urges and stick to "the code," while when Quinn kills it's because he listened to his conscience and shot an evil person because it felt like the right thing to do in the heat of the moment.

The movie Les MisÃ©rables has my favorite example of this with Javert who sees himself as lawful good. If you enjoy musicals check it out, although if you have singing experience I hear some of the performances aren't great.

** Main character in Code Geass is, in my opinion, more straight-up villain than simple anti-hero, and yet I sympathized with him and thought his heroic counterpart was naive and ineffectual. Rather than opposing characters openly admitting that he was a good guy, I feel like his choices were ambiguous in-story, despite his place as the main character.

The anime is fantastic, and though the main character is certainly very clever, he's definitely not as rational as he could be, constrained by emotions that work against his best interest, lack of information, and lack of real-world experience in trying to lead a revolution and change the world. Even so, he actually manages to achieve his goals, to some degree.

** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight]] Tropes are your best friends.

Les trois mousquetaires - should fit just fine, if you read the sequel. Literally all characters repent their actions against the main antagonist. He was a hero and a patriot in the best meaning the word has.

Worth the candle. Greatest (and somewhat lost) ruler of all times was quite DnD's lawful evil.

Forged destiny - small but good episode with Tyrian. Hero that failed viewed as bad hero. Then he become bad. As a whole book isn't about the villians.

Syper Powereds - well, haven't finished it yet, but probably fits. Praise the Globe.

Team AMBR: Finding redemption. "Evil" = violent people. Not always bad or wrong. Beware: merciful MC that drives me nuts.

[[http://willsaveworldforgold.com]] - Ardon is the best evil bitch character I've ever seen.

Half-joke is a joke only by half, so - /Il Principe. A good ruler is a bad person./

You may try Warhammer 40k. I mean, Emperor is great and all but also pretty evil.

Also beware the messy English for it not my native.

Well, he is more tough and self-centered than evil, dragging the hymanity to better future, *kicking and sreaming*, and also is not exactly human, but:

Unification Wars were a giant massacre ended in enforcing of harsh law written by Himself and only himself. Not all of people he sentenced then were bad - they were unnecessary for his plan. Like a pretty good priest in the Last Church by Graham McNeill. Also all warriors that he used for war were killed after its end. Means and tools to an end.

During the Crusade several Worlds were destroyed. Genocide was considered bad last time I've checked.

As was proofed in the Dark Imperium He never loved no man even his sons. Engineer, warrior, politic, mage and a lot more. Dad,huh? Not quite. Some people think that the Heresy florished upon daddy issues. Certainly true for Angron, Magnus, Kurze, Perturabo, Lorgar and Mortarion. Especially so for Angron and Lorgan: it cost him nothing to save Angron's comrades or not bombing the Lorgar's capital to make a point in argument.

That's all I could remember apart from wild theories about sypreme only God of galaxy. Wanna more - try 40k forums.

Even pre-Horus Heresy, the Emperor's policy was to purge xenos (aka: any sentient non-human species) and to squash human opposition /at any cost/. Anyone who wasn't willing to submit was crushed. Anyone who didn't want to let go their religious beliefs was brutally repressed. Granted, he had reasons for that behaviour (namely, hoped that by completely squashing religion he'd starve the Chaos Gods of faith and kill them), but it was still really tyrannical. In addition, he still was arrogant. He did cause the Horus Heresy, basically, first by letting Lorgar (the Word Bearer primarch) do his thing and then brutally humiliating him in front of his Legion, then by trusting Horus with the role of Warmaster. He was walking a very fine thread, but then committed some serious blunders which plunged his whole enterprise into Chaos (quite literally), rendering all the suffering he had inflicted all the more pointless.
