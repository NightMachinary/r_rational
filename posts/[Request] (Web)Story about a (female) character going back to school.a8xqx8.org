Inspired by the great new Story "RE: Trailer Trash" (Granny gets sent back in time to be a 13year old and relives her life trying to make it better) on Royalroadl, I would like to ask if someone knows similar stories to this one.

TLDR, Request for:

-- Reincarnation/sent back-in-time/preserved memories

-- SoL

-- female MC preferred

-- school setting if possible

Thanks in advance.


** Ascendance of a Bookworm might scratch this itch for you. It's not set in a school, but it's slice of life iseaki where MC (a sickly young girl) tries to invent paper and books in a world where parchment is very expensive.

*** would upvote more if i could, i have no idea how i could forget it fits the criteria (except the school one), i guess i mostly thought sent-back stories rather then other world transmigration so i'll go with that excuse.

** Ticks all four boxes but still not exactly what you're looking for, the anime Iroduku: The World in Colors is about a girl sent back in time from 2078 to today.

****** Ah~ I see. I hesitate to call "Re: Trailer Trash" a power fantasy mostly due to how few chapters it has at the moment, but it seems to be going in that direction currently.

The MC could still fail in certain objectives in the near future as well. A failure which could have heavy consequences depending on if and how it happens.

******** To be fair to the MC, loosing weight isn't really /hard/ per se. Getting into a routine/habit to lose it is what's hard. Seeing as she had already lived (before) with a fairly healthy diet/lifestyle I don't think it'd be too unbelievable for her to lose weight that fast.

Burning 20 pounds a week may not be absolutely healthy but it is realistically doable.

** I like /Still, Wait for Me/, but that has a male MC. It's also a translated Chinese webnovel. The main character is in his mid-thirties living with a lot of regrets: failed business, failed relationship, lots of debt, but then gets hit by a car and becomes 17 again and gets to relive his life and treat those around him better.

It has a very wistful and nostalgic tone to it, at least the early parts, where the MC relives the last year of high school and realizes, with his 30-year-old mindset, how good things were and how much of it he took for granted, and how fleeting the teenage worries he had were. He also knows the fate of a lot of his classmates and friends so he subtly tries to help them out when he can. It's a very slice of life series, and later on there's business management as well.

I should warn you that maybe 60-80% of the conflict is relationship drama, as the core conflict is that the MC already has a girl he loves--the one that got away in his past life--but he can't go see her as she's 5 years younger than him and she's about 12-13 at the start of the story. (Hence the title of the series as he has to wait to meet her again). Meanwhile, the MC is the type of guy who lacks the guts to flatly turn down women who show interest in him, leaving all of his relationships with women stuck in a "it's complicated" state. So in a sense this is a harem series, and that seems to be the biggest negative as seen from the reviews on novelupdates.

*** Imo, this aspect of metaworld is really weak. Other isekai MCs use their gaming knowledge and/or life experience to help them in the new world.

Metaworld's MC constantly laments how her previous adult life and business acumen have no useful impact to her current teenage life as a mage in training. Her familial relationships are all different, the city she lives in is different, etc. etc. To the point where I question the point of making it isekai. Perhaps I'm spoiled by WtC, where the past life connection is the entire point of the story.

Metaworld's MC does demonstrate some 'maturity' when dealing with uppity teenagers around her... but not in the sense of being able to compromise, or show humility to avoiding petty ego-fights... just that she can stay calm and composed and then use her mary-sue powers to lay out a one-way smackdown of masturbatory levels.

Which can be fun, don't get me wrong.

**** Metaworld have lots of issues, it's one of those guilty pleasures it's not good enough to recommend to anyone but not bad enough to stop reading either, since it does have those fun parts from time to time, its issues kind of grate me a bit too.

what grates me most is probably how the side characters are treated, they don't feel like people they feel like props to make Gwens throne sparkle, metaworld is a mary sue power fantasy pure and true while doing it best not to appear like one.

but those can be nice too sometimes as long as they are well written.

op didn't ask for someone who comes back and is a saint/paragon of virtue/better person so I'm not sure why the MC being prideful and self centered is an issue? MC is dedicated to uplifting the living situations of people even the modern serf class that that have no magic and trying to make humanity better over-all

this is true but the novel starts in her first year of high school, in some of the more recent chapters when MC is in college MC does finally put her MBA powers to work; making a deal with the House of M relating to modernizing the finical institutions of the world.

that being said although i like this story it doesn't have much of an emphasis on the school setting despite the MC being in high school then in college for the whole story so far
