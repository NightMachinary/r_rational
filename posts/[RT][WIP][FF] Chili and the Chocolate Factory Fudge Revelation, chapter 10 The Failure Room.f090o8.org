Gazemaize continues to astound. If I commented about everything I enjoyed in this chapter, I'd just be recapping it. I'm delighted at the continued worldbuilding and characterization. I'm delighted at the continued dark (chocolate) humor. And I still can't wait for the Oompa Loompas to show up and sing about vaping.

** This is not the original Charlie Bucket, but rather a candy-based clone, created by the Factory as a replacement. The original Charlie Bucket /may/ have been the one who committed suicide the moment he left the Factory (presumably because the Factory would have prevented suiciding within said Factory), or that may have been another candy clone.

With the Oompa Loompas out of the picture, the Factory is now in complete control of itself. It needs a replacement for Mr. Bucket, however (since the last one became suicidal); hence the tour

Calling it now.
