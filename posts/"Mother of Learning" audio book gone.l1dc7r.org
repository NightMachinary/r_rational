I listened to the "Mother of Learning" chapter 29 on spotify 2 days ago, and now no audio chapters are shown anywhere.

What happened?!

Was it really taken down?


** Not sure about Spotify, but the man himself links each chapter on [[/r/Voraces]]

Edit: I just checked the links, and they're all 404 now. idk what's going on with it.

Voraces does have nobody103's permission for the recording, so I'm guessing it's just some sort of hiccup, but I don't know.

Edit 2: the most recent chapter shows this comment:

#+begin_quote
  Thank you everyone. It has truly been an honor to narrate this story for you. I hope you will enjoy the new project and maybe check out the other podiobooks narrated by me:

  [[https://jackvoraces.podbean.com/e/chapter-1-super-minion-audiobook/]]

  [[https://seabornaudiobook.podbean.com/e/seaborn-audiobook-chapter-1/]]

  I look forward to bringing the definitive Mother of Learning audiobook to you soon on Audible.
#+end_quote

I guess maybe the project is taken down because nobody103 and/or Jack Voraces are going to monetize, but that's just speculation.

Edit 3: from Voraces' Discord:

#+begin_quote
  @everyone Mother of Learning anouncement: As many of you already know from the livestream yesterday, the Mother of Learning Podiobook is finishing at chapter 87. The author is currently signing an exclusive deal with a major publishing company and they have asked for the podcast to be taken down. All episodes appart from 87 have been removed already. There is good news however, the publishers have agreed to have me do the official audiobook for Audible! We WILL get to finish this book, just not through the podcast.

  We are starting a new project that is a little challenging but has the potential to be aweseome. Check out the Book to New Worlds channel and #chapter-links for the introduction episode.

*** This is fantastic! It's great to see that both Voraces and nobody103 will get money for this, and who knows, with it as an actual product and not a hobbyist thing like this there is even a chance that it will be completed faster this way, although that's probably a stretch.

************ To each their own, but just FYI, most audiobook and podcast apps have pitch-corrected speed controls. I listen to most things at 1.5 or 2.0 speed and find I'm pretty much listening as fast as I'd be visually reading something that I wasn't skimming through. And of course, sometimes with books or parts of books that I'm particularly relishing, I'll dial it down to 1.0 to slow down so I can fully savor and appreciate a good scene or chapter. At other times I might dial up to 2.5-3.0 to skim through parts I'm not so crazy about.

I still visually read plenty, but I go through a surprising number of books annually via audiobook format alone just due to all the immense amounts of time that stack up between driving, working in the kitchen, cleaning, exercising, etc.

************* Doesn't really help with the "engrossed" part. I like to completely lose my place in the world when I read. I cannot pay attention enough to an audiobook while doing anything else, and if I'm gonna just sit there listening I may as well set there reading instead.

*********** I'm not the GP, but I'm pretty anti-audiobook.

Personally, it's because I'm a “visual learner”, i.e. someone with an auditory processing disorder and/or ADHD who needs more time to parse a sentence (and think through its tangential implications) than a narrator/lecturer will tend to give.

I tend to turn on closed captions on every video/film/TV show they watch, despite in theory “understanding” what is being said. I find I can keep up much better with comprehending the words when reading them, than when listening to them.

But! It's not actually hard for me to absorb information presented auditorily (i.e. I'm not hard of hearing); I'm just /slow/ at it. I find that voice-acted dialogue /in video games/ is just fine for me --- because in those, you usually need to “press to advance” between message boxes, so I get the time I need to absorb each sentence/paragraph.

Slide presentations can work as well, if done well (i.e. when you have slide-wise control over the presentation, and the audio is split up such that the audio for the slide plays from the beginning when you focus that slide; rather than effectively being a video with “linear audio”, where the transport controls jump around in the audio stream, and slides stay in sync with that.)

But it's very rare for people who want to present large amounts of information to bother to put it in either of those formats. So I tend to just ask for a transcript instead. :)

************ I find I absorb info better visually, but audiobooks are just very enjoyable because they are passive. I can listen to an audiobook while I work, drive, play video games, while resting with my eyes closed, etc. Listening to audiobooks has let me consume so many more books than I did before, and there is something extra you get with a good narrator. In my head characters don't tend to have different accents, nor do they emote as strongly because that's not really something I understand very well. It is interesting to think about how a narrator's rendition of a book colors the experience (do they choose a voice based on fore knowledge of a character, and does that give hints about that character you would not have picked up on otherwise? Do they add inflection that's not technically in the description of just... so and so said?) anyway that's a tangent. I totally understand why someone wouldn't prefer audiobooks, but I'm a bit defensive because some people tend to look down on audiobooks as somehow less “intellectual” than visual reading. I guess the comments, “I have less than zero desire for an audiobook” and “I have no interest in listening to an audiobook for any reason EVER” came off as like, inherently close minded and made me feel like that person had some specific beef with audiobooks rather than just preferring a visual medium.
