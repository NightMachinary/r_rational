Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I've had a setting bouncing around in my head for a while now for a pen and paper RPG that I'm calling "Thousand Gates" (working title).

Instead of a single world, there are effectively infinite mini-worlds called realms. These essentially follow the biblical model of cosmology, with a flat land surrounded by a spherical firmament. They vary in size and composition, with most containing a single biome. Their land area ranges from a few dozen square miles to a few hundred thousand square miles.

These realms are connected by a shifting network of "gates". These are points in space surrounded by an aurora-like aura. When an object touches the point in the middle, it and every object whose weight is supported by it is teleported to the realm it is connected to. They'll appear near the gate on that side, but not within the aura and won't be touching the gate on that side.

This is a high magic setting, and magic can be used to to do many things including influencing gates.

Below are some rules/features of the world I've come up with. I want to make it so people/players can have a real impact without completely breaking the setting. Let me know if you have any suggestions for it.

- While magic can be used to teleport, it can't be used to travel to a different realm. You have to use a gate for that.
- A Realm must have at least one gate at any time, and realms/gates can never form a closed loop. All realms are always connected to all other realms if you use enough gates.
- Gates normally last between a few days and a few weeks before disappearing. Magic can be used to extend this indefinitely as long as the spell is maintained (usually by a magical object kept nearby). Gates can also be forced to disappear with magic, though this can take some time, especially if the gate had previously been reinforced.
- Gates do not appear inside or underground. The firmament must be directly above them, and a certain percentage of vectors leading from a point must contact the firmament without contacting any material for that point to be a valid gate location.
- If conditions change so that a gate is no longer in a valid position (someone builds a roof, for example), the gate will move into a valid position. This is predictable enough that it can be used to move gates to specific locations.
- Magic can prevent gates forming in certain locations (you don't want one directly above your stronghold, for example)
- Since gates teleport the thing they touch and everything whose weight is supported by it, this can lead to some problems. If someone walks up to a gate and touches it, they'll leave their shoes behind. A vehicle with wheels may appear without its axles or wheels. Since this is a setting with a lot of magitech, I planned on having flying ships as the main form of transport between worlds. Just let the prow touch the gate and the ship+cargo is transported as one.

I envision large empires made of connected realms using magic to prevent the formation of new gates across most of their territory and stabilize existing gates, with a few realms on the "edge" acting as the frontier. Some isolationist empires might only allow a single gate into or out of their territory.

What are some of the things you envision happening in a universe like this? Potential challenges?

Just a reminder that teleportation needs to be handled carefully because it's super exploitable. For instance in mid-to large sized realms you should be able to teleport metal rods hundreds of miles above a city (which unless the atmospheres operate via magic and the whole dome is always filled) then let them accelerate through empty space with the result of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment][well...]].\\
Of course you might choose to simply make this sort of kinetic bombardment attack difficult but not impossible and incorporate it into your setting, allowing you to incorporate elements of MAD if you wanted. These sorts of attacks might mean that all extremely valuable targets are kept either hidden or in realms that don't extend high enough to pull off these attacks.\\
Also if you controlled your gates/territory extremely closely then you might be able to stop this sort of attack depending on what you need to pull one off.

Of course if you can open two way portals (within a realm) there are way more exploits, but just using teleportation the biggest issues are pulling massive energy out of it, usually through gravitational kinetic energy.

Also it strikes me that kingdoms are likely to try to majorly influence the climate through the use of gates. For instance a desert realm opening a gate to another one in a ocean realm partially immersed in water (or fully depending on how much water blocks the gate vectors). This would allow them to have one of their gates in be a river (and very difficult to leave through which may even be intentional) so the ships going wouldn't really need to fly either.\\
Similar strategies could also be implemented for affected the temperature (also using submerged gates since water has so much heat capacity), humidity or expanding/creating or shrinking/removing bodies of water.

It strikes me that the main source of mechanical/electric energy is also likely to be gates which open to bodies of water at a higher elevation to drive massive turbines. Hell if they don't need to open to some "equivalent" position in the other realm then you could set up a loop of gates through which molten metal or something similarly dense flows/fall constantly, in order to extract massive amounts of kinetic energy.

Given you didn't say that gates need to be the ground I imagine empires are also going to need to ward all the sky/space up to the firmament above their cities to protect themselves from a gate based type of kinetic bombardment attack.

By setting up the right arrangement of gates above the atmosphere it should be possible to make structures that are continuously falling in order to experience zero G's.\\
Also those object would build speed indefinitely this way which potentially allows for gate based kinetic attacks to cause arbitrary amounts of devastation. Also you could probably make great use of the time dilation in a continuously falling structure that had reached near lightspeed (which would need to be well shielded against radiation).\\
Yeah the whole continuously accelerating gate loop idea is so ripe for potential abuse as well as insane potential. Of course you might well need multiple cooperating governments to manage it which might eliminate the chance of rogue agents using it but would certainly introduce some MAD politics, (after all can you shield every part of every realm in your empire?). Not to mention the devastation could be so bad that you could destroy a realm that wasn't totally shielded just so the explosion would travel through gates there into your enemies realm.

**** I hadn't thought of kinetic bombardment, but since the people being attacked will generally have magic, too, it shouldn't be too hard to solve it in a way that doesn't break the setting.

I'd rather not give players WMDs without making them really work for it.

Maybe wards that detect and redirect large falling objects have become standard practice, or maybe the are shunted into a pocket universe.

As to the whole gate/weather thing, there is a problem with all of that. Gates are tiny things that only teleport an object that touches them. Even assuming non-solid objects are affected, it would only act as a pinprick sized portal. This poses a problem for most things involving liquids or gasses.

Given that this is a high magic setting, people will likely struggle more with harnessing/directing power than generating it, but some of these perpetual motion type generators are interesting enough that I may have some empires that use them.

Actually, another problem with the gate/generator ideas is that people can't arbitrarily create gates between two realms. I may also set a rule that two realms can't be connected by more than one pair of gates at a time. I imagine with the gates randomly appearing and nearly infinite realms to connect, there may never be more than one known route between any two realms. So any generator technique that blocks a gate to other traffic may be infeasible.

It's not really clear why that would be the case. Like gasses and liquids are made up of many individual particles so unless there's a limit on that it's unclear why they wouldn't pass through. Though since the particles aren't all supporting each other you might have the water appear spread out as a continous blast of mist. Also if only solids are affected you could still set up the portal so that a glacier passes through it or all the ice that fell off the edge of the glacier was funneled into it.\\
As for them being tiny you mentioned flying ships being the main transportation so they really don't seem that small. If it can fit a flying ship then you could have a pretty massive pipe connected to a river blasting water at it.

In regards to stuff involving gates: Even if you only get one gate between two realms you could still create a loop of gates between three or more realms. Of course these plans may require a lot of logistical work but that's probably a good thing since it limits gate based WMD's to major powers. Though if there's practically unlimited uninhabited realms maybe you could set things up there.\\
Importantly it strikes me that the best strategy may be just setting things up so that light passing through the gates gains some gravitational energy with each circuit. So using these portals you would effectively be able to create gamma ray bursts of intense energy then when the circuit is broken it could be set up so the gamma ray burst went through a gate.\\
Even besides being a weapon I imagine people might use this to try to break the firmaments and other similarly insane things provided they were separated by a chain of enough gates that the explosion won't reach them. Of course if somebody left the gate accelerator on too long then it would create a kugelblitz which would be /really/ bad.

As for protecting against kinetic bombardment that seems like it would be rather hard. In that nudging something with that much inertia isn't going to make it not hit your city (plus you need to extend the wards up into space to really affect things too much). Of course when governments are involved there's also the issue that they would likely put their own wards onto the projectile, which only need to last for seconds at most once they get remotely close to the target. As for opening dimensional pockets, that doesn't seem like it would work, after all unless you allow pockets of unlimited size the projectile still hits the inside of it, either collapsing it and releasing all that energy. Or creating another even better type of WMD by using dimensional pockets to catch massive amounts of energy from kinetic strikes and then release it all when you next open it.

****** They aren't really portals, they're points in space where any object that contacts it is teleported. More like a tiny teleportation circle in DnD or something like that. I set it up that way specifically to prevent weirdness with liquids/gasses, so I think I'll just say that liquids and gasses don't count as "objects" as far as gates are concerned, but if a container containing them is moved through a gate, they'll go along with it.

I might also say that teleportation requires more energy when traveling to a higher altitude in order to make kinetic strikes less viable. I /really/ don't want the players to have easy WMDs.

And as for loops of realms, I don't think I was clear enough. People don't have any way to influence where new gates lead, and there are a tremendous number of realms. The best you can do is set up wards to increase the rate that gates form and hope for the best.

A single loop of gates small enough to fit in a single empire would take decades of waiting and extreme luck. And they would't have much say over which worlds were connected in a loop.

A loop of three realms would be seen by the inhabitants as proof of divine intervention.

Another idea for preventing bombardment: disintigration beam aimed at the projectile. Hit it high enough, and it won't gain enough kinetic energy for the particulate matter to be a problem. Even if it is moving quickly, air resistance is a much bigger deal for small matter, and wind magic may be used to counter it/spread the effect over a much larger area. Or maybe portals to redirect it into the sky before disintegration. Or maybe a cylindrical gravity nullification/reversal effect.

Now, that I think about it, it shouldn't be a problem. If the players try anything funny with kinetic energy I'll just pull out one of these and surprise them.

Yeah I mean I got that it's just that gasses and liquids are made up of lots of little objects ie molecules, there's no fundamental difference between sand (which would presumably be teleported but perhaps be spread out around the exit area) and water except scale. So presumably the gate must set some limit on how small objects can be before it doesn't notice them.

#+end_quote

Yeah for conservation of energies sake the most consistent solution to this problem ought to be to require that they put in as much magic as would be needed to telekinetically move an object so as to add that much gravitational kinetic energy.\\
Of course it needn't be exactly as much energy as would be used for telekinesis because you might say that there is a lot less inefficiency and thus wasted magic. However it ought to be cost as much or more than whatever the /theoretical/ minimum mana cost would be for telekinesis.

With that said of course this wouldn't really affect governments because they can certainly afford to attach each rod to massive hydrogen balloons (getting them as high as possible to reduce the cost slightly) and then just muster enough mages to afford the cost of teleporting the massive +tungsten+ lead encased in steel rod. Of course if the magic can be used to add energy in this sort of straightforward way I can actually think of more destructive WMD's than kinetic bombardment.

For instance why not just add the energy in the form of kinetic energy directly instead of as potential energy? Or instead of adding large scale kinetic energy add it in the form of small scale kinetic energy ie heat, in which case you now have a spell that sets off a bomb at the target location if it's not warded. Of course allowing either of those means mages should easily be able to use gun spells since the kinetic energy requirements would make them way more efficient than something as terribly wasteful as a fireball. However magic focusing on applications which use the least energy is sort of an inevitable consequence of most self consistent magic systems that don't find excuses to avoid it.

Actually now that I think about it kinetic bombardment is probably going to be a thing regardless of teleportation because you have magical flying ships, which presumably don't need to exert an equal and opposite force on the air beneath them. So you could use specially designed airtight ships as "bombers" with less explosive but far deadlier payloads than the real deal.\\
Of course the enemy could try to protect the area above their cities and bases with their own magitech craft, but given tech levels, speed and the amount of space above most cities to protect, there would be a definite advantage on the offensive side in space combat.

In regards to gate loops I suppose they may not be common enough to be too big of a deal. However given you said there are supposed to be nearly endless uninhabited realms, large enough empires seem like they could probably find a loop with a long and dedicated enough program of searching (with dedicated gate wizard explorers to ensure they don't lose their path home). Part of why it seems inevitable is that importantly any size loop will work provided you can get control of all the involved gates and move them, which shouldn't be an issue if most worlds are uninhabited (or if any inhabitants aren't on equal footing with the empire). Still this sort of thing is most definitely in the domain of large governments research projects.\\
It has also occurred to me that black holes are actually not an issue since event horizons can't propagate through the gates. So all that creating a black hole means is that nobody who uses gates connected to one of those worlds is coming back.

See the thing is that defending against kinetic bombardment is in many ways comparable to defending against ICBMs, it's /way/ harder than you would expect. For one hitting it is damned near impossible because of the sheer speed and the fact it would probably be enchanted to slightly move around side to side at random similar to what ICBMs do, also good luck even detecting a projectile moving that quickly from so far away. In another sense these rods would actually be harder to beat than ICBMs because they are massive steel rods (perhaps cored with lead for mass or even made entirely of tungsten or uranium if materials allow), the destructive energy required to actually vaporize them would be utterly insane and require introducing these beams as staggeringly powerful weapons in their own right.\\
As for snatching it with portals, that is going to have the same issues as shooting it due to difficulties in predicting its exact path. Of course with sufficiently massive portals that can be created in a split second you can probably beat that but that becomes a massive addition to the setting in its own right. Plus one would also have to consider the ways automatically activated enchantments on the rod will be designed to counter this and other safeguards. Also since portals exist it becomes vastly cheaper or at least easier to use massive numbers of rods dumped from portals so unless the catching portal can cover the whole city you're screwed.\\
In regards to gravity safeguards those are flawed because the rod would just adjust its path to avoid them like with beams. Except with the added downside that you need to keep the rod in the antigrav field for a while to do much to diminish the inertia it built up in space. So the only way either type of field works is if you blanket a truly staggering amount of space (hundreds of cubic miles likely) with it in which case you might as well just cover that area with anti-teleportation wards. Also like most other countermeasure magics you could easily apply gravity magic to the rods themselves to massively increase their destructive yield.

Anyway if you want to keep WMDs away from players probably just make things prohibitively expensive in cost and or magic, doing nerfing the ability to extract free gravitational potential energy from teleport probably does that. With the additional bonus that you haven't /only/ kept your players from obliterating extremely well defended city. After all do you really want to make it so that any powerful wizard can nuke anywhere that isn't incredibly warded? Of course undefended areas could still probably by nuked by using "bombers" like I mentioned earlier so that particular point is probably moot. Spaceboats on the other hand can probably be much more easily countered by well defended areas provided they have better divination than the players anti-divination wards, so they'll never get above a city before being taken out by any of the superweapons I've mentioned.

Proposal: stupendously large supertankers that aren't really designed for travel, just to survive gate transit, support vast amount of water and rapidly load/unload it.

Depending on how predictable gate behaviour is, you could possibly even automate this, with "landing cradles" on the dry side that automatically empty the vessel and roll it back to touch the gate when it is empty (and vice versa on the wet side). The automated solution could perhaps use smaller vessels but transit more rapidly, and many more in parallell.

****** Something like that would probably be used for transporting supplies between realms. I think magic will be common and powerful enough in this setting that "free energy" devices won't be that much of a game changer. (Mostly so that the players don't get caught up in perpetual motion shenanigans.)

Either that or I could say that the power requirement of the devices that keep gates active is rather high, and increases when matter is moved through to account for any changes in potential energy. I'll probably have to go with the "free energy is common" thing if I want to stop players from turning themselves into a power company, though.

I may have to set an upper limit to the size of objects that gates transport to prevent anything too ridiculous. Like a glacier larger than a small realm suddenly being transported into it. Might make the limit inconsistent among gates so people are forced to err on the side of caution.

*** One of the biggest challenges is going to be maintaining the infrastructure that allows an empire to persist. Not only will occurrences similar to the fall of the Roman Empire be more common, but they will in some respects be impossible to recover from (Earth geography is constant, but gateverse geography is not, so if you lose the gate to the fabled world of the Really Useful Stuff, it's probably gone forever).

I've got an idea kicking around for an unstable world where the paths between A and B change over time (meaning that neighboring countries will likewise change) and the only way to keep things nailed down is to connect them with an iron road.

Something more unique to the gateverse would be the practice of constructing immense fortresses in front of or around any important gate. I imagine that it would be very difficult to invade any properly-organized empire, since you can not only set up an indefinite number of walls and other defenses in front of it but reinforce the location from behind the gate. Normally, a fortress under siege is on its own, but a gatefort that is under siege effectively has an entire country within its walls.

**** Tying into the empire collapse thing, I was planning on having one nation that began when a city-realm in an empire intentionally collapsed the only gate to the rest of the empire in order to escape some kind of calamity. The city then began reinforcing gates into uninhabited realms and colonizing them, spreading into a new empire.

This might even be how most independent nations form; a kind of civilization mitosis.

As for the fortresses, I agree. War between civilizations will be difficult and probably usually end with one side collapsing a gate and separating from the others.

But with a high-magic setting, even the best fortress might not be impervious if the players are smart about it.

*** Hmmm. No closed loops - or no loops at /all/?

If there are no loops permitted at all, then if you and I are in realm A, and I have access to the gate that leads to realm B, then there is /no route/ that you can use to get to realm B except by going via my gate. I can magically reinforce my gate, and put loads of troops and wizards into defending it, and tax any trade that goes through the Gate to my hearts' content.

...wait, come to think of it, there is a way around this. If you can slip from realm A to realm C through a different Gate, and then close the gate between realms A and C, then realm C will be temporarily entirely disconnected from the Realms. It will, of course, immediately reconnect to a random Realm... and if you're lucky, you might be able to get from that random realm to B without going through my heavily taxed Gate.

...this leads to an idea for an NPC. A smuggler, who has his own private mini-realm (one of the really small ones). He buys a bunch of cheap stuff, stuffs it in his mini-realm, then goes in there himself and shuts down the Gate. He then finds himself able to get to a different, randomly chosen Realm, with access to a bunch of stuff that was cheap where he came from and on which he has paid no import duties, and presumably access to a whole new market... so a kind of inter-realm smuggler. (A very useful character for an RPG, because he can easily have just about anything in his private mini-realm, tends to randomly turn up anywhere, and is quite willing to sell it to anyone if the price is right. Pay him a bit more, and you can buy the "no questions asked" special as well; in case of danger, he retreats to his mini-realm and closes the Gate behind him.)
