*** You're not missing anything. It's a sad, wistful end. They created something that could have been beautiful, and let their own greed destroy it--except that it went out on its own terms, and none of them know what those terms were.

My theory is that Jen and Avatara are out there quietly orchestrating things behind the scenes. Very cool story, though I don't think the author quite knows how quote inserts work.

Magazine-style artistic pull quotes don't play well on mobile screen sizes, where there's no room for them to be airily outside the flow of the main content column. :(

***** Sure, but even still, you never put a pull quote directly adjacent to the line it was pulled from. Which happens four or five times in that story.

******* I read it on mobile so the pull quotes were awful.

Even if they were more to the side I believe there are far too many, magazines I can think of have 1 pull quote per column per page at most. So maybe a few hundred words per pull quote, while this story seems under a hundred for each.

Good story idea, poor style and execution in my opinion.
