[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy]] by Aetherial, is a story that is currently ongoing on Royal Road.

I recently started reading it and after catching up and following it for a while, I think it is a perfect fit for this sub.

As I said in the title, the series is a rational take on a whole suite of different genres and themes.

It creates a rational form of cultivation through a Sci-fi implementation of nanomachines, given cultivation themes intentionally by the creator.

It portrays a rational version of the apocalypse, caused by human greed, selfishness, and lack of communication.

It portrays a rational depiction of virtual reality, something that impresses me even more than the others in some cases as the genre is rife with wish fulfilment and power fantasy, by making the virtual world every bit as important as the real world, but without diminishing the importance of the real world at all.

Finally, it depicts a rational take on Artificial Intelligence, as something almost entirely alien and undefinable by the human mind, and how the existence of such a being would change the world as we know it.

I think anyone looking for a rational take on any of these genres should give Nanocultivation a shot. It also has some great characters that are incredibly unique (especially the MC), and worldbuilding that is incredibly interesting without taking up half the story.


** I read this a while ago before I gave up following it; I don't think this story is rational especially the vr aspects it had a lot of tired tropes: the most glaring was supposedly people have been using the VR world for years yet no one thought to try and teach the NPCs skills, then the MC who is such a great person decides to treat the NPCs as people and gets massively rewarded.

*** I don't know what you are talking about, plenty of people treat insiders as normal people, Lily is not unique in that, and if you are talking about the people from the academy village, then they /aren't/ NPC's they are outsiders who have been oppressed and lied to, that MC and friends are trying to help.

Also why can't a trope be rational when executed according to the rules of the world and in line with the goals of the characters involved? That is a core part of PGTE.

**** its been a while but i thought it was explicitly stated the higherups in the VR academy were explicty listed as NPCs and their was generalized distrust of outsiders, yet the MC is respectful to her teacher and then it comes out her teacher is a super powerful special teacher who came back because of "reasons"?

also lots of the story the MC seems to be extermely reactionary; she is chased by people in the scrapyard; is chased by people in the shelter; is chased by people outside of shelter; is hunted by perople in the sancatury; enters the VR, and almost immeditaly just agrees to assault a high level enclave despite adkweondlging that people who get caught doing this are tortured for infinity and thus "torture banned" all well the MC is stil gaining SIGNFICANNT skills almost every week; and the entire justifaction for why theirs a time crunch is 1 of her accuqantices was "allocated/kidnapped/aquried" by a guild; yet shes fine with leaving all the other people she knew from that time period to be on the border of starving and scavenging in a toxic wasteland and dieing from exposure every couple of years; it just seemed absurd

***** She got a powerful teacher because +"reasons"+ she did well on the trials, and Guardian (his subsets) like (to make use of) people with Tao systems.

The reactionary part is true, though for me it's one of the very few cases where I didn't find that annoying.

**** sorry i might have some details wrong but if the people in the village near the academy arent NPC's then that even strengthens the argument since the MC comes in with like no kwoldeghe of the system and "just so" happens to have tons of fortuitous events compared to someone who saved for multiple years and long term planned for the situation yet ended up like that.

***** FTFY: +saved for multiple years and long-term planned+ was in debt pretty much their whole life working on minimum wage paycheck to paycheck

Yes, the MC did help one such poor person. Happens in real life all the time - charities, individuals, etc. do help poor people that nobody else had helped before. Small-scale charity is easy. It would be irrational if she easily fixed the whole town when nobody had done it before.

They are trying to scale up in recent chapters, and I'm sure the associated complications are coming, too.

*** Sadly there is no Royal Road app at all, if you want to read an RR story offline, your best bet is using the browser add-on 'WeptoEpub' which when used on the contents page of a fiction, downloads it as an EPUB file. I use it a lot.

***** I've heard there's an extension for Calibre that can rip the entire web serial into a decently-formatted eBook.

Getting that set up is in my to do list, but there are so many other books to read I just haven't bothered with web serials yet.

This one sounds intriguing, though...

** I haven't read it all, but I had to stop because I just wasn't interested in the virtual reality aspect of it. The story is supposed to intertwine the plot of the real and virtual reality, but it seemed too far separated for my taste. It may get better later on but I had read a decent amount and decided to give up.

*** Virtual Reality is always divisive, I personally haven't found another besides this one that does it for me.

The VR aspect in this story is fine with me cause I find it believable in a way others aren't, the fact that it is being controlled and run by what is basically a god like entity, it makes sense that it is so realistic and that there are actual, sentient, natives.

It all comes down to the fact that the VR element is actually tide into the themes, the Idea of Paradox and what makes something real or fake, if you didn't manage to get to the academy part of the VR section, then I Highly Recommend giving it another go, the characters introduced are important both Inside and Outside, and are just as good as any of the 'real' ones.

**** I believe I got to the start of the academy arc, so it introduced her roommate and the roommate's mission. To me, the author created this unique cultivation with nanotechnology which I was interested in with a cool post apocalyptic setting. The virtual reality just seemed too removed for me and the fantasy like abilities gained in the virtual world didn't translate into the reality that I cared about so it seemed a bit pointless to me.

***** Some of the abilities gained their do transfer over, the ones her system is capable of replicating, though you are right that magic and some of the less natural ones don't.

I do believe that the, Inside is just as interesting as the outside though. Maybe I have a soft spot for LitRPG, but the idea of an alternate dimension (which Inside basically is) that influences the world in a social and economic manner, without taking away from it, is very interesting to me.

I agree that the Outside is more Original in setting and execution, but I don't think it would be that way without the Inside portion of the story.

The cultivation of outside doesn't go away while inside. By the end of book 1, the author has managed to tie the progression of both together very well.

To each their own though, as I said VR is divisive, I personally avoid it like the plague in most cases, so I don't blame you.

*** It's a common trope to some Chinese webnovels that has been copied a lot recently in America web serials. It combines the character leveling and skill gain plot devices with Chinese mythology and Taoism. Sort of similar to dbz in some ways with their power ups.

General idea is that you breath in spiritual power and circulate it through a special vein structure specific to this power before storing it in an organ called the "dantian".

Overtime you learn to use, grow, and condense this power and it changes you from a normal mortal to an all powerful immortal capable destroying mountains with a single punch and summon blasts of lightning to strike your enemies.

Basically every main character is the Chinese version of the magic swordsman trope but with more historical and mythological context and less technology.

**** And I suppose that in this situation you get cultivation-based powers from the virtual reality. Or the nanotech. Hmm. Got that, will check it out later, the core concept seems a little interesting. And I wonder what other culture-specific SF/fantasy ideas there are about.
