****** Probably nominally (or aspirationally) monthly rather than /actually/ monthly. The chapter prior to this one was June 29th, and the one before that was December 1st of last year. There's not enough to develop a trendline at this point, and I'm not quite ready to call this fic back on a proper schedule yet.

** I assume this was semiauto, and haven't read the chapter yet, but I assume this was intended to be "SD 21" in both the submission and chapter number as opposed to 212.

** There's a blatant continuity error in this latest chapter. Fiona had already read about Sirius and his lack of a trial back in ch.69.
