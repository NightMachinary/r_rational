** I'm working on editing a manuscript right now, and the question of how transparent to make the plot is one of the big things on my mind. Of course, having a community of people to read what you've written works better if you're writing serially and can make course corrections along the way - if you're writing a book that's going to be published and with no plans for a sequel, it's considerably less good, and if no one understands the plot when the book is over, you can't really make changes after the fact.

So you can't make the mystery too mysterious, or people won't get it and the climax will seem to come from nowhere, and you can't make it too obvious, or people will be bored when the mystery rips off its paper thin disguise and declares itself. I think the solution must be to have a large number of beta readers to give you feedback, but that offers its own problems.

*** What I always do is have two mysteries. The first mystery is meant to be solved. The second mystery can be guessed at, like knowing that the bad guy has something up his sleeve, but you don't know how it will actually pan out until the end of the story.

*** You don't have a team of editors? How are you going to publish this?

**** There are a number of steps towards getting a team of editors - a completed and relatively polished manuscript being one of the first ones.

***** Is the transparency of the plot something hard to change afterwards? I thought editing was a very long process from what I've heard, so you've got time.

****** It depends. If you have to change a step in the A>B>C causal chain that makes up the plot, then it's horrendously expensive to change. If you're lucky, it's just an extra paragraph somewhere. (In my case it's a little bit more complicated, because it's a time travel story, and the causal chain goes A>B>C>A and so on.)

#+begin_quote
  You cannot take the standardized Deep Wisdom of your surrounding culture and make your characters rehearse it. What leaps into your mind as a cached thought for Deep Wisdom, even if you think that Deep Wisdom unknown to the laity, is nonetheless the equivalent of writing vampires who hiss and drink blood instead of asking yourself what you would do as a vampire.

[[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]], do you by any chance know who Dio Brando is? I think you'd really like him, actually. In short: he started out an ambitious and sociopathic social climber, then unexpectedly found out an artifact could turn people into vampires, then /used it on himself to gain immortality/, then started /upgrading his own biology halfway to Elder Thing/ using his newfound vampire powers, and decided to /take over the world as an immortal vampiric god-king/.

[[#s][JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Phantom Blood]]

And he still manages to keep his ability to [[#s][Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Stardust Crusaders]] secret until the very end, making his defeat require something of a Deus Ex Machina, although even that was /somewhat/ rational in that [[#s][Stardust Crusaders]].

TL;DR: Vampires do not actually hiss, they go WRRRRRRYYYYYYYYY.
