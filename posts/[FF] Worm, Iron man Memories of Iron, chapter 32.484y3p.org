** I don't think this is rational fiction, though.

*** It was posted here a little while ago, as it fits the general interests of the group so I linked the update. I quite like the story and was glad I found it here. I tagged it ff as I don't know if it qualifies as rational but it certainly is fanfiction.

**** Meh, people on this sub are adults. We can make reminders/alerts for any stories we're interested in.

Obviously this is just a suggestion, as there aren't any strict rules for this, but I would suggest leaving "update" posts only for the stories that are distinctly rational and of high quality; which this fic doesn't necessarily meet.

Otherwise we're going swamped with stories that are just barely rational and more "look at this cool superpower!". Someone recommended /The Gamer/, for crying out loud!

**** If it isn't rational, but it's fanfiction, then maybe it should go to [[/r/fanfiction]] or [[/r/parahuman]] or, I don't know, [[/r/marvel]] or [[/r/ironman]] if that exists.

There have been repeated concerns over the possible dilution of this subreddit, which I think is entirely reasonable. If a work isn't rational or rationalist then it shouldn't be here.

I hope you can understand where we're coming from.

** I had a bit of trouble with chapter 6. It breaks the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Could you maybe adjust that chapter?

*** I'm not the author, I was posting an update given noone else had, and thought people might want to read it.

*** If you're serious about that being 'a trouble' in a Worm fanfic, you can always go onto the spacebattles thread and plead your case.

No comment on how well that will work, though.
