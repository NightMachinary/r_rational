** Things might get a bit slow on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], but I still come here for rational fiction and fanfiction, not to discuss politics, and /certainly/ not to discuss modern US military policy and American ethnocentrism or lack thereof. Looks like this would make for a lively discussion, but I will be downvoting it to reduce visibility.

I'm posting, rather than just silently downvoting, in hopes of directing this subreddit away from things like this and towards other things.

*** I see your point. Feel free to do that. I just asked because this is the largest rationalist community that I'm an active part of. I'll accept the off-topic downvote.

EDIT: While American ethnocentrism is what started the discussion, it ventured more into ethnocentrism as a whole, and how it colors our views of right and wrong. That's a topic that seems to be of interest to rationalists. At least based on what I'v seen here.

**** Perhaps I can point you toward this? [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/]] It deals with a similar subject matter, but it is also a rational short story and discussing fictional peoples might be more productive than discussing real countries.
