** Note: I had to learn about skolemization at the time and it was boring af so admittedly making it a weapon of the villain is kind of biased. I had also been putting off reading on (spoiler)the chapter's villain(/spoiler) since everyone was talking about them so I did it for this chapter. It's a nice contrast to the more "pure evil" villain from before.

** I am confused. Is this a first (or second, counting its prolog) chapter, or an 18th chapter?

*** It's a prequel to the previous chapters set in the past of the same setting.
