There are a lot of different magic systems around. Some of them don't even seem computable. Some of them hint at an underlying system that makes sense, and some of them outright explain how they work in detail.

Like in mistborn. There's a set of magical "elements", and you can use your knowledge of how the system works to guess what the unnamed elements do. As it turns out with a fair degree of accuracy.

Or there's [[http://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/1zna38/computable_magic/][this]] one I submitted to [[/r/magicbuilding]] which is based around continuous cellular automata.

So what other works have "good" sensible magic systems?


** I've always been a fan of the way the Young Wizards series did their magic. Magic in that system is a sort of a universal language (in that every part of the universe can speak and understand it, be that part living or nonliving). Magic has a cost, set limits, and is composed from smaller discrete elements. To cast a "spell", so to speak, you compose a sentence requesting or ordering the elements of the universe to do whatever it is you want it to do.

There was another story on here a while ago that dealt with a number of magic systems that worked in different ways, but all of them were well explained, with the chief plot point being a woman from a world with one magic system was put into a world with a different magic system and had to figure both of them out.

But the best one I can recommend for what you're asking is [[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], which has a magic system that is so well defined, structured, reproducible, and sensible that it has its own programming language and branch of physics, with associated academia. The story gets pretty wild, and especially in the later chapters I would call it more Hard Sci-fi than Fantasy, due to the way magic is treated, but it's well written, fairly long, nearly completed, and regularly updated.

** [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Pact]] has a possibly sentient system of tiny spirits tiling the planet and watching for uses of magics, giving power bonuses for theatrics like oaths, declarations, successfully preforming the same action three times in a row, and developing and holding to personal style. It seemw whacky at first, but it gets more and more logical as it is revealed.

*** It has a kind of consistency to it but is still incredibly vague about what you can actually do. Also my impression was that it was more of a universal karma thing rather than specific spirits 'watching' your actions. Can you cite a source for that?

Pretty great story anyway, would recommend to others. Very tense and there's always shit going down.

That (at least some of) the magic is enacted by the watching spirits is pretty much directly said in [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2014/01/04/bonds-1-5/][Bonds 1.5]] : "Here, I make a meager food offering, create a sign to indicate what I want, and draw from the reputation I maintain with local community spirits. A bonus of my position. The spirits play along, because they know it keeps people safer and helps to keep the community safe, and because they know I'll make a better offering later, a habit I've established."

And that they manage//are/ the karma system is suggested by the way they pause to address them in [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/damages-2-6/][Damages 2.6]] "Those who are witnessing us, beings of law, justice, and right, help guide this to the right hands.” (and some surrounding text, justifying their actions as in accordance with the spirit/letter of the law).

I think there are other references, but those are the ones I remember well enough to find.

***** Thanks, these are good references.. But! I don't think they actually demonstrate that the spirits ARE the karma system, just that they too observe it and work within it. To me these quotes don't differentiate between those two possibilities.

I tried to find some info on what is said in the awakening ritual but couldn't with a quick scan. However, in 6.2 Blake says ".. You're... I dunno, making yourself known, on a fundamental level. The ideas are more important than the words. It worked, so it probably wasn't wrong.”

I think ideas being more important than the words is probably correct, the ritual being almost one of self-affirmation rather than one of describing oneself aloud to something which is listening. In my view it's a personal, internal commitment, not an interview.

**** It's not vague at all, just complex from the sheer amount of study required. Pact, unlike most fantasy stories, actually succeeds in making the lifestyle of a powerful practitioner /take a lot of effort/.

I don't have a direct source for the sentience claim, but I am certain of it and if the story doesn't turn out that way by the end I'll eat something unpleasant.

***** To be clearer, I mostly meant that it's vague to the reader - we don't yet have enough information to be able to say "Blake has x items in his inventory and y knowledge, in z situation he could do a,b, and c to d,e, and f effects."

It does still seem a bit vague in-universe to me as well though. More like a system formed of guidelines than one formed of rules. For comparison, in Worm I felt I had a much clearer mental image of how events could play out. Characters have known abilities with known effects, and any combination you can imagine would produce the effect which you imagine.

****** It does mention (when they are preparing to face off with the history-stealing demon) that it could be more like art. Your statement sounds a lot like how Rose would want to view magic.

From Blake's interpretation, I see it more like putting on a play. You say your lines, and the audience reacts. With famous plays, and good actors, you can predict how the audience will feel. But with a newer play or a newer actor, the audience might go wild in approval, or sit there completely bored.

There are some 'rules' (still in the play analogy), like speak loudly, enunciate, big hand motions, etc. But when doing something you haven't done before, it's not easy to predict what the reaction will be.

** For purposes of fiction, the lawfulness of magic is simply the degree to which the reader can predict in advance what magic can and can't do. Saying that something is based around "nanotechnology" makes no difference to this, unless you reprise enough physics that readers know what molecular machinery can and can't do. Saying that it involved "calculus" would have the same problem, unless you reprised a lot of Thinking Physics and then stuck to it.

** Name of the Wind was good for this - the most common magic was "sympathy", involving binding things that share some commonality, then (shocker) actually needing to supply enough energy through that linkage to make the magic happen. Either from a convenient heat source or out of the mage's own body heat, and with greater similarity providing a /more efficient/ link.

Plays hell with entropy, but it at least respects conservation of energy.

Less so the other forms of magic in that universe - sygaldry lets you put magic into objects just by engraving them with the right symbols (although possibly still conserves energy - the master of the art talks about having been pursuing an 'ever-burning lamp' for a long time without success), and naming seems to be able to call on arbitrary elemental effects just by speaking their secret names, although that wasn't strictly under conscious control.

I feel like it hit a good spot between being well-defined enough to prevent it being a "Win everything by authorial fiat" device, while still leaving in a bit of mystery.

*** /Name of the Wind/ has (I believe) about seven or eight magic systems which run the gamut between "hard" and "soft", and thankfully Rothfuss is a thoughtful enough author that he knows how to make that distinction work between all of them. (Sympathy, Sygaldry, Alchemy, Naming, Fae Magic ... and there must be others that I'm forgetting which are even less well-defined, but those five are in hard-to-soft ordering.)

Anyone who read the Mistborn trilogy knows that as incredibly well done as its magic system is, from a storytelling perspective Sanderson still relies on a (kind of literal) Deus ex Machina to resolve the plot.

** [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/][Unsounded.]] <3 I think it's been posted here before. Really well-fleshed-out system, especially if you read the more in-depth explanations the author posts on her Tumblr. To oversimplify the hell out of it, it involves taking "aspects" of things in your environment and applying them to other things. It kind of reminds me of computer programming in that mages have to express what they want to happen with absolute precision.

** I am an aspiring Fantasy writer, and one of the things I hope I have accomplished is to make a magic system that is clear and makes sense. The hope is that by the time readers finish the first book (which is ~90% written) they will understand the magic system well enough that they are able to combine information gleamed from both PoV characters and draw conclusions the character do not draw themselves. Conclusions like "Hang on, this couldn't actually have happened, that guy is lying his /ass/ off!"

That said, while I intend to make most of my planned series Rationalist-ish, the first book only has rationalists in the shadow, and the main characters certainly do not qualify yet. So most of the first book probably doesn't belong here. /My villains are super awesome, though./

** Spellwright series, Blake Carlton. I haven't completely vetted it for rationality, but I absolutely love the "magic as text made physical" thing and all the wonderful wordplay involved. The author is also tremendously creative. The different languages of magic each have their different uses and limitations, a compelling and broad structure that Carlton successfully writes within.

** Pretty much everything by Sanderson (you already mentioned Mistborn) at least has consistent rules. In some cases (The Stormlight Archives, for example), we don't know the rules yet, but they're there, and we'll probably learn quite a lot about them before the series is over.

Sanderson's laws of magic have already been mentioned. And The Name of the Wind.

** For my money nothing beats the Inheritance Cycle, where magic is done by simply describing (in Elvish) what you want to accomplish. There's no limit on the diversity of what can be done, and the limit on the power is that the /energy/ (as defined in physics: force X distance) required to produce the desired effect by pushing matter around is drained from the caster in the form of physically fatiguing them. You could literally teach a brand-new student everything there is to know about how magic /works/ - including the top-secret stuff that only the elders /of the dragon riders/ are supposed to know - in an afternoon; everything else (read: years) is just practice and learning a long list of practical applications.
