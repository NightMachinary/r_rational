** I just finished reading, I got to say that I'm not used to seeing people actually settle things rationally when emotional stuff comes up, it almost never happens in fiction, even though maybe it would be much better if it did.

Also I'm more and more worried about the upcoming cruise, knowing what happened in the anime... or at least I was until I realized that Blue was not going, therefore removing an eventual dilemma about teleporting, although the other dilemma about the other people still stands and it actually gets asked in the story, pretty interesting.

I'm still worried a bit.

As long as it doesn't swing too far in the opposite direction and everyone's emotional stuff always gets resolved in one quick and easy conversation, I think it would often be better too :)

** Well, wasn't that a ominious ending?

This could easily be a turning point of the story, in which Blue undergoes some traumatic event that deeply changes him, like everybody dying horribly due to his mistakes or due to Team Rocket, sending him into a downwards spiral of hatred/vengeange that will make him become a Tyrant Champion that only Red can depose, at which point Red will have became the hero he wanted Blue to become, someone that can keep no secrets and still win anyway.

Nah, that will never happen. Right?

** I just want you to know that every time I see a new chapter of this story, it makes my entire day. Seriously, I actually spend all month waiting for the next update, only to repeat the process. Keep up the nice work my dude.

Assuming that Generation 8 (or however many more gens come about while you're writing this story) come out before you finish your story, will their Pokémon and regions and such exist in your story's universe? Will we ever get to see the group interact with Gen 6 and 7 Pokémon?

Now I'm wondering how other regions handle disasters. Kanto is tame compared to Hoenn or Alola I'd imagine, considering the former has deities that constantly battle to eternally drown/drought the world, and the latter has actual beserk and amoral deities running amok and doing whatever they please. Not to mention Ultra Beasts. Now I want to see Red interact with Ultra Beasts and see how he as a researcher would react.Have you considered writing an in-depth type of "History of the Pokéworld" based in your universe? You know, with history and how society and culture in different regions differ-stuff like that?

Anyway, sorry for typing so much. I just really love your story!

*** I'm glad you're enjoying it so much :) Some Gen 6 and 7 pokemon will show up, yeah, and when 8 comes out I'll probably mention stuff from it, like I did with Alola.

Hoenn's legendaries are more of a specific event thing, they're not normally just wandering around like the storm birds are, so thankfully they don't have to worry about them: in fact they're actually mythic pokemon who get "downgraded" to legendaries during the events of the game, in terms of how the people in the world view them.

****** That was the other thing I was thinking about, where maybe they did score super high on IQ tests, but it was because their brain was like a quantum computer that happened to be supremely well suited to IQ tests, or because they borrow processing power from people around them (though obviously a scientific study would keep the alakazam isolated from all but dark people with a control that used non-darks to see a difference), but they have like no personality of their own, or are lacking that sentient...idk what to call it. curiosity, self-awareness, creativity...i have trouble conceptualizing sapience...

*** I think it's best to ignore it because...IQ isn't generally a thing where, say, there's 200 questions and you get 150 right so your IQ is 150.

Instead it's based on standard deviations. So in order to reach 150 in the first place, you need a couple thousand people in your sample, because otherwise that score will only have a fraction of a person in it.

In order for there to exist a single person with an IQ of 1000, you'd need more people than there are atoms in the universe. For 5000...I can scarcely imagine.

I suppose that you could excuse it by saying that some people imagine Alakazams as having an IQ of 5000 because they are 50 times smarter than the average human (whatever /that/ means), but...if that's the case, than my hypothesis is that Alakazams are either aliens that descended on a still-primitive earth, created pokemon (and maybe humans), and parceled out all the incredible technology that we see in the Pokemon world to some unknowable alien end....

Or the world is just a simulation and the Alakazam are like Agents from the Matrix.

/edit:/ or maybe in the Pokemon world, average IQ is set to 10,000 instead of 100. That'd make it pretty funny actually. Though I would feel bad about enslaving a race of creatures with an average IQ of 50....

Secondly, I wanted to ask you some questions. You see, I'm GMing a ptu campaing and I intend to use your world, mainly because it is awesomelly well built, coherent and connected, and is able to give a sense of the dangers of living along such creatures. It is true that I will make some changes in the name of gameplay (capture rate, welcome back) and other just because we (the players and I) like it, such is giving some pokemon intelligence or adding mystic powers to some human blodlines.

Why I'm telling you all of this? Well, first because I would like to know what you think about it and if you have any suggestions, second... because I would like to ask you some things I've found out I would need to know.

*** Glad you're enjoying the story so much! I'm totally fine with anyone using the setting and whatnot for their own stuff, and don't really have any opinions on the changes: do whatever works for you and your players! My only recommendation for the mystic powers in human bloodlines is to try and make sure any you introduce have a weakness associated with it, the way psychics are more at risk from ghost/dark attacks and feel the pain of the pokemon they merge with, and the way dark people can't use teleportation and are somewhat distrusted by society.

As for Renegades, there are some groups that are against the death sentence for it, but not ones that have a lot of political clout: think of Renegades as how our world treats terrorists and you'll have some baseline for just how much they're reviled. The rest of it comes from a sense of deep /betrayal./ The world only works as one where mankind is trying to survive against the monsters all around them: to use those monsters against your fellow man marks them as the worst kind of villain, in a lot of the fiction of the world.

What might help is a better idea of the Renegade trial process, which goes something like this:

1) Someone is accused of being a Renegade. The accuser tells their story to a ranger or police officer, who puts out essentially a warrant for the accused's arrest.

2) If they fight or try to escape when charged, they're assumed guilty and often killed on the spot.

If they get away:

3) They're marked as a Renegade officially, and anyone who sees them can get a reward for killing or capturing them. Hunters are trainers specifically allowed to train their pokemon to attack humans, and may be employed by the League if needed.

If they submit:

3) A hearing is called with the original accusers and the accused. Four additional people need to witness against them along with the highest ranking Ranger available. A number of factors go into the process.

4a) If their pokemon directly attacked another human, they're tested to see if they have been trained to do so. If they have and they are not a registered Hunter, this is often considered strong proof, and they are quickly condemned. If the danger to humans was not due to a direct attack, this is skipped.

4b) A psychic is often called to weigh in as one of the witnesses, particularly if it does not appear pre-meditated. If they're Dark or there's reason to believe they might have trained to resist psychics, this is skipped.

4c) Ranger and witnesses ask any questions that might reveal that humans were not put at risk intentionally. The person's background is recited and taken into consideration too. If they have a criminal history, this is often a mark against them. If they have participated in any notable wild pokemon incidents, this is often a mark in favor of them.

5) There's a vote, which is often accompanied with official paperwork, but sometimes that part is done later based on potential hectic nature of circumstance.

6) If the decision is not unanimous, they are released but put on probation, their pokemon held by the nearest city until they go through some safety courses to ensure whatever incident led to people believing they were a Renegade is not repeated. If the paperwork is delayed and what was originally a unanimous vote is no longer unanimous, protocol differs based on region: in some a new hearing is called and the process is repeated with different judges and Ranger, in others the accused is released. The Indigo League does the the former.

7) If it is, they are branded and the nearest Leader is called in to execute them. This is done differently in different regions and is ultimately the Leader's decision. Most put them to sleep first through some thing like sleep powder or jigglypuff singing. An overdose of sleep powder can then be used, or lethal injection of some poison. In the past it was more common for them to be trampled or burned or electrocuted to death, but most modern cities frown upon such brutal tactics, unless the Renegade caused a significant amount of death and destruction.

8) If their pokemon directly attacked a human, they are given to Hunters to retrain or killed if they were particularly vicious or deadly. If not, they are given to next of kin as in a normal death.

9) If at any point in the future one of the accusers recants their testimony or a witness admits to being bribed or pressured, an investigation is launched and heavy jail time and reparations to the family imposed. This is excessively rare, happening no more than a handful of times a year worldwide, compared to the average of two or three Renegades accused per year in any given region.

Hope that's helpful!

**** Wow. I was expecting an answer, but this is awesome! The trial process will be very helpful when the time comes, thanks a lot.

I am still thinking about how to handle some pokémon been intelligent. Maybe there are just few like those, and choose to be alone. The interesting part will be the more... Godlike legendaries, as I'm not sure what you will do with them (the creación trio, the lake trio, the swords of justice...) and what their relationship with humans. I always envisioned the aqua and magma teams as the result of some old cult (kinda like the most radical belivers at petalburg)

I think that is all for now. I wish I were better at english so I could make deep reviews of the chapters. In any case, keep up the good work!

** Between Red potentially being "recruited" by Sabrina, who unless I'm massively misremembering is known to be part of the Mewtwo project, Red's power to (temporarily... so far) strip safety conditioning off of Pokemon, and Mewtwo's presumably massively scaled up psychic potential... Hmm. I'm starting to become very concerned that literally no one has asked how safe using this power is for humans yet. So far the closest we've gotten is Leaf insisting it would be dangerous for Pokemon, and Red seeming to be a little aware of (and trying to manage) the risks involved in what he's doing. But so far no one's red flagged this as potentially a potential society destroying mega problem yet if it becomes misused, presumably because (so far) it's completely temporary.

But those safety guards Red is lowering exist for a reason, and Red isn't the only one with psychic powers. I guess probabilistically you could assume he can't be the first one to come up with this idea, and the world hasn't ended yet so therefore its harmless, but that's really flimsy logic. No one's really gone through the process of ratifying any potential disasters before jumping straight into Red using it directly to improve the performance of his own starter. What if it weakens the conditioning over time? What if it strengthens a Pokemon's mind against currently used conditioning techniques, making it harder to train them? No one thought to, say, catch a couple dozen Rattata, let the Pokeballs automatically train them up, and then push their conditioned to the breaking point over the course of several months to see what the (honestly not even particularly) long term effects are?

If Red is the first one to think of this, and then he goes and tells a bunch of people (despite Aiko's insistence to the contrary, he hasn't been silent about it so far to anyone who just happens to ask), who tell a bunch of people, and other psychics hear about it? If that happens you better hope it really is that safe. Otherwise you'll have a bunch of trainers ignorant to the potential side effects, all using it on their Pokemon, which would be a disaster in and of itself even if it doesn't cause any other form of major (that is, permanent) disruption.

And back to Mewtwo. Why do I suspect this ends with Mewtwo learning about this and using his massive psychic ability to deliberately "de-safety" trainer's (non-Dark I suppose) Pokemon on a wide scale? Even just in, say, a building sized area over a temporary time, dialing up this ability to eleven could cause pretty massive problems.

And wow, if Red didn't have ethical concerns (and little motivation towards trainer battling), what's to stop him from sending out a "tanky" Pokemon, in hopes it won't die, and then deliberately dial up the "release instincts" dial on an opponent's Pokemon as high as it will go to make them look like they lost control, and therefore get them disqualified? Actually, is that even a thing? I imagine it would have to be. Do that to a Gym Leader and watch the political backlash roll in... Well, I guess one reason he can't do that is he's not that great at connecting to Pokemon he's never seen before as an offhand action yet.
