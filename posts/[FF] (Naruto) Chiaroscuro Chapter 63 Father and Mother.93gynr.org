***** Naruto fanfic from the perspective of rational Shikamaru. There are changes that happens as a result of the deviation from cannon but nothing extreme.

*** I assume it's related to the Akatsuki attack, where Shikamaru ran into Black Zetsu. Black Zetsu is the will of Kaguya (or something like that), and there have been hints that Shikaku's shadow-splitting technique is related to whatever created Black Zetsu.
