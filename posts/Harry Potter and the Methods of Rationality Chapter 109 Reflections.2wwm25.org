***** I'm sure it is, but that doesn't mean that EY didn't intend the word to be synonymous with "fiendfyre" here. Bale = evil, especially a force of destruction. It fits, and sounds a lot less silly than "fiendfyre phoenix."

** Isn't the obvious move here to steal the mirror itself? The puzzle can then be solved at leisure, and plus you get a super amazing magical artifact that survived Atlantis' fall.

Also, if Atlantis was erased from time, that implies Voldemort's horcruxes, even widely dispersed as they are, do not necessarily make him immortal. I wonder if he's done anything to deal with that threat area. I'd guess not, as if he understood secret time magic he'd presumably already have won.

**** The immunity to fiendfyre is irrelevant, because I'm not talking about destroying the mirror.

I don't think the description of the mirror as seemingly anchored to the spot within the room was meant to be interpreted literally. How would someone be able to see something like that with human eyes?

Even if the mirror is anchored, all else being equal it seems easier for Quirrell to defeat Dumbledore's anchoring wards than for Quirrell to trick the Atlantean security protocols. And the bonus is that he would get a unique magic artifact this way.

** I'm unhappy with a few things here.

If EY wanted the Atlanteans to have built an AI, that's the kind of thing that should have been probably foreshadowed. Instead, Quirrell just gives an info-dump a few minutes before the story's end. Boo.

Also, the joke about people not believing Harry was a real 11 year old was not funny. It seemed kind of snide and indignant, and broke my immersion. The "coherent extrapolated volition" script also broke immersion. Within the actual story, the joke/criticism doesn't even make sense, as Harry has just learned the roots of his personality are actually decades old, so Quirrell is blatantly wrong to think otherwise, and it should be obvious to him that this contradicts his beliefs. And then he goes further and mocks people who would believe it. What?

Love the title of the chapter. Like the idea of the confundus but I feel like the Atlanteans, if as cautious as claimed, would have recognized that if people are allowed to alter their own mental states to control the mirror then people are opened up to potential coercion or manipulation.

*** The criticisms you mentioned are the same ones that came to mind when I read the chapter. I agree, it got very expositiony and that joke came across as meanspirited. The wording also seemed pretty immature for Quirrell.

*** I'm not sure the joke about Harry not acting as a real 11 year old was meant to be mean-spirited. Anecdotal evidence, of course, but to me it just came across as poking fun at the readers. (And Quirrell really is cynical enough to be plausibly indignant about it. He'd be cynical about the sun rising in the east if he had an excuse for it.)

Unfortunately, you can't hear the author's tone of voice when reading a text, so playful humor and indignant ribs are sometimes difficult to tell apart. Worse, we're hearing it told in-character by an villainous uber-cynic who considers the rest of humanity to be depressingly idiotic. At that level of encryption, jokes sound like insults and vice versa.

Anyway, since a joke and barb look very similar in this context, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to be /too/ offended. (Rather, one must be *precisely* offended. Given prior probabilities of EY telling a joke vs not telling a joke, I estimate this to be roughly 20% of base levels of indignation. /s)

**** Also, when I read it I thought it was actually describing what readers would have had to think of Eliezer in order to believe that /he/ was so stupid as to think Harry acted like an eleven-year-old. In which case it's only a step away from self-deprecating.

***** I agree that that's what it sounded like, but it came across as more of a jab than as self-deprecation. "Ha, you idiots, did you think I was just stupid? I was actually not stupid; you're stupid for thinking I was stupid."

It's not so much that I feel personally insulted, as that I think it was a jarring momentary shift in tone and--like OP of this thread said--broke immersion. It puts a bad taste in my mouth to see the narrative wave around its own recent twist like that. Like if at the end of Sixth Sense the guy turned to the camera and said "Oh wow, I sure didn't see that coming! This changes everything in retrospect, but it all makes perfect sense! What kind of crazy God would come up with this one?"

I agree with you somewhat, but you should take into consideration that the fact the statement was ambiguous is evidence that Eliezer wasn't trying very hard to avoid sounding rude.

Unless you're thinking there's a distinction between "not wanting to use it at all" and "not wanting to use it /yourself/"? But I don't think that Dumbledore or Flamel would pass the former test.
