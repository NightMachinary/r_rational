Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** According to my rigorous statistical analysis based on the first 200 of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s top entries and caused by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8advus/rthfdcthe_last_sovereign_deconstructing_nsfw_game/dwyg86w/?context=3][this joke]], this subreddit consists of:

** I typically go several months between adding songs to my workout playlist, because a song has to meet high standards of awesomeness in order to qualify for being added to that sacred playlist.

I don't want to have to fast-forward past a long build-up at the beginning (lookin' at /you/, dubstep), I don't want a plodding lull in the middle, I don't want to ever have to skip a track, I want to be able to just hit "shuffle" and then have a consistent stream of bass thumping in my ear-holes without having to touch the iPod again until I leave the gym (a not insignificant number of people don't wipe down the machines after they touch all over everything with their sweaty hands (/yes I know machines are inferior to free-weights because you're not working your small stabilizing muscles when you're locked into a fixed movement pattern/ but real gyms are expensive and Planet Fitness is only ten bucks a month), so I consider my own hands to be thoroughly contaminated until I've washed them in the bathroom after I finish the workout, and I don't want to touch my iPod with contaminated hands).

Anywho.

I recently found The Best Song. It's an electro-house / dubstep fusion (electro-step?) with a chiptune aesthetic.

Artist: MegaNeko. Song Title: Robot Language.

It's almost perfect. My favorite part is definitely the little transition that happens at 1:23.

I'm currently in speed training, which involves sprints on Monday and Thursday, and fast 5 & 10 km on Tuesday and Sunday. Cross training is every weekday, and that's the usual gym workouts (the specifics of mine matter less than going out and developing the habit). It's a slog.

*** Well, Ray Kurzweil thinks that we're going to be injecting nanobots into our bloodstreams to augment/replace our immune systems by the year 2030, and he's had an 86% accuracy rate for about 150 predictions over the past three decades, so I'd assume that's a thing that's /definitely/ going to happen at some point even if he's overly optimistic about the time frame. Even if it takes until 2040, that's only 22 years. Beyond that, who knows what an artificial immune system made of nanobots could do? It'd certainly end death due to infectious disease and cancer and heart disease. Maybe another 20 years out from there, people stop aging completely and we've achieved functional immortality and no longer die from biological causes. Who the hell knows? For all we know, the average lifespan by the year 2070 could be 250 years and the "maximum" lifespan could be pretty much arbitrary and determined mostly by a person's propensity for risky/reckless behavior.

EDIT:

My dad's dad had two heart attacks (one of which required, like, quadruple bypass surgery) and a stroke, and died of colon cancer about 10 years later in his late 70s. My mom's mom has had a heart attack, and my mom's mom's sister died of colon cancer in her early 60s. Haven't spoken to my dad in about 7 years, but I assume he's still on blood pressure medication, and he had an angina attack at some point in the early 2000s. I've got the genes. I figure I need to make it to at least the year 2055, and I'll be 66 then. But it might not be until 2070, and I'll be 81, and that's a harder target to hit. So, I started lifting weights about 3 years ago. I figure anyone who's serious about all this futurism crap should probably be exercising on a regular basis and watching their intake of sodium, because heart disease is the number one cause of death right now in the developed world.

***** Cardio is great for your heart, but there are studies suggesting that weight lifting improves brain functioning, that it can actually stave off age-related cognitive impairment and slow the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's. We don't really know what causes normal Alzheimer's and don't know if it's hereditary, but we've found genetic markers that correlate with "early-onset" Alzheimer's and it looks hereditary, and my dad's mom died of early-onset Alzheimer's in her early 50s. I figure I, specifically, should be taking that into consideration, but I feel like most people who plan on living a long time should really consider lifting weights to preserve their brain into old age. I personally lift weights 4 days a week (upper body / lower body split, chest/back/shoulders/arms and quads/hamstrings/glutes/calves) and then do cardio twice a week (stationary bike, better for your knees in the long run than running).

******* From what I've read, benefits are seen from doing at least a full body workout at least twice a week. If you do three sets of pushups, three sets of squats, and three sets of pullups, you've basically hit every major muscle group in your body.

Also, if you're doing those exercises to work your muscles and not to get your heart pumping, you should do each rep relatively slowly so that gravity and momentum aren't doing the work for you. Some people do like 50 half-pushups at mach speed and once a trainer forces them to do them correctly, get surprised that they can't do anywhere close to as many. Gotta slow it down and /feel/ it.

******** Yep, I do a mix of the two speeds. The first set of sit-ups, push-ups, and burpees is usually done fairly quick just to get my heart going, the second set is done a lot slower, and the third set is at a medium speed. I'm usually a little impatient with the last set and I just want to get it done and out of the door to go running.

Probably not what I should do, but it's what I'm most comfortable doing in getting warmed up for running.

I keep wanting to have a separate set of exercises that's not just running, but I have trouble motivating myself into doing any exercise that's not running. So I compensate by having a somewhat lengthy warm-up routine to sort of trick myself into doing some additional exercise that isn't running.

Thanks for the tips!

Edit: I should also share that one of the main reasons why I got into running other than being so gosh darn quick as a kid was because heart disease and diabetes is really common in my family. Nearly everyone on my mom's side of the family has had a heart attack at least once in their 50s (no deaths from it at all at that age though). Only my mom's the exception so far, but she has another 6 months left to make it to her 60s!

Great idea about the fan. I do listen to a lot of white noise on my headphones, but I'm starting to get worried about my hearing from so much headphone use. So I figured I'd give something made for just noise cancellation (3M X4A) a try instead of an over-the-ear headphone.

*** I'm going to second a white noise machine. Before my roommate lost weight and stopped snoring, I piped white noise through my PA speaker every night and wore earplugs, which in tandem significantly increased my ability to fall and stay asleep.

For the rest of the time, I'm just constantly listening to music anyways, which allows me to drown out most background noise even at lowish volumes because I'll focus either on the music or what I'm doing and ignore everything else.

No clue. They'll probably help, of course, but won't be a cure all. Though to clarify-- have you been using ear/buds/ or ear/plugs/? If it's earbuds (sound generating) I'd suggest trying earplugs and an external white noise generator (even laptop speakers could work, for example). It may or may not work, but earplugs are dirt cheap and it's useful to have some around anyways.

** So I browsed through [[/r/theworldisflat][r/theworldisflat]] for curiosity's sake. See if there were any ok points raised about there being a flat Earth, or much more likely just to laugh at people being dumb. And it surprised me, their arguments were much better than I expected, which is to say that they were abysmal and failed at even basic experimental design or consistency, but they did actually perform a few experiments. Also, their videos are too fucking long for the amount of entertainment they bring.

One video in particular was about how you could have sunlight on the bottom of clouds in a flat Earth model. The video surprised me because it demonstrated that the mechanics of it aren't impossible. The person set up a flat piece of plastic parallel to the table, a light source taller than said plastic, and the camera pointed at the bottom of the plastic. Moving the light source back made it eventually light up the bottom of the plastic. What the person failed to account for is that he performed the experiment on a white plastic table, and that the actual ground wouldn't reflect the light. Just so dumb and funny that these people take themselves seriously.

Also, one of their top posts is about how a flat and divinely made earth would be better than the actual model. Not why it was an accurate model, just why it would be a better place to live in. Yes, so convincing. That's also why I have a banking app that always displays my account balance as $100000000 instead of what it currently is, because I prefer to believe the higher number.

I know this is the intellectual equivalent of beating up the handicapped kid, but the people who believe this stuff are nominally adults.

Also, the answers just aren't very creative, and I would expect that more from people with disfunctional reasoning over people intentionally using bad reasoning. Why would you come up with boring answers? Take the question of gravity, for instance. The somewhat novel answer for why things fall down on a flat Earth is that the entire world is accelerating upwards at 1g. You could experimentally show that to be false, because actual gravity gets weaker the higher up you are, but it would be rather expensive to disprove. The answer they ACTUALLY give? Things don't fall, they sink because they are more dense than the air. And they sink downwards instead of sideways because that's the direction things fall. Not even barely defensible the way that you would expect from intelligent people espousing intentionally false beliefs would be.

There are lots more examples of arguments that are much more likely to come from a diseased mind than a mind in it for the laughs. Arguments that simply wouldn't occur to a normal person. The above is just the tip of the iceberg.

** I probably should save this question for the Wednesday World building thread, but I'm too impatient to wait.

I'm working on this time travel story where the protagonist has the power to induce Stable Time Loops which means she believes that time is immutable in the sense of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rrW7yf42vQYDf8AcH/timeless-physics][Timeless Physics]]. The antagonist is someone with a different time travel power, but unlike hers he can change the past and thus sees time as mutable in a Branching History Model.

The [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/moral-conflicts][Good vs Good Conflict]] practically writes itself where the protagonist is horrified at the antagonist seemingly murdering trillions every time he changes the past and the antagonist thinks the protagonist could destroy the world if she abuses the Stable Time Loops to create an [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes][Outcome Pump]].

The part I'm ashamed to need help with...is the ending. I wanted to come up with a model of time travel that could permit both mutable and immutable types of travel and I've been having trouble coming up with explanations for how both can occur. Clearly a conflict can't be written if I can't explain how it's possible to have both versions of time travel in the same world.

The best ideas I have are related to how we can have both the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9cgBF6BQ2TRB3Hy4E/and-the-winner-is-many-worlds][Many Worlds Interpretation]] and Timeless Physics at the same time, but I don't have a good enough physics background to reconcile the two.

*** I've got two ideas, neither of them physics heavy (so maybe not what you're looking for).

The first is that it's all branching timelines, it's just that /some/ branching timelines fall into stable configurations, where a branch will create a "clone" of itself. In this model, the real power the "stable time loops" person has is creating (or finding) branches that are sufficiently self-creating, such that they /look/ like they're loops, but are in fact branches creating branches. (This is my preferred reconciliation for the Terminator timeline.)

The second idea is [[https://qntm.org/hypertime][hypertime]], which could work well because of how easy it is for an observer to not be able to make sense of what's happening with time travel. Not that much different; you'd have a huge "stack" of self-creating timelines, then the interloper "branching" out divergences in them. Hypertime models take a ton of work though; I plotted one for a fanfic I was writing, and while I got one that seemed to work, I wasn't sure that I could do the "this is actually hypertime" reveal correctly.

I understand how hypertime is just time-travel set in a universe where time has two dimensions. But I cannot wrap my head around what is happening to the time line(s) after one jump. I really want a diagram to explain it.

It's a really good idea though, because while I can't explain /how/, I do see that there is the possibility for multiple types of time travel and it would permit mutable and immutable versions.

***** I'd have to dig out my scanner, because they're mostly paper notes; a lot of it is in the form of diagrams plotted with time on both axes. What I found helps most is thinking of universes in "stacks" and then migrating a diagonal line of the "jump" down and to the left, assuming that the lower left corner is "Past - Past" and the upper right corner is "Future - Future".

Here's [[https://i.imgur.com/sPBxewe.png][a cheaply done MS Paint version of one]], a rather simple case of Jumper 1, going back in time 200 years, and Jumper 2, going back in time 600 years from 300 years in Jumper 1's future. This also assumes a "top" timeline where no time travel took place, and further assumes (or doesn't show) any jumpers from within the three divergent histories, which further complicates things.

In short, it's possible for someone to go back in time and end up in a timeline whose /past/ does not resemble the one that they remember or have records of, which is one of the neat possibilities of hypertime. You go from 2018 back to 1963 to stop the Kennedy assassination, only to find that in the 1963 you ended up in, the Nazis won WWII, even though that's got nothing to do with you.

I also drew up a model for applying hypertime to Back to the Future, namely the "Other Marty" scenario, but never really found the ending I was looking for, which ideally would have had OT Marty show up. The diagrams were /really/ complicated, because you need to account for the subjective experience of at least four characters who are all hopping to and from different timelines with causal relationships being muddied by hypertime. (e.g. Doc goes from 2015 back to 1985 to tell Marty that it's his kids, and shows up in a 1985 created by a totally different Marty going to 1955 -- a 1985 where he was shot to death by the Libyans.)

*** I'm not a physicist, but I think there's a "world is a simulation" type of answer to this problem:

Think of the world as a server, while every sentient being is a client. The state of the world is stored server-side, while the state of a sentient being's memory (experiences of reality) is stored client-side.

The world has infinite processing power, which it uses to construct an infinite timeline based on its near 100% accurate predictions of the future actions of every client. Each client only has access to one part of the timeline (the present), and uses data from the server to fill up its memories.

When a client time travels back to some time t, they are basically hacking. They are now exchanging data with a different part of the timeline than the server expects. Whenever that happens, the world detects the mismatch between client and server data as a time paradox and so it:

1. Destroys the timeline starting from the point of time paradox all the way to future infinity.
2. Rebuilds the infinite timeline with different random events happening.
3. Pushes data to the clients to rewrite all their memories to match the new timeline.
4. Checks if the new timeline still contains a time paradox: if so, restart from step 1.

Normally, this would just result in the act of time travel being erased. The odds of the new timeline still containing the time traveller's attempt to time travel are near zero, so the client just ends up having his memories overwritten and has no memory of attempting to time travel.

But some clients have memory protection. For example, your protagonist's client-side data is read-only: whenever the timeline is rebuilt, the world server can't overwrite her memories. So it has to keep destroying and rebuilding the timeline over and over again until it happens to construct a timeline that matches her memories. From the point of view of the protagonist, she only gets to see the final timeline that matches her memories, so as far as she can tell, time is immutable.

On the other hand, your antagonist's client-side data is private: whenever the timeline is rebuilt, the world server can neither overwrite nor read his memories. So it doesn't detect a paradox even when it constructs a timeline completely incompatible with your antagonist's memories. And doesn't overwrite his memories to match the new timeline. From the point of view of the antagonist, he has clearly changed the past, so time is mutable.

And in both cases, trillions are murdered over and over every time someone time travels.

#+end_quote

As though anything any physicist thinks of is a de facto part of the discipline. Many scientists delve into philosophy and metascience -- that doesn't make those things science. While mathematical formalisms of physics (especially QM) are accessible only to physicists, the interpretation of those formalisms is philosophy -- by necessity an exercise carried out by those same physicists.

  And EY didn't come up with Timeless Physics

This is what bothers me. EY has popularized ideas (at least among this crowd) that he is ill-equipped to discuss in the first place.

^{†} Maybe an individual can verify it for themselves. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality][Maybe.]] And maybe it can be falsified. Perhaps. However, I am skeptical that any experimental outcome would be conclusive.

I'm not sure how to respond to such a blatantly false assertion.

  It's something reserved strictly for pop-science.

False.

Extremely false.

Strawman. Not the right fallacy, vodka for the first time in ove 2 months so I can't do this tonight but I'm already typing.

** So, I'm quite late to this thread (> 17 hours, by the looks of it).

Hope you all enjoy your weekend.

I've been learning so much new crap for work lately, it's been pretty ridiculous. I haven't really touched the Javascript programming scene in ages, but new frameworks and platforms are being released faster than I can shake a stick at.

I'm going to discuss how... schizophrenic I feel from all this.

I was hired as an intern in Sep, having never touched PHP or Javascript. Since then, I've learned about the web framework Laravel, (Web frameworks are p. awesome, if you ask me...) and become intimately familiar with it.

I've learned Javascript, jQuery, and datatables. A month ago, our team began to make a strong-ish push to move from the Frankenstein that is our current Javascript 'base to the Javascript frontend framework Vue.

That stuff is /pretty/ slick. It's strange to wrap your head around, has some interesting gotcha's (don't all js frameworks?), but overall Vues is pretty sweet. So nice to have a data-driven workflow.

Our stuff is still Frankensteinish, but it's becoming more and more structured every month. :P

To add, I've been reverse-engineering Halo 1. I've also got a number of projects in that vein as well.

On Vuex: I've attempted integrating it on a report I was building, but found it overcomplicated our asynchronous operations. The plugin to allow time-travel debugging would be super sweet though.

*** May just be a personal thing for me but I've found that the Martian holds its value well. I've read the book at least five or six times and immensely enjoy each re-read.

I also have really enjoyed several re-reads of Ready Player One though that's definitely for more personal, video game/pop culutre nerdy reasons.
