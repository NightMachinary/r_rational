** Their chances of escape are looking better now, what with the unspoken plan guarantee.

** Emma needed a chance to grow up and mature a bit... I think?

I'm 99% sure Norman's still alive. And I don't think Ray's actually given up yet. I love this series.

*** Yeah, I'm excited to see her take the reins on the escape plan! That last page implies that she's secretly been working on a plan while Mama believed her spirit was broken. Can't wait to see what happens.

*** Agreed. Though maybe she didn't have confidence in her acting abilities. Also she was also not in the best head space at the time so perhaps the idea of lying didn't even occur to her.

**** Same values. More likely to defeat enemy, save everyone if alive. Imagine same story with a mama on their side? Genius children are already selectivity bred for intelligence, with access to as much tech as mama has access to, lovingly raised but with full knowledge of the situation and ready to fight.

** So that's mama's plan , making them give up. It makes sense ,by killing Norman first she ensures Ray will stop trying since he wanted to escape whith both Norman and Emma and now he will be depressed.Now Emma is the biggest threat so she broke her leg to ensure she isn't a problem , and will try to recruit her as mama . Also now we know where the kids come from.

** So, random question: would mass killing spree murder suicide be out of the question? It's difficult to identify another course of action from the outside that would have a chance of changing things.

Whether it would change things for the /better/ is a different question, but it's swiftly appearing that the alternative to go gently into the night.

Perhaps that's just a reflection of me. Emma's thought processes were disturbingly familiar.

*** I don't see what it would achieve. The plantation would most likely just be repopulated with one of the many potential Mamas competing for a spot, and a new batch of children.
