*** Pretty much what I thought, but I considered it a good idea to ask in case I was being incredibly stupid without realising.

** Sorry for the double reply, but this is a separate issue.

You ask "Is this really free will," and in order to answer that I think you need a good definition of free will. Can you explain what it is? Do we have it? What is the physical difference between someone who "has free will" and someone who only /thinks/ they do? If there isn't a measurable difference, I would be suspicious that the question is malformed.

What are you /actually/ asking?

** If someone gave Gandhi a pill that would make him want to murder people, would he take it?

Humans tend to have stable goals, and work toward the furtherance of those goals. If you love your family, you are exceedingly unlikely to go change that fact, because if you're capable of doing that then you probably didn't love them much in the first place.

** If you want free will you have to be stupid enough to believe you have free will. Pak Protectors know they don't have any.
