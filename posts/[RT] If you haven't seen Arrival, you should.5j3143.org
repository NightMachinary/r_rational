Wanted to let you guys know that Arrival is a really good movie, and really well done.


** If you want to encourage people from here to watch the movie, you probably should have mentioned that it was a film adaptation of the short story, /Story of Your Life/, by Ted Chiang.

******* That's true, but you don't have the knee-jerk "oh my god she could have saved her so easily!" sort of reaction like you do with the accident. It happens on a smaller scale in the story, too - she remembers a salad bowl falling on her kid's head and making her cry, and then that same day she's in a supermarket and she sees the salad bowl. She decides to buy it, even though all she knows about that bowl is that it hits her kid in the head and makes her cry.

Plus, the point was that she /loved/ her vision-of-the-future child. If your Favourite Person (partner, kid, parent, Eliezer Yudkowsky, whatever) were to suddenly get hit by a bus and die horribly, and I said, "hey, I'm Omega, I can make it so that person never lived. You will forget about them, but they wouldn't have died young in that bus accident" - you'd be like, "no, I love them, I remember them, and although our time was cut tragically short I would rather have a little than none of it". Louise /remembers her future/, so she loves that little girl just as much as you'd love your own kid.

Can you imagine going back in time and deliberately stopping yourself from conceiving a child you /already have raised for 10+ years/, by, say, making yourself have sex 10 seconds later so a different sperm meets the egg? Sure, you'd probably love that new kid just as much as the original one, but you would lose /that/ kid.

Hopefully you're not as bad as my boyfriend who would say "well I'd stop my daughter ever existing and I'd love my new daughter the same, and she wouldn't die, so it's strictly an improvement" and then when I explain that people generally care about their kids enough not to want to replace them, even if their future self wouldn't know the difference, he just scoffs and goes "what? no. that's stupid. who would do that?! They'er wrong!"

********** I'm probably worse. Assuming we had a kid together, I'd make notes for my alternate timeline selves and then go back and randomize the circumstances of our kid's existence over and over until I could reliably generate a child whose existence brought you the most joy and happiness.

(Edited: OK, I'd try and find the maximum total happiness for both yourself and the child.)

(Double edit: while adhering at least moderately closely to societal norms/expectations, for anyone thinking "Well then just lobotomize them and stick wires in their brain's pleasure centers.")

*********** That's very sweet, and honestly, that's probably what he'd do too.

I'm glad to have someone so incorrigibly rational in my life, but at the same time, it's infuriating at times. I was hoping that by getting him to watch /House/ I could explain how even though you're doing the rational thing, people might still think you're a jerk. Didn't work. He just thought House was the best and everyone else was stupid. /sigh/

************ To be fair, House /is/ the best at doctoring, that's his schtick. He would just be /even better/ if he didn't go about it in the most unsociable way ever and constantly seed problems for himself further down the path. Try explaining it to your boyfriend in terms of comparative longterm advantage when doing and not doing an action, a type of action and a specific class of action.

************** Try phrasing it to him cleverly: First agree with him part of the way. He rightly points out that House gets better results than a normal doctor would. This makes his approach better than the standard one.

Fair enough. But just because he has a /better/ approach doesn't mean he has the /optimal/ approach. He could achieve all the same results by behaving more sociably, while also getting reduced social friction, not alienating his minions, and building up social capital that he could use to do more without repercussions. :P

Then point out to him that this is an instance of a general problem: People defend a particular action as having advantages over the null action, but don't spend the time to think of /even better/ approaches -- usually as part of some motivated reasoning so they don't have to stop doing the original action.

Also, I suspect most of House's abrasiveness comes from his constant pain (hence his Vicodin habit) and he copes with it by screwing with people.

************ If it helps, I've learned that if you want people to be happy, sometimes it's rational to do the irrational things that make them happy.

Even if it's a case of wanting to put purely rational goals first, there's no reason not to also attempt secondary goals of happiness. And from there, it's a short step to leavening pure-rationalism goals with emotional ones.

Or, from a long-term rational perspective, people are more likely to help you achieve rational goals if you've made them happy, even if that means perhaps not meeting each and every short-term rationalist goal.

** I've seen it. I like the alien parts, the language, the antigrav, etc. I didn't like the B-plot with the future child or the idea that speaking a different language allows you to break physics. Wasn't a fan of the unsubtle pro-US-military-above-all approach, either.

I'll admit I haven't read the book - that might bring it together more smoothly.
