Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Last night I was having the usual nightmare where I'm back in high school for a math test and all the formulas have slipped out of my mind, so I turn to chat with a forgotten friend-

And then it struck me. I'm /back in high school!/ Quick, uh, Apple shares, bitcoin, 9/11, Fukushima, I don't remember enough daily news to immediately prove foreknowledge but I do know a /startling/ amount of future Magic the Gathering trivia, maybe I should get vouched for by /Wizards of the Coast/...

(Then I tried to leave the classrom and spent the rest of the dream in a pointless chase scene with the math teacher. Can't win them all.)

 

On that topic: are there any good stories in which an [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml][earthfic]] character who goes back in time tries to accomplish goals beyond their petty personal selves? It's a popular wish-fulfilment theme, but the ones I know are either fantasy worlds or people with depressingly small-scale goals.

** I just got back from an eye exam, and apparently I'm near-sighted. I've known this for a few years now (just barely passed my last driver's exam eye test), but finally went in to have my eyes checked. I'm a little bit excited about having glasses, in the hopes that they'll make me look distinguished and intelligent, but this is a new world for me.

Any particular tips? They'll probably only be on when I'm trying to use the living room computer on the big screen, or when driving.

*** Do you mind if I ask why you don't intend to wear your glasses all the time?

I don't understand why anyone would choose not to always have good vision.

As for tips: Designate a space where you put your glasses every evening when you go to sleep. Looking for your glasses really, really sucks when you need them to actually see anything.

Alternatively, or preferably additionally, get a pair of back-up and/or sports glasses. Sooner or later you will lose or destroy your main pair. Don't be like me and wander around France blind as a bat because your only pair of glasses fell into the sea on the second day of a two week excursion.

Consider getting an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 bucks or so. You might get your lenses clean without it (though probably not that gloriously clean), but removing the gunk sticking to the nose pads is a pain without it.

Speaking of the nose pads: they will turn green and/or yellow after a while. Apparently that's because the material they are made of is porous and prone to sucking up all the oils and lotions it can get its greedy little openings on. Here in Germany most shops will replace them for free, though I have no idea how the rest of the world handles it.

Take a couple of minutes to work out how to open and put on your glasses quickly and while using only one hand. Not only does it look cool (it really doesn't), it can also save you time and grief in emergencies.

Though from the sound of it most, if not all, of these tips will only become relevant once your eyesight has deteriorated a bit more.

Per the eye exam, I'm only mildly near-sighted, and my vision within about three or four feet is as good as it can be, glasses or not. Roughly 95% of what I do that needs vision occurs within that range (cooking, reading, writing, playing with my son, general hygiene), and wouldn't be improved by wearing glasses. Beyond that range is where I run into trouble. So if I'm going to be spending large amounts of time not getting any (or marginal) benefit from wearing glasses, it doesn't seem to make sense to wear them, except out of habit or the need to be able to have far sight at a moment's notice.

***** As someone who /tried/ doing this when I first got my glasses, it usually ends up as way more trouble than it's worth to swap back and forth. What I found is that I had habituated myself to not having perfect vision, and avoided doing tasks that would require it. So when I got my glasses, I found myself using them even for cases I didn't need them before. Add to that the fact that, when going out for the day, I needed to take them with me in the event that I had use for them, and the most convenient place to store glasses for occasional use happened to be my face.

If you have computer-induced nearsightedness, chances are your vision will eventually deteriorate to where mine is at, where everything /works/ without glasses, just with an extra layer of annoyance. I could go without them just fine - I spend most of my time indoors too - but it feels a little slimy and imprecise, like having a coating of grease on your hands.

***** I'm in a similar situation, got glasses recently because I'm a bit near-sighted. At home they are off unless I'm watching TV, at work they're off at my desk but on everywhere else, and I keep them on when I drive somewhere. The bad part is that I often forget to grab them again when I get up, because I'm used to only needing to gather my wallet and phone and stuff. I already lost my first pair. So definitely take care if you're gonna take them off somewhere.

Personally I find that carrying glasses and having to find or pick them up when I need them to be more trouble than it is to keep them on.

​

BTW do you spend a lot of time outside ? Recent studies have shown that the rise in the frequency of nearsightedness is directly correlated to a decrease in sun exposure and time spent outside.. This is worrisome because if the number of people that are nearsighted increases, the number of people that have it so severe as to be considered blind also increases.

Really? I started wearing glasses at age 5, and in the last 25 years I've literally /never/ lost a single pair of glasses.

I destroyed a pair in 7th grade. They were the "bendable" titanium frames. During break/recess/whatever at school, I twisted them to show off their "bendability" and snapped them clean in half.

I mean, were your glasses not fitted correctly? Sounds like the stems were too long if they just slipped right off your face. I just now looked directly at the ground and shook my head /violently/ back and forth and up and down and around and around, and they're still attached to my face pretty firmly.

When I was a kid, I often got glasses that had stems that were one 5mm increment longer than what would've fit me during fitting - because childrens be growin', yo - so I always took them off before riding roller coasters, but after attaining my adult size as a teenager - and the consistently-sized head that accompanies your adult size - my glasses began to fit from purchase to grave / "drawer full of old glasses I refuse to throw away." I've worn at least the last three or four pairs of glasses I've owned on some of the tallest and fastest roller coasters in the US, and they stayed attached to my face pretty firmly. I mean, I haven't worn my newest pair of glasses on a roller coaster, but the pair before that and the pair before that and the pair before that (which I got at ages 15, 17, and 19), yeah, those got thoroughly tested.

There's three numbers printed somewhere on your glasses (unless your glasses are a few years old and the numbers have rubbed off). Width of the lenses, width of the nose bridge, and length of the stems/arms/earpieces. That last one's the most important for this discussion. It'll likely be either 135mm or 140mm or 145mm. The next time you get glasses and are trying on frames, disregard the style for a moment and look for those numbers, and try on all the different stem lengths to see how they fit. The width of the bridge and the lenses are important as well, because your pupils should be centered in the middle of the lenses.

TL;DR: Loss or destruction of glasses is neither an inevitability nor a common universal experience. Glasses don't just fall off your face, and if they do that means they haven't been properly fitted (if you don't already, it's a good idea to try having an actual fitting done at an actual optometrist's office rather than going to lenscrafters or Walmart or ordering them offline - if you /do/ already, maybe find a new optometrist).

I can't stress this enough. Glasses that have been properly fitted by a professional shouldn't move on your face unless /you/ move them.

***** Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed advice.

The problem with that particular pair of glasses wasn't the fit, though. It was that I decided to splurge and got the ultra light-weight rimless glasses. Which was great, until we took a boat trip and an unexpectedly violent gust of wind from diagonally behind me ripped them off of my face and cast them into the ocean.

I haven't actually lost another pair after that, but I have had them destroyed or otherwise made un-useable or inaccessible in the mean-time, be it through my own actions or circumstances beyond my control.

You're right that my claim of inevitability was exaggerated. On the other hand, just being careful is not enough to ensure your constant and uninterrupted access to any particular pair of glasses.

You don't mean Silhouette, do you? The self-styled "lightest glasses in the world"? Because the pair I got at age 17 was Silhouette, cost thereabouts of $900 (cost before insurance, anyway; used to have really good insurance back in the day...). Wore them on roller coasters without even thinking about it. Wore them through two years of college, which was up in the mountains, and my glasses never even budged during the incident when I missed the bus and had to walk the 20 minutes from my apartment to class /during a literal blizzard/ (that's an exaggeration, blizzards technically have sustained winds of 35+ mph for 3+ hours, and the one specific instance I'm referring to was 25+ mph sustained for an hour or two with 40+ mph gusts; I'd go outside and smoke in 10 mph sustained with 20+ mph gusts, which was not rare weather there).

Still, I can't imagine someone getting Silhouette glasses and the establishment selling them not doing a proper fitting. Maybe my glasses' stability during the semi-blizzard was due to the fact that I was wearing a thick beanie pulled down over my ears?

On the other hand, I've /never/ been particularly careful with glasses, I've always just put them on as soon as I got out of bed and not taken them off again until I got back in bed 16ish hours later, never sparing them even a passing thought in the interim, and I've never been prematurely dispossessed of a pair of glasses by anything other than my own stupidity that one time when I was 12 and snapped them in half with my own hands. The glasses I got at ages 15, 17, and 19? I'm going to be 30 in a few months and I still have all three of them, and switched back and forth between them over the last 10 years (though I've worn the latest pair almost exclusively for like the last 3 years, up until I got a fresh pair 5 months ago).

A lot of people use sunglasses when driving to deal with bright sunlight, but I can't do that thanks to my glasses. So I usually rely on a baseball cap and/or open the sun visor.

Give yourself more space between your car and other people's cars when you start out driving with glasses until you adjust. This will give you more time to react to any issues.

I don't have them myself, but you can also get [[https://www.stantonoptical.com/blog/anti-reflective-lens-coating][anti-reflective (AR) eyeglass coating]].

#+end_quote

Don't.

I've worn glasses since I was 5 years old. For 25 years I've gotten out of bed in the morning, put on my glasses, and not taken them off again until I got back in bed (except for bathing/showering (and swimming and riding roller coasters, but those aren't part of a bog-standard day)). I've had many severals of pairs of glasses in my life.

Due to /circumstances/, I got a new pair in the spring of 2009 and then didn't get another new pair until about 5 months ago. That's almost a decade's difference. Anti-reflective coating was not common at that time, and I got them at my optometrist's office where AR coating wasn't being "pushed" because they knew it wasn't for everyone, it was more like a film coating and it was likely to flake and peel off. Over the last decade, it's evolved into ionization and blasting the lenses with electrons to create a layer of magnesium (I think) particles that's bonded to the surface of the lenses and only a few molecules thick.

Sounds fancy schmancy, right?

I recentlyish recovered a memory from age 6, after having gotten my second ever pair of glasses. They told me about cleaning the glasses, how I shouldn't use my shirt or spit or kleenex or whatever else people use, and that the "cleaning cloth and cleaning spray" didn't cut it as an exclusive, and that at least once a day or once every few days I should wash my glasses with mild soap and lukewarm water. I was 6. I think I did that for maybe like a week and then went back to wiping my glasses on my shirt. I think I noticed that the lenses had little scratches all over them, but anyone who has glasses probably knows that you don't really see those scratches once the glasses are on your face.

I forgot about the "washing the glasses with soap" thing until 5 months ago when I got my first new pair of glasses in a decade.

I got them from Walmart. They "upsold" me. They told me that they could tell that my then-current glasses (a decade old, from before AR was a commonplace thing) had AR coating, and that I didn't /need/ to get it but that it's one of those things that you'll miss once you don't have it anymore. So I got the AR coating. I thought Wally World had given me screwed-up glasses (it had been a decade, and I had forgotten that switching to a new pair of glasses has a qualitative wibbly wobbly weirdness to it while your eyes get used to focusing through a different prescription in differently-shaped lenses). I also noticed a weird green reflection on the back of my lenses in my peripheral vision. So I went home and started doing research immediately, and learned about AR coating.

That's when I found out that Wally World straight up lied to me, that my last pair did /not/ have AR coating. People make a big deal about AR glasses being clearer so other people can see your eyes, but I swear that the green reflection on the lenses is like something out of an anime, the very first thing I thought when I got home and started examining myself in the mirror was "why in the bloody hell does the entire surface of these lenses turn green when light hits them at a certain angle?" I also found out that AR lenses are extraordinarily easy to scratch, even if you get "scratch resistant" AR coating.

Luckily I did this research before the first time I ever cleaned them. The "cleaning spray" might contain ammonia and/or alcohol (I can't find a definitive answer - regardless of how I ask Google, she just keeps giving me the same list of "how to make homemade glasses cleaner" and "we sell glasses cleaner, please purchase it from us" and "how to clean your glasses"). Both of those ingredients will break down the AR coating over time and make the world look foggy, owing to being coated in a prismatic rainbow sheen (like the way oil on pavement looks).

So I rediscovered the "cleaning glasses with soap and water" thing. Went out and bought a microfiber cloth to dry them with.

I've treated these glasses more delicately than any other pair of glasses I've owned in the last 25 years, taking great pains to clean them in the most gentle manner I've ever done (the last few months for those 10-year-old glasses I'd been wearing, I just folded up some toilet paper and wiped them down with that (my shirt had stopped working, there was just a permanent grease smear that only got cleared up with TP, presumably from a decade of never washing them with soap and water); TP is a product made of wood, and if you clean AR glasses with toilet paper you might have to get a new pair of glasses).

Even treating them delicately, after having the glasses less than a week, I cleaned them with soap and water, then got the microfiber cloth out of its package to dry them off, and I pulled the microfiber cloth away and noticed a smudge near the middle of the left lense, and I held it up to the light and the smudge was a little cluster of scratches, looking very similar to the little clusters of scratches that I would anticipate accumulating on a pair of glasses after a few years of wear. Apparently, just the most wee little smidgeon of dust on the cloth was enough to scratch the lenses to bits. Since then, I now use the cloth to pat the lenses dry rather than rubbing the lenses with the cloth.

It is straight up /ridiculous/ for a pair of glasses to be /that/ high maintenance for so little benefit. Sure, if there's a light behind you then you won't see its reflection, but you'll see a big green glare. Sure, other people can see your eyes just a little bit less obstructed by light reflections, but situations causing those light reflections on normal glasses are going to cause the green glare. It's almost like the only real benefit to AR is that they look better in photographs that were taken with a flash.

Also, I wore the glasses while wearing a VR headset and now there's a centimeter-long scratch in a straight vertical line on each of the lenses almost directly in front of my pupils, so it doesn't matter how clean the lenses are, I've still got a smudge right in the center of my vision. I'm going to wait 6 months just in case I ruin my glasses and have to get new ones, to ensure I get my money's worth out of these, but eventually I'm going to go to an auto shop and get some sort of chemical goop I read about a few months ago and use it to remove the AR coating from my glasses. The coating is /microscopically/ thin. It takes next to /nothing/ to scratch them.

*** Transitional lenses are a trap. They're cool for about a week, and then you're stuck indoors with sunglasses on for ten minutes every time you go outside. They barely work in the car too since windshields tend to block UV rays, which is what activates them. Buy a regular pair and a prescription pair of sunglasses instead.

Anti glare on the other hand is a godsend if you use them at the computer.

I can recommend getting rimless frames, at least on the bottom of the frame. It makes reading much easier since there's less getting in your way.

I too once thought about only wearing them when I needed them, but you know what's more annoying than wearing glasses? Carrying a bulky case on your person with the constant threat of breaking or losing them. Like, as thick as your wallet and as big as your phone. Annoying as shit. Plus your eyes are only going to get worse from here, may as well get used to it.

If you find a frame you really like, keep in mind that the next time you update your prescription you can just use the same frames. They won't usually tell you this.

If you have an HSA, it can be used on glasses.

There's a transition period while your brain rewires to compensate for the frames and slight visual distortion of the lenses. In my experience it's 3-5 days of headaches. If it's particularly bad bring it to the attention of your optometrist, but just be aware, I guess.

Oh, and it /totally/ gives at least +2 to both sophistication and nerd cred.

*** Hmm, just some random practical thoughts:

zenioptical.com is an excellent source of cheap lenses. Do not buy lenses direct from your optometrist unless you have great insurance, you will end up paying a lot more.

If you have any kind of metal allergy make sure you get hypoallergenic frames to avoid awful rashes. Get something with replaceable nose pads to avoid long term grottiness, as well.

Keeping the lenses clean can be a real chore, easier these days with microfiber cloths. Never ever use paper products to dry your glasses, it is astonishing how easily a lens can be scratched

If this is a concern, go along with the flow - your optometrist will check your eyes and give you a new prescription, then you'll pay, then they'll take you out to be fitted for glasses and you should just let it happen. Once they figure out what fit you need, take off the glasses they've given you and look for the three numbers printed on the frames, for bridge width and lense width and stem/arm length. Then just say you aren't happy with any of the styles they have available and just leave. When you go elsewhere for your glasses, you'll have been properly fitted and know all the relevant measurements.

Brick and mortar establishments like Lenscrafters don't care (they'll try to put you in something you find attractive with a high price tag, the fitters at the optometrist should just throw random frames at your face regardless of style to find out your fit before they move on to something as trivial as style), and websites that rely on taking a picture and measuring pixels are inaccurate enough to be problematic, like, you /really/ need your pupils to be pretty much centered in the lenses, and if the bridge isn't the right width they can slide down your nose, and if the stems/arms are too long they can slide off your face, it really is kind of important to get professionally fitted.

*** I've worn glasses for most of my life and absolutely hate them, mostly for the looks and the fact that if they get broken I'm severely handicapped in outdoor life. I haven't been able to convince myself to get surgical correction due to the benefits of glasses and risks if the surgery though. Here's some positives:

You can get completely used to them: After the initial discomfort, then some awkwardness, you will forget you're wearing them entirely. I have no problem doing any exercise in mine, and can even sleep in them without a problem when needed.

Always on comfortable eye protection: Always wearing glasses means you rarely have to put on additional eyeware, and that you are used to it. Mine saved me an eye when I ran into a tree branch so hard it scratched them, and have helped far more times than I've noticed.

UV blocking: Most glasses (and contact) lenses block 100% of UV light so you can stare at the sun without wrecking your eyes! More practically this means I find direct sun and glare much less of a problem than other people, and I personally know it isn't roasting my retinas. You will still want sunglasses for comfort, but health wise they aren't necessarily.

Tips: Clean the nose pads and parts that touch your head with an astringent to avoid oil buildup and acne there.

Clean the lenses for others sake, you might get used to or forget about dirty lenses but it will bother people talking to you.

Have different lenses for: sports, casual, and formal. Sports is for durability and frequent cleaning, and you want them tighter than normal. Casual and formal for style since having a separate serious/formal looking pair really helps step it up and accent special occasions for friends.

Put on your glasses to look at things "hard", even when it isn't needed. When asked your opinion about how something looks, or a paper make sure to put on your glasses. You don't need them up close, but everyone else has at least some feeling that you are entirely blind without them.

*** If you happen to cycle a lot like I do, try looking for frames that are thin at the temples. I have glasses that have more than a centimetre vertical width at the hinge and get moderately thinner the closer they get to the ear, and I was really frustrated when spring came around and I found out that this frame introduced a wide obstruction in my field of view when looking out of the corner of my eye or over my shoulder (to check for traffic approaching from the back).

Other than that:

- You can always retain the frame and exchange the lenses every few years, particularly if you happen to like your frame.
- Glare reduction is worth it (for me, I don't remember a time I didn't wear glasses)
- Sonic bath cleaners are worth it (they're multi-purpose, not just limited to glasses, but also bicycle parts, for instance)

*** I got glasses about two years ago and I have an even smaller prescription than you do (I can pass eye tests fine!), however the reason I wear glasses full time now is because once I adjusted to wearing them (took about a week), I stopped getting headaches! I used to get headaches about once a week and now it's more like every six weeks.

Also get your glasses online. I get one "free" pair per year with my health insurance, but that's only to the value of $120, which is the cheapest glasses. Getting them from zenii even after the exchange rate and shipping to Australia is like $50 for the nicest transition lenses and much more choice of frames.

** A Flash of Colour in the Mind:

Some say to remember that the finger pointing at the moon is not the moon. And some say that every time you call up a memory, you change it. But here's the best I can express what remains of a split-second of thought earlier today:

I was enjoying reading a classic SF novel for the first time, and as my thoughts went over expanding on an idea from one line, I had a combination of seeing that expansion in the form of some Avatar-like glowing blue text, combined with an odd sensation. It took me some time to nail it down, which was a combination of thinking that the expansion was new-to-me, interesting... and what I now realize was the actual emotional sensation of hope.

I'm not sure if I can describe what it's like to realize that I'd literally forgotten what hope feels like. I've cobbled together an intellectual approximation, so that, as a hyperbolic-to-the-unrealistic-extreme example, I can analyse the pros and cons of suicide, taking into account that I know my mind is prone to certain biases, and come to the logical conclusion that even if I don't anticipate anything ever getting anything better, staying alive is most likely the better choice. But that's an entirely different thing than actually /feeling/ "hey, that sounds like something better that just might happen".

Sure, I've now been going over that split-second so many times that by now I mostly only remember remembering it. But I'm still taking it as a /very/ good sign I'm still on an upswing. (Sure, one step back every few steps forward, and there are days as blah as before... but there are days that /aren't/.)

About the only downside is that re-thinking my latest story idea, I'm now realizing how bleak and depressing my outline is; so I'm going to have to change it so much that I might as well be coming up with something from scratch. Which is such a ridiculously contrived "downside" that I'm grinning lopsidedly to myself as I type this.

Of course, given past experience, I may only be peaking before a return to previous depression; I've had such before. But... it may not be. And I'm looking forward to hoping my mental state will improve further.

However, Faeria didn't have that problem and it had quickly become my favorite CCG due to several other reasons. It has beautiful artstyle, requires more tactic and planning ahead than other CCGs due to its unique living board, gives you all the cards in an expansion with 100% guarantee if you buy them. All in all, I'm pretty passionate about this game and realized it's currently on sale, so I thought I'd do some "subtle" advertising here.

It's [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/397060/Faeria/][on Steam]] and this weekend it's free to play. So, try it out and if it strikes your fancy, remember it's on 50% sale ;)

It's incredibly hard to top Magic, especially now that it actually has an online version that doesn't look like it was coded by the team that brought us the original healthcare.gov (And doesn't require the fiscal outlay of the paper version). Progression is pretty decent, specific decks are easy to save for with just wildcard drops, and the free packs round out your collection nicely, but most importantly, it's just so much better balanced than most of it's competitors.

I should also note that [[http://discord.gg/rational][the discord]] has a #politics channel, though I have it muted and so can't recommend it (you'd have to see for yourself). And politics seems better discussed asynchronously with more time-per-message anyway, at least to me.

Give me a week to think about it, then ping me again? I'll put a note in my calendar in case you don't. I'm leaning "against" right now, mostly because of bad experiences in the past, both with politics in this sub in general, and with quarantine of topics (rather than outright bans).

************ Okay. To make it very brief, HOURS after the recent terror attack in New Zealand, an Australian senator made extremely insensitive remarks (so much so that when I read the statement I assumed it was poorly done satire). It essentially said that allowing Muslims to immigrate into New Zealand was the cause of the attack, and ended with a bible verse, among other terrible things.

He was not popular for this, and to put it in context, this senator is from a very conservative part of a very conservative state, and he got elected after two or three senators were kicked out of the senate for being ineligible (there are somewhat esoteric rules about what qualifies you to be a senator in Australia - for example, as a civil servant, I wouldn't qualify - and they are not thoroughly checked, so a few years ago it was discovered that a bunch of senators were ineligible due to being dual citizens of other countries without knowing it, so a bunch of senators had to resign). So this guy ended up being the guy who ended up being eligible, despite having very few votes.

He was a member of the One Nation party, which is one of our numerous third parties (we have preferential voting and thriving third parties, who always get one senate seat, and we've recently had the most popular third party have a house of representatives seat, proving the system works, or something). One Nation is one of the more whackadoo parties but also one of the more mainstream parties: it is unapologetically racist, and not just in the way that most conservative candidates are racist, but they literally want to close immigration to non-whites. Sadly, One Nation is popular in the conservative/racist areas of the country. However, this guy was ultimately kicked out of that party /for being too conservative/. He joined another, even more conservative, even more fringe party, and was kicked out of that party too, so now he's independent. When he was sworn in to parliament, his opening speech was extremely racist and even referenced the Nazi final solution.

So with that background out of the way, we come to EGGBOI, an Australian legend. "Eggboy", a 17 year old, attended a political event this politician was holding, and he took an egg with him. He stood behind him filming on his camera and he smushed the egg into the back of the senator's head. Following that, the senator hit (or attempted to hit?) Eggboy twice, and then ~5 men tackled Eggboy to the ground. Eggboy was arrested but released without being charged.

He is now being praised as a national hero on social media as the senator is extremely unpopular for the recent remarks. Several Australian bands (e.g. Hilltop Hoods) have offered Eggboy free tickets to their shows for life.

Meanwhile, our Prime Minister (from our mainstream conservative party) has said that he thinks the senator should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for hitting Eggboy.

And that's the story! I hope you enjoyed it.

******** There are a couple of negative effects I've seen in other places:

- Quarantine is fine as a line in the sand, but some people will still disobey the quarantine, meaning that there's still some work involved.
- Quarantines attract people who desperately want whatever the quarantined thing is, and I can tell you right now that I don't want to attract anyone to this sub if what they want is political discussion, especially not since there are so many outlets for that in so many other places, and so much of the discussion quickly turns toxic.
- Toxicity can spill out of quarantine fairly easily. If two people get into a pissing match in quarantine, it's very easy for that to bleed out into other subjects, producing drama and ill will that I don't want.
- Quarantine zones are ripe for targeting, either toward this sub, toward mods, or toward users. (I would care much less about that if discussion of the quarantined subject were something that were core to the function/purpose of this subreddit.)

Don't get anti-reflective coating on your glasses. I'm currently typing a response to [[/u/xamueljones]]'s response to your comment about glasses, but I've been working on that comment for like two hours because it was /WAY/ too long and needed to be cut down to a reasonable length, but I still might abandon that comment without posting it (I do that a lot, writing out pages and pages worth of nonsense in a single comment and then just deleting the whole thing). If I /do/ abandon it, the main point was /don't get the anti-reflective coating./

Also, think of your glasses as a prosthetic. Get out of bed, put them on, and don't take them off again until you get back in bed (obviously take them off before showering and before swimming and before riding a roller coaster). None of this "I'm only gonna wear them while driving" crap.

There will almost certainly be visual distortion. The world is going to look weird and wibbly wobbly for anywhere from a few hours to a few days (or even up to two weeks if it's your first pair), because your eyes have to adjust to focusing through them. The only way to make the wibbly wobbly stop is to wear the glasses as much as physically possible.

** Designing a perfect country: Administration

Many people fantasise about how they would improve the world were they put in charge of it, I'm sure in this subreddit we have a particular fondness for these kind of thought experiments.

One of the least interesting and yet significant is how a country is internally organised.

There is a reason we don't have a single central government that manages every aspect of government. Instead we split the government into sections each with their responsibilities, and we further subdivide that into more sections and ad addendum until we're happy.

The question I have is what is a good method for administrative divisions? How should responsibilities be divided per level?

I'm trying to imagine if I was put in charge of say the UK and they wiped it clean so there was no government anywhere and they then said divide up the current government responsibilities into appropriate areas.

In my opinion the ideal administrative system should be robust: it should be able to handle predictable future events, to do so it should be flexible, the size and shape and number of divisions on each level will likely change as people move and cities grow and shrivel. There must be mechanics for responsibilities such as public transport being able to be transferred to a single entity when for example London grows and subsumes the city). It should also be consistent and as universally applicable as possible. One area on the same level shouldn't have different responsibilities than another. That just causes unneeded complications.

Zeroth Level (technically ultimately responsible for everything): National Defence, Foreign Policy, National Infrastructure (railways?, highways?, some degrees of public transport?, how much of infrastructure is there responsibly), Education (to what extent, general guide?, management of schools directly?, standard exams?), Power, Water (?), Standards (deciding when to accept international standards or creating national ones), National Statistics? (collection devolved or maintained?), National Parks and Pollution? Healthcare?

First Level: area? population? density? number? River pollution?

Second Level:

Third Level:

How many levels?

If anyone can point me to the best place to find information and discussion on the optimal administrative system I'd love to read something like that.

There are several essays in there on why the optimal number of levels is 0, and that we should embrace anarcho-capitalism. They aren't necessarily true, but they are well written and thought provoking opinions that I haven't often seen argued for elsewhere. I think it'd be particularly a good read for you too since you seem to be taking it for granted that governments should be large.

There are fairly extensive conflicts on these issues since different regions want different things. Like say, if you hate the government and think their education system sucks you may be happier with a more local education system, but if you are worried about local radicals making your schools teach dumb things you may want a national one.

This example seems overwhelmingly in favour of local education systems. If you don't like your local education system, it's relatively easy to change cities. If things are set up like how many libertarians want, they'll be enough different local private schools you won't even need to move at all. If you don't like your national education system, it's a monumental task for many to change countries.

And while it's difficult for the poor to move areas, it's far from the potentially impossible task that moving nations is. In fact, moving cities for the most extremely jobless, homeless poor I would think is just the cost of one bus ticket, and isn't even too much more than that for people working unstable jobs like fast food worker and renting apartments.

You forget about social networks but I would also say that I wouldn't want people to move. It's more optimal for everyone to stay in a centralised location. The only reason you should be out of the city is if it is necessary (mine natural resources).

Or for job opportunities. Say you want to become an actor. Again, move to Hollywood. Or maybe the scenery you want is nice open farmland, some people really value fresh air and having large spacious properties.

Or maybe job opportunities change. Take someone born in Detroit in the 40s. You can start off in the automobile industry and have a great career. But after a couple decades the economy shifts and you're laid off, no fault of your own. You ought to be moving to a new city where there are different job opportunities.

That's actually a sign of the fundamental flaws of Libertarianism. That philosophy starts from an idealized system of government, then makes some simplifying assumptions about humans in order to make that system of government work.

One of these simplifying assumptions is that humans can be modeled as something like a fluid - populations will naturally move along a gradient from less prosperous places to more prosperous places.

That's not true for a bunch of reasons. Among them:

1. It costs money to move from one place to another. If you're already in a shitty place, you're not going to have as much money.
2. It costs "spoons" (or mental energy) to move from one place to another. If you're already in a shitty situation, you're not likely to have the willpower to make the move.
3. Moving will destroy your social network. Generic Appalachian Town might suck and there's no jobs, but at least Aunt Mary and Cousin Joe and your best friend Rob are nearby. (btw this is also why areas like "Little Italy" or "Chinatown" form - if you can move somewhere and slot in to an already existing social network, you're a lot more likely to be successful)
4. Moving requires information. If you move somewhere because there's no jobs in your area, and then it turns out there's no jobs in the new place too, you're extra fucked.

The net effect is literally what you see in the USA now: mobility for the upper-middle class, stagnation and quiet despair for everyone economically below them.

A strong government is a necessary evil to actively obstruct the 0.01%, restraining them from buying said government out from under the rest of the citizens and then from using their power to siphon out even /more/ wealth until they eventually consume the entire planet.

In 2016, home ownership hit its lowest level in 50 years, and it hasn't improved much in the last two years. /One out of three/ Millennials is still stuck living with their parents, the highest that number has been since the end of the 1930s (coincidentally, the end of the 1930s was about 10 years after the start of the Great Depression, and we're currently about 10 years out from the start of the Great Recession).
