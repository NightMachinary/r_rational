Disclaimer: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]] is mine. If you haven't read it, pardon the waste of electrons.

I have plenty of ideas for where the story is going, but reviewers have suggested some really interesting ideas that ended up making their way into the story, and I thought I would ask for more of that. For example, in the other 2YE thread, drageuth2 suggested causing gold to change weight (from the usual 'massless coinage' houserule or, by RAW, '50gp = 1lb' to 'heavy gold nugget') by melting it from coins into raw gold, which I thought was really shiny.

The rules of the world are in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/10/The-Two-Year-Emperor][Chapter 10]].


** I read the first ~30 chapters some time back. I haven't looked at the entire thing recently, so apologies if this duplicates stuff that's already happened.

I would personally go for an Ice Assassin Army.

[[https://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fw/20030124a][Ice Assassin]] (also in Frostburn) or Simulacrum Clone Armies. Anyone who can cast Ice Assassin (Wiz 9 spell) can make an evil clone of a target /under their complete control/. If the evil clone happens to be a clone of themselves, the high level caster who just cast ice assassin, well, the clone can cast the spells you can... including, say, /Ice Assassin/. Your army of one can expand indefinitely more-or-less. Simulacrum is similar but requires a higher level target because of the percentage stuff. For fueling the caster cost requirements, consider planeshift or balor mining.

Combat tactics: use mooks/summons carrying Dust of Sneezing and Choking (stuns for 5d4 rounds in an area, /no save/) backed up by infinite wizard armies. Start your attack by having some fraction of your wizard armies on another plane cast the spell /gate/ to summon in all of the leadership and high-level characters of the opposing army that you know of and force them to hand-roll tacquitos while you kill them, before your assault begins.

**** Possibly the most broken magic item in the entire game is the Thought Bottle. The TB lets you pay 500 XP for save point on your XP; when you use the save point your current XP is set to N, where N is the number of XP you had after paying for the save point. (So, you're at 3000, you pay for a save point, you can now restore to 2500 whenever you like.) I believe a given save point only works once.

So, let's say you are 7000 XP above your level requirement. Get yourself, say, 3 TBs (A, B, and C) and do the following:

A: save (can now restore to 6500 XP) B: save (can now restore to 6000 XP) C: save (can now restore to 5500 XP)

You now have 5500 XP to play with. Cast Ice Assassin (IA). Reset bottle C, take a new save point. Cast IA. Reset bottle B. Etc

You can end up casting a truly ridiculous number of these things for a grand total of 500 XP. And don't forget that each IA is a duplicate of you, including your experience total. Give them each some thought bottles and let them go crazy as well.

** Leave.

I would leave.

Get everyone out and go somewhere else. This world is fucked and [[#s][bad things are happening.]] Go to another place, another world. Another plane, if you have to.

Did I miss a reason this isn't possible?

Look, I know the Planar Handbook wasn't in the resources list, but other planes clearly exist. They're in the Prime Material now. And it is apparently ruled by idiot gods with some serious issues.

So, leave. Jake's kidnappers wouldn't be happy unless they took everyone from their kingdom, but we've seen that /logistically/ it is possible to do. They could likely be talked into saving the people and not the literal land in this instance, especially after seeing the results of [[#s][other advanced people.]] Or figure out how to bottle entire cities, if that helps.

Point is, despite all their /wonderful/ speed-chess plans to fight back, there is still no known way to defend any country anymore. Easy attacks abound, ones their foes are clearly able to enact right now. There is also proof many, many others have failed in the same situation before. [[#s][Even worse stuff.]]

So leave, and find a better place to live, with [[#s][nicer stuff.]] Even if there isn't time to make such travel work, someone had to have done some world or plane hopping before. Find their stuff, unearth it, and play Stargate SG:1 until you find a gate that goes somewhere nice. Or at least [[#s][redacted.]] You don't even need your Omaga plan follow up. And we all knew what that was the moment he thought it up.

I would be in favor of this plan both as the person of Jake and as a member of a D&D adventuring party stuck in this situation.

*Woah!* Wait, stop the presses. I just read in another response that there are Planer Ring Gates. So...other methods have to exist. This is sounding better and better.

--------------

Either that, or run a quick ascension gambit so you can actually stand a chance of fighting back.

No, not on yourself -- you likely don't have the soul that would become godly in the first place. No, bootstrap /your executive assistant/. You know, someone with a good mind who's humble, moral, and actually seems to like you and wants to help. Forget [[#s][current plans.]]

If reality hands you lemons, make a goddess of lemonade.

Just do it fast enough. We know [[#s][they]] can't react faster than Jake can do stupid things, and at least then you'll have a new goddess to support you.

You, sir, are smarter than the average bear. I've already had several people ask what that plan was.

I really like the idea of ascending Suze, I just don't know how you would do it. Pun-Pun takes too long -- the gods would see as soon as you started the loop and show up to smack you. Conceivably the Omnifiscer, but I think that trick is bogus and I wouldn't allow it. Any thoughts?

**** Maybe I just read too much doomsday sci-fi. Didn't think Jake assumed planer travel was possible at the time, though. The idea I initially had was a suicide switch, some sort of “fuck the world” option. Means seemed obvious when I read that part, which to me is just good storytelling.

--------------

*edit some numbers wrong, doesn't matter had dragon

As for becoming a god, how that happens always depends on the story. I'm just going to go ahead and post the ideas I've got so far, as this is taking forever to work out in detail. This is really long.

There are some basics. You've gotta become at least a quasi-god or hero deity -- Divine Rank: zero. This is what people like Hercules, Perseus, or Theseus have. They are just /better/ than normal people and have some sort of divine nature, like a godly parent -- though that isn't listed as a requirement. The closest to a firm listed descriptor is that they /usually/ have at least one higher than mortal stat. Someone acquiring this basic divine nature is the only rules path I know of that doesn't involve direct and high-level godly intervention. And that seems...unlikely at this point. Wishing someone into hero deity status should be a last option, as that seems equally unsafe.

From reading the “rules”, such as they are, being /like/ a god in some way appears to be one firm part of being considered one. My take is, if you have stats that are literally godly, and you also do godly things, it should just slot into place if there is room “up above”, so to speak. That which is like a very minor goddess and does a very minor goddess' work, /is/ a very minor goddess, in other words. Worst case, you end up with a hero or champion who has literally inhuman stats.

Well, worse-worst case is, existing gods erase you from existence. But that shouldn't stop you at this point. There are already hints that ascension is very possible and the gods watch out for common world-breaking exploits to it, but this path isn't exactly cheating. Wishes might still help, though I wouldn't go there unless you're very, /very/ sure there are no better options.

--------------

There are two ways to go that I see. Max her level and look for divine boosters, or think outside the box.

First option, get Suze a class level, then powerlevel her. She has high INT (perfect memory?), so a wizard --and we can powerlevel those easy now. Done.

Finding something to light that spark of the divine is hard, but seems possible. Depends on DM approval, though there are several spots where the plot might imply ways to do this. Might be one of Secret's terrible secrets, even.

--------------

Or you decide to jump out of the box and start swinging around wildly. Then it is time to explore something that's been kind of thin on the ground: dragons. We've got a creepy mathful topographical dungeon now, but still no dragons. We need some, so might as well make our own.

Now, dragons have interesting stats. Physical are absurd, but this isn't a problem that can be solved by crushing with large size combat rules. No, I'm interested in their high mental stats, higher than any normal human. One might even say, on the way to godly.

Problem is, you don't get mental stats of something you ploy'd into. But if Suze can really become a dragon, even just a /little/, then she's got some chances to bootstrap into godhood. The best shot seems to be just to get her to be a /hatchling/ dragon, somehow, then artificially age her a *lot*. Dragons gain stats with age, not with class levels, and that includes much, much better mental scores. I'm not sure a poly'd dragon would count, but maybe it would in a strict reading of the rules (or lack of them). Otherwise, you could do something like wish to take the form of a hatchling dragon with your original mind in it's body, running and expanding along with it's brain. Or find or make magic item to do one of those strategies. It shouldn't be impossible to do.

It is important to mention again that the point of the aging is to use the dragon's natural mental progression to improve your own stats. For that to happen, you need to be a dragon to the extent that you improve like they do. That also means you need a way to age a dragon that makes it actually mature. By strict rules, this isn't training or “growing up” somehow. You hit the age, the dragon gets the stats. We'll take advantage of that.

--------------

I see two options for aging. If you can get a room with compressed time magic on it, maybe using some custom plane antics, and have dragon-Suze spend 1,200 years of relative time in it, great. Make sure she brings a book to read. If not, I think it is time to talk something like [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/complete-divine--56/bestow-curse-greater--729/][Greater Curse]].

This specific spell allows for custom curses that are no more powerful than those given as examples. Any sane DM wouldn't allow negative spells to have strictly positive effects. So clearly, it would be possible here, as we're only using the rules as written. Personally, I'd figure out a way to bake it into a magic item that ages people who activate it. Here's how I'd justify that working to my DM:

One of the set effects for Greater Curse is “one ability score is reduced to 1.” Permanently.

Now, “venerable” age gives a character +-3 (point reduction, not penalty) to the three physical stats and +1 to the three mental ones. That's a total of -6 points of stat changes. The curse effect is therefore twice as bad as the sum effect being applied to a single standard adventure's average stat (13).+ *edit wrong in a couple of ways, whatever. It is actually even more years with this methodology and the right numbers. Adulthood to venerable is 55 human years, so I'd round conservatively, and thematically, and say an equal Greater Curse effect is making a total of 100 years of human aging happen per cast to the target of the spell.

To get Suze to 1,200 years old (greater wyrm) would require only 12 casts. Very doable for an item, still doable otherwise. Do note that it is touch only, and would still have to be available in someone's spell collection. Seems like something /someone/ should know, even if your infodump didn't contain it.

But on the /other/ hand, if you can get some kind of Chamber of Maximum Learning going, all the better. Age her to 1,200 or so as quickly as possible in a compressed time field while she studies. I do not have rules for this, but it should be possible. No rules in core D&D for going mad from lonesomeness or isolation, so that isn't a worry. But really, give the woman some books. Lots of books.

Suze needs her own infodump, if at all possible. This would be a good time for that. Focus on stuffing that genius brain with secret knowledge from the looted temple, any spells and engineering secrets your new “friends” might have squirreled away, everything and anything. She'll have plenty of time to sort through it.

Then find even more magical ways to get more knowledge into her. Try jamming mass-scryed knowledge in there too; total information awareness seems godly. Get all possible divination and knowledge magic running full-time, pour it into her brain. Maybe instead of a revived goddess of Secrets, you can get a dragon goddess of Knowledge out of it. That hits the right checkboxes on the “rule of cool” list.

--------------

Through whatever methods, assume by this time that you've got something like Suze the “all naturally grown” gold great wyrm, with at least 30s for mental stats (more, if you let her advance from her human stats).

Now kill her.

Okay, maybe that was a little overly dramatic. You'd need to bring her back, obviously. I haven't worked out the best way to do this, but you need to get dragon-brained Suze into a real human body again. And I think a trip through the afterlife with increased intelligence on death might help thematically firm that up, so loss of natural intelligence doesn't occur.

Remember, the point is that having a dragon with dragon stats isn't special. Having a human with the same mental age-growth curve of a max age dragon is very, very special. One might even say, quasi-godly. The end goal is a 30s mental stats Suze as a human again, all ready to do epic things in the world to to support their claim to divinity. Then you can start to power level her with class levels, if you haven't already.

Getting “natural,” permanent ability scores that should normally be impossible for a mortal human (int, wis, and cha, in this case) is a good start, but you should also do a crazy hard task: like learning all the spells from two civilizations, diving into the secrets of a dead god, experimenting with how to make the best coffee in the multiverse (/It is by the coffee of Suze that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion./), something along those lines. If you set up a compressed time chamber, that'll push her in that direction already. If not, it might be time to get /really/ creative.

I know this all looks unlikely, but it is also thematically appropriate and could be done without drawing divine attention with any one act. Like wishing to be a dragon god. Well, maybe the time stuff, hard to call. We haven't heard of any dragon gods yet I think, so the position might be open, easing the way a bit.

Hell, I'm half convinced just from writing this that she's a moderately old gold dragon in disguise /right now/. Wouldn't /that/ be convenient for this plan.

--------------

Even if my ideas have huge, commonly dismissed holes in them, hopefully it'll help get the juices flowing. Looking forward to more chapters. Keep up the good writing.

*tl;dr dress for the god you want to be -- so become an ancient dragon, then turn back into a human and complete some heroic actions; time chambers to train under 10000x Earth's time are a good idea; Suze is totally a dragon already, isn't she?*

** hooray, I thought of something shiny <3 Thank you for that compliment.

Here's something else I thought of:

What are the conditions for de-sanctifying holy water? Obviously if you drink holy water, you don't have holy pee. But it can sit on the shelf indefinitely without losing its beatitude, right? And presumably putting things like flavorings in it wouldn't have any effect (so long as the flavorings weren't cursed or antithetic to the deity blessing the water, I guess.)

If you evaporate holy water, does it lose its beatitude? Steam is still the /exact same water,/ just moved around. It's not turned into something else like when you drink the water. Hell, if the water is blessed by a deity with a fire/heat affinity, it should probably rightly make the water /stronger./

Boiling holy water sounds like a helluva anti-undead weapon to me; it'd fill the air with holy steam and take out any of the fliers. Or you could pressurize holy steam and fill up a portable hole with it; slap it onto a board or something and you have a 1-shot steam cannon that should blast away most undead.

But that's all tactical thinking. Thinking more strategically... How does that holy water maker that the Deorsi have work? Does it bless whatever water it touches, or does it have some sort of HW/volume limit?

If you dropped it in the ocean, could you theoretically bless the whole damn thing, if you left it in long enough? If you lowered it on an anchor into a major tidal cycle, you could probably bless most of the water in the ocean. Not only would it kill any undead walking along the ocean floor, but it'd also mean that all the rain in the world is now /holy rain./ Which would probably put a damper (heh) on the undead nations.

--------------

Edit: I~DE~AAA!

The Deorsi portal things that link two places together can be turned on and off with a command word or something, right?

Make yourself a classical infinite-fall tunnel with two of them, with a third (deactivated) portal-half between them. You can then drop things into the tunnel (via brief activation of the Input/Output portal) and then just let the object fall forever, picking up velocity and damage. You can then have an instant surprise orbital strike wherever you can get the I/O portal half. Turn it on, thing goes flying straight to the ground, boom. If you found a way to suck the air out of the falling tunnel, there'd be no terminal velocity and you could even accelerate things to /trans-relativistic/ speeds! Relativistic Kill Vehicle Portal Strike.

Or you could sink one portal half to the bottom of the ocean. Then whenever you activate the other half, you'd have a million-PSI water cannon that could pulverize steel.

OOO! Does the holy water chalice have to /touch/ water to bless it, or does it just have to be 'within the cup'? Depending on how it works, you could make it a part of a portal chain to the ocean (very carefully sized and positioned portals to prevent damage to the artifact, of course.) Then you'd have a /Holy Firehose of Utmost Annihilation./

Further idea: Can Deorsi spell engines be keyed to a summoning spell? If you had a magic tunnel that spat out a monster on demand, you'd be able to make much more scalable training arenas than Jake's current design.

*** Hm. AFAIK, Rules As Written (RAW) are silent on how you de-sanctify holy water, so it's up to DM (or, in this case, me) decision. I have a question in over at the GitP forums to see if anyone knows of a RAW answer.

I like the steam cannon idea. I was trying to do something similar a while ago: put so much water in a Portable Hole that it would fuse and turn into a 1-shot plasma cannon. Sadly, you can't get it dense enough in a useful period of time without using demiplane tricks that I've already outlawed.

The Deorsi chalice is a 'Sacred Vessel', from page 37 of the Book of Exalted Deeds. The exact wording is: "Water placed within it becomes holy water" so, no, it doesn't have to touch the chalice. Interesting point, and one that I will definitely try to (ab)use if I can think of a way.

The water has to be /in/ the chalice, not just touching water that is in the chalice, so blessing the whole ocean would require pushing every drop of water through something the size of a punch bowl. Theoretically possible but not practical. (Although I /really/ like the idea of holy rain, and have actually been working on an idea that is somewhat similar.)

The Deorsi portals are Ring Gates. Sadly, they only have a 100 mile range, they don't have an offswitch, and they DO have a mass limit: they can only pass 100 pounds of stuff per day. This removes most of the abuses that you can do with them. But! There's a loophole: if something doesn't go all the way through, it doesn't count towards the mass limit. e.g., if you reach your arm through and then pull your arm back, it doesn't count against the mass limit. So, here's what you do: take an iron bar, put it partway through. Move the rings until the ends of the bar touch. Weld the ends together. You now have a no-ended iron bar. Drop it, and it will fall forever, generating effectively infinite kinetic energy (it's possible, although difficult, to remove the air from around it). The problem is that you can't move the darn thing once you start it (because if the bar touches the edges of the rings it will break them), and you can't get it out of the rings.

The interesting thing about that is that (per my ruling), the two rings are /mathematically the same point/. So, if ring A is parallel to the ground and ring B is perpendicular to the ground...what happens to the bar?

As an aside, there are 'Planar Ring Gates' too. Same thing, except they are 10' wide, have a mass limit of 10,000 pounds / day, and only function when the two rings are on different planes.

As regards damaging the Sacred Vessel, there is a 6th level arcane spell called Hardening. It permanently increases the hardness of an object, and the effects stack. You can make the Vessel as touch as you like. (Which they've done; that's why it can manage having 10 Decanters of Endless Water pointed at it without breaking.)

Spell engines with summoning: yes, you can. Interestingly, however, you get no experience for summoned creatures, because the ability to summon them is factored into the summoner's XP value. (The way it's normally expressed is 'you don't get extra XP if the caster throws a Fireball at you, so why would you get extra XP if he throws a Summon Monster at you'.) Personally, I think this rules is a complete crock, but it is the rules.

There's an out though: a monster created by Polymorph is /not/ summoned. So, set up a spell engine that polymorphs houseflies into, say, a wolf. The trainees beat the crap out of the wolf and gain XP.

The solution is to turn the chalice into a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle][Klein bottle]]. You can move from the "inside" to the "outside" without crossing an edge, so it's inside /is/ its outside. All you really need is a way to alter the chalice and that fiddly bit where you technically cross into the fourth dimension, but after that you're good to go! (I suppose technically it could be argued that a Klein bottle has no inside or outside at all, in which case the artifact would be kaput, but it really depends on how those words are interpreted.)

**** You might still be able to use the ring gates for an oceanic water cannon. You can chain together gate pairs to get around range restrictions. With careful enough positioning of tiny buried gates, I'm sure you could make a surprising amount of the entire world be within '100 miles' of everything else :P. After that, you just need a Hardened gate cover with a quick-release valve or something. Then you could instantly summon 100 pounds of (potentally holy, if the Sacred Vessel is involved) water through a tiny corridor once per day. Not /as/ effective, but still pretty damn powerful, and you could equip squads with them over time.

If you have an infinitely falling no-ended bar, could you teleport it out with [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Teleport_Object][teleport object]] or something? That might be a way of getting it out of the rings without touching them, for use in orbital/relativistic strikes.

That polymorph thing sounds brilliant. That also makes me wonder something, though. Divination rules are that you can only track people, not places or things, right?

What qualifies as 'people'?

Like, if you used inteligence-damping equipment and spells on a person enough to drive them to 0 intelligence or below, would they start counting as an animal instead? Would that make them invisible to scrying, and controllable by druids? You could potentially put some sort of druidic post-hypnotic command or geas or something on them, for them to do a bunch of stuff and then shuck the anti-brain gear. That way, you could move people about on the surface without risk of being spotted.

Attacking the problem from the other direction, what if you make a sentient artifact? Does /that/ count as a person? Can you use it as a scry-spy? You could make a grid of buried gold sentient rings over the area you want to watch.

Also, I had a thought about the current brute-force anti-teleport locating weakness thing: What if you move the town /deep enough underground/ that it doesn't effect the surface?

Water cannon: could work, but would a lot of fiddling. Probably not the most efficient tactic, although it makes a nice surprise.

Scrying: there is a Scry Location spell that will locate places instead of people. Unlike other Scrying, it will even reach other planes!

Int 0 as animal: I would have to check, but I believe if any of your abilities to to 0 you are either incapacitated or dead. Regardless, I would still treat them as people, not animals.

Sentient artifacts: that's...an interesting idea. I think I would rule that they are things, not people, but I would need to think on it.

****** Hrm, if it effects your decision, then according to [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Intelligent_Items#Intelligent_Items][the wiki]], intelligent items should be treated as the sentient construct race. So if constructs are vulnerable to scrying, one could argue that intelligent items are as well. But ultimately yeah, that'd probably be DM's call. And it's less useful of a tactic if you have Scry Location anyway. Could be useful as a means of tracking a mind-blanked mark you tricked into picking up the ring, maybe? Mind-blank says that scrying targeted at the blanked person fails, but says nothing about the sentient ring in their backpack (Air Bud rules lawyering FTW :P)

****** Idea!

Okay so, those wall-of-force armatures Jake used to mass-manufacture cannons from iron blocks...

Let's say you had one of those that was set up to kill a monster coming out of a polymorph engine. Like, if the exit of the engine was laced with wall of force razor wire, and there was a springboard trap on the floor of the engine set to a trigger held by the trainee, which splatted the polymorphed monster into it.

People get XP by indirectly killing things all the time in TYE. The landguards just got a ton of levels via cannon bombardment. So I think there's a strong case for the WoF armatures being a valid way to factory-farm XP.

You might be able to have some lucky trainee killing one monster per /round/ for however long it takes to no longer get EXP from it. And they'd be able to kill stuff /way/ above their pay grade, since the only consideration is that you don't want to polymorph up something that can survive the death trap.

--------------

Second idea:

Freeze holy water (presuming freezing it doesn't desanctify it.) Since it's now a sold object, you can cast Polymorph Any Object on it. (PAO doesn't specifically /say/ the object has to be solid, but best be safe. Besides, it'll give you a duration bonus.)

Polymorph it into dry ice, or nitrogen ice, or some other solid that sublimates into a gas fairly quickly. Then you can fire the ice blocks out of a cannon, and let them dot the field. Or pump an undead stronghold full of the mist from the evaporating ice, or fill portable holes up with the ice to make mobile smoke emitters, or something.

The field will quickly be full of (seemingly inoccuous, to the undead) mist. But as soon as the polymorph wears off, they'll be /covered/ in holy water. The ones with open wounds will have the stuff /inside/ of them. Since you're converting a cold solid to a cold solid, you'd have a duration factor of +5, so you'd have 12 hours to bomb as many undead clusters as possible before the polymorph wears off and they (painfully) realize what you're doing.

Oo, or even better! Even if the thing being polymorphed has to be a solid single object, does the polymorph /result/ have to be solid? If not, you could polymorph holy ice into carbon monoxide, or some other colorless odorless gas. Have a stealth team sneak ring gates or portable holes or something full of the stuff in, and you can secretly 'poison' high-value targets.

Alternately: polymorphing holy water into blood and transfusing it into the feeding stock of babies may be a valid vampire assassination technique. That one has some potential stealth re-applications, too. The vampires have to eat, and so long as you have alignment-switched vampires as sleeper agents, they'll have a hard time predicting who is poisoning their supplies. Very good demoralizer, classic guerilla tactic without the usual fallout of poisoning a well.

******* Hm.

I'd be inclined to say that when you PAO something, you have changed its fundamental nature, and thus it is no longer holy water anymore. This "change of fundamental nature" is why, when you PAO into a dragon, you get all of the dragon's special abilities.

Also, note that if you polymorph water ice into dry ice, you actually have permanent duration -- every single one of the modifiers applies, giving you a duration factor of +13.

You couldn't PAO it into blood, but you could definitely have the infants drink it, or inject it into them. That would work.

'Cause then you could PAO a drop of pond scum into an ape (lasts only a few minutes since very dissimilar) And then PAO the /ape/ into a human being (Very similar, should be permanent.)

The PAO scum->ape wears off, but you don't /have/ an ape for it to wear off on. So... Which spell takes precedence?

Or y'know, some other chain of polymorph to get whatever thing you want an infinite supply of that you can't get at the marketplace.

And yeah, that (usually temporary) fundamental change of nature is kinda why I thought you could use it for holy water surprise attacks. The trick would be seeing if the water regains its beatitude when it unmorphs. So you'd have to avoid dry ice, obviously, but maybe nitrogen ice or some other volatile would work.

************** I had a thought: Why does the XP all have to go to /people/?

We've got an infinite pool of xp now, and it looks like magic items aren't something you can just buy on the marketplace in TYE (is there a name for this world?), even with infinite gold. Why not use some of it to farm out magic items en mass?

It's quite possible for a person other than the item crafter to [[https://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060526a][transfer XP to a magic item.]] The only solid restrictions I can see are that it has to be a willing transfer, and it has to be to an item that the transfer-er is proficient in. And you need a cheapo magic item that just about any caster can make in a day.

So while you can't use a commoner for this, you could just use a trainee fighter for weapons/armor, a trainee wizard for scrolls and wands, a trainee bard for Vuvuzelas of Supreme Annoyance +20, etc.

And I do mean trainee. The lower the level, the more bonus exp they get for killing stuff above their challenge-rating with the WoF armature. If you have a level 1 peon slaying a dragon per round and putting all of it into items (keeping them at level 1) then you should be able to build up /absurd/ amounts of exp right quickly. Make some truly expensive stuff, outfit everyone in your army with +5 swords, whatever.

Can't believe you gave /Afi/ the diplomancer, this is gonna be /awesomely/ daunting.

On that note, I actually had an even /more/ munchkinly variation pop into my head. I don't think it has a /high/ probability of working, but it's such a wonderfully evil thought that I just had to share it.

The main limitation of the WoF armature training is that eventually the monsters get just too darn strong, and they can /survive/ complete dismemberment. I imagine there are some pretty dern high challenge ratings to be found there, but it's still a hard limit to how high a level you can reach. Not exactly getting-yelled-at-by-gods territory.

But consider this:

Exp you get while polymorphed into another form, even via PAO, is still experience you keep when you morph back, right? You might earn more or less exp for a kill than your baseline form, depending on how the transformation effects your ECL, but still.

And that includes non-sentient forms. If you PAO yourself into a zombie and the zombie kills a bunch of stuff, you keep that xp. Or if you PAO into a boulder that rolls down a hill and kills a bunch of monsters.

So what if... You PAO yourself into an iron ring, and you have your mage friend try and craft you into a magic item?

They don't /complete/ the crafting, that'd just make you revert the changes as if you were damaged or something. Instead, they hook you up to the WoF xp machine, and they let it pump you full of tens of thousands of xp.

They're just... putting it all into an item. An item that happens to be you.

And I don't see any rules forbidding /multiple people/ feeding xp to the same magic item. Hell, the rulebook even explicitely mentions an idea of an evil sorcerer chaining multiple people to his armor of evil evilness. So you could have banks of /hundreds/ of level 1 peons feeding you.

Jake can't use that on any of his troops, of course. Even if it worked, it'd /immediately/ make the gods break out the wide-angle destruction beam. But mein gott, can you /imagine/ a level 100+ Duncan?

I don't think I buy the part about being turned into a proto-magic item, fed XP, and then turned back. XP for crafting isn't the same as XP earned for level advancement.

Of particular interest seems to be the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#manualofBodilyHealth][Manual]] and [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#tomeofClearThought][Tome]] series of items. They're a set of 6 magical items, 1 for each of the base stats, which permanently endow an "Intrinsic Bonus" of up to +5 for that stat.

Permanent. And intrinsic. Meaning it's pretty much just added to your ability score. Fundamental change of nature, like PAO. You can get more skill points from int and everything.

+That makes me think that unlike other bonuses, it can be stacked.+

+That seems like prime getting-yelled-at-by-gods territory to me, but /oh/ Jake will be able to make himself so much better before he gets there. And he could probably use some Wis to round out his Int, anyway.+

Disregard that, intrinsic bonuses can only go up to [[http://dnd.steinhour.net/General_DnD/3E_Charts_and_Tables/3E_Magic_Item_Notes.html][+5 for each stat.]] But still, even if it isn't uberstackable, that's +5 to each stat that Jake can give to an entire /army./ Plus another substantial boost he can give to himself, since he /could/ probably do with some Wisdom (he probably has the max +5 int from wishes)

It's a slower stat-gain regimen than wishes, since each tome takes 48 hours over at least 6 days to read, and probably something like a month to make. But if ever Jake gets some breathing room, he can just set tens of thousands of mages working in parallel on a massive set.... (I'd say go to the astral plane to farm them out, but didn't you say something about not wanting time dilation effects for planar travel, since that's too easily breakable?)

Also potentially good:

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#dustofDryness][Dust of Dryness]]: Stores up to 100 gallons of water in a marble-sized pellet, all of which can be released at once when thrown. Holy water bombs? Holy water bombs.

So many applications, from custom-shaping the battlefield, to simply using them as a farmable source of adamantine for other projects. Presuming you can't just buy adamantine golem parts on the market, anyway.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#lyreofBuilding][Lyre of Building]]: Magically reinforces buildings once per day for 30 minutes, potential for hiding the town in an indestructible box if you build 48 of them, maybe.

Depending on how multiple lyres' powers overlap, may allow a bardic symphony to play an entire battlefield into one massive constantly-firing trap. Or to make /giant music-powered stone golems the size of a mountain./ Even if that wouldn't work, has tons of potential for moving the town.

I think it's not the same water, which means the positive energy in the holy water is lost.

Lyre of Building -- it's not exactly clear to me what that 'reinforce buildings' ability does. It might mean "you play this thing and the affected building is completely un-harmable for the next 30 minutes", or it might mean "the building heals every round for 30 minutes".

******************** Idea: If you had a sacred vessel on the field, you could load it up with dust of dryness pellets and have some sort of mechanism to burst them. At the moment of being burst, all the water from the pellets will be 'inside' the vessel, and so will be blessed. Instant holy lake!

... Though it might be supercompressed into holy plasma.

Let's math!

You said the sacred vessel was 'the size of a punchbowl' right? I'd guess that at around 3 gallons' volume, fair?

According to woflram alpha, [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number+of+marbles+fit+in+3+gallons][you can fit about 6400 marbles into 3 gallons]]. Might vary a bit depending on the shape of the chalice, size of the pellets, etc.

Let's first imagine that the water escapes somehow without being significantly heated/compressed. So it all stays water. We'll even assume that it just floods out instead of being largely aerosolized.

if the water has to be 1 foot deep to be dangerous to undead, then it'd be dangerous until it spread out into boxes of 5*5*1, which each take up about [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5*5*1+foot+box+volume+in+gallons][187 gallons]]. 640000/187 is about 3422 squares. [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=radius+of+circle+with+area+3422][Giving us a radius of about 33 squares]] .

Okay, so not so much instant holy lake. Instant holy decorative pond?

Good thing that's probably not what would happen.

640,000 gallons of water. In a 3 gallon container, however briefly.

/yikes/

I have /no idea/ how to do the math for trying to compress that much water into that little amount of space. I do know that it takes an /obscene/ amount of pressure to force water into any greater density. Like, the entire weight of the ocean is enough to /barely/ make the water at the bottom /slightly/ denser than the water at the top from pressure alone.

My gut tells me that the pressure wave of all that water expanding at once is probably gonna be much more dangerous than the fine misting of holy water. Probably more economical to use a non-sacred (and bigger! Muahaha!) vessel, save the risk of destroying your Sacred one.

I think I like this idea /much/ more than the old '100 gallon holy water bomb' idea!

Of course, 6400 dusts of dryness would cost 5,440,000 gold. So even if Jake could buy it on the market, he'd probably have to get the commoners mass-exploiting the ladder trick to make that much in a reasonable time period.

But it's still fun to imagine making a nuke out of /water/.

Wrap it in a thick steel/iron/whatever casing. 100 gallons of water in a 1/10'th-inch sphere should be pretty catastrophic levels of pressure, all released at once when thrown.

******************** Okay, I've tried to get myself off the PAO-er-pack of ideas, and get to non-phylactery anti-lich strategies. Preferably ones that could be done from a distance, since Afi could probably ask reality itself to turn against someone and /succeed/, with his diplomancy.

The only idea I've had so far is this:

A lich cannot (as far as I know from RAW) choose to abandon a body and return to the phylactery by any means except suicide. If you can trap their body in a strong anti-magic trap, and keep them suitably restrained, you can keep them as sealed evil in a can.

Extension of that idea: If you somehow get a lich's body to near the event horizon of a black hole, or somehow find a way to launch them to trans-relativistic velocities, then it may be tens of thousands to millions of years before they return, even though for them it's only a couple of seconds to cast greater teleport.

As to the fussy details: the Teleport Trap spell doesn't have the range, unfortunately. (And, due to range and planar rules, you can't use the (Planar) Ring Gates to extend it.). Still, you could use the Baleful Teleport spell to make it work. You'd need to use a lot of them simultaneously; the spell has a Will save, so Afi would probably need to roll a 1.

You could always find some safely-distant part of space and /make/ a black hole. PAO up sufficient qualities of neutronium or something, so it collapses into a hole that will be stable for a few millenia?

Make a black hole: Heh, that would actually work. As I remarked in story, there's a limit on the size of the source object but not on the size of the output object. There's no reason you couldn't say "PAO: grain of sand to enough neutronium to form a singularity".

As far as I know, undead are not immune to Imprisonment, although the touch attack and Will save part are troubling. (Although, if you know the target's name and facts about its life then it gets a -4 on the save.)

A while ago I started a thread over on the Giant In The Playground forums asking [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?306515-How-to-kill-someone-permanently]["How do you kill someone permanently in 3.5?"]] There were a lot of suggestions...really a lot. Most of them were outside the ruleset that I'm using and some I just didn't agree would work, but there were several that would. One that I found especially interesting was: Take your victim into a Portable Hole. Cast Imprisonment on him. Get out of the Portable Hole and throw a Bag of Holding into it in order to destroy the Hole. You can only be released from Imprisonment if "a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place" -- and that location no longer exists.

************************** There is one potential problem with PAO'ing your black hole though: you're obviously not gonna get a permanent duration first cast. Probably only gonna get a 20 minute duration. And /whose 20 minutes do you get?/

If it's 20 minutes by the reference frame of the caster, then there's no problem, just cast PAO neutronium->neutronium. Or maybe PAO singularity->singularity (technically the source object would be infinitely small now :P)

But if it's 20 minutes in the reference frame of the object, then you're gonna have it instantly disappear. Only potential way to make it work is to do tricks with initiative, double-PAO'ing the neutronium before it collapses.

And that imprisonment trick is /eeevilll./ Major props to the person who came up with that.

Re: Initiative-slipping an antimatter blast:

I thought of readied actions too, but I think the exact wording in RAW is that a readied action happens just /before/ the trigger, interrupting it. So even with a condition 'when Al finishes the spell,' the actual occurrence would happen just before he finishes. Which could be problematic if Al passes the check to finish casting anyway.

You /might/ be able to do readied actions with the condition 'antimatter detonation' though. That might get you to interrupt the antimatter while it exists, but before it kills you.

Although...hm. With enough caster-level boosts -- and I mean REALLY enough -- it might be practical.

You're right about readied actions and yes, 'I teleport when the antimatter explodes' would work in my interpretation.

In point of fact, destroying someone permanently is a really hard thing to do -- even if you wipe out their soul, a god or enough Wishes could Ship of Theseus the person back into existence -- create an exact copy of their body and a mind with all the same memories and skills.

The only way that anyone came up with to wipe someone out permanently is the Ritual of Crucimigration. It's a ritual that you use to become an undead; it's quite unpleasant. You have to petition for it, then lose a level, then pay 1000 XP. "if the level loss and the 1,000 XP cost drains a creature to 0 XP or less, it is destroyed, turned to dust, and can never he raised or revived again using any means." *any* means -- that includes divine intervention. So:

- Dominate Person to make them petition
- Make them play patty cake with a vampire and then fail all their saving throws so the level loss becomes permanent and they are level 2.
- They lose a level (putting them at level 1) and can't pay the 1000 XP.
- Boom! They are permadead.

**************************** I don't suppose that jibe about the effected object being infinitely small held any water?

Technically speaking, 10^{19} is more than enough for a black hole. In fact, two protons are enough, if you smash them together energetically enough. Gravitational singularities are a function of /density,/ not just sheer mass. Mass just makes it easier, since you have gravity working with you to squeeze it all down, and the Schwarzschild radius becomes bigger. Maybe if you had the neutronium sphere surrounded by antimatter explosives (my, isn't that a fun sentence <3), it'd be enough to squeeze it down?

The only problem with low-mass black holes is that they're short lived. The lower a black hole's mass, the more hawking radiation it gives off, and so the faster it will dissolve. A 2-proton black hole would exist for such a short amount of time that it barely counted as existing at all. That's the real reason the large hadron collider was never a danger; if it /did/ somehow make a tiny black hole, the hole would just instantly dissolve.

The Chandrasekhar Limit is a limit on how massive a non-rotating white dwarf star can be before there's no stable possible configuration and it /always/ collapses into either a black hole, or a neutron star, depending on conditions. You could consider it a minimum mass for natural black holes (though I imagine the pressure of stars going supernova means there's a few natural ones out there under the limit). It clocks in at 1.4 stellar masses: 2.765*10^{30} kg

Thankfully, wolfram alpha [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=hawking+radiation&a=*FS-_**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.T-.*BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M--&f2=2.765*10%5E30&f=BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M_2.765*10%5E30&a=*FVarOpt.1-_**-.***BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.Q--.**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.J---.*--][has a function for this]]. It says that a black hole with a mass of the chandrasekhar limit would have a temperature of 4.4*10^{-5} millikelvin. Pretty dern close to absolute zero. So the hole would only lose mass very slowly, and would last for billions of years.

A black hole with mass 10^{19} [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=hawking+radiation&a=*FS-_**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.T-.*BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M--&f2=10%5E19+kg&f=BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M_10%5E19+kg&a=*FVarOpt.1-_**-.***BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.Q--.**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.J---.*--][has a temperature of 12270 kelvin]]. That's a high temperature, and it would only get hotter as it loses mass. But it's releasing that mass as pure energy here, and since E=mc^{2,} we can reach pretty good temperatures before we lose significant amounts of mass per second. Thing would probably be stable for at least a few thousand years.

Set it up, and throw in a few dozen more neutronium spheres, and you got yourself +a stew+ a black hole that should last a good couple hundred million years at least.

Of course, if you could phrase the request like "Sphere of neutronium with volume 56 cubic meters of suchandsuch density" then you could make arbitrary amounts of mass and still be able to double-pao it before it collapses. That'd get around the problem neatly enough.

Also, when you have them petrified, you can do better than just keeping them sitting around as a statute:

- Flesh to Stone
- Soften Earth and Stone (turn them into clay)
- Add a lot of water so they become mud
- Purify Water so they become just pure water
- Pour the water into a river

Petrified is not dead, so they don't respawn from their phylactery. But they no longer have a defined location from which they can be turned back. Wish does not contain a clause that would fix this situation, although the catchall "you can try for stronger effects but it might be dangerous" would let you do it at GM's discretion. Miracle (aka "the strictly better version of Wish") probably could recover them, especially if you paid the 5000 XP for a major request.

*************************************** Okay so, let's see if we can design a less /offensively anticlimactic/ version of this. (For my money, anticlimax is /proper/ munchkinry against overpowered foes; you save the flash and boom for when you're having fun with threats you could hypothetically handle by standard means.)

When a lich's body is destroyed, its soul returns to the phylactery, right? And by that I mean, the soul is physically inhabiting the phylactery, it's actually /there/.

Well... Doesn't that technically mean that /Afi/ is right there on his phylactery? We can't target the Phylactery with wishes, but we /can/ target Afi.

So let's try this:

First, design a sentient magical item. It's lawful neutral and named Boomer. It takes the form of a hard-leather steel-toed boot.

Boomer's one and only ability is that, on command, it will cast PAO on its steel toe, turning it into a couple grams of antimatter.

You have a caster ready an action: Upon (and therefore /exactly/ before) Boomer completing its PAO, they will Wish/Miracle Boomer onto Afi's head. Since Boomer will complete its action /on the same round,/ Afi has absolutely no chance of teleporting it away.

You have now killed Afi via [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFldBVWFgWo][Boot-To-The-Head.]]

Then you just wish up /another/ Boomer, and /do the same thing./ Goes straight to Afi again... and since Afi's in his phylactery....

(or if you only want to use two wishes; find a way to kill Afi's body by more standard means, then use Boomer. But phylacteries don't really have a Head to Boot.)

And maybe the gods could step in right after and put a ban on making sentient artifacts that only exist as curse bombers or... something. They're gods, there's gotta be /something/ about this that offends them arbitrarily.

The double tap, though... you're not targeting the phylactery. You're targeting Afi's very-much-unprotected soul, which is just /residing/ in/on/around the phylactery.

The cat has the phylactery tied to it, Afi's soul is in the phylactery. The cat has been Mind Blanked, so it and all of its stuff are protected -- that includes the phylactery and, by extension, Afi's soul. The cat has also been Temporal Stasis'd, so nothing can hurt it or its stuff, including an antimatter blast.

It's debatable whether Wish can teleport you to a MB'd critter; the spell needs to find its target, which is information gathering, but YOU aren't gaining information.

Well, if you can get an antimatter bomb /to/ it, then the blast will pretty well reveal its location, and completely disable all its defenses. All you need is to look for the cat in the center of the crater. You have 1d4 days to get through the army of undead and cast Freedom on it. Tricky but not impossible, potentially worth a go even if we can't find a way around it.

But let's try and find a way around it anyway :)

Okay so.... What if we studded Boomer with outwardly facing Beholder eyes? (The sending mage casts Wish from beyond 150 feet. So long as they have gear to enhance their eyesight like you used to detonate those explosive runes on the super-bouncy-balls-of-righteous-undead-slaying, should work fine.) Or we give Boomer the ability to emit antimagic that doesn't effect itself, same difference really. Would their antimagic emissions disable the stasis while it's within the field?

Back to getting around the Mind Blank...

Wishaport doesn't seem to work like any other sort of teleportation. It has /no/ chance of failing, It does /not/ rely on 'familiarity' in any way, and it has no sort of range or plane restrictions. I'd say that there's a good chance Wishaport is a special ability of Wish itself, rather than wish mimicking/combining spells.

You're reshaping reality itself so that someone is 'there, and not here.' You might not need to be able to find your target to do that. Wish just puts it there /anyway./

After all, Wish can't /tell/ you where Afi is, but that doesn't mean that Wish doesn't /know/ where he is.

Finally, the text of Wish says that it can put things down in an area 'regardless of local conditions.' So maybe one of the 'conditions' it can get around is lack of information about the target.

******************************************* Idea:

If Wishaporting an item to someone works through mind blank by -any- of the means I've tried to justify (or if you can just locate Afi through a Loki question sufficiently enough to target him, or something....)

What if you Wishaport a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trapTheSoul.htm][Trap The Soul]] spelltrigger token into Afi's hand. Does that count as tricking him into picking it up? 'Cause that shit don't have a save, and it /sucks the soul right out./

--------------

Secondary idea:

Wish can be used to mimic just about any spell. But does it stick to the range restrictions of those spells? Like say if my friend Bob on the other continent casts Sending to me saying "Omg soooo many dire wereleprechauns, buffz plz," can I Wish to cast Grease on Bob's clothing so he can get to properly wrestling them?

If Wish can cast spells at great range, then do all the /other/ usual range-y things of Wish apply? For example, can Wish cast across planes, or to targets that are usually impossible?

If so, it may be possible to directly target Afi's soul /while it's still schlepping around in his body./ Potential there, if you can find a way to /destroy his soul directly/ through some spell or another.

--------------

Tertiary idea:

Get Afi into a portable hole by some means or another. Dimension Lock the portable hole once he's in (or before if you aren't using some manner of teleport trap.) Double-PAO into the hole, turning a mote of dust or oxygen atom or something into a hyperdense neutronium sphere that will collapse into a black hole, and close the portable hole as a readied action against the sphere collapsing into a singularity.

Afi's now trapped in a dimension-locked demiplane with an extreme gravity well making time there run superslow thanks to relativistic effects. If mind blank /does/ beat all manner of wishaport, then he's gonna be trapped there until he realizes that and takes his own mind blank off. Even if that just takes one round (his time) he's gonna be in there for tens of thousands of years (our time), at /least./

I /think/ that should make Afi unreachable to anything but a really determined god. So long as you can keep tabs on that closed hole, or find a way to dissolve it without destroying the demiplane. (Put it in a box tied to a mind-blanked temporal stasis'd cat, and thow the cat into /another/ DimLocked black hole, but just in space instead of in a portable hole this time?)

Any ideas on adding godproofing?

******************************************** Hm. The RAW on TtS is "picks up or accepts the object". 'Accepts' implies a conscious choice, so wishaporting it into his hand doesn't count. 'Picks up' does not require the same degree of conscious choice, but it does require that he take a move action to put his hand on it and lift it. Again, no go for teleporting it into his hand.

Maybe you could trick one of his minions into giving it to him...or make a piece of paper be the trigger object, wishaport it near him, with a Magic Mouth to say "We surrender! Here's the terms!" Maybe. You would think a lich who's lived for thousands of years would be a little more paranoid than to pick up random objects that just came out of nowhere.

Maybe you could wishaport into his lab, and enchant one of his pens as the trigger object?

Wish 'mimics' a spell, meaning that it's exactly the same. Same range.

*********************************************** I thought on it a little more:

Damage from gravity is probably a type of [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/environment.htm][environmental hazard]]. Damage from those is determined by the round. I'm not sure if that means each character rolls for damage on their round, or if the environment itself has a 0 initiative roll for everybody at the start of each round.

Either way, /Afi will survive at least until his round comes./ Unless he has the exact same initiative as the people who cast the PAOs and closed the hole, then he will survive for at least a fraction of a second, and possibly as long as 4.999(repeating) seconds, before he even has a chance of taking damage. If he's beyond the event horizon, where time dilation approaches infinity relative to outside the horizon, then a fraction of a second is /well/ over enough :)

For avoiding this process destroying the world:

Once the portable hole is closed, it's sealed off. You don't have to worry about the singularity devouring the world unless someone opens the portable hole again.

So long as you close the portable hole /before the effects of the collapsing neutronium reach the entrance of the portable hole,/ you're fine. You can do that easily via a readied action. Like I said, gravity propagates /merely/ at the speed of light. It's got nothing on readied actions, which /always/ pre-empt the event, /no matter what./

True, closing the gate would solve the problem, and a readied action would happen before gravity reached you. You can't teleport across planar boundaries so you couldn't teleport out. You could Plane Shift. I guess you could even just have the Big Strong Fighter pull you out.

That is HIGHLY Munchkiny. So much that even I look askance at it. It's also utterly epic.

Well, if you don't need to /see/ the trigger, then you shouldn't have to rely on any sort of range. After all, you could ready a counterspell against a mage 100 feet away, no? What's to say you couldn't ready one against a mage 100 kilometers away? You aren't seeing them complete their action either way, and yet the readied action still fires.

Therefore, say you introduce two commoners to each other. You then hire them both on, so that they spend all day readying an action every turn: They will repeat anything the other commoner is about to say.

You've now got yourself an infinite range, faster-than-light radio with infinite uses per day, and no silly word limits like Sending. Just tell one commoner to repeat what you say to them, and have someone listening on the other end!

Or you could cart around a commoner and use them as an omni-radar! Have them ready an action every turn that they'll point in the direction of Afi's base if they get within 10 quadrillion feet of it, or something. They'll be like a compass directly pointing you to Afi's base, so long as it's on the same plane/planet.

If you ready an action to move but your character is immobilized the action would just fail. Nor could you ready an action to cast wish as a fighter, neither is a legal action for the character to take. Readied action gives you no special ability to do things you cannot normally do.

Same thing here, if you cannot make a spot/listen check you cant relay a message, if you dont have the knowledge you cant point to afi's location.

What is abusable, however, are trigger conditions. By RAW and a broad definition of condition, I could argue that Afi being in /this/ map grid is the condition to trigger my action to point at a specific map grid. Pointing at a predesignated spot doesnt require anything special-the trigger is doing all the work here. If the DM allows that trigger, thats legal (if stupid).

This gets dangerously close into the old "it doesnt say I /cant/ cast spells while dead" area though if you allow such a definition. Sadly not even the rules compendium really goes into the definition of valid conditions so it is ultimately up to you.

You couldnt actually PAO into a one-legged troll or a purple-haired woman for instance, neither would fall into the the norm for their race. It doesnt even always give you the ability to /fully/ use all the limbs of your new form actually, just check out alter self and attacking with multiple limbs. Its not a finely controlled atomic restructuring machine; its a magic spell in a poorly defined, badly written rules system.

Think of it more like a command for the universe's command prompt, not a logically consistent phenomena. You can pass it certain variables and it will run with it. If you try to pass it invalid or uncalled for variables it will, at best, ignore them if not error out entirely. PAO allows X, Y, and any value of Z; it wont take A, B, or C.

*************************************************************** Actually, speaking of alter self... [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/polymorphAnyObject.htm][PAO]] says it more or less mimics Polymorph, and [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/polymorph.htm][Polymorph]] says it imitates Alter Self....

And [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/alterSelf.htm][/Alter Self/]] says this:

#+begin_quote
  You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
#+end_quote

So.... All you have to do is realize that a few extra folds and connections in the brain is a relatively /minor/ physical quality, no?

Also, PAO says:

#+begin_quote
  Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form. If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.
#+end_quote

Which implies it really /does/ mess with your head on more than just a 'command' level. It grants you the intelligence and other properties of the form you take. So maybe you can specify just /what/ that intelligence implies.

As for int bonus, what it implies to me is that it physically changes your brain, not that it imparts any knowledge you specifc. The rules say you get a new int score, it doesnt say you get a whole bunch of knowledge along with it nor does it say you can specify anything about what that int score means.

But if we allow this, we could just as easily argue that being a Nth level wizard is just a matter of knowledge and thus PAO gives us infinite levels of wizard. Or that since any ability can be expressed in a minor physical quality, we can have any ability we want through shapechange as long as we make it (ex) or (su).

This is going down the rabbit hole that leads to arguing about what you can and cant do while dead. Ultimately 3.5 is not a ridgid, properly definined, consistent system. You have to use common sense at some point to fill in the gaps. You can rip apart literally anything if you are willing to ignore common sense enough. If we do not accept that the rules tell us what we can do rather than what we cant do, then the entire system instantly snaps in half.

****************************************************************** Thats kinda the dirty little secret of RAW though, there is no such thing. RAW in the strictest term does not actually make a workable system; its self-contradictory and lacks definition. As in, it fails at even the simplest levels, way way below what we have been talking about. If it was a program it would fail to compile rather than just have bugs when run. You have to have some level or RAI or you hang on undefined terms before you even get to the rules.

All my arguments about what PAO cant do are on the very RAW side of the continuum. Same as I would argue that a lv1 commoner cant cast wish at will just because the rules do not spell out he cant. By RAW: "rules say what we can do, not what we cant" is the foundation I am going off of here.

If I wanted to argue it enough, I can point out thought bottle lets you store both xp and thoughts (suggesting xp is purely mental), xp is literally experience which is synonymous with memories (again implying it is purely mental), and mental and physical capabilities fall under a species normal ranges by your definition (which covers what class levels do), thus alter self gives you xp. And hey, there is no minimum int needed to be an archmage either, just a minimum if you actually want to cast certain spell levels. Playing word games ends in a trainwreck.

I just cant agree that specific knowledge falls within the normal range for minor physical characteristics of a species, normal range has an actual meaning. Specific knowledge is not in the normal range, its at a range so extreme that its highly likely to be unique if not nonexistant. That is going beyond even the whackiest raw scenarios and into purposefully abusing semantics to allow something that is clearly not allowed.

[[http://therafimrpg.wikidot.com/glass-strike][Glass strike]] is like flesh-to-stone, but glass. Except it can be cast to /explicitly/ target objects. Undead are subject to fortitude saves that effect objects. And since that's a really rare occurrence, I imagine Afi's neglected his fortitude compared to his other saves. A glass statue of Afi can be PAO'd as easily as a stone statue, no?

Also, from the Book of Exalted Deeds, [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/book-of-exalted-deeds--52/sanctify-the-wicked--93/][Sanctify the Wicked]] is a spell that /directly targets the soul./ It tears the target's soul out and imprisons it in a gem, where it's turned good over the course of a year. Tearing a lich's soul from its body and imprisoning it sounds like the sort of thing that'd keep it from returning to the phylactery. But the spell requires a rare class, and it's 9'th level, /and/ it requires expensive spell components, /and/ it's a will save.

Also from the BoED, [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/book-of-exalted-deeds--52/last-judgment--90/][Last Judgement]] kills the target, but immediately sends it to the lower plane to be punished for all eternity. Might also prevent phylactery resurrection. Would only be a delaying action, since he can be resurrected, but still.

The big problem with PAO'ing antimatter right now is that it necessitates sacrificing a high level mage. But what if you sent in /two/ magi with the same initiative?

Or can you cast spells through a ring gate without sticking your head through? You'd probably have to stick your arms through, but arms can be regenerated. And since the gates only transmit one way, you'd be safe.

The initiative trick was the first way that I thought of to make AM work safely; Al has a readied action with the condition "when Bob finishes casting his spell, I will teleport us away". Bob casts the PAO:antimatter. Al's action triggers and basically preempts everything else in the universe so that his action can happen. You would need to use a ring of teleport or something like that, since casting a spell would still take 6 seconds.

Alternatively, Bob could just have a Contingency spell on himself that says "when I finish casting PAO:antimatter, this Teleport spell will get me out of there."

Alternatively, Bob could PAO or Shapechange himself into a ghost or other incorporeal form before casting the PAO:antimatter. Incorporeals are immune to all non-magical damage, including AM blasts.

**** So I happen to be a mathematical physicist semi-specializing in GR. I've never rigorously looked at a space with portals like this in it before (but after this discussion I probably will try), but my intuition suggests you're going to run into more problems than you realize.

As far as you've described, the portal openings consist of a pair of (probably) ellipses with conjugate points on the part of the planes defined by the ellipses interior to the ellipses mathematically identified. The problem with doing things that way is twofold. First, these portals have no "backs," meaning if something going in the "front" of portal A comes out the "front" of portal B, then anything going in the "back" of portal A comes out the "back" of portal B. Requiring portals be "anchored" on flat surfaces doesn't fully solve that problem due to the next problem.

Since these are /mathematically/ identified points, then anything physical can travel through the portals. Including forces. Including gravity. As a toy example, consider two point masses with appreciable mass, each very near the portal surface compared to the size of the portal. At that distance, the relative locations of the portals don't matter; they can be lightyears apart and the masses exert a pull on each other like they are right next to each other.

Now rotate one of the portals around one of the point masses. Wherever the portal opening faces, that is where the force of attraction is.

What does this mean in the context of people using portals? Say you have a portal in front of you (normal vector perpendicular to the ground's normal vector) with output above you facing down toward you (normal vector anti-parallel to ground's normal vector). Looking through the portal you see the Earth "in front" of you, which means you feel its gravity in front of you, too, /in addition to the normal gravity below you/. So the mere presence of portals near massive bodies changes the force of gravity *appreciable distances away from either of the portals*. In theory, with the proper locations and orientations, you can severely screw with gravity across the entire planet with two portals on the same continent.

To go with the RAW while keeping physics as realistic as possible, you either have to drop mathematical identification or GR.

Place a strong loudspeaker a few kilometers from the portal, and yourself a kilometer from the portal on the other side. The sound that reaches you will be much weaker than if you were two kilometers away from the loudspeaker on its other side, and for the same reason gravitational pull towards a portal to a large mass will be as strong as usual from directly in front of the portal, and about quadratically with distance diminish as you back away from it.

One point: the Ring Gates actually do have an "input" and an "output". Nothing goes in the output side or out the input side. I'm not sure if / how this interacts with your post. To be clear: if something goes in the "input" side of ring A, it comes out the "output" side of ring B and vice versa. Through suitable use of Sovereign Glue (a magically cannot-be-broken bonding agent) it is possible to make a one way valve like this -- just glue the input side of B to a magically unbreakable wall.

--------------

EDIT: Ok, I finaly had the chance to sit down and read this. I think what you're saying is that, in the situation you describe, the planet's gravity is simultaneously pulling in two separate directions. There's only one "point mass" (the planet) in this example, which is why I was confused -- you mentioned two in your original statement.

You are (of course) right, that's how it would work under physics. I think, however, that this is a case where RAW trumps physics -- the item description makes no mention of effects on gravity, therefore there aren't any. Of course, the flip side of this is that it wouldn't transmit /light/ either -- the descriptions says that you can "stick your head through" to look around, it doesn't say that you can just look through the portal. That's a pity, since I was planning to turn (a pair of ring gates) + (a bunch of Celestial Brilliance stones back home) into a giant anti-undead laser cannon, and now it looks like I can't. Feh.

********* Hm. Good point. Yes, you can. The canonical examples from the item description are:

"A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate."

Ok, so the input / output thing is not absolutely pure -- the input side can emit things that started on the output side, so long as they are boostrapped in by something that went only partially through the ring. Still, the general point stands -- air, light, gravity, nothing comes through in the "wrong" direction except through this one loophole.

***** So, not sure I understand what you're saying, but what little I get reminds me of something that puzzled me about Stargate as well: If your portal lets through gravity, shouldn't Earth (or whatever planet you're on) be thrown out of its orbit the moment you turn the device on? In the case of the Ring Gates the planet's own gravity should do the same.

Speaking of Ring Gates: If you make the iron bar a permanent magnet instead, would you get an infinitely powerful generator? Though, to be honest, I seem to be incapable of imagining what the field lines of a straight but somehow no-ended magnet would look like...

**** Eventually the speed of the object falling an an air filled space will set the air on fire, then turn it to plasma, then begin to FUSE the plasma. You really need that vaccuum.

And there is no real method to extract energy from it once it gets that fast without splosions.

Also, as an object approaches relativistic speeds, its mass increases to infinity. Not sure how that would jive with a weight limit, but it could have a serious gravatic effect on the surrounding everything.

I'm assuming Jake's current idea involves a little teleport circle-star lifting or equivalent. That or black hole connections. Either is about as dangerous as it can get there, but if the liches are anything smart, the phylacteries are not anywhere near where they are. Likely not even on the same plane. They basically need Herrun to find them with any degree of success.

** - You can use the Hourglass to make permanent /Symbol of Death/ set to affect only undead creatures. (Attune them to Colborn so he doesn't get splatted.) Put the symbols on shields and have them activate on sight. If you have, say, 100 shields lining the entrance hall to Grofhamr, then even an undead that passes their save on everything except a natural 1 will be destroyed 95% of the time.
- They have access via merchants to infinite amounts of adamantine armour. Using /Animate Object/ and the Hourglass, then stacking /Hardening/ on the armour, create practically-indestructible shock troops. For bonus points, fill the armour with Celestial Brilliance Bouncy Balls of Doom. Or fill the armour with papers of /Explosive Runes/, and order it to get close to high-value targets and then break a necklace of fireballs/other item that will set off the /Explosive Runes/.
- Also cast Hardening and Animate Object on the Landguard's armour, with orders to get them out of combat once they're unconscious. This should hopefully preserve enough of their body that only a Raise Dead is needed rather than a full True Resurrection.
- Again with abusing the Hourglass ( :D ) you could give everyone in Grofhamr both /Invisibility/ and /See Invisible/ permanently, which seems like an advantage.
- Dust of Dryness as a bomb containing 100 gallons of holy water.

The note on Find the Path is true; that's why I paired it with Discern Location. However, on reading that spell's description I realised that you have to have touched the object so that's probably a no-go. You can, however, still choose targets like "the room where Afi keeps his phylactery" as valid choices for Find the Path, and then just throw out a Mage's Disjunction.

Jake has two powers: "outside view of the RAW allows exploits" and "everyone must obey me because I'm the ruler and I'll have the Landguard kick your ass if you don't." His problems are: social and making mistakes (or succeeding but causing issues in the process).

INT boosts allow you to make bigger mistakes faster, and insult people more easily. WIS boosts make you make fewer mistakes, and CHA boosts let you manage social situations more smoothly. Boosting either WIS or CHA would (a) substantially change his character and (b) eliminate most of the problems he's facing.

This creates a medium-sized Animated Object, which has just 31 HP. Making it out of adamantine gives it a hardness of 20, which acts as an impressive amount of damage reduction, but that's all it really has going for it. It can probably kill wights indefinitely though.

There's actually a much more powerful use of animated objects, which is seriously broken within actual game terms, but not within Two Year Emperor terms - the druid spell Awaken (only 5th level, to Animate Object's 6th) can turn trees into permanent Animated Objects with no size restriction. Any particularly large full-grown tree is colossal (the trees that come out of a feather token are just barely too small, and still gargantuan), which yields 256 HP and hardness 5 permanently for less investment.

- The undead will almost certainly kill and/or convert all life on the planet; does this mean that the lives that exist now can be looked at as unsavable and therefore not a factor in decision making?
- Exactly how many lives would be taken by blowing up the planet? How do you tell?
- If doing this is the only way to be sure that the undead don't follow and kill off the millions of people that you are transporting, how does that affect the calculation?
- Will the undead stay confined to this world, or will they spread to others before the gods finally decide to cut them back? If they do spread, how many billions of lives will they end?

** /Blasphemy///Holy Word///Word of Chaos///Dictum/ instagib everything around you that's 10 or more hit dice behind your caster level. No save. Caster levels are hilariously easy to increase: Orange Ioun Stones give an untyped bonus to caster level. Stack up Orange Ioun Stones until your caster level is in the low hundreds, then walk up to $target and cast an appropriate /Word/. Boom. Even works on Undead!

--------------

Craft Contingent Spell lets you set any spell you know to be cast on a near-arbitrary trigger. For example, you can trigger a /Celerity/ for whenever combat starts, ensuring you never lose initiative ever again. Or you can trigger an /Atonement/ whenever you have to use /Blasphemy/ while you're Good, so that you can use your /Word/s without having to worry about your alignment. Or, for that matter, you could just set a /Word/ to go off whenever a high-level undead is within the AoE. Cast /Heal/s whenever you're at low health. Cast /Delay Death/ whenever you're about to die.

--------------

/Magic Mouth/ can trigger off arbitrarily complex audible signals. It can produce audible signals. /Magic Mouths/ can trigger each other. Build a computer.

--------------

Things which have had /Temporal Stasis/ cast on them are completely invulnerable modulo /Dispel Magic/. Use /Animate Object/ to animate a giant folded-up tarp, have the animated tarp origami itself into a castle, /Temporal Stasis/ your new castle. Or door. Or helmet. Whatever.

Quintessence is similarly fun.

--------------

If you want mechanical energy, /Heat Metal/ when cast underwater instantly boils all of the water nearby. An acre or two of chicken wire could easily power a gigawatt-range reactor. If you don't want to go through the trouble of electrical generation, just use a ring gate to connect your fuck-off-huge steam turbine to your load through a /Temporal Stasis/'d shaft. Side note: when you're doing stuff like this, it's much easier to build open-cycle systems using Decanters on the input side and /Dispel Water/ or Spheres of Annihilation on the output side.

--------------

.../Goodberry/. How the hell did everybody forget /Goodberry/. A single command-word item of it, at maximum throughput, can permanently feed 10k people. And berries are way more tasty and logistically convenient than protein sludge.

--------------

/Major Creation/ can make just about anything you want. Including "rare metals" and other odd stuff. It's temporary - one round per level - but it significantly lowers the level requirement for antimatter bombing runs. Other fun things to create: Hydrazine (fuck you, Tsiolkovsky), enriched uranium (what happens to fission and activation products when the original uranium goes away?), 10 cubic feet of photons (IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZOR).

--------------

You can make any spell into a trap. Traps can be reusable, auto-resetting, and - most importantly - auto-/casting/. Give them super-low search, avoid, disarm DCs and so on, and your magic items now cost a thousandth as much XP. And take a thousandth the time to craft. And don't require people to stand there and set them off. Even better, if you've built yourself a /Magic Mouth/ computer, you can use traps for physical I/O.

--------------

If there are /any/ infinite planes /anywhere/ in the multiverse, you can use /Planar Binding/ to summon /whatever you want/. Because no matter how small the measure of your target being is, if it's nonzero (and, in DND terms, "nonzero measure" means "you can build it as a character, the build is the story") there's a concrete instance out there somewhere for you to summon.

Magic traps are one version of what I've been calling 'spell engines'. There's also spell turrets spell clocks. I just use 'engines' to lump them all together.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicMouth.htm][Magic Mouth]] says "The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects," so it actually can't activate another Mouth. Also, it's a one-shot; once it's discharged, it's gone. Other spells CAN (e.g. Programmed Image) say command words, though.

I'd use diplomacy bombs. If you get the skill up reasonably high (which shouldn't be too hard with monster training arenas) you can relatively quickly do mass conversions of the liches. To convert an enemy who is hostile to you and trying to kill you to a friendly person who will fight on your behalf requires a roll of 60. To convert them to fanatical requires a roll of 160.

[[http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1141886]]

In the long run I'd be trying to make some sort of build like this, where when the person jumps anyone who observes them instantly becomes a fanatical follower. This works just as well on gods, incidentally. If they observe me they are then fanatical followers because my unit's jump was so awesome.

Still, even without that extreme measure, diplomacy wins the game. Mass mind control of any sentient being. You could take measures to limit it's effectiveness, like blocking your hearing, but generally diplomacy is very effective.

More generally, though: the Diplomancer, Pun-Pun, and the Omnificer all share the same problem -- they are relatively easy to pull off, and then the story is over. The Omnificer I handle by saying "I don't agree that it works" (which is true). Pun-Pun I handle by saying "running the loops takes quite a few rounds; the gods would show up and smack you before you got too far out of control."

The Diplomancer definitely works, and it can be built up to slowly enough that the gods probably wouldn't notice until you were already doing it. Arguably, if they used their divine power to observe you doing your jump, they would be affected even if they weren't there. So, yes, it's an entirely doable worldbreaker. And that's part of why I don't use feats.

**** The heavier abuse ones rely on feats, but you can get reasonably powerful effects even without them.

For example, you can create a magical item with a 30+ skill bonus for just around 90k gold. Takes 90 days. 100*skillbonus^{2} A 5+ bonus takes 2.5 days. I'd probably get a number of magical craftspeople to make a variety of those for the near future, with different bonuses. You may well be able to acquire a cloak of diplomacy or such of 5+.

So, level 10 half elf cleric. No feats. 16 charisma, 5+ from wishes, 2 from level ups, 5+ from a magical item of charisma, total 28 bonus 14+. 13 skill points spent on diplomacy, 4+ from synergies, one 5+ item. 22 skills, total bonus 36. They cast visage of the deity, giving themselves a 4+ bonus to charisma. Cast divine insight on self, 15+ bonus to one skill check. Have some cast greater heroism on you, giving you a 4+ skill bonus. You now have a skill of 42, or 57 in a pinch. On a 3 you can convert any group in one full round action to be friendly to you, with visage of the deity you can with a 3 convert any enemy to be helpful to you in a standard edit full action. This power would get far worse as you got stronger diplomacy items. If our emperor had a 30+ item and a 5+ charisma bonus then he could convert any hostile enemy, including a god, to be friendly to him with no roll needed.

Is it abusive? Not much more than antimatter, I'd argue. It's a way of instant killing a group of people with less range and lower requirements. It could help a lot in mass conversions. And it's really not that hard, even without feats, to get a decent bonus.
