** As a computer guy it was pretty horrifying seeing someone elevate their permissions and then just start mucking about.

*** It was pretty horrifying and hilarious. Let alone consult experts from the burgeoning muggle programming industry, I don't think he even spends 5 minutes brainstorming possible consequences. I can only imagine how much shit has happened because someone got impatient and sudo'd their commands without being thorough.

** This story always felt a little lazy to me. Even excluding the setup of the situation, which is at best, problematic, I think it's OOC for Harry to be this rash this late in the story. It's also a little unbelievable that it takes that much computronium of memory for a task as simple as simulating a human mind, to any level of fidelity.

I dunno, the gotcha just doesn't feel earned to me.

** That's a poorly designed system, if it allows a viewer at a lower privilege level to listen to the password of a higher one.

In fact, I'm surprised he was allowed to view the logs of a higher-privilege user at all.

And that Fawkes was willing to do what he did. Taking Harry to the Source of Magic is one thing, but a member of a species known for its extraordinary loyalty /stealing/ something from its bonded partner... seems unlikely.

*** It is indeed a poor system, but there would be no story to tell without a flaw. Someone else mentioned that Atlantis is broken, and with only one core online the entire thing may be operating in emergency mode. Perhaps the other cores were meant to supplement remote viewing and ensure no one viewed anything sensitive, or maybe the rod only started working after a great part of Atlantis suffered critical failures as a sort of emergency maintenance device.

*** Per the summary:

#+begin_quote
  This story occurs in the universe of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, diverging in Ch. 101. It contains spoilers for that story through that chapter, and is unlikely to make much sense without having read the same. It's intended to be a darker, more pessimistic interpretation of the story.

** So Harry discovers that heaven is real, and his first instinct is to start pulling people out of it? Seems kind of out of character. Remember that the reason he opposes death so much is that it represents a complete destruction of a human consciousness. He should really be trying to get all the other afterlife servers back up and running again

This could honestly be pretty easily fixed by just making the afterlife servers full of static copies of people at the moment of their death, rather than going full San Junipero

  The simulation usually has realistic physical laws and earth-like backgrounds, but the minds stored can modify it as they desire

Sounds pretty decent to me. If Harry has specific objections, he doesn't voice them here

** The problem with this is that Hermione was a muggleborn and Dumbles would have needed to know enough about them to simulate Hermione.

Enough to fool Harry, who talked geek and Hermione understood. Dumbles knew some Tolkien, but...

** Me reading the story:

“Well this is good so far”

HPJEV: “god-computer make more computronium”

Me: oh god oh no oh shit oh fuck WHAT HAVE YOU DONE??

God-computer (source of magic): >! turns earth and much of the solar system into computronium before decanting the resurrected hermione granger onto the airless surface of the computronium sphere.!<

Hermione: dies because that's what humans do when dumped into vaccum.

all other humans are dead because they got turned into computronium. afterlife may or may not be functional it's an existential catastrophe either way so in practice it matters very little one way or the other as in both cases no one can interact with the real world

Me: /thanks/ HPJEV you destroyed the world because you failed to spend 5 fucking minutes thinking about what could go wrong or even talking to a semi reasonable adult

TL;DR A good story with a very “thanks I hate it” ending.
