The winner will be +working in a coal mine+ whoever gets the most votes!

All of the stories linked will be posted as top level comments and anyone can vote for whichever story that they liked.

The voting will close on September 13th, 11:59 pm (EST) and the winner will get a month of reddit gold and bragging rights.

Anyone can vote, including the participants.

Some people haven't submitted their stories yet, but I will permit stories to be submitted after the deadline. They just will have less time to gain votes just like how late submissions for the Biweekly Challenge had less time to gather votes and win.

Not all prompts had a story written for them and submitted to the sister prompt voting thread.

This means that some stories posted here were written for a prompt where the prompter didn't submit a story. So don't be surprised to see a story written for a prompt that is not available to be voted for in the other thread.

Furthermore, some stories were written in a way that the prompts themselves are a spoiler. Hence, all prompts will be put in spoiler text, and it's suggested that the reader reads the associated stories first before reading the prompts.

Prompt: It's said there are a million keys in the City of Locks, and twice as many doors. The Picker Guild tries to force their way through the doors with ingenious devices and working knowledge of the locks, while the Keysmiths sort and catalog every key found. The Cannoneers take a different path, trying their best to blast through walls and circumvent the doors, but their successes have been few, and they've raised the animosity of every other faction. Lastly, there are the enigmatic City Locksmiths, the lockers of doors.

**** *Author's worldbuilding notes:*

Tillane of House Jinia, second son of the second son, and a Onceborn, converted to this religion against his family's wishes. He is sixty years old this past Janyra (month).

He works as facilities manager of Jinia's College of Wellkeeping, where acolytes learn physical and psychological nursing skills -- wellkeeping of mind, body, and heart. His House is renowned land-wide for its skilled wellkeepers. (Think of a trade college campus, focused on nursing and psych.)

You Only Live Once is a slur against the Onceborns, adherents of the Message of Adael the Once and Future. He was a moral teacher who started a movement of love and morality. Adael was executed, quartered by four bulls, his limbs hung on the city gates for a day and a morning per the tradition, falsely convicted of the crime of plotting to blow up the Repository of Souls (colloquially known as The Cloud) after making the very public claim that he could revive people from death, not just reincarnate them. This was a hundred and forty years ago next Myra (month).

There are a handful of other religions, and their adherents are looked on as devotees who seek wisdom, not people who genuinely believe in a concrete spirit world or an afterlife. None of those religions shun being Born Again (reincarnated via a process similar to Joss Whedon's Dollhouse). Primarily, though, most of the people who run the government are Adeists, nonbelievers. No Onceborn has ever been elected to the House Councils of the Land of Sundor, and they plan to keep it that way for both biased and unbiased reasons.

The primary civic works architectural style is tribal brutalist concrete, with ziggurats. The weather is tropical with constant hurricanes. The people of Sundor are mostly Native American in appearance, but largely suburban American in culture. The Land (country) of Sundor has five provinces, New Movada being the most Arizona-like province (state), Kinkad being the settlement (city).

The rationalist focus, both in the prompt and in my story, is bias. The people who run the government think themselves rationalists /because/ they shun spirituality, but are blind to their biased unwillingness to allow people with other points of view to represent them, let alone make decisions on their behalf.

The reason for the blatant expy of Christianity was to avoid many of the historical connotations thereof, for a cleaner setting and a clearer exploration of this central ratfic concept: the fallacy that people who are on the side of truth must thus be right in other areas of knowledge, morality, or attitude.

**** (*TL;DR at the bottom.* I'm basically gonna use this comment to rant about my own story; your comment is just where it all happened to come spilling out of me.) :)

I'm glad you liked it! That's actually kind of a relief to read, because truth be told, I wasn't pleased with the way it turned out overall. I procrastinated a little bit trying to come with story ideas, and then I think the story suffered from a lack of planning.

The seed of this story was just something I jotted down in my brainstorming document, something like "A character's legs fall asleep on the toilet and they have to escape a serial killer." The idea was kinda lighthearted and goofy, and it /seemed/ to fit the prompt well enough. I had this Scary Movie-esque mental image of someone pulling themselves down a hallway all overdramatically with a killer stalking behind them all slow and menacing - but, like, funny. Because... toilet.

I came up with the "bursts of stupidity" thing and the "trapped in a horror movie thing" as twin catalysts to move the story along to the beat of a standard horror movie. I thought I'd be all clever and have the bursts of stupidity be an actual tangible element in the story rather than just having stupid characters - and, considering this is [[/r/rational]], I figured a rational character could /recognize/ when she was being unusually stupid and then try to account for it.

But then when I started writing the actual story, I realized that the rational tone I was trying to strike didn't fit with the goofy story I'd hoped to tell in the first place. I could only pick one, and given what sub we're on, the rational tone felt like the indispensable one. Even that first ridiculous mental image of the girl and the killer in the hallway didn't work, because in a rational story, the killer would just walk up to her, slash her throat, and walk away. This gave rise to a new problem in that /that image/ (now cut from the story) was really the only thing linking this story to the prompt I'd been given!

I played up the "escape" angle to try and fool people into thinking the story had something to do with the prompt. That's why the story starts with that particular line and then flashes back, that's why I named it "/Escape/" - to try and make it seem like there was some sort of travel happening, even if just in the reader's subconscious. I felt a little bit bad because I really did like my prompt, but I was too deep in it now and had procrastinated too long to change course. Near the end of writing, I actually realized the story would be better (more natural, more satisfying, more subversive of horror movies, more... feminist?) if my character got the jump on the killer and took him down, but then the "travel" content of the story would drop from, oh, about 3% to almost literally zero. So as much as I wanted that ending, I stuck with my original one.

The end result is something that's too serious to be silly, too silly to be taken serious. It's trying too hard to fit a prompt that clearly no longer applies to it even remotely, and it feels scattered and unfocused as a result. Even the basic prose felt lackluster most of the time.

*TL;DR:* The story got away from me.

**** Thanks While brainstorming for this story. I realized there was a lot of potential for munchkinery with the prompt. However most of the applications for such power would be negative. So sure my character could have committed crimes and got away with them. That route just didn't inspire me. I needed to know why my character did what they did and committing crimes did not fit in the peaceful society I imagined. I was more interested in asking what are the consequences to society in a world that's telepathic. I imagined people would be a lot more compassionate and understanding. That there wouldn't really be any major taboos of discussion. Then I asked how would my character fit into that world. What would they want?

The story was originally going to be a lot longer and focused on the performances they were giving. As it turns out having a show where you can't just read the performers thoughts is a bit of novelty. And the communities reaction to it.

I however procrastinated and ran out of time. I realized that what I wrote did work as a story albeit different from what I had originally planned.

The only thing close to clues I could imagine were that the guy was important (had guards), the recurring mention of breathing, a way of widely sending binary information, the implication that said way was horrific/unexpected, and that the guy survived in the end, which eliminates my initial thought of some body horror.

The ending implies that whatever he does is shocking, possibly self-injurious and/or taboo. So I'm trying to think of something shocking he could do to communicate the GPS's binary message to anyone outside of where they were being held, but there doesn't seem to be anything in the story other than the GPS itself that can send information out, and the the whole reason the character does whatever he does is because he's worried that the GPS might not work.

**** The answer: Protagonist assumes some information leakage when captors contact authorities to show proof that he is alive.

Details and excuses follow. Basically, the above logic should have been included in the text and I have no justification for why it was not. I was too busy optimizing words and missed the forest, or something. Sorry. I left the ending vague because I think it's more fun to think what the protagonist could have possibly done. Basically, if he assumes visual information leakage, body horror is a "good" option. If auditory, he may try to force visual by trying to remain silent, until he gets non-lethally shot or tortured. He may also try to talk in a weird way. Or alternatives. (Breathing was intended to set the mood, no hidden depth, though it does sound cool.)

********* Makes sense! I actually think it would have been cool to see explicitly what he did, but that might just be because my imagination isn't up to the task of filling it in.

********** I think that's a fair criticism. When you post to a “rational fiction” audience, your title is essentially “information”, and your story finishes with an open-ended cliffhanger, most people would expect it to be a solvable mystery from the clues provided. The correct answer being essentially “I dunno how it worked but it did and it was gross yo” is a pretty unsatisfying end.

*********** Well, the correct answer in the specific given case was "do nothing"...

Anyway, I'm sorry it wasn't well received, and I do regret not writing the essential assumption about the contact with the authorities. I'm still not sure about descriptions of body horror, but regardless, I appreciate your feedback.

************ Ah, I meant correct as “what actually happened in the story” not “the ideal response”. For me it was not about the taboo/horrific thing being explicitly described, just there wasn't /any/ taboo/horrific thing we could have guessed correctly. Looking at the story again without the expectation of it being a solvabls mystery made it a more pleasant experience, so I think the main issue was the audience's assumption of the kind of story it would be.
