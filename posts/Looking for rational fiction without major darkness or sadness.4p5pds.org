I don't like stories that are dark or have very sad parts, such as a character we've come to like getting killed off or experiencing major grief. What are some good rationalist stories (or movies!) that fit what I'm looking for?

  The Patrician took a sip of his beer. “I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that's when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.”

** I'll second Mother of Learning. With This Ring is pretty lighthearted, too, and has lots of optimization. Also, if you don't mind self-promotion, you might like my own books. (First one is [[http://amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-War-Broken-Mirrors/dp/1505886554][Forging Divinity]].) That said, all these choices are at least mostly rational, but not rationalist. Rationalist stuff is much harder to come by.

For the really light-hearted experience one might want to avoid the semi-canon omake episodes about what might have happened if Paul was more angry and became ruthless and egoistic.

** I would advice "Please don't tell my parents that I'm a supervillain" series. It's incredibly light-hearted while still being pretty smart, if not exactly rationalist. It also describes a superpowered society that successfully solved prisoner's dilemma and avoids superhero paradox, and that's great.

**** Pact's magic is one of the most well-thought-out, amazeballs set ups I've encountered. The universe /literally/ runs on narration, for good and ill of the main character. People seriously exploit that fundament.

I'd argue it's "harder" than pretty much anything else out there. Runners-up are probably Dresden Files, Codex Alera, and Name of the Wind (at least that come to mind right now). Each of those have really solid setups /internally/, but I couldn't tell you how to cast a Dresden spell, or make a magic item in NotW. I /can/ tell you how to cast a Pact spell.

You mean the story where people go pretty much insane in their own personal time loops that rarely combine with each other and where one of the time loopers tortures/conditions the point-of-view character to enslave herself at the beginning of each time loop, then everything goes pear-shaped and trippy?

I'm pretty certain what you call light-hearted/upbeat and what I call light-hearted/upbeat do not intersect very often, if you're calling Time Braid light-hearted.

**** Hmm All the things you mention do happen, but at least in my opinion the thing that makes it fairly upbeat and no really dark is the approach of the characters. The story is never about "god how could we possibly deal with this", its always about how the characters can grow and become stronger. And that combines with a world where this is possible.

Its similar to the difference between dragonball z and for example worm. sure, people are dying left and right on both, and they suffer on the way plenty of time, but dbz is lighthearted because the characters don't actually dwell on it. they just push on, and the world is built in a way where they actually -can- push on. On the other hand worm is not upbeat, because the characters do take note of their pain, and the world is -not- built in a way where they can just go on and overcome everything thrown at them.

Even when Sakura was a hostage in her own mind the narrative was not really "ohhh the sufferingggggg", it was "ok, so how am I getting outta here".

Personally I think Sakura was shown to agonize much more on the moral stuff("I am holding their memories in my control", "I want to trust him, but how can I be sure?" etc.) than on the "dark" aspects. she just accepted the world for what it was and tried to do the best she could within those constraints.
