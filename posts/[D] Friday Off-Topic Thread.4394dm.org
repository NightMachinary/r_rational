Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I'm really enjoying /The Witness/ for the most part. It's a game that's very much about challenging your assumptions and taking in the world as it is rather than how you would like it to be. It's also filled to the brim with fiendishly difficult puzzles. So I second [[/u/xamueljones]] recommendation and think this is a worthy successor to /Braid/. I haven't finished the game yet, though I think I'm only a few hours away and will probably go for full completion, which will likely double my time.

Also, today is my last day of work, after which I will be a stay-at-home dad (and ideally doing contract work and/or writing on the side). So that's neat.

*** I have a somewhat different opinion of The Witness. I really like a lot of the game, but I don't feel it's perfect. I have played ~12 hours and [[#s][spoiler]], so while I haven't seen the entire game I feel I can render some sort of initial judgement on the game. I really like a lot of the game overall, and it seems really fun in many areas, but the problems that I have with it are significant enough to lower it from potential 10/10 to more like a 8/10 experience.

1. It's now [Current Year], we should have options menues where we can adjust field of view sliders, graphics quality, resolution, etc. We shouldn't be forced to edit random text files in the game's folder with Notepad to adjust antialiasing levels. This shit is not acceptable in a $40 release. No, having 3 graphics quality options is not enough.

2. The puzzles have a lot of neat mechanics, and they work together well when they mix multiple puzzle mechanics together. It's great. However, there are a HUGE number of puzzles after you understand the basic mechanic of an area just using that basic mechanic in more complicated ways, and in several areas they get boring like halfway through or even earlier. Ten of the same puzzle with extremely slight differences is not ten times as amazing as the first puzzle - and lots of areas don't limit themselves to small numbers of repetitions like 10. A lot of mechanics overstay their welcome in this game and become boring for me before I'm done all the puzzles.

3. The audio is all FUBAR for my PC. I get constant skipping and repeating of audio cues and audio logs. It would be a bigger deal in a game with more audio logs etc (I have found precisely 2 extensive audio logs in my ~12 hours of play). Some forum threads suggest killing audio software etc, and I haven't had any success with that - basically, I don't know why it's broken but it is and it made the two audio logs I listened to almost unbearably annoying. There are also segments of puzzles using sound that were much more difficult than they had any right to be because of this issue. Thank god there's no music and mostly not a huge number of ambient noises.

4. The lack of an ingame map [[#s][spoiler]] is a giant nuisance for a game this sized. It's impossible to navigate the island without getting lost constantly for the first ~12 hours, and trying to find somewhere you've been before is a nightmare.

**** The game is all about minimalism, and there are a few places where I think it hampers itself in pursuit of that goal. The lack of a map is definitely one of them. The lack of settings is another (though there are at least /some/ mitigating reasons for that). I wouldn't give it a 10 either, especially not at the current price point. But it is a good game, especially if you like minimalist puzzlers.

I consider the lack of a map display to be a good thing. I want more games with no maps, or at least maps embedded into the world with no game-model-breaking properties. The Pip-Boy is bad. The boat map is good.

I won't disagree on having options menus, however, there's no real way around that without killing accessibility.

The audio is a bug and you should report it. Number None is doing a lot of support work, so make use of it.

***** Regarding maps: It doesn't necessarily have to be HUD-based maps - it could be other navigational aids as well. I recall, for example, The Talos Principle had no HUD-based obstructive maps at all, but I spent about 95% less time lost because they had /signs/ up everywhere pointing you toward puzzles you had / had not solved (black marks through the puzzle reward on the sign to indicate you solved it already) so you could always find a new goal to work towards. Some signposts or other indicators would be a gigantic improvement. Even just putting the boat map on some boards with a 'you are here' in a bunch of prominent places inland would be super nice.

Neither but both.

The breakthrough is in /general/ models and algorithms that can be /trained/ for arbitrary specific tasks. So-called "transfer learning", re-using training data/experience from one task to pre-train for another, is still considered an open problem in which comparatively few advancements have been made.

Further, there isn't a consensus on /why/ these "deep learning" models work as well as they do, as there are several different hypotheses as to why and most of them aren't very, shall we say, /predictive/, in the sense of being able to tell you ahead of time when deep learning should work and when it shouldn't.

I'm partisan to one of those theories, and it also tells us a lot about transfer learning, but it's going to take a few good experiments and a theoretical paper to actually cover the ground.

I am interested in the question of which features we are most likely / least likely to share with an intelligent alien race given similar primordial soups. (E.g.

*** I too would love to see more articles about this, but in the meantime I'm happy to speculate:

*A Brain, Familiar Senses, and a Head* It's nice to limit the distance your nervous system must extend, and centralization has huge advantages. A brain centralizes thinking, minimizing thought time, and clumping as many sense organs as possible around that nerve center keeps reaction times low. Light and sound are omnipresent in most liveable environments. The molecular analysis of taste and smell are crucial for basic dietary reasons. Touch, temperature, balance, and proprioception would all be familiar mental concepts whether the aliens had specific devoted organs for those senses or not.

There's no reason any of these senses necessarily need to share (or not to share) the particular holes we happen to use.

*Arms and Hands*: You're right about not necessarily needing five fingers, but it is extremely important to have dexterous many-pronged instruments on the end of relatively strong limbs not used in general locomotion. The ability to manipulate and to carry seems an important step towards what we think of as intelligence.

Contrast the difficulties that crows, elephants, octopuses, and dolphins encounter with such interactions. They might be uplifted to technological competency, or provided with prosthetic versions, but their own innovations will have a hard time getting far with such limited physical ability to experiment.

*Bilateral Symmetry*: Binocular vision and binaural hearing have huge advantages in conceptually-2D land based life. Limbs in pairs have a lot of locomotive advantages. Given the importance of arms, the whole "two arms, two legs" thing might not even be that unusual. Fewer is inconvenient, more is a waste of energy.

*Omnivorous*: Energy is important.

Generally speaking, the fewer things a creature eats the less it has to think about what it's eating. Conveniently, the more things that a creature eats the less energy it has to spend digesting and the more that can be devoted to thinking.

It turns out flexible minds are expensive, but so are the sorts of vibrant guts that can turn a single food source into all the myriad proteins necessary to sustain life.

The smartest herbivores /can and must/ eat a wide variety of plants which supply different nutrients, the smartest carnivores /can and must/ eat the largest variety of animals. That dietary/intellectual spectrum has shown up in animals as diverse as arthropods, molluscs and mammals, so it would be no surprise if it existed in unconnected evolutionary trees.

I challenged myself to making a quadrupedal crocodilian tool user. They developed tool use via their jaw muscles and used tongue+variety of teeth and jaw postures to manipulate tools. Their forelegs acted as proping/grasping and the long/strong appendage factor was fulfilled by a muscular and flexible neck. Their tool use occured as an offshoot of nest building/manipulation and the invention of fire and cooperative social interaction allowed for more precise control of the heat distribution in their nests, which gave their females a way to control depending on environmental conditions the genders of their offspring.

sexual selection became a highly social game and sons/daughters and ready access to burnable fuels along side aquacultures of usable fish and general environmental challenges eventually created industrial revolution.

Their version of population labor opening up from necessry work was the creation of electrically heated nest beds (an offshoot of their more kiln like 'traditional' nests) and eventually caused much social, political and economical upheaval.

then some one built a GAI out of video game and everyone got raptured and is arguably dead.

Because the main drawback of intelligence is just how long it takes to learn everything you need to know without it being hard-coded in as instincts. Hence there must be some sort of lengthy learning phase and the species needs to have good protection for their young during this period of life.

Sexual dimophism also seems like a plausible candidate, both for the rapidity of mutation, and as a way for the species to compete internally, while still allowing for wide-scale cooperation.

** So I've recently been presented with something of a difficult situation. I was having a conversation with one of my professors, someone I respect and care about. I've known they had a serious condition of some kind since last year but I found out its specific nature. It's a genetic issue often abbreviated as MERRF, basically the mitochondria in their body just begin dying and this causes their entire body to slowly degrade. There isn't a cure, and I don't think there will be until gene therapy advances significantly.

It's something that acts very slowly as far as incurable fatal diseases go. I don't know, I just wanted to share this with some folks that don't tend towards fatalism. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for, it's just a really unfair situation.

Feel free to ask for more information, although I might decline to answer since I'm not sure how much it would be appropriate to share.

** Question for those of you in romantic relationships: Is your partner a rationalist as well? If not, do you ever find yourself having difficulty with them on certain things, due to you favoring a rational viewpoint over the viewpoint she prefers (a societal based one, an emotion based one, etc.)

For example, I could see the concept of "the one" causing friction in a relationship. As in, you don't believe in the concept, whereas your partner may be convinced that you are "the one" and is hurt by your reciprocating her belief.

Also any general notes about how you found rationality impacting your relationship ( If it does at all) would be cool. I'm just speaking as a curious, single person.

Edit: sorry in advance for typos. On mobile :(

My fiancee dislikes LW culture and harbors genuine resentment and hatred over much of HPMoR. I also took her to LW-TA meetings sometimes and she liked the people there.

She doesn't follow the community, but very much considers an active practice of /good sense/, grounded in science and evidence, to be an absolutely essential part of life.

The fact that she deeply dislikes many societal norms and doesn't want to trust emotions that might derive from an active mental illness are big spurs towards that view.

Also, if she were here, she'd be telling me to beat you over the head about "emotion-based viewpoints" not being necessarily irrational, blah blah Straw Vulcan, blah blah. I concur.

*** Like the others who commented, my GF isn't a "rationalist" and couldn't get into HPMOR, though she did give it an honest shot (not even my remixed version helped ;_;). That said, she's an exceedingly intelligent person who is studying biochemistry and programming, so she's more rational than the majority of people.

*That said,* we argue occasionally about things like whether her love for me is "stronger" because it's more emotional and less logical (neither of us believe in "the one," but two people loving each other exactly the same amount seems improbable), or some differences of opinion that can mostly be chalked up to her being more "traditional" or "conservative" in certain regards.

Every relationship has disagreements, however, and the most important thing is how we react to them. We've always tried to treat each other with respect, and have commented on how grateful we are that the other is an intelligent and rational person that we can disagree on big issues without it causing resentment. Best of all, we've changed each other's minds on a number of things, which is really the best you can ask for in a partner: for them to logically challenge your beliefs and help you learn.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-Rationality][This.]] I wrote it to help the early parts of the story flow a bit better and introduce the characters as more well rounded and less abrasive, the way they do in the later parts of the story. I noticed a lot of people who start reading HPMOR have the same complaints about Harry's brattyness and the generally rough writing, and have gotten good feedback on the remix's ability to introduce people to the story better.

"Traditional" and "conservative" not in the sense of religion or anything as personality/world defining. More about things like to what degree society's mores are helpful or harmful. For example, I have a tendency to be a bit too flippant about the way other people see me, or the first impressions I might give: "if they judge me on my sandals, who cares what they think?" or similar. She's made the point before that being able to acknowledge that about society and people in it and act accordingly is actually the more mature and rational approach, in circumstances where it actually matters how others view you.

Antichamber is a great puzzle experience. It's very minimalistic in terms of story (almost no story), it's basically 100% first-person puzzles. The game has a bunch of noneuclidean space and stuff that's really neat. It's got really good puzzles, though, and will keep you occupied for a few hours without overstaying it's welcome. It's sort of expensive at full price for what it is, but is old enough to be on sale frequently. Completion time: ~8-10 hours.

Braid is, as everyone else says, a wonderful 2d puzzle game. It's totally worth picking up, even at full price, but also goes on sale frequently. Fairly short game (~4-5 hours at most, probably less).

The Swapper is a great puzzle game with a few interesting ideas about identity, the ship of theseus problem, consciousness, etc. It's got a fairly minimalist plot, but absolutely gorgeous aesthetics - everything in the entire game looks great. Completion time: ~5 hours.

The Talos Principle. It's got a neat mixture of portal-like first person puzzles with a gorgeous ruined civilization aesthetic, and a storyline that is surprisingly engaging. There is a lot of philosophical questions and stuff in The Talos Principle, but they're mostly not terribly sophisticated. Still more interesting than most videogames. A really fun puzzle game. There's a lot of secrets and hidden easter eggs, but even without those a full playthrough takes a long time.

QUBE: First person puzzles are pretty great, but game is short and fairly easy. Almost no plot, almost no replay value (worse than any of the other games in this list in terms of secrets and replay value). Get on sale, don't pay full price. ~3 hours.

Dishonored: My single favorite game of recent years. It's got a neat plot, and gameplay similar to the Thief games - that is, stealth-FPS with looting, evading guards, etc. Only, you get magical powers to teleport and stuff. It's got a number of levels to explore in the course of missions which feel very big and are very complicated, it's got some replayability (two paths you can take that have meaning - low chaos and high chaos), and it's just a ton of fun, some of the most fun I've had in a game recently. The story is competent but not amazing for the most part - the actual main plot is decent, but all the optional quests, recorded sound journals, and other noncentral stuff is really amazing and brings the whole world to life.

Also, there's tons of extra secret rooms unnecessary to achieving victory where the dev put a lot of their developer's work, and these most difficult puzzles are pretty much wholly optional.

The hardest puzzles in Antichamber are harder than the hardest ones in Portal, but the level of difficulty of the puzzles you have to do to beat the game is about the same. Braid is similar, in that the secret stars are sort of BS but the rest of the game is more straightforward.

*** The Binding of Isaac (Rebirth) is a good Rougelike. It's very light on story, but it's got a great deal of replayability. A game takes 30-90 minutes to finish, and everything is randomly generated (Within certain parameters, of course; one shop per floor, with random stuff in it, one treasure room, one boss).

Every playthrough is different, because there are hundreds of different items you can come across, and they all have weird synergies with each other. It's not an intellectual game, but there is planning ahead and experimentation to be done, and you'll never have two identical runs.

There is /some/ story stuff to figure out, as well as the mystery of how to unlock things, so if you haven't played it before I recommend staying away from spoilers, at least until you have cleared a 10 floor playthrough.

Rebirth is the same game as just The Binding of Isaac, but bigger and better, so no reason to play the vanilla version unless you can get it for free somewhere.

I'm slightly disappointed by KSP because of patched conics, simplified atmosphere, non-Solar system scales, and an inability to build megastructures. Although that last one doesn't quite fall under KSP's purview.

***** Early Metroidvanias were 2D exploration platformers. I would suggest going back and emulating old GBA metroid titles. Metroid Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion are some of the best games in the series.

Castlevania has grown as a franchise. Earlier games were more difficulty focused, But starting with Symphony of the Night the 2D games began following the formula of gaining power ups to progress in exploration of the castle, and were all generally well received.

Both series are somewhat minimalist storywise, and the lore is generally still understandable if you play them out of order.

If you want a more story based metroidvania, Cave Story is generally considered a masterpiece. It has always been free to download online since its initial release, though remastered versions such as Cave Story+ exist for purchase on steam.

Roguelikes.

Spelunky and Rogue Legacy are two games that bridge both genres.

I'd play Splunkey before Rogue Legacy, firstly because I find it more fun, and secondly because much like Cave Story there is an original free version in addition to a remastered version on steam.

As for pure roguelikes, there's a difficult line to straddle. Too hard and it's boring because you're at the beginning of the game too much. Too easy and.. well.

Faster than Light and Teleglitch were both roguelikes that I felt had both great game-play and great atmosphere, but they share the feature of being pretty hard.

I'd suggest you just watch someone play the beginning of each of those games on youtube and see if you like what you see.

****** Oh and one game I feel compelled to mention that's probably too hard is La Mulana.

It's a metroidvania platformer where you explore a ruin as an Indiana Jones expy. But...

Remember that part in Indiana Jones and the last Crusade, where Indiana is going through the trials and he has to use his father's notes to survive? That's La Mulana.

It's basically one giant chain of Indiana Jones puzzles like those ones. It's fun, but you either need to get a guide or take notes. With real paper. Organize them.

***** I Wanna Be The Guy isn't what most people refer to as a Metroidvania - one of the distinguishing elements of a Metroidvania is collection powers that allow you to advance in other areas - you're in a large area that you unlock more and more of by collecting more mobility / unlocking / etc powers. The canonical examples are Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. IWBTG is a straight platformer.

The best Metroidvania so far is probably Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition. It's a great game that takes inspiration from Mexican culture (esp. luchadores etc) and is just really wonderfully well done.

***** My main point of contention is that, apparently, not once does Brian consider using some NZT-time to figure a potential way out of either of his situations. No real data gathering, no searching for blackmail material, no contingency plans whatsoever. Or maybe, if we're going to ignore even possibly thinking about Edward Morra and the enzyme except when needed for the plot, how about oh, I don't know, immortality by way of mice? Building a jetpack? Anything at all!?

Nor does he actually think for a second about building up a stash of NZT. Step 1: gather materials to make little see-through pills of nothing that look like NZT. Make said pills. Step 2: do enough work in the office for two days, or just pretend you only get through half of whatever you normally get done. Maybe train your non-NZT self on how to act like he's on NZT through videos and such. Figure it out, you're on FLIPPING NZT. Step 3: the next morning, apply some sleight of hand and swallow the fake NZT pill while keeping the real one. Keep the real one on hand in case of emergency, of course. Do this once a week when possible, maybe more. Tada. A secret emergency stash of what is literally your most valuable asset.

I'd never have thought that the show as it existed in the pilot would have become the wild, energetic, off-the-wall show that it is now.

For example, the letter =d= doesn't have a /leftward/ bulge--rather, it must be considered as having a protrusion /opposite to the direction of writing,/ or the writer will constantly mix it up with =b=. Likewise, =q= in reversed cursive takes a fair amount of thought to execute correctly.
