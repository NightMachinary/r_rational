** Andrew Rowe ([[https://www.reddit.com/u/Salaris/][u/Salaris]]) is the author of the Arcane Ascension series and he's coming out with another book, /How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps./

#+begin_quote
  For thousands of years, there has been a cycle: a Demon King rises and conquers, and a Hero is reborn a hundred years later to defeat him. Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him to save.

  And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan.

  She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'll travel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete. And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy.

  She might not be a Hero -- but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.

So I figured since people here already loved the previous books he's written, you guys would want to jump in and preorder the audible before it comes out on April 30th.

So far, I don't know if the book is audible only or not. It doesn't appear to be coming in epub or mobi formats, but I don't know. I've already left comments on the website asking about it and I'll post an edit here later when I find out.

EDIT: It'll be a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimbersCourt/comments/g7hkt1/how_to_defeat_a_demon_king_in_ten_easy_steps/fohkkdl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][year]] before it gets released into text.

*** Hey, thanks for posting this here! There's definitely a lot of the same kind of lateral thinking and weird rules exploits stuff that I generally write. It's a comedy/parody, so keep that in mind, but it's probably something people who are in the mood for a light rationalish work might enjoy.

Also, free for the first few days for Audible subscribers, so that's a plus.

**** No problem. I think I should have waited until it was out though. People here seem to think getting news about preorders to be spam.

***** That's kind of weird to me, since it's only a week off. But hey, I suppose every subreddit has a different culture.

****** I'll say thank you for posting I appreciated the free audiobook, and will probably buy it at some point in a mobi or epub, because I like the bag mage and Zelda parody.

** I'm interested in this book but I've never read anything by the author. Is this book connected to or a sequel to any of his previous works, or can I listen to this one first?

*** It's a stand-alone so you don't need to read anything else. It's also a lot shorter than most of his other stories, so if you ever buy anything else by him, don't be surprised by the doorstop length.

**** Thanks! I had noticed the disparity in the lengths. Being so short in comparison, I thought this would be a good one to try out a new author (of it was standalone). Going to get on audible.

** The book is great I've listened to it 3 times. I would love a sequel or something similar. Is this his only comedy book?
