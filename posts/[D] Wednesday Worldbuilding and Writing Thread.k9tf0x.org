Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** There exist a multitude of magical methods to [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-plants/][speak with plants]] and [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals/][animals]]. All evidence points towards plants and animals having sentience. It is soon widely (though not universally) agreed that eating plants and animals is unethical; similar to how the idea of eating dogs, cats, or dolphins is currently perceived.

Exceptions to both the magic and ethical objection include fruits, fungi, algae, microbes, and animal products like eggs, milk, and honey. Most "vermin" are also exceptions, including all insects, arachnids, gastropods, and nematodes. Note however that nuts and seeds are widely viewed as ethically unacceptable for consumption, even though they haven't (yet) grown enough to be communicated with via any magic.

- What does the diet and agricultural system of this setting look like? How do people get adequate nutrition?

- How do people get textiles, dyes, cooking/heating fuel, or construction materials?

- What would likely be some common dishes in this setting?

- What is the view towards herbivores or carnivores - for example is it ethical to raise sheep for wool and milk even if they eat grass?

**** There are a few magical ways to produce non-sentient nutrition:

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-to-flesh/][Stone to flesh:]] A 3' diameter 10' long cylinder of stone can be transmuted into "a fleshy substance." The texture, flavor, and nutritional value would probably be similar to spam. It's a somewhat high level spell, so roughly only one in 31,000 people are able to cast it, though they could all cast this at least daily. The spell yields about 70 cubic feet of flesh, or roughly 4,170 pounds of product.

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-food-and-water/][Create food and water:]] This provides enough food to feed three people for a day per spellcaster level. It's a third-level spell, and roughly 1 in 200 people can cast it at least daily, and each of them would be able to feed at least 15 people when they do.

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dream-feast/][Dream feast:]] This can feed one person when cast. It's a 1st-level spell, and roughly 1 in 26 people can cast it at least daily.

Taken together, these could easily provide about 25% of the nutritional needs of the population. If the spellcasters were tasked (or paid) to provide 100% of the world's food requirements, they would likely be able to do it, though it would take away a lot of their ability to use spells for other purposes like healing, teleportation, divination, etc.

***** I can see a few 'ethical eating' communities forming around high-level spellcasters, but I can't see this sort of thing catching on beyond that. (The communities themselves will be short-lived, because they - for obvious reasons - collapse almost instantly once the spellcaster dies or leaves them).

Some of them will be pretty much cults - and the spellcasters will often require heavy fees (up to and including "everything you own"). The result of this is that said communities would probably be looked down on by the wider world.

*** I'm gonna be honest, this scenario seems like an existential nightmare. Given that it was the case, I can only imagine that the response of many people, rather than to find ways around the murder/mass slaughter of thousands or millions of sapients, would be to deny that sapience in the first place, or ignore/purposefully try not to think about it (considering that's a common enough way of tackling sources of existential dread in our world, as far as I'm aware). I mean, there's already plenty of human death in our world which could theoretically be avoided with minimal to moderate changes to lifestyle (for example, everyone decides to research diamond companies so that they can avoid buying blood diamonds), but... it's not the case that people do that. Because there's too much suffering to tackle every bit of the problem with alterations to lifestyles. Outrage fatigue plays a part in this, and I can only imagine that it must be more prevalent in this created world as well.

But let's presume that people still try their best, because I like the optimistic spin, and happy stories make me happy. Stone and its derivatives (concrete, metal from ore, and so on) seem relatively okay, with the initial problem being the initial harvest. One work around the 'wood is immoral to harvest/farm' issue could be a funeral culture of harvesting the bodies of the dead so that they may provide in death as they did in life. Animals have their meat eaten and their bones turned into glue, trees have their wood forged into tools and houses, and so on, but this is treated very respectfully, perhaps with a culture of 'death-smiths' and related profession surrounding it. Most of these products would presumably be rare, valuable, and precious to their owners on a sentimental level.

Coral reefs could theoretically be a source of concrete and decoration, if I remember correctly. They're made of polyps, which while animals, /might/ be vermin depending on how you define it. If that is the case, then coral reefs could be an excellent source of material, and potentially dye? I'm not sure if dyes can be garnered from them, but if it is the case, then that might work.

Silk would be even more valuable than normal. Not only can it be farmed entirely from 'vermin' creatures (silk-worms) but if you altered their diet a bit, you could have them be fungivores or carnivores. Interestingly, with the distinctions you make between vermin and larger animals, the existence of carnivorous insects is more moral than the existence of herbivorous ones (since while herbivorous insects eat the sapient plants, the carnivorous insects only eat the non-sapient herbivorous insects, with a few exceptions). This would have an interesting effect on the cultural perceptions of some of these vermin compared to earth, I think - caterpillars and butterflies being seen as sinful, empty plagues, while spiders are more of a heroic defence system by the earth to defend its inhabitants. Tailor this to your personal choice, of course, but I think it's an interesting route to explore.

Fuel is a tricky one. If you have magic, then maybe an 'eternal flame' style of spell could be used, to burn without the need for wood or charcoal. It also creates the interesting aesthetic of towns clustered around magical fires, while living in the wilderness is immoral or dangerous depending on the individual. Perhaps government wizards go around fruit orchards, fungi fields, or insect farms on the outskirts of the nation to provide newly built settlements additional flames as required. This, of course, makes a lot of assumptions about your magic system, but I can't imagine an easy non-magical method off the top of my head, save for perhaps some strange flammable algae I'm not aware of.

Shelter is an important note. Because it's so much harder to produce morally, I could certainly see more communal housing being a thing. Also, perhaps cave homes? I can imagine people taking over natural caverns as a community and then civilising them, hobbit hole style, to reduce the need for building materials.

That's all I can think of right now, but I hope it helps you build this terrifying experience!

Meat grown from cell culture is presumably non-sentient as long as you're not growing brains. Whether a specific plant product can be ethically cultured depends on which parts of a plant are required for sentience. If you grow a log of wood in a vat, does it become sentient?

Whole lettuce leaves would probably be an issue. In real-life, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_communication][plant communication]] can be carried out with volatile organic compounds emitted by glands found on leaves, and received by receptors on the leaves of other plants. This can be used to warn nearby plants about danger, like crop-eating pests, and induce those plants to secrete compounds that would kill or repel pests, or else substances which would attract insects that would eat the pests. I haven't sifted through research on lettuce to see what's known about the extent of communication and response that lettuce leaves are capable of, but given a setting with magical lettuce that can hold a conversation, I suspect whole leaves would be too much of the plant.

***** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant%20communication][Plant communication]]*

Plants can be exposed to many stress factors such as disease, temperature changes, herbivory, injury and more. Therefore, in order to respond or be ready for any kind of physiological state, they need to develop some sort of system for their survival in the moment and/or for the future. Plant communication encompasses communication using volatile organic compounds, electrical signaling, and common mycorrhizal networks between plants and a host of other organisms such as soil microbes, other plants (of the same or other species), animals, insects, and fungi. Plants communicate through a host of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be separated into four broad categories, each the product of distinct chemical pathways: fatty acid derivatives, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, amino acid derivatives, and terpenoids.

Cellular agriculture focuses on the production of agriculture products from cell cultures using a combination of biotechnology, tissue engineering, molecular biology, and synthetic biology to create and design new methods of producing proteins, fats, and tissues that would otherwise come from traditional agriculture. Most of the industry is focused on animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs, produced in cell culture rather than raising and slaughtering farmed livestock. The most well known cellular agriculture concept is cultured meat.

*** There is a good argument that the spell merely makes animals/plants smart enough to speak and hold an intelligent conversation temporarily, not that they are inherently smart enough to do so. Presumably, this (or another justification) is the tune most people and cultures would take when the alternative is starving to death or admitting that you and everyone in your family is a ruthless mass murderer.

That said, I do think a good answer to this would be breeding feed "animals" that don't count as animals for the purposes of the spell, so while obviously our world has no reason to breed massive insects or spiders presumably they would have spent thousands of years doing just that.

*** Re: your last point, kinda gives the premise a very shaky foundation. If nearly everything is sentient then why should humans set different standards than everyone else? Just increasing living standards should be enough. Maybe it could be figured out which animals cause the least suffering in what they eat and those could be farmed.

Why no nuts or seeds? Can you still eat seeds as part of something else, like a strawberry?

Algae vats would be viable if the infrastructure already exists.

There's going to be a weird intermediary period where people have to keep eating sentient life, that'll be interesting.

Generally yes, seeds eaten whole are typically okay. Many seeds actually grow best after passing through animal digestive tracts, like the seeds of cherries, raspberries, and blackberries.

This is an interesting point. However, consider that mountain lions have no qualms about eating cats and dogs. Even though wild predators are okay with that situation, we very much are not. We do have different standards, and we're generally willing to go to great lengths to enforce our standards wherever possible.

*** Given that this references DnD, I assume this is the kind of magical world where Ents also exist, and the trees can talk to each other? In that case, it seems the only thing remotely close to ethical is to kill of all herbivorous and omnivorous animalia, living of their flesh for a short while but eventually dooming all the carnivores to starvation as well. During this intermediate time, do a bunch of research to make sure all the animals (except for strict pollinators, probably mainly bees) are realy dead and will stay dead, try to expand and supply the ent population with tools to deal with any unforeseen complications or resurgence of animals, etc. Might want to spend some resources transferring knowledge and culture to the trees as well. As the ents, hopefully they'll make sure to maximally promote healthy trees and minimize shorter-lived plants. The ideal outcome here is the only living things on the planet are trees and ents (and needed non-sentient symbiotes like bacteria and mycorrhizal fungus and pollinators), that all have no frustrated needs or desires except occasionally the weather, and live for many centuries.

*** Sentience doesn't automatically imply wanting to live (or any other sort of worldviews for that matter). I mean enough sentient people have committed suicide, and I'm sure there's enough people and/or cults that aren't as fussed about death as most (just look for mass suicides through history for the low-hanging fruit I guess). I mean enough major religions exist where eternal suffering and torture for large swathes of people is a core belief as well.

I think you overestimate how much such a world would have different actions, it would likely just have different ethical justifications with a higher tolerance for more brutal punishments like torture, maiming and execution (which have all cropped up plenty in history anyway).

Edit: I was going to talk more about sentient plants/animals being accepting of death specifically as an example, that was the worldview point, but distracted myself with the other points.

Also random thought, but a parody isekai where all the plants are extreme masochists who talk constantly about wanting to be devoured would be a hilarious one-shot.

** Wanted to share and get some feedback on my interpretation of the Pokémon universe, I feel like this interpretation solves most of the issues cannon has while still holding the sprit of the world:

Pokémon are *aliens*. The Pokémon world is pretty much our world but which Pokémon appeared whatever number of years ago in from "somewhere else" (where and how exactly is not that important, you can make something rational along the lines of; arceus ported them over or Pokémon were originally just Mew with transform and became all the Pokémon we see now, or other shenanigans with the legendries, Noas arc style reality destruction, w/e). Also Pokemon are *energy beings.* As in, they are made from some sifi/magic shenanigans, and differentiate from humans and earth animals because they aren't fully physical. (I think from a more detailed perspective they could be something like a "projection" on the physical world, but practically they are as physical as anything else other than 1) pokeballs and 2) they can't die that easily (if they have blood/organs at all which can depend on the setting).

I feel like a setting like this fixes all the issues current interpretations have such as:\\
- Do animals exist? (yes)\\
- What is meat, do Pokémon eat each other? (maybe but they don't have to, nor do humans - but their "projections" are just as real as anything else so CAN be eaten -see: slowpoke tails)\\
- How do pokeballs work? (Pokémon are energy beings)\\
- Why can't you use the same space tech for anything else? (Because they are all purely matter - UNLESS, a possible "technological advancement" could be simulating Pokémon's nature with other things, this could make items which can specifically be held in containers with this "special matter" such as bikes, but humans will still not be able to use it.)\\
- Why are Pokémon based on Animals/Human items? (If we go with some sort of scenario where Pokémon are created in some way, they would obviously mimic their environment. Or, since they are malleable as being made of energy at the core, they could "adapt")\\
- If Pokémon are intelligent (which they can be) isn't this slavery? (Yes, but you can add some things with Pokémon largely not being against following trainers cos alien mindsets. - Or, one I like a lot which is the interpretation the story "dreaming of family" uses; for whatever reason Pokémon just get stronger when with a trainer, and most join willfully; they also have instincts which make them want to get stronger in the first place, and enjoy battling but are otherwise treated like family by most trainers.)\\
- Why are tiny kids going on Pokémon Journeys? (This setting I feel would make the world safer in some ways but more dangerous in others; humans (and kids) would still be walking around with nukes in their pockets but there wouldn't be much reason for wild Pokémon to attack people; so a journey into the wild like this to have kids cultivate their own personal strength actually makes much more sense to me.)\\
- What are pokemon moves/types? (Moves/types can be made possible by this same "energy", and this can also explain all the resistances/immunities/super effectiveness of types, with types being different types of energy a Pokémon is made up off/uses. This can explain matter-out-of-nothing and all the other shenanigans of the Pokémon universe which make no sense)

So what do you guys think? And if you like it, feel free to use any of this for your Pokémon fanfics- I love them XD.

** I've been kicking around a little SciFi concept lately and wanted to get some feedback.

The setting has a vaguely moderate-future level of extrapolateable technology, mostly in the biosciences, available, along with some degree of excellence in reactor technology (fission, fusion, and antimatter). The setting also has a smattering of what are understood to be ancient alien factories, still operating; stick raw materials in the input, get the preprogrammed output.

One of these factories makes sublight drives. Attach this drive to a conductive metal, hit it with photons or the right kind of energetic particles, and whatever contiguous metal it's attached to plus a radius of 100m out moves in the direction you hit it at exactly .1c without any inertial effects once it's built up enough energy for one second of motion. (Think of it as a perfect capacitor. It's not an infinite-energy device.) These pretty much never break, so acquiring one is trivial (we're talking less than a million bucks in today's dollars, available in whatever quantity you desire) but powering it is obviously not.

Another factory makes single-shot FTL jump drives. These create a disjunction to FTL travel at both the source and destination which increases exponentially based on how far you travel. As a standard, if you jump a light year, you generate two bubbles of this disjunction; at the center of each bubble it's impossible to jump out for two years, and the duration decreases as you travel in any direction until there's no effect two light-years out. That said, the mass of the ship is completely irrelevant; there's volume limits, you can't move a planet, but you can move cubic kilometers by the hundreds for sure, possibly by the thousands. These are, similarly, extremely cheap and available.

There's a factory that makes paired ... something between a cranial jack / implant and a headset. Wear them for long enough and you start being able to feel the emotions of the person wearing the pair when they're in range (very short, maybe as little as 10ft), to the limit of that person's attunement.

What other kinds of neat alien technology might exist that would fit into this mold? What neat things can you think of (that aren't war), or consequences that jump out at you about these pieces of tech?

*** Do you have any thoughts on what the ancient aliens ' purpose in leaving this technology behind was? For example, in Mass Effect >! the Reapers made the titular technology and the mass relays available because it was easy for them to deal with, compared to other technological paths. !< But other aliens might intend for their successors to receive their technologies as humanitarian aid, or as a way to uplift them into whatever transcended society they've formed, or simply whatever survived the fall of their civilisation. Deciding on that might make it easier to come up with related factories.

With the existing ones, the cheap FTL drives seem like they wouldn't be usable for routine transportation due to that disjunction effect. Instead, I imagine they'd mainly be used as transport for exploration craft far enough from anyone else that the disjunction wouldn't cause problems. If they're cheap enough, they might also be used on planetary surfaces as an alternative to conventional methods of escaping the gravity well, as such a short distance would mean that they could be used more often, but that would be vulnerable to disruption from someone jumping a longer distance.

In addition to use by couples or parents wanting a closer emotional connection with their loved ones, the empathic implants might also see use by co-pilots, spacewalk buddies, and other pairs of workers in jobs that involve close proximity and require a high degree of teamwork.

I imagine the sublight drives would lead to an infrastructure of energy beamed from solar arrays to fuel most in-system transport. The arbitrary 1s, 100m, and 0.1c values might be used as measurement standards. Also, the movement is a minimum of 0.1 light-seconds, which is about the same as the distance between the earth and the moon. That might make lunar colonies more viable.

**** The closest there is to a consensus in-setting is that the aliens built these self-repairing, more-or-less indestructible factories to be part of the commons, and then broke the universe somehow. Probably with the punch drives.

This conclusion is entirely wrong. I'm not totally decided on what the truth is; right now I'm leaning to "the galaxy is basically an ant farm" with the technology left behind being either there to make things more interesting, there to test a theory, or both.

*** Not all of these factories are /safe/, however. One produces cranial jacks/headsets that, to all appearance, put whoever wears them into a coma; they still have brain activity, but seem to constantly be in a state of fear. (For safety reasons, it's only been tested on rabbits, and similar). Of course, at some point some evil sadist tries to use these as a torture device... and it turns out that this device is a full-sensory-immersion RPG. Once you defeat the main boss, you wake up again (but for some reason, the virtual world is filled with bunnies who keep fleeing from every encounter...).
