Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the power to spread disease. That is, the power to /spread/ it, not manufacture it. Whenever you see two people that are within 100m of each other, you can infect one with any disease that the other has. You just need to see both people, not touch or go near them. There is no limit to the number of times you can use this ability. You can only spread diseases that are caused by germs, not injuries or genetic problems. Can this power be used to become rich/conquer the world/help humanity?

*** Are you immune to any diseases? Can you +move+ Shift the disease from one to another, without making both have the disease?

Can you use any of your ability on yourself? This is incredibly powerful, but still somewhat dangerous, especially if you go seeking rarer diseases, because even if you don't need to touch the afflicted, you might expose yourself to other diseases along the way.

The power to transfer say, HIV from one person in a crowd, to everyone else in a crowd and within such a short period of time is VERY powerful.

**** HIV is not the worst disease to have: in a vulnerable population a simple flu will kill people far, far quicker than even untreated HIV which takes months if not years.

If you really want to kill people you probably want to spread rabies (if parasites count as germs), since it kills quickly and reliably. Especially if the power works on animals...

***** Sure, HIV isn't the worst thing to have, but it might be more subtle than a crowd all gaining rabies, depending how you plan on doing things.

You dont /need/ to have the power able to transfer rabies to humans, if you nab someone you could overpower, and then nab a rabid dog, and let it transfer naturally, then you can use your superpower that way.

This power is kinda quite evil, huh.

****** Also HIV is well optimized as a wasting disease: it takes a shitload of resources to keep someone with HIV alive, and it never goes away.

Ironically, someone could probably use this to positive social ends. Go to Washington DC with someone HIV positive, and beam HIV into Congresspeople till they're motivated enough to cure it.

Yes. Though you would be afflicted with that disease. Might be worth it if you have a cure to the disease though.

Yep, this is something your ability can totally do. Though it will be very suspicious if you are the only one in a crowd of people who doesn't get infected with HIV.

*** Point of information for others to use: most people have a butt-ton of asymptomatic diseases, so even a single person would be a vector for a few dozen diseases.

Question: Does it work on animals? I'm guessing not because you said 'people' but if it works on animals I can carry a bat with rabies around with me... (in a cage!)

Question: By 'germ' I assume you're using a catch-all designation for viruses/bacteria. Do parasites (e.g. rabies) count? Do prions (e.g. mad cow) count? What about toxins (e.g. poison mushroom, medication overdose)?

Question: Can you tell what diseases someone has by looking at them?

Question: Do you have to see them IRL or, for example, if you watched a video of a president giving an address to a large crowd, you could give the president the worst disease in the crowd?

--------------

Generally, if I have the ability to identify diseases, I'd use that to be some sort of medical psychic and win a bunch of skeptic prizes, use that fame and some cold reading to become famous that way and I'm rich. (Even without identifying diseases, I can also "predict" who will get which diseases by causing them, cast "curses", and so on: the problem is if people are able to prove I did it I could go to prison and that would suck).

If I wanted to help humanity, I'd get some of the worst diseases in the world and bring them to rich people - multi-millionaires tend to start charities to raise money and awareness for diseases that people they know have, so I'd take advantage of that.

I can't think how I'd conquer the world, short of killing probably the entire population of England and then also most of Australia and getting myself on the British throne somehow, and I'm not sure I'd even be eligible as I was born out of wedlock and the British royal family has weird rules like that (my parents, who have been together since 1980, finally got married three years ago because they went to vegas and they figured they had to since that's what you do there; but I digress...).

In conquering the world and/or helping humanity, I'd also do some Kira-like vigilantism, which would be an easier feat if I could carry a rabid bat around with me which I probably can't. I don't think this would be very easy as the sort of people I'd most want to kill in this context would be people who would have good access to medicine and poor access to really, really sick people.

**** I'm going to limit the ability to only work on humans, and only on diseases that actually affect the first target. So you cannot bring around some kind of carrier who is immune to tons of diseases but carries all of them.

I will allow parasites and prions, but not toxins. The disease has to be something that can reproduce itself and so look like it could have spread without your ability. Rule of thumb: if the disease can be spread by taking blood from one person and injecting it into the other, your ability will work.

No you cannot tell what diseases someone has by looking at them. But you can say, see that someone is coughing, and spread whatever disease is making him cough to another person without knowing what that disease is. Your ability will fail if his cough isn't actually a disease (or the target you are trying to spread the disease to is immune to that disease), but there are no penalties or side effects from failed uses of your ability.

Hmm. Yeah, you would need to somehow get them near fatally ill people, which would probably require you to get accomplices willing to abandon their hospital treatments to come around with you. It also wouldn't be very safe, since the diseases you spread may end up spreading on their own, killing innocent people by accident. For example, if you go visit an imprisoned serial killer with your accomplice, and spread rabies to him, the serial killer may later bite another prisoner and then the disease may end up spreading to the entire prison before it is caught.

***** Depending how amoral you are, you could hire someone to go into a hospital with you, transfer something horrifying to them, then follow you to somewhere you know your Kira target is going to be. Two people die, but if you did things right you could set it up that some unpunished criminal was the one following you around.

How do you define "affect"? The three asymptomatic colds I no doubt have right now are affecting my immune system, but they're just not causing /visible symptoms/.

So if someone has an "invisible" disease like, say.... well, let's go with a worm infection. They're probably in a lot of pain if it's severe, losing weight, wasting away, etc, but in the early enough stages they'll look pretty normal even if they are being affected. Can I not spread their worms? Or do I need to guess they have worms?

Glad to blow minds! It's what I'm here for! :) Yeah, I watched /The Celebrity Apprentice/ (even the most recent season with The Arnold replacing The Donald), and the celebrities played to raise money for charities, and it was usually a charity they or a family member was personally affected by. So it was an interesting trend.And actually, there was one celebrity whose charity was some disease nobody had ever heard of, and he was like, "the people with this disease have a really hard time, so I am raising money for them", and usually Obscure Disease Charity Celebs have a cousin or kid with the disease (e.g. Trace Adkins had a food allergy charity because his daughter has a peanut allergy), but nope, this guy was just feeling bad for these people with this rare disease. Don't remember his name but I remember being surprised by the lack of connection.

The big problem is that most infectious diseases just aren't fatal enough to weaponise. You'd probably need to do it on a lot of fronts at once. Twenty years ago HIV might have been a good start, but now it's kind of useless in the first world unless it goes undetected a very long time (which is going to be your best bet, really - give someone HIV, hope they don't find out on a blood test, then give them a bunch of flus and whatnot to take advantage of the AIDS when it develops...)

*** Honestly your best bet with this power is almost certainly to use it to spread colds/influenza in controlled circumstances in order to prove you have powers and get rich/famous. At some point in the future there might be utility from this power in that you can use it to rapidly spread retroviruses and that it's creating matter from nothing, thus preventing the heat death of the universe long term.

Fundamentally using this to spread pandemics just isn't likely to serve you any good, and you'd probably get caught pretty quickly (since the CDC is smart enough to know if a disease looks like it's spreading through deliberate infection).

I'm not sure this would end well. I can imagine getting rich by proving you have a supernatural ability to make coins disappear, but proving you have a supernatural ability to spread disease seems more likely to end with you burning at the stake. After all, there will be tons of sick people wondering if they got sick naturally, or if they got sick because you spread the disease to them. So even if you never used your ability on them, there could be tons of people out for your blood, screaming vengeance to the high heavens.

***** Do you think we live in the middle ages? All you need to demonstrate is an ability to spread colds from one person to another in relatively close proximity, there's no reason to assume such an extremely limited power would lead to some sort of panic.

Plus like with any demonstration of supernatural abilities you would probably go to a european country unlikely to kidnap and do experiments on you first and the local government isn't just going to turn you over to panicked masses. Though really I think you overestimate the degree to which this is actually liable to cause genuine mass panic.

*** One place where this could be useful would be in diagnostics:

If you can determine which (germ-based) diseases someone has by sight, this would make you a near-perfect diagnostician. That could be very valuable, both as a day job and for pandemic prevention. If instead you just spread all the diseases the "donor" has, that would be less useful unless you can find people in good health who are willing to be infected with unknown diseases to improve someone else's diagnosis. I guess depending on where personhood starts you could also use IVF to produce "people" in petri dishes and transfer the diseases to them, which might be easier to analyse.

Other ideas:

Public health: Get one person with a very mild form of an otherwise dangerous disease at a large public gathering and use them to perform an invisible mass vaccination. This might be easiest to perform from space, depending on how visible individuals need to be and how easily you can get access to the ISS.

Intrigue: Provide spies with samples of different mild bacteria that they can infect themselves with to encode information. When the spy appears in public, transfer their illnesses to yourself and determine which ones are present. This would be almost completely undetectable, other than requiring you to see the other person.

SETI: How clear a view of the person do you need to have? If you can look at the night sky and detect diseased people beyond Earth, that has strong implications for the Great Filter. You can also transfer their diseases back to Earth to get an idea of their biology, and send them the various SETI broadcasts encoded in the DNA of a custom bacteria strain.

FTL: Do lenses and mirrors still count when viewing someone? If so, you might be able to set up a very elaborate optical arrangement where you view two people who are very long distances from each other, then try transferring a disease between them to see whether this transfer occurs faster than light. Of course, you'd need an immediately detectable disease, and this probably wouldn't be worth the effort.
