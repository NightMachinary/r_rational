** Saw someone mention my book here earlier and I remembered that some people in the subreddit might be interested.

For those of you who aren't already familiar, [[https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB/][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]] is a novel with a mix between dungeon crawling and time spent learning magic at an academy.

It's set in a world that's heavily inspired by Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy and the Tales series, but where game mechanics are treated like normal elements of the world. For example, there are justifications for respawning monsters, dungeons with rooms that constantly changing, character classes, levels, etc.

There's a heavy emphasis on learning the rules of how magic works. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you might like these books.

**** How is it better? I read the first and generally found it to be meh. Is it worth trying the 2nd?

Edit: Just to be clear, I don't think this was a bad book and I don't mean any criticism about the work to the author. it was quite well written and it did keep me reading through to the end, it just wasn't quite for me, I think.

***** The first i found it to be ok. In spite a couple of flaws. Biggest i think it to be too infodumpy and with an ending cut 50 pages too soon to be truly satisfing.

This one had all the good bits with much smaller info dumps. Less teenage drama. A few new characters that are really engaging and cute (i love researcher) and an ending that is much better

Not if you disliked the first.

I am loving the second, but I loved the first too. It isn't different enough to warrant a chance if you have already found the series not to your tastes.

But then I am only like 40% through it so my opinion might be worthless.

****** I didn't dislike the first, I just wasn't drawn in. I found the way magical power was gained to be too arbitrary: powerful entities give it to people to further their own goals, but also as reward for solving puzzles and whatnot for no particularly clear reasons. Is it similar in the 2nd?

***** I just finished the second, it's similar to the first just done better imo. I think it fixed some of the problems the first had, and is a pretty fun book. Overall though it's a sequel, and if you didn't like the first, you might not like the sequel.

*** Loved it! Minor editing error, I think: at location 8214 in the kindle ebook, Sheridan is referred to as a woman:

It's important, when working towards a large goal, to set yourself smaller goals along the way so that you do not get discouraged.

I might not like his personality, but he's already involved, and we can be reasonably confident *he's* wasn't working with Orden.
