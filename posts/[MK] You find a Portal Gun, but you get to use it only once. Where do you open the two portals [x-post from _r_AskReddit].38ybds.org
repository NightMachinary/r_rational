** Either

a) Hold onto it until astronomy is advanced enough to figure out if an exo-planet could support life, then aim very, very carefully.

b) as [[/u/_ShadowElemental]] said, a stable celestial body in /very stable/ solar orbit that's unlikely to deorbit if a lot of extra mass is added to it without being massive enough that the gravity well is a problem. Engines to compensate, maybe.

c) Put both ends on moveable plates. Give to NASA or other aerospace organization. You now have a spaceship that needs only enough fuel to get into orbit, can support as many humans as you want without supply problems, and can even manipulate its own mass by passing matter through the portal. The only limit to its acceleration would be c and the amount of earthside fuel we could pump through. They wouldn't need rocket fuel, either. We could literally pass them garbage to throw out the back end.

In fact, said spaceship could be expanded more or less to taste. Although there might be some... weird physics on the boundary once the far side accelerated to relativistic speeds.

Otherwise, yeh, put the portals onto two big solid steel plates and let NASA build a module around one and launch it to the ISS.

*** It could be that whenever you step through, you emerge (just after) whatever time you were at when you left. So even if one portal has 'subjectively' experienced 10 years and the other has only experienced one hour, stepping through the portal 30 minutes in would still only leave you 30 minutes+ walking time in, assuming the surface is flat. If the portal is vibrating forward and backward, I dread to think of what'd happen to your body at parts of it age at variable rates, but I guess it could still be used for inanimate things. Going through the other side would be the same. I hope I've understood what I've said correctly. Time is fucky.

Also, the gravitational potential thing has been discussed, and people think it might not violate the conservation of energy, because we don't know if it costs energy to go through a ground portal and emerge at a roof portal.

**** Sure, but there's nothing in space that's as easy to hit from the surface of the earth than the surface of the moon.

It may be that there's nothing in space other than the moon or /maybe/ the sun that you could credibly hit with a portal gun. And even the moon would be tricky. The sun would be really tough, with 8 minutes windage, and where would you anchor the other end?

Maybe if you could talk NASA into sending a kilometer-scale balloon to geosynchronous, but how would you talk them into it without a demo? You only have one shot.

Once you've got the portal to the moon you can start assembling a linear accelerator. It's much easier to do that, on the moon. Once you can demonstrate it there won't be much difficulty getting people building one that you can ship through a two meter hole in pieces.

One option for propulsion -- have anchor points around the edge of the plate. Have one plate in a vacuum chamber on Earth, one in orbit. Working from the Earth side, put a solar sail through the portal into orbit, with the anchorlines attached to the rim of the space-side plate. Shoot a laser through and voila, propulsion.

******* Could do, but I think the solar sail is going to be logistically easier.

- You don't need to worry about shutting it down in order to refuel, (or potentially blowing things up by hot fueling)
- The Earth-side portal room is going to be a vacuum chamber in order to prevent issues from pressure differential. Vacuum is a good environment for lasers
- With a rocket you need to get large tanks / hoses of rocket fuel into the Earth-side portal room, whereas with the laser you just need power cables.

For anything that required high thrust (e.g. to get out of a gravity well) the rocket would definitely be the way to go. For in-space cruising, though, I think you'd want the sail.

My other thought was to just shoot it in the direction of space that is most likely to not hit anything for a while in order to get it as far as possible, but then you risk hitting a star and messing up earth. Not sure if anything beats the high Earth orbit proposal.

***** Let's try it (hopefully someone will correct this calculation if they spot an error):

If the portals are relatively close to earth, then gravitational potential energy is u = mgh

The mass of a slice of water is dm = πR² dh D, where D is the density of water. The portals in the game are about a meter in radius.

Since every slice is teleported to the top of the column, H is constant, and we integrate du = dm g H to get:

u = πR² D g H²

The time it takes for a slice at the top to reach the bottom is t = √(2H/g), so the power is:

P = u/t

= (π/√2)R² D (gH)^{3/2}

If we could put a portal at the height of Mount Everest, and the other at sea level, and pour a column of water between them, the power output would be around 57,000 megawatts. Hydroelectric turbines are very efficient, ~80-95%, so most of this power would be available.

In comparison, the Hoover dam is 2,000 MW, and a typical coal plant is about 600 MW. The entire world's energy consumption is around 18,000,000 MW. So our Everest-height hydroelectric portal is much more than a single power plant, but much less than would be required to power the entire world.

The International Space Station is at a height of 400 km, so if we could put a portal on a geosynchronous orbit at that height, and ignore all the problems associated with a killer torrent of vaporizing space-water, the portal would produce about 17,000,000 MW, or just about exactly enough to power all of human civilization.
