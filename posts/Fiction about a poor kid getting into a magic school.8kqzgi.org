Hey, does anyone have a link to the fiction about a really smart kid in the lower class getting into a magic school and having to deal with all the issues surrounding that?

The story starts off with him being the son of a maid, and taking tutoring lessons with his rich friend. He studies really hard and makes #2 on the admittance test, so that he can follow her to school.
