[[http://www.kongregate.com/games/player_03/run-3][Run 3]] is a simple game with a minimalist excuse plot. You have to run through a tunnel with holes in it, and in the more difficult levels emptiness with platforms in it. I'd give a few highlights, but there's very little story so I feel like it would be spoiling it by having you read all the best rationalist parts beforehand.


** Interesting stuff, but I'd prefer to not spend even more time than I already have (an hour) in order to get a plot that might not even be all that interesting to me. If you could provide the plot in spoilers or via PM, that'd be great.
