Don't know either. Maybe contact whoever's hosting you?

***** I'll definitely try. I'm being hosted by WordPress, so I can't promise anything. If you would like, I have also posted the story over at [[/r/hfy]]

****** It's because you included "www" at the beginning. Your site doesn't have a "www" sub domain. My browser automatically stripped that out, and I think most of them do these days, but clearly some don't.

******** You mean it didn't throw an error on the [[http://www.thing.wordpress.com][www.thing.wordpress.com]]? Because that would be weird. The security certificate is pretty clear about not applying to sub-sub domains.

********* I mean I loaded this: [[https://www.sufficientlyanalyzedmagic.wordpress.com/2017/11/11/chapter-nine-lima-delta-alpha/]]

Got the error, removed the first part to make this: [[https://sufficientlyanalyzedmagic.wordpress.com/2017/11/11/chapter-nine-lima-delta-alpha/]] and then that loaded fine.
