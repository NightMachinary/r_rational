** Story is a crossover between a manga called The Gamer and an anime called RWBY. I have no familiarity with either of them, and this was not a problem. (In fact, I started reading The Gamer after this fic and gave up after a few pages). Requires very basic familiarity with CRPG tropes, at the level of the original Final Fantasy, but I imagine this shouldn't be a problem for most of us.

Link is to the first post of thread 1 of 4. I recommend reading exclusively via the indices on the first posts of each thread, unless you want to slog through ~600 pages of comments. Story appears to be updated consistently with one chapter per day.

One could probably argue for an [RST] tag--there's definitely an awareness of sunk costs and taboo tradeoffs.

On a side note, I am vaguely disappointed that I didn't know about spacebattles.com until very recently. It seems to be at least as good a source of entertaining fiction as FF.net or AO3.

*** Are you aware of the [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]] story?

It's the only one I have read on there but it is fantastic. Updates every day with short (~1500 word) updates.

How are you finding stories on that site? After finding With This Ring, I spent some time trying to find other quality fics and had no luck. It doesn't seem to be organized well to find new stuff.

**** The only other story I'm reading on the site is *[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]]*, which is a pretty interesting space opera. The last surviving human-built AI warship looks to extract revenge upon the alien society that destroyed Earth. Very reminiscent of the Halo universe.

**** When I find a good story on SB, I'll read the comments on the story, and if someone said something intelligent that I agree with, I'll check on any stories they've linked in their signature, and sometimes look through their post history for other stories they've commented on.

**** Yep, I've read the first few pages of With This Ring and it's on my to-read list.

I sorted the Creative Writing forum [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/?order=view_count][by views]] as a proxy for popularity. Popularity != quality, but it should at least have a non-zero correlation with the enjoyability of the story. Then I skimmed the opening posts of the first few threads. It just happened that The Games We Play was both enjoyable /and/ rational-ish. (EDIT: I may just have gotten lucky in stumbling upon TGWP. Continuing the above method in an attempt to find more interesting stories has been a failure so far...)

***** Be warned: the author is infamous for writing a brilliant first third of easily a hundred stories by now, and then abandoning them part way.

Still awesome, but often frustrating!

**** Nothing wrong with writing on the forums but they seriously need a repository as it's just so inefficient to use one master post to click through posts, it's also as you say terrible for finding new good stuff.

*** The Gamer.

I've been reading The Gamer. It has a lot of munchkin potential, with a character that can invent new abilities and can choose which stats to boost regardless of how he trained for XP.

He even chooses to mainly boost intellect in the canon.

But the manga hasn't really lived up to its munchkin potential. I still think its good, and i have more than enough time to keep up with something that only updates once a week, but there's a reason I never opted to post it here.

Edit: That does also make it ripe for making rational.

**** The main issue is that it's a never-ending training arc with almost literally no development of the plot or characters. You could shuffle around the chapters in almost any order and the story wouldn't be meaningfully affected. It's fun for a while, but I wouldn't pay money to read it.

*** Ya, I hadn't watched RWBY but I'd seen it mentioned a few times and so after catching up with your story I took a night and watched through Tue series. Definitely affected how I view certain characters.

** That link is somewhat ridiculously outdated.

I'd try [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-four.311394/][thread four, here,]] as it has an up to date index as well as being the thread that updates are currently being posted in.

** I'll second this recommendation. I didn't post it here myself because I'm not sure exactly how rational it would be considered (like with "With This Ring"), but I've been enjoying this fic /thoroughly/ pretty much since it began.

What I'm saying is - whether it's rational or not, it's a good story, and I recommend it for that.

*** Just out of curiosity, why don't you think With This Ring would be considered rational? The world it exists in isn't particularly rational, but the SI charachter is constantly recognizing things that don't make sense and attempting to fix them where possible. And since we still don't have an explanation for what the world is or how he got into it, the fact that the SI charachter is the only person (or one of the few at least) that attempts to go about things in a rational manor, maximizing goals, etc., qualifies it in my book.

**** It's not that I don't think it's rational, it's that I don't think I'm a good judge of these things.

The "problem" is that I have no issues engaging my suspension of disbelief when the story is engaging, and so I will miss plot holes and obvious issues.
