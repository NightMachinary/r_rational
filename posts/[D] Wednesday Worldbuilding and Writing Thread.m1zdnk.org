Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I realize this isn't exactly on topic, but I'd like to point out that "lair" is a Russel Conjugation of "home", implying that the inhabitant is a reptile.

** Expand on two of my fantasy settings for me please!

I would like some opinions on what nock-on effects my particular magic systems would have in a random standard fantasy world. Thanks in advance!

System 1: There is a second dimension (lets call it the "Aether") which is a memetic dimension, created and interacts almost solely with consciousness.\\
In this world, all consciousness gets "reflected" in this dimension, each brain has a live "recording" of their consciousness in this dimension (which I will call a "soul" but it (usually) has no effect back on the individual brain).\\
This reflection is just that; if it is "wipped away" or destroyed, it would be just like deleting a picture in your phone of a scene, the scene would not be affected and the picture will return when you take another. (so the soul would reform eventually).\\
The magic system in this world, is through certain materials/training w/e (some cool suggestions here would be appreciated as well) certain people and/or objects/items can allow themselves to be affected by the Aether. E.g. "soul sight" is when a individual somehow allows their photon receptors in their eyes to be affected by the light equivalent in the aether. This makes them able to "see" in the aether and hence see the souls (and whatever else is in there, e.g. a "ghost" is a self-perpetuating soul (consciousness recording))\\
This would allow the user to see people's minds as they are active (and through training be able to read into that - suggestions on what could be gleaned from effectively seeing live MRI scans of people's brains in a medieval setting would also be appreciated), but it also makes them vulnerable to influence from the Aether. (e.g. Ghosts, and soul attacks only affect those who can actually "see" or "feel" it).

Lastly, one phenomenon which is possibly with this system for isekai plot purposes, is strong enough souls, with the right materials, etc can be attached to an item and have the soul re-create the consciousness it is a recording off into that item. (Effectively, it will attempt to create a silicone brain in whatever object it is it is trying to mold itself into. If it manages to reflect itself enough into the object, so the object can start perpetuating the soul, it will create a feedback loop and eventually solidify into an artificial consciousness.

Note: unlike in PITH, the soul in question would hold all autonomy of itself, it could kill itself, it couldn't really be made to feel pain etc. This is also extremely difficult and costly so is rare, but the rich tend to have a few willing such objects around the place. Note, that since the objects are made to be affected by the aether (to be able to "write" the brain into it) it also is vulnerable to soul attacks, and can influence themselves through their soul slightly. Not enough to say; levitate or animate something, but enough so that it could trigger "nerves" in automatons or wind up mechanical devides such as clocks within themselves to help them interact with the world. They would usually have soul-sight along with other soul senses and since physical sight is so integral to consciousness eventually create photo receptors to be able to see the world like they originally could.

What would be the consequences of this?

​

System 2:\\
All people have a "spirit", which kind of acts like the soul in the above system (a recording of what you are) except it is your whole physical nature not just mind and it actively back-influences your own body. As people train in something, it will influence the soul to be good at that, which the soul feeds back into the body to strengthen that even further creating a constant feedback loop. Effectively, this ends up working kind of like classes, skills and levels in litRPG's except without a system and all the actual numbers. A archer can become super-human at archery and so-on.

One common "class" is a Tamer, (beast tamer, druid, w/e). This is a "class" which at some point has the individual merge their spirit with a companion animal. They and the animal end up taking the most prominent traits from the other. usually, a human's most prominent trait is its intelligence (brain); making the animal smarter but not look much different, while the animal's are whatever physical characteristics are special to it, which basically make the human a low-key furry.\\
This gets passed down to children as well, making most "nobles" or descendants of powerful people with a class that does this share their animalistic traits.

I want to not have the average person to all be some sort of geniuses, so there will be some excuse why all humans intelligence isn't amplified due to the spirit (unless they focus heavily on it).

What would be the logical consequences of a setting like this on on a fantasy world?

​

Thanks to anyone bothering to read all this XD.

*** System 1: The first thing to come to my mind is that there will be some /deeply/ unpleasant people seeking immortality for themselves. Think 'an eternal Hitler, forever leading the rise of Germany' to get the sort of idea I'm considering... though of course Hitler /in person/ has no place in a medieval story, I can imagine a similar person having a similar idea.

System 2: One way to counter the intelligence-amplification effect is simply to have both Beast and Tamer tilt themselves somewhat towards each other... so that while the Beast gains in intelligence, the Tamer /loses/. And that gets passed down in the genetics as well (so the more 'furry' traits someone has, the less intelligent they are, on average). On top of that, for non-Tamers, their intelligence /is/ amplified due to the Spirit, which works out to the average person having somewhere around average human-level intelligence (with some incredible geniuses and incredible dullards both around the place). How's that for a suitable excuse?

**** Hmm, im not sure I like much narratively having "tamers" be dumb, to reduce the average intelligence with that excuse they would have to be really dumb. I think probably something along the lines of intelligence just being too complex for the soul to amplify effectively (or does with diminishing returns) would work better narratively. It is a good point though and can give some more world-building: Bad joins and good joins, some spirit merging goes wrong, and both partners loose as much as they gain, while a good merger aims to only pass the beneficial traits.

For the first point: that is a good point, its something I thought off but dismissed because I wanted to add the rule that "complex systems deteriorate" so even soul-bound items "age" mentally. But this may not have as big an effect as I thought and some ancient evils could add some easy interesting plot points.

***** On mergers: Eh, that's fair enough. Though the idea of a merger that only passes along /some/ things and not others raises all sorts of possibilities; if someone merges with a housecat, for example, they may gain any combination of the following:

- Ability to see in the dark
- Enhanced reflexes, especially when it comes to catching things
- Enhanced ability to move silently
- A habit of washing themselves in their own saliva
- A tendency to let other people think that they've got away with something - and then slam down the punishment for their transgression while they're already breathing a sigh of relief
- A compulsion to kill and eat birds, fish, and rodents if he sees any

And, of course, some of these are what he wants and some are not. But the question of what the tamer wants and what he does not might be /different/ for different people, or in different cultures; one culture, for instance, may frown /heavily/ on non-human appearance, while in another culture, non-human ears may be considered a sign of superior genetics and thus an attractive feature. Similarly, the cat-tamer's ability to move silently might be praised in one society (he can sneak up on our enemies!) and denigrated in another (you never know if that guy's sneaking up on you...)

Here's a thought: maybe they don't age in the same way as people do (because of not having a human body anymore) but, rather, they accumulate trauma as time goes on. An ancient sage, reborn in the form of a book, may once have had great wisdom and insights to share, until a great-grandson left him stuck in a drawer for a decade - when he was rediscovered, he'd undergone the equivalent of ten years' worth of sensory deprivation and was no longer quite sane. What makes this even /worse/ is that, for obvious reasons, all such possessed objects are not in human bodies; and the feeling of not being in the right body is the cause of all /sorts/ of possible traumas.

It's certainly possible that, in order to survive as a soul-bound item, the bound soul needs some sort of /dream/ to work towards; some powerful, all-consuming /AMBITION/ that allows them to ignore the fact that they are locked in the wrong body and have been for the last dozen decades or so and will be forevermore. The all-conquering despot has an ambition built in - he wants to Rule The World and nothing as trivial as mere mortality is going to stop him - but presumably other ambitions can also work (like the sword who used to be a famous fencer, and just lives to Fight Everything, or the sage-become-a-book whose ambition is to Learn Everything). But this also suggests that the ambition /itself/ might begin to warp the item - the sword, for example, might grow more and more bloodthirsty over time, encouraging its wielder away from peaceful paths simply because it prefers the rush of battle; and the sage-become-a-book may drift into less and less ethical means of experimentation and manipulation to find out new things (and maybe that's why he was locked in a drawer...)

**** For system one.

History would be completely different because there would be eye witnesses to events thousands of years ago. Maybe history /archeology is nonexistent.

Ghosts of experts would be like living libraries.

Language would evolve differently, or at least have some church latin separate from the vulgar tongue. Gotta learn to talk to old ghosts.

Without bodies, ghosts might lose human emotions or evolve new ones.

People might purposefully alter the ghost imprint they leave behind. To purify the parts of themselves they don't like, change memories so their ghosts tell an edited version of history, etc.

/This/ leads to entire rabbit holes of insanity. With even fairly minor changes, how long do ghosts remain anything that can be considered human?

****** It's not that eyewitnesses are better, it's that with them no one would have bothered to write things down in the first place. Thucydides would have never written about the peloponnesian war, as a letter to the future, if he knew all the eye witnesses would exist as ghosts. There might be history if ghosts are really rare or it's a newer invention though...
