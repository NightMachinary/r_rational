It's a lot harder to create discussions around a story after it finishes so I think this is the best time to gather around and reminisce. And after 5 years of following this story on a monthly basis, I think the MoL deserves a celebratory mega discussion, about the ending, our favorite scenes, characters, expectations, theories, comments, etc.

To me, this ending fits very well with the theme of the story. I thought Zorian would die and turn into a lich, especially since all his power and knowledge would make him into a very worthy undead immortal.

I only wished to see more of the classmates and teachers in action during this battle, so we can get some of that delicious reaction. Alongside that, the author could have included a segment with Taramatula estate battle with the Ikosian forces.

Overall, it's a great story. I'll miss waiting for future chaps after the epilogue. What do you guys think?


** I kind of want to see government reactions to Zorian. While he never has really had political aspirations, he's the best human mind mage who can bypass Mind Blank, connections to the psychic spiders living under Cyoria, the fancy teleportation grid thing, and the ability to do all of this and be at multiple places at the same time. People trying to fit him into their political calculus are going to be having a nightmare.

I always looked down on the Eagle Riders, and didn't realize they were strong enough to fight against Oganj for a few minutes. The last time they were in the story, they got their asses kicked easily when QI and Z&Z were fighting in that field.

It was by the Exiles, though, who are sort of a wild card when it comes to politics, and they can presumably get some great PR back by smashing the exiles, and helping The Isle would be bad optics for any of the other Splinters.

While I'm not disappointed in what we got, I definitely agree that the different parts of the battle could easily have been dragged out into 3 more chapters following many more of the many characters and factions introduced throughout the book.

AFAIK the reason explained for why Zorian does this is because simulacrums are made of ectoplasm and they can be dispersed with ease.

To effectively have the mind-web setup Zorian has at the end of the book he has to ensure his simulacrums don't just blow up to simple force spells.

Also I'm fairly certain the simulacrum spell only costs mana when creating a simulacrum. The magic system in MoL isn't defined very well but it really seems the only time you're burning mana at a constant rate is when you're consistently shaping mana.

Anyways that's beyond my point. Zorian uses golem bodies for his simulacrums so they don't get destroyed easily in combat.

********* Both reasons are mentioned for the golem bodies, in chapter 74:

#+begin_quote
  He was a brand new type of simulacrum that the original had thought up recently -- instead of being embodied into an ectoplasmic shell like a regular simulacrum, he had been attached to a real matter golem body designed to mimic the original. This was a step up from the base spell in just about every regard, granting him vastly increased durability and halving his maintenance cost at the same time. It allowed Zorian to maintain twice the usual number of simulacrums and ensured that they wouldn't be destroyed by relatively minor damage.
#+end_quote

Additionally, mana regeneration dipping negative is mentioned 10 chapters earlier, in chapter 64:

#+begin_quote
  He could only maintain three simulacrums at most without his mana regeneration going negative, so that was not an entirely irrelevant cost.

********* I think the last time it was referenced was at the start of "real month". He made 4 simulacrums, as that was the max he could do while keeping his mana regen at a decent rate. 1 stuck meditating, one defending his family. He was kinda salty only having 2 doing "real" work.

***** He couldn't inhabit the golem, because he wasn't a simulacrum, he was the "real" one. And he /could/ have made another simulacrum to inhabit the Mrva golem the whole time, but he was trying to limit how many simulacra he made I think. I'm pretty sure earlier on he discusses different kinds of simulacra bodies, but I don't remember if there were tradeoffs or not.

*** The simulacra /are/ golems. He stopped making them out of ectoplasm a really long time ago.

I agree Zorian probably could have enhanced them further than what he did, but there's no reason why he'd make them wear Iron Man armour when he could just as easily make them into, basically, Ultron bodies, and discard all of the squishy, vulnerable bits.

*** Nobody103 has talked about this. Basically, putting a soft fleshy body inside of a golem just removes some of the best parts of golems, namely that they can survive pieces of their bodies being blown out.

As far as the simulacra go, they are actually built around golem bodies, its what make them more efficient and durable. Nothing as crazy as Mrva, but Mrva has a different precious cargo to hold on to.

*** I got the impression that the core of a golem needed to hold the insanely complicated spell core that 'programmed' it, and therefore couldn't fit a person inside without significant loss of capability.

**** I was thinking the Simulacrum plasma body could morph into a liquid/gaseous state since he deformed his body when he was talking to the detective in the tavern.

Creating the core would be a lot tougher, but he could do something similiar like the Iasku Mansion soul. The necromancer dude used his wife's soul as the controller for the mansion, which Zorian could do something similar like that.

** I loved the ending and i will sorely miss reading this story, i wish nobody103 would continue writing it after a few months break. something like he said he was considering: a slice of life following our characters in their life, probably after a time skip.

i can't convey how i loved this story, this world, these characters.

only one tiny thing still annoy me:

i'm still disapointed RR is really Jornak. i forgot what i was saying in my several analysis of the subject but Nobody103 got us used to crazy plot twists and Jornak came really late in the story. All others important characters were in the first 3 chapters beside Silverlake and Alanik (both living in the far north and unrelated to the time loop storyline until zorian meet them)

i guess i was just unimpressed with him. I believed until the very end he was actually a puppet for the real RR. I think i just wanted a better villain

Of course it's nothing compared to what this awesome story brought to the table
