Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You are given a cardboard box and told that one week from now, the box and all of its contents will be transported 500 years into the past.

*RULES:*

- The box is a cardboard cube, roughly half a meter on each side.

- The box is moved in time, but not moved much in space. The time travel mechanism has a minimal level of intelligence, so everything is relative to Earth, and it will try to put the box somewhere where it will fit and can be supported. If the box's exact location would put it inside a solid object, it materializes somewhere nearby.

- The box can only appear where no one is looking.

- As such, you can choose where the box appears, but only if you can travel there (or have the box transported there) in the present. It would be advisable, therefore, to keep the weight to something you can lift.

- You can put anything into the box which you can get access to within the time limit.

- The box needs to be able to closed in order to go back in time. If you dump a huge stack of books into the box such that the lid cannot close, nothing happens at the end of the week.

What do you put in the box, and where do you put it, to have the greatest positive impact on the course of history?

*** Hmmmm.

...brief research leads me to a mathematician called Luca Pacioli, who died in 1517 (probably around June). I therefore propose to find out where he lived, and arrange for the box to appear in his attic or otherwise among his possessions, presumably after his death. I plan to insert into it a number of manuscripts detailing mathematical discoveries that were, in our timeline, not made for some years after his death - ideally, largely opening up new fields but leaving obvious and interesting questions unanswered as a goad to future research, but realistically probably a few dozen sixteenth- and seventeenth-century papers in their entirety. (And maybe a couple of more modern ones, too).

Luca gets a lot of questions asked, especially about how he got his printing so neat and regular, but it's posthumous and so no-one can answer them. The advances in mathematics push through a general advance in science and technology to the present day. That... should be good, right?

*** Volume of the box is .125 m^{3,} volume of a person in liters is approx. equal to weight in kg...my immediate response is to recruit a thin contortionist (59 kg -> 59 liters -> .059 m^{3)} , and spend the week planning around having a person with present-day knowledge appear five hundred years in the past. Fill in the extra space in the box with whatever supplies they will require (good first steps are things like a phone with a copy of wikipedia and a solar charger).

** You have the ability to memorize long strings of text (plus images/illustrations) at a glance, and play them back to yourself at high speed, which is similar to skimming in that you can pick out relevant concepts as you find them. You can also study them with an effort level similar to if you read them manually but without the inconvenience of having to turn the pages or have the book physically present.

You can thus basically load books into your mental 'inventory', without necessarily understanding their contents. You can do this with as many books as you want, but they won't be useful in terms of skills and knowledge until you actually spend time 'reading' their contents and forming relevant mental associations.

Even if you haven't read the book properly, there are things you can do which are based on imagination plus what you can do with a real book. You can alter a copy of the memorized book by adding highlighting, creating alphabetized indexes, visualizing animated illustrations, and so on. This doesn't harm the original memorized copy, so you can still refer back to it as needed. You can look things up by page number, and you can also do text searches.

*** Well, I'd see a small improvement in most everyday tasks that require recalling stuff, though the ease and speed of recall might be roughly comparable to googling (or even worse with sufficiently advanced google-fu). Most useful with respect to learning would probably be the storage and easy-access of my own notes, but that's more because I've not quite gotten around to digitizing them.

If I were still taking classes, I might be able to take more and harder classes and do better in them (maybe, IDK, back in college I wasn't limited in this regard by memorization/recall but more by other things).

The best application I can come up with would be trivia -- you'd have a huge advantage in game shows like /Jeopardy/ or /Who Wants to be a Millionaire/, moreso in ones that give you plenty of time to "think".

More fancifully, you can become a spy and copy down paper documents at a glance, though not any better than a really tiny camera lol. Maybe it would be useful on those jobs where they search you for wires and stuff before letting you see their top-secret documents.

** Not /exactly/ a munchkinry problem, but I figured this was the most appropriate place to put this:

You have a randomly-generated sequence of 8 bits, and you are allowed to flip one of the bits before sending the sequence to a friend. You want to somehow use this to send him a number between 1 and 8 inclusive, but here's the catch: your friend does not know what the original sequence was. (If he /did/, all you would have to do is flip the bit whose index corresponds to the number you wanted to send, making the problem trivial.) The /only/ information he will have available is the sequence you send him; he does not know which bit you flipped, or even whether you chose to flip a bit at all.

You can confer with your friend beforehand, but afterward, you are not allowed to communicate with him at all, apart from sending him the modified (or unmodified) bit sequence. Given these constraints, is it possible for you to communicate the number to him? If not, is there at least some way for him to guess the number with greater than 1/8 (12.5%) accuracy?

*** 100% strategy (I think) using only 7 bits:

Number the bits being sent from 0 to 7. Ignore bit 7, leaving us with 7 bits. Encode the number you with to transmit in the parity of the following bit sets: {1, 2, 3, 6}, {0, 1, 5, 6}, {3, 4, 5, 6}. [1,0,0]=>1, [1,0,1]=>5, and so on. [0,0,0] maps to 8, because we don't ever want to output 0. Take your random number, run it through the above encoding, and xor it with the target number. to figure out which sets you need to change the parity of. Then just find the bit that appears only in those sets and change it. So if we have 7 [1,1,1] and want 5 [1,0,1], flip the bit that only appears in set #2, which is bit number 3.

On the other end, your friend just takes the 7 bits you sent him and converts it to a number between 1 and 8, as described above.

Very neat solution. Although you could come up with a set that's easier to memorise:

#+begin_example
  A := {0, 3, 4, 6}
  B := {1, 3, 5, 6}
  C := {2, 4, 5, 6}
#+end_example

Which gives the table:

  A => 0
  B => 1
  C => 2
  AB => 3

*** I don't know the exact math involved but I t you can send information to the past using death notes to communicate FTL, I'm not sure how exactly you have to set up things to do that( and I would really appreciate if someone more knowledgeable about relativity explained the details of how to make time machines once you have faster than light travel). For maximizing information sent a future civilization could create a creature that can transmit a lot of information effectively in ways easy to manipulate for the death note, and can be easily revived , that way you can maximize the information sent while minimizing the usage of the death note( I haven't seen the show in a long time but I think the number of pages was limited).

**** RE: animals, I too am not familiar with the workings of Death Notes (I tried watching it, made it ~10 episodes in, but found it too boring to continue), but what does it count as a "human" (it does explicitly specify "human" [[http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note][here]], with perhaps slightly weaker assumptions that they have faces, hearts, etc.)? Can I just get some lumper taxonomists to expand /Homo/ to something much broader, or are deathNoteverse metaphysics such that /humans/ have some special ectoplasm demarcating them from other life? If I have two identical twins with the same name and I use the death note on one, does the other also die? What about people with artificial hearts, or the recipients of face transplants, or those in permanent vegetative state or w/e.

My thinking is not to use people, but rather human skin cultures shaped into little faces and attached to little hearts. You could probably fit one per cubic cm or less.

And given page limits (or not, the wiki makes it sounds like there's inconsistency), are there limits as to how tiny your font can be? Can text be machine written?

This is the problem here. It's rather reminiscent of the reason you can't exploit quantum entanglement for superluminal communication: to transmit information using entangled particles, you /also/ have to communicate along some other channel, which limits the effective speed of communication back down to subluminal velocities. Likewise, the Death Note may kill without regard for distance, but you can't use the deaths of random people near you to deduce anything without having first established who your partner is going to kill, what a particular death means, etc.--all of which requires sublight communication.

The difference is that for quantum entanglement, you have to communicate across normal channels at the same time as you communicate across the superluminal channel. For what I'm proposing, you can just determine an encoding method in advance. Yes, you still need to get someone somewhere subluminally, but after that you're in the clear.

Imagine a crew taking a 4-year trip to somewhere half a lightyear away. If you tell encode a message in a string of deaths, then they're getting that message three and a half a lightyear earlier than sending that message through pulses of light, which is usefully FTL.

The main problem with this system is just that communication is one-way rather than two ways. (And of course, the fact that it's only usable when you get bunch of people further than 40 light seconds away, but that's an engineering issue.)

********** Mm, that's a fair assessment, I'd say.

Do note, however, that if you want to work out a communication schema using the Death Note, you can send much more information by leveraging the /time/ of death instead of (or in addition to) the cause of death. The Death Note has a 23-day window of operation, and exhibits no limits on precision. Even if the recipient can only measure time of death to the nearest minute, that still gives you log_2(33120) ~= 15 bits of information per death, and if we assume that the time of death can measured to the nearest second, that yields an additional ~5 bits, giving you a total of 20 bits per death.
