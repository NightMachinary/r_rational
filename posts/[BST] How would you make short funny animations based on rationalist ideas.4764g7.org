I have always wanted to make a series of short funny animated videos, somehow based on or related to rationalist topics.

The "technical" side of producing videos seems to be coming together, I have figured out the [[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/RDO5r][character design]] and style that I want for my videos, and I have the general idea of how they can [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RqaG1FR-OIM][look like]].

Now I'm thinking about the most important part - the content, the ideas I am going to express in this format. I will figure it out eventually, but at this point I haven't yet, so I wanted to ask you to help me brainstorm the things that I could talk about. Ideally it would be intelligent and educational, yet I would be able to keep it short and funny. Or maybe just fun, with xkcd-like inside jokes and references, but no actual "teaching rationality".

Do you have any interesting thoughts on what would be cool to make in this format? Any advice or bright ideas would be really useful.


** My initial thought would be something similar to the conversation-ey pieces of SMBC (or any Dinosaur Comics strip) where characters have dialogue about ideas. You could pick a length that works well for the idea.

*** That's really interesting, I'll think about it and see if I can make it work.

** I really like the art style in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqaG1FR-OIM][The Old Town]] and I can certainly see you making successful videos that look similar. However, if you want them to be popular, you might want to consider getting someone else to read your scripts. I realize that your voice doesn't actually sound like it does in that video, but I can hear a bit of an accent in your [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNgOKjd2ahM][vlog]] as well, and my guess is that this would decrease your chances of success. I could be wrong though. Sometimes an accent or distinctive voice can be a benefit, and I don't really know how to predict such cases. Anyway good luck!

*** Thank you for the advice! Yes, I do have an accent, but I'm working hard on improving/eliminating it, and it's already better than it used to be. There's a lot of other skills I need to keep working on, especially writing and comedy, so speaking is just one of many things I need to improve to make my videos successful. I'd rather not outsource it, so I'll just keep trying to get better until it's good enough.

** I think one important thing to consider is your target audience. Obviously not all animations/cartoons are for kids but... Children are the demographic that teaching has the best ROI on.

Is there a good ELI5 version of rationalism to start with?

Maybe look into educational theory for what age group is the youngest that is expected to be able to grasp the concepts? (I'm told that IFF you present it correctly then elementary grade students can learn calculus)

*** My ultimate dream is to create something like Rick and Morty, so I'm going for more grown up kind of stuff(not nsfw, but not for kids either).

I guess the main challenges are to figure out what are the most useful and interesting ideas to express, how to express them in small chunks, and how to do that through funny and entertaining jokes/stories/dialogues.

Thinking about TA is a good advice, maybe if I'll have a specific person in mind it'll be easier to understand what to say and how to say it...

** Try animating some of Yudkowsky's short stories, perhaps? I mean the really short ones that form single LW posts. Maybe SSC's, too, although his short stories tend more towards the entertaining and less towards the educational, as I recall.
