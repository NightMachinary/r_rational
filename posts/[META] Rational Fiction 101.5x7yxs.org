I have a bit of an interest in rationalist fiction. I'll admit to being a skeptic in general and a giant raging science nerd. Unfortuneatly, I'm at a bit of a wall. I know where to start. I've read the tvtropes page and have read some of HPMOR. (In my defense I have ADHD and can't finish a goddamn thing.) Basically can I get some recommendations for someone newer to rational fiction, and preferably that of the shorter variety.


** Not to toot my own horn too loud, but if you wanted something short, finished, and rational, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111][Rules of Wishing]] probably fits the bill quite nicely.

*** Slatestarcodex fiction is more "stuff that [[/r/rational]] likes" than rational fiction. Stellar, but not what OP is asking.

**** The pill stuff was pretty rational, as was the cactus thing.

***** The pill stuff was much more about exploring the funniest edge cases of the pill powers (e.g. [[#s][spoiler]]) and finding excuses to keep all the pill people together than real optimization. I'll give you the cactus thing on a technicality.

** Have you tried all the fics on the wiki section of this subreddit? Because if not then just try that, nearly everyone else is just going to recommend things from that list, or just tell you to check the wiki yourself.

*** It's not short though...nor finished. I highly recommend it as a story, but for the specific criteria given, maybe not so much.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]] is a complete rational Superman fanfiction from the perspective of Lex Luthor, which I found excellent. And reasonably short for a full story, at 80K words

** For really quick single-shot stories, there's always the biweekly challenge threads (each of which links to the previous thread, so you can start from the current sticky and follow backwards in time).

Not necessarily the absolute apex best of the community's output, as it's by nature a quicker and less refined format. But usually at least interesting, and requires less commitment than diving into the lengthy serial format.
