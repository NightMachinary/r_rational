** And today, class, we've discovered a problem with decoupled tiny economies with high demand products connecting with huge economies with many people willing to take advantage of that high demand.

I suspect the galleon exchange rate is about to take a nosedive.

***** In plain English, it's "equals the set of all lengths to which you cannot provably compress strings", where "you" is some Turing machine M. It's a play on Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem, which I'm trying to slowly, steadily investigate to see where it gets that famous "constant" L that's supposed to be a function of the size of the Turing machine =K(M)=, and thus build a whole construction to work around the Theorem, sorta-kinda.

If it works, it might be helpful for Certain Things.

But also, it just says in a mathematical way, "I am eldritch stuff you cannot comprehend", which is always lulz.

** An error I haven't seen pointed out: Erdös was still alive in 1992, so no need to use the resurrection stone to get a 1.

I'm going with "he died a few years earlier, in 1990."

The math was presented wrong. Each of the 100 wizards was paid 1,000 galleons per day, total of 700,000 for the whole group.(*). 50 GBP/galleon makes that 3.5 million pounds. There was a change between first and second draft that changed the number in one place and not the other. Final edits didn't happen due to a graphics card that decided it wanted a virgin sacrifice or a bit of a lie-down, one or the other. It's at the fumigators now, but I won't be getting it back for a couple weeks. I figured it was better to post an insufficiently edit chapter than nothing.

(*) Slightly less, as Dumbledore refused payment. He just wants his school back and doesn't need the money.

**** I think arithmetics is failing one of us. Here's my calculations:

1,000 galleon per day per wizard for 100 wizards for 7 days gives us 700,000 galleon total (as you said here). G700,000 * £50 = *£35,000,000.* And I've googled around, and it appears that in 1992 the USD/GBP exchange rate was about 1.8-1.9, so it's about *$65,000,000.*

***** Arithmetic is indeed failing me. Thanks.

I'm probably not going to fix it for a couple of weeks -- I'm working on a loaner computer, which is an 11" Windows machine with less RAM than my phone. Just writing the new stuff is agony, so I'm going to leave any nonessentials (like corrections) until I'm back on my own box.
