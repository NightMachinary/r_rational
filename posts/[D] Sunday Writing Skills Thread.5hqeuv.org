Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow [[/r/rational]] fans...

- Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tropes]]?

- How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

- Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

- Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

- Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.


** In my story, a protagonist is experimenting with time-travel abilities and I want to demonstrate the scientific method by showing how real-life researchers might investigate time-travel.

What are some particularly important experimental protocols and investigation are people interested in seeing being used?

So far, I have:

- multiple hypotheses being generated ahead of time to cover varying possibilities before attempting to prove or disprove any single hypothesis

- experiments to falsify a hypothesis rather than only looking for confirming evidence

- reading and summarizing information from the background literature in the relevant fields to better plan the experiments

- detail extensive planning for a rigorous experimental protocol to avoid bias, errors, and false positives/negatives

- show the protagonist being wrong and updating their hypothesis in the face of new evidence (or completely throwing out their prior guess)

Does anyone have any other ideas? Some helpful suggestions could be styles of investigation such as cautious vs fast-paced, many possibilities vs one hypothesis, complex experiments with redundancies vs simple experiments, and so on.

PS If people want to tailor their feedback based on the power being investigated, it's a device which has a screen to only show text and a keyboard. It sends messages back in time, but the researchers have found out that whatever appears on the screen (ex. "This is a time machine!") will end up as the very next thing the researchers type into the device.

*** Randomization is important, find something you don't know beforehand, so the device is giving you new information.

I'm not sure if this is proper peer review, but give the data to someone who has not been working on your project, to see if that leads them to the same conclusion. It can be too easy to be locked into a solution.

*** Science is largely a collective process. Individual hypothesis generation and experimentation is quite a different process, and you'll have to face that unless this time travel device is going to become a worldwide phenomenon.

For instance, if you're given a study about some phenomenon, and the sample size is relatively low, it doesn't mean much to you, because of how it got to you and positive reporting bias, its almost meaningless to have something like that put in front of you. Academia is a huge machine designed to report anomalies. You don't start getting reliable information till you can do a metastudy of replication attempts.

But if you have a particular phenomenon and you want to investigate, and you do, and you get a single positive result, n=1, that's already meaningful to you, because there was far less bias in the flow of the information. The scientific network is biased towards reporting interesting results, but if you randomly select a sensible test and a sensible testing apparatus, those individually will have no bias towards interesting results at all.

So if this is a story about a single researcher working alone, for themselves, especially if they're the only person who has access to the phenomenon, its going to look very different to Science as we know it.

*** Just a brief thought (no clue if it actually makes sense though):

How about building a device that's only purpose is to determine whether you fucked up causality and wiped out a timeline? Design it such that it's your first foray into time travel at all. And it communicates with the version of itself you take into the past. But it's ahead of itself by a few seconds. Then, before you take a time travel trip, you check the device. If it's still pinging itself, then you know your trip won't alter things enough to prevent the device's conception. So the trip you're about to take hasn't impacted your general sphere of causality. It serves as a rudimentary, first response sort of safety measure.

Reading that back, I have almost no idea how any of what I wrote makes a shred of sense. But I'm not erasing it. So....Yea. Hope this helps? :)

** *Fiddling with [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]*

*Beta readers*. I could use more general feedback; if you're interested in helping, just pop over to the link, and you can use the built-in commenting system.

*Title*. "Extracts" was good enough for a working title during NaNoWriMo, but doesn't have anything in particular to do with what the story's turned into. The main theme seems to have become something like "I work at being [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared][Crazy Prepared]], and you the reader can do it too! And it's worth it!" (In particular, our protagonist only survives due to making backup copies of himself, which carry on when the original snuffs it.) Do any bits of phrasing come to mind?

*Cover*. At one point, my protagonist ends up with the physical form of many dozens of rats. I'm thinking of finding a Creative Commons image of a line-drawing of a reasonably nice-looking rat (as a starting point, maybe [[https://pixabay.com/en/mouse-rodent-animal-mammal-rat-311396/][this one]]), and tiling that image across the cover. (Well, maybe paying a couple of bucks for an actual graphic-focused person to do the manipulation.) Have any better ideas?

Is there anything else about this story that you want to say, but that the commenting system on GDocs might not have been the best medium for?

** I'm currently using 750words.com to work, very loosely, on a story about teleportation. This effectively means I have a lot of scenes from different points of view, some of which are in the present tense, which is going to be no fun to untangle. So my question is how much POV switching is acceptable, which I realise is a length of a piece of string question. I have at the moment three main POV characters - a woman C who has just 'caught' teleportation, the Aide to the Brigadier in charge of the project to control it, and the escaped 'patient zero'. This would be OK, I think as they are mostly in different places, but what do I do when they meet? And what about my scenes where, say, an unnamed hotel owner is used as a POV so I can show C from the outside? is a smattering of such scenes OK? or should I use them as my background only?

*** Are you using third-person limited-omniscient phrasing? That is, using 'she thought X when he did Y' instead of 'I thought X when he did Y'? I've seen a number of stories which focus on one main viewpoint character or another for a while, then jump to another main one, with occasional "reaction shots" focusing in on a side-character or two. I didn't have any problems understanding those stories, so it seems a workable approach.

*** I was a fan of a writer when I was a teenager called Brian Caswell, and he wrote in the sort of style you're going for.

What he did was he had maybe 3 or 4 main characters, who narrated, with each section headed "Anne's Story" or "Bob's Story" or whatever. Then sometimes he'd do a third person omniscient type section, which didn't have that heading, just the date/time.

So I guess my suggestion is if the hotel owner is being used as a POV only once, and then later in the story the seamstress who the characters go to is used only once, and then the kid they save in the climax is used only once, etc, you might be better off doing a third person POV for those scenes.

  I can't even find a way to write "Kol walked towards..." without teaching the reader some Ser body language, because Sers are constantly expressing things with the way they move.
#+end_quote

There's a difference between writing the equivilent of the expression "he frowned, looking at her with narrowed eyes" and expecting the reader's knowledge of body language to say "his face showed he was angry" and writing the equivilent of the expression "he looked at her angrily". Now, the former is generally considered better writing because we know what a frown /means/. But if you don't know what a frown means, why not say "he looked at her angrily"?

But what's stopping you from saying "Kol walked towards the podium, the subtlety of movement in Kol's gait showing not only was Kol nervous about giving the speech, but Kol was overflowing with sheer joy at the fact that they were finally going to make peace with their long-time enemies"? Or even "I watched Kol move to the podium, and my knowledge of Ser body language isn't great but I am pretty sure that Kol was mighty happy about something"? Or get poetic, "Kol looked at the object of eir affections, and took a step forward; that single step said all at once 'I love you, I need you, and I would do anything for you' in the sensuous ballet of the Ser's body language"?

That may depend on how broad an audience of readers you're interested in. The only reason I remember the shared-world "Medea: Harlan's World" is because of the rather alien alien species (vaguely fox-ish centauroids, which reproduce by dropping off body/limb segments), and I've read more than one story trying to delve into various sorts of non-human psyches.

The usual advice, which seems to apply, is to write what /you/ find satisfying. :)

** How do you guys make distinctive speech patterns for characters, without just giving them an accent? Ideally, my goal would be to have the viewpoint character of a segment be immediatelly recognizable by the narration alone, even in a 3rd person work*, but it's difficult doing that.

Probably the best example of me /trying/ to do that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11936165/19/Horizon-Breach][chapter 19 of Horizon Breach]] because I flip between a number of viewpoints, but I still have this overly academic vocabulary throught.

If I had to sum up my problem, it's that it seems like I write with the same voice as I'd use in a forum argument.

** *Infodumps vs Storytelling*

David Weber is probably the current king of including infodumps in his books, such as detailing a warship's hordes of missiles' sizes, accelerations, ranges, and similar other numbers. Some people seem to love such detail, others hate it.

Over in this week's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ib10o/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/][Worldbuilding]] thread, I've pasted some notes I've jotted down on the setting for [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]], in the form of part of a journal entry of my protagonist. The whole story is in the form of such entries; and at the moment, I'm wondering how to avoid infodump syndrome, or whether I should even try. I honestly haven't decided how many of the described details are going to be relevant to my protagonist's forthcoming shenanigans, as he tries to leverage various aspects of the world he finds himself in to accomplish his goals. So should I just leave the whole thing in now, and be ready to trim out anything that turns out to be excessively irrelevant by the story's conclusion? Should I move pretty much the whole entry to the authour's notes that won't be part of the story proper? Should I try something completely different?

An inquiring mind wants to know your opinion. :)

*** Personally, I prefer stories to /not/ include infodumps unless it feels natural. A very good example of how an infodump can fail is when in a science-fiction story the author has a character randomly start talking all about a futuristic, commonplace technology that everyone knows about. Because the character has to explain it for the reader even though it doesn't make sense for anyone to talk about it, it falls flat. It'd be like us suddenly talking about how revolutionary computers are, whenever we use Facebook, or Google.

A well-done example of when to /not/ include infodumps is Worm. There were these horrific natural disasters/villains called Endbringers. Wildbow explicitly didn't explain who the Endbringers where at all when his characters first mentioned them in passing. Until Leviathan showed up in the story, I had no idea who the Endbringers were. When the story started talking about alarms and fear of an Endbringer showing up, it added to the unease and worry about who or what these horrific antagonists could be. It was a well-done piece of story telling which would have been ruined if the Endbringers were explained in an infodump instead of letting the reader continue only knowing them as ominous villains.

Infordumps should be used sparingly and only in contexts which make sense such as a classroom setting, training, or when people explain important rules to newbies. The part of your story where your character negotiated with the representative of the Oracle (section #52) was a very good place for an infodump and conveying world-building information to the reader.

So if your character /would/ want to make a note of the important information in the journal, then the infodump is fine. But if it's about some minutiae he wouldn't comment on, then don't include it. Let the reader try to figure it out from context before you start wondering about where to fit explanations.

In this case, I think the fact that he has finally made contact with the real world, and is just learning about some of how it's changed since he died, puts this particular infodump in the 'reasonable' category.
