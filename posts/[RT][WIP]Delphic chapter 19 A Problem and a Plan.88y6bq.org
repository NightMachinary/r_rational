** Wait I don't know if I'm being thick, accidentally missed something in an earlier chapter or somehow even managed to miss something in this chapter, but I'm kind of confused as to what Iron Lantern is exactly?

Is it some kind of hacker base being run by a programmer with limited super speed? Or a more directed program, with the goal of producing a specific product (like an AI or something)?

*** Here is the added paragraph.

#+begin_quote
  The Iron Lantern project had a well-defined objective: create a data-rich system (known in information security as a "honeypot") capable of attracting and trapping an advanced digital intelligence. While the NSA would certainly claim such a system could have multiple uses, its one plausible target was clear. They intended to capture Delphic.

** Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

- Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
- Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
- The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.

*** Honestly, I'm concerned that I haven't yet established myself enough to justify it. The other writers that I see on here with Patreon accounts seem to have a lot more content already set out and a much larger following.

I don't want to come across as presumptuous. I'm very new at this.

Do you know if any of the web fiction writers with Patreon have weighed in on it? It has been fantastic to get voted for on Top Web Fiction and to get comments here, so if a Patreon would encourage even more reader involvement, I should at least consider it.

**** Haha, I'd imagined it was something like that! I definitely think that your work is promising enough to justify it.

Even if it wasn't, it would just remain unpatronized until it was.

I want to read more and I'm willing to pay what I can for it! (that's not a lot).

***** I finally set up a [[https://www.patreon.com/Delphic][Patreon]] after all.

Thank you for your kind words, which helped give me the courage to try it.

****** You're the first person I'm patreonizing! Partly because I enjoy Delphic a lot, partly because played a role in you starting one, and partly because I've just started earning!

** First thought: "It's a lie, it's not a vaccine, he's planning to take hostages."

Second thought: "Remember the last chapter, what his entire career has specialised in! It's /not/ a lie, it /is/ a vaccine, and the proportion of supers is about to go *way* up!"
