** Can't believe im saying but Death is rational. And his approach to problem solving, holy shit yes. Every day update for at least 300 words. Thank you universe.

Also the banter between the protagonists is hilarious. Also metal armor and welding fuck yar.

** This is a fantastic piece of writing. It has fantastic characters, fantastic plot, fantastic worldbuilding, fantastic humour, fantastic action, fantastic villains, and excellent munchkinning of physics, chemistry, and biology powers along with more esoteric and fantastical varieties.

IAN the author.

Does that phrase really need to be abbreviated? Wouldn't a simple "I am not" only take a second longer while also being much more clear to newcomers?

** I'll start giving my opinion once I'm finished with the first book but I can already see several thing that really don't seem rational to me. The weirdly varying body control being one of them.

** So I've read a fair bit of this, certainly not a majority yet, but I've ran into a thing that I feel a lot of writers do that I don't really enjoy.

X happens. X has a lot of implications, HUGE implications. It totally changes things for the protagonist, for the reader, for the world, and then when we are just sort of getting into the action regarding X's changes, suddenly A, B, C, D, and E are added. And now we have no clue what the world is really like. Before it was a normal world or a setting we recognized + X, which means that we can start to think and ruminate on how X might change the world.

E.g. Rational Luther in the world of Superman (using this example because Mr Alexander Wales is well known). It has far reaching consequences. The reader starts to think about what might change, but imagine if suddenly it was also revealed that Luther could do magic and that there was a sentient race of bugs living in the Earth's Crust. In my opinion, now its too much. At this point, for that story, I am having a really difficult time understanding what the rules are. And this might just be me, but I like knowing the rules, especially if the author is setting us up for this to be a sort of rules centric story.

For Zombie Knight in particular, I really felt like a lot of things were explained early, and so, as the reader I was mentally prepared. There were some extra things thrown in, fine, that is a bit of a stretch, but now I can understand why their impact will be major.

But when "abilities" start showing up, and I'll try to keep this spoiler free, I felt like I was now in a world where anything could happen. There could be magic, or AI, or new sentient races, or any number of things. I don't know what the rules are, or what the baseline rules are, and its like, sadface stuff there.

Im not sure if I am explaining this very well, but I'd love to hear other peoples' thoughts. Also, I think Zombie Knight is pretty darn great, and this story certainly isn't the worst abuser of this particular aspect of story telling, but it just made me think of it.

*** I think part of it is that it /is/ a world where anything could happen, but that anything has been very carefully picked out by the author. The story scales up. It starts with Hector, then Hector's city, than his country, then globally local conflicts, than international conflicts, and will get even greater from there.

Also, the rules are kind of poorly explained at the beginning. The author gets much better at it later on. I'm not aware of any case where the rules are downright violated, though. There is a cohesive set of rules, and it makes sense. Eventually.

I think part of it is that there is a rather large world beyond what the story's currently about. Like, huge. International political intrigue, history, godlike monsters wrecking havoc.

The "normal world + X" element is fine, so long as it really is "normal world + X". But it's more than that, it's "World with X, Y, Z, Q, and ‚àè which looks normal on the surface if you happen to live in a global backwater that hasn't suffered magical apocalypse for long enough to build up a tech base.".

I guess my point is that it's not a "Rational Luther in the world of Superman" story. It's high fantasy, there just happens to be an approximately 21st century facade on it.

The abilities, by the way, are awesome, and make sense once they're properly explained. You will see someone weaponizing magical fluorine chemistry at some point. I promise.

** I'm two books in now, and while I'm unsure how rational I'd call this, it's definitely an enjoyable story to read.

**** When they were all trying to escape the guys at the castle, along with the queen, is the first case that comes to mind. There was that explosion dude but it didn't strike me like he could displace enough matter quickly enough to catch up with a reaper underground. And everyone except the bodyguard had reapers and the bodyguard could've just stayed behind in the castle. I don't think there was a net under the castle either.

Also, I just realized that the aberration's powers have much less explanation than that of the servants and so are kind of cheating, especially in the latest chapter where they make use of a, from what I can tell, completely never before used BS ability.

edit:

And also all the times when they're trying to get somewhere--they are limited by a reaper's max flight speed anyways so why not solve the human transport problems by just killing them and rezzing where needed? Doesn't seem to take that long to rez from nothing and time would still probably saved because the reaper can just move at max speed to the destination instead of them having to match transport speed.
