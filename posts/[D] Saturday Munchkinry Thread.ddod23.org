Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You can teleport anywhere on Earth, but so can everyone else. No telefragging, and you get a mild sense of whether or not the specific location you're trying to get to is safe (ie no cars rushing at you, not suspended in the air, nonlethal temperatures, other things that you would notice after being in that location for less than a second).

I'll probably ask about general consequences for Worldbuilding Wednesday, but for now, what would you personally do with it?

Edit with more info:

I'm going for near maximum user-friendliness, so here's what I have in mind. You think “Paris”, and you mean “Paris, Texas”, then you'll go to Paris, Texas. If you've been there before and have even a subconscious memory of the place, it'll probably be the place of the memory unless you specifically mean anywhere else. If you've never been there, it'll go off what you know about it and go to the most mentally significant place you have any sort of knowledge of. If all you know is the name, you'll be at some vaguely central location, as determined by the zeitgeist.

It takes about a second of thinking to trigger the teleport, and then it's instant. So roughly 60 times a minute is your max rate.

I think with today's technology there'd be no way to detect a teleport before it happens, besides maybe seeing if it looks like someone is focusing on something. It's probably possible but would take some focused research for a number of years.

Making a room “full” would work. You couldn't just have dangling beads, but filling it with wooden blocks would be fine. You'd need to stop people from teleporting to wherever those blocks came from, though.

Clothes and surface level worn things are automatically taken with, as well as a breadbox worth of other stuff. No selectively teleporting parts of stuff. Two people trying to teleport to the same place can teleport a third, unconscious person, but otherwise you can't teleport humans. Teleporting is granted at around ~13 years old.

If teleportation is a new ability, I'd push for a society and government structure similar to that depicted in Ada Palmer's /Terra Ignota/, absent any better ideas.

***** Fantastic worldbuilding. A convincing extrapolation of a not-too-weird future Earth, when Humanity only really inhabits Earth, the Moon, and tenuously Mars. A convincing unreliable narrator who is providentially positioned to tell the story. It's a book with dozens ofnideas, any three of which would be a good scifi or fantasy novel on its own. It's got weird politics, weird economics, weird gender stuff, weird religion stuff, weirder religion stuff, weird tech stuff, meta-narrative stuff, weird point of view changes, and yet it's purposely straightforward and understandable.

As tumblr user birdblogwhichisforbirds summarized the series: "In a world in which murder, religion and gender are illegal, one man spends his life doing those things to other people."

*** In addition to the fun of everyone having teleportation, you've also given everyone spidey senses (constantly think about teleporting 1mm ahead and your danger sense will be active).

I suspect that danger sense would also be munchkinable into a precog (using chains of if it will be dangerous then I will push this button, making this area dangerous, which past me is looking to teleport into, and will thus press his button instead, etc). Pain in the arse to set up, especially with the <1 sec limit, but doable. I think Asmiov had a story about a chemical beginning with T that would dissolve 3 seconds before water was added, it did a similar thing.

Worm gets away with it by having precog be not 100% reliable (so building a long chain is asking for failure) and having precogs interfere. Option 2 is out if everyone has teleportation ("I want to go to the Eiffel tower", say 10000 people simultaneously, followed by a squelch and then metallic groans as the tower collapses under the weight of partially crushed corpses...) but option 1 is definitely open - have the teleport fizzle 1 in 1000 times, or give a false reading of danger, and you can't munchkin so easily with minimal story impact.

*** Me, I would make a list and spend each weekend at a separate location with my partner. What would it do to the economy though is particularly interesting. It would take lots of trends that have already been happening with globalization and make them so much more severe:

- Most land becomes less valuable. Clifford D. Simak explored some of this in /City,/ even if I don't quite agree with his conclusions. But basically, buying land in a relatively stable poor country makes a lot of sense. Living in an apartment makes no sense whatsoever. Rather than Simak's deurbanization; I would expect hyper-commercialization and economic specialization of some cities. Shipping becomes bigger, faster, etc.
- Labor becomes truly mobile, and moving operations becomes frictionless. Every person can now apply to every job. HR becomes mind-boggling difficult. Manufacturing moves near raw materials or target markets.\\
  At the same time, white collar companies can now make headquarters in international waters.
- Instantaneous shipping for small items means that the transportation field is revolutionized. Basically, everyone can buy ripe/ in-season produce all the time. It also means that you can have big specialist stores that have incredibly high foot traffic if people know they exist.
- Non-specialized labor becomes much harder to find, except for couriers, and even then it's a limited field. Retail centralizes, most big box stores close.\\
- Things get especially weird when you consider what happens with immigration. Any area with conflict basically depopulates in a month or two as industrialized countries face enormous waves of migrants. Do nations dissolve, ignore borders, or become voluntary ethnostates?
- Security becomes much, much more difficult, because you can assume that bad actors have physical access all the time.
- Catching drug-dealers becomes harder than ever. At the same time, drugs become even more concentrated for transport.
- Bulk data transports become a viable substitution for some entertainment uses of the internet. In less industrialized countries we see a lot of this.
- Ability to speak different languages becomes far more valuable. Right now, a store in America needs at most two languages to reach 99% of customers. In teleport universe, megastores can reach 40% of customers by having employees that speak the top 10 languages. The more languages a manager has, the larger a department they can manage, the more people they can serve.

*** Assuming this is a new world event and our reaction to it, the most important thing would probably be making a secret hideyhole/cache to store personal property and sleep safely, assuming that people can't just intend to "teleport to X's/the nearest hideyhole" and defeat any attempt at security through obscurity that way.

Given that civilization as we know it is almost certainly going to collapse due to billions of impovershed third world humans teleporting to the first rich city they imagine, raiding them for food and luxuries, then returning to their villages on a daily basis, it will be imperative to stockpile as much as I can and cache my supplies somewhere. For this, my best bet is to make a temporary cache somewhere I have already personally been and can be reasonably confident no one will stumble across in the next day or so before I can commit to searching and preparing a more obscure site in the wilderness.

Hikers, spelunkers, and other people with adventurous hobbies will have a tremendous advantage here, due to likely having come across some place no one will think of checking in that timeframe. Alternatively, if relative momentum is nullified through teleportation, then locating a tropical/temperate archipelago on a map, teleporting there, then teleporting repeatedly through the air to scout for an even more secluded island is a possibility. With a personal site secured, the next objective is to gather as many short-and long-term supplies as possible in breadbox size increments. Potable water, food, gardening and hand tools, containers, clothing, medicine, seeds, and so on.

At the same time, finding as many trusted individuals as I can, namely family, close friends and colleagues, to coordinate for future survival efforts. This would be mainly instructing them how to best begin their own caches and a communal message spot where we could leave messages for later cooperation.

With the threat of raiders being able to take anything visibly noticeable from the air, it would be ideal to hold out with procured supplies for around a month before attempting to start any sort of community; enough for immediately available food stocks to run out or spoil and the immediate chaos to die down, likely due to mass starvation by everyone who didn't prepare in those first critical hours. From there, paths to survival can branch in a lot of ways.

Is the site you're looking for secure, pleasant, /and/ unknown? I do a good amount of hiking (and a bit of caving) and am having trouble thinking of a place that meets all three criteria. But I've only gone substantially off-trail (& not to some publicized waterfall or cave or w/e) a few dozen times in my life so maybe more ardent bushbashers could come up with something viable.

It'd be more important to just grab as much as you can before the larger stores and supermarkets get emptied out by unscrupulous people. After that critical period, you could chain teleport into the wilderness to try to find a suitable permanent site.

*** Assuming that society doesn't entirely collapse, after a period of brief destabilization information about this power, as well as strategic advice on how to best use it, will be widespread. So in the long term, I'm going to rely on the collective wisdom of society to discover and explore possibilities. The time for individual reasoning about this change is in the short term, during the transition period.

I could steal what has not yet been secured, but I don't want to have to live on the run or risk my life, and the danger sense you describe won't alert me to a camera or some kind of reactive defense system.

I could collect goods, perhaps such as rare plants or animals which are moderately difficult to collect (dissuading the buyers from simply getting them themselves), which command a high price in a small market (making it profitable with relatively little work, but not so scalable as to quickly attract the attention of a large firm with a lot of optimization power).

The best move might be to try to get in on the ground floor of the information infrastructure of this new world; I'm already a software engineer, so I could conceivably convince some panicked investors that GrubHub for the teleportation age that I ought to get a lot of their money.

For prosocial munchkinry, I could try to support and publicize cheap, scalable centers of some kind of support, for example a massive emergency room hospital that benefits from economies of scale that anyone can visit.

unfortunately, this is a pretty optimistic assumption. Imagine how many people who live in abject poverty right now, who if given the opportunity to effortlessly take a loaf of bread would do so. Now imagine how many hundreds of millions of people all around the world are living in those conditions, now with the ability to instantly teleport to cities of wealth beyond their imagining and take whatever they can carry with them.

To call what would immediately ensue "food riots" would be the understatement of a lifetime, spreading from the most famous cities like NYC, Beijing, and other country capitals, outwards to smaller towns. Those first few days would likely see the collapse of societal infrastructure in its entirety under the flow of billions of economic migrants that literally cannot be stopped.

Well I wouldn't have a car anymore, so that'd be nice. Really transport both on the local and the regional/national/international scale is just a pain in the ass.

Probably I'd move somewhere with a lower cost of living and generally just live a more full and efficient life, visiting my family more, wasting less time on commuting, taking more of an interest in conventions or concerts or the like that travel currently makes impractical or at the least inconvenient. I'd also do some more world travel/tourism, with that initial hurdle and housing out of the way. I'd make a point to still traverse minor distances on foot, if only to keep moderately in-shape rather than becoming a blob person.

I certainly wouldn't become a superhero or anything, wouldn't really try that hard to try and exploit it for wealth or power or any of that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] munchkinry. That shit's risky and dangerous and someone more capable and daring than I is probably already picking up all the low-hanging fruit. I might take a look at the job market and try out the teleporting courier lifestyle depending on hours/pay compared to my current job, since surely there'll be huge demand for such work.

There are of course broader implications for the universality of this power: safety, infrastructure, whole sectors of the market disrupted by changes in transportation, etc. We'll leave that aside and assumed it's handled to the point where I'm not living in a post-apocalypse, though.

*** I might get a houseboat. I've always kind of liked the idea, it provides some security, and most of the downsides no longer apply. Just drift off to sea.

I'd also get some better, smaller camping gear. A bread box is pretty small, considering, but I'd ideally want the ability to carry a "home" with me because it gives you vastly more options for places to stay.

I'd finally try skydiving - no parachute or plane needed anymore. (I assume from how user-friendly this sounds that momentum isn't conserved.)

Obviously I'd go in holiday more, that goes without saying, but ... ironically this would probably mean most tourist destinations are /much/ more crowded, so finding obscure-but-lovely destinations becomes a big commodity. Hopefully there are apps to warn you when places are "trending" and thus crowded.

Speaking of tourism: obviously area denial tech is a big deal in general, but specifically for tourism, it's essential to preserve a lot of landmarks and historical items. Yet obviously it's hard to apply the "no empty space" idea to a lot of tourist sites. If they station snipers (or automated turrets) to shoot anyone climbing on the Pyramids with rubber bullets, is that enough for people to sense it's unsafe? For museums, I'm picturing a grid of dangerously powerful lasers, powerful enough to burn but dim enough that they aren't visible in air and so don't interfere with people viewing from a distance.

Question: If I get a group of friends together, can we carry larger objects other than "unconscious human"? If so, I'd probably volunteer to help lift rockets as high as possible, that sort of thing. I'm guessing there's a good chance you can't, unfortunately, since there's no limit on surface area: volume ratio and so any volume could be lifted with enough people and big enough handles. It'd be cool though.

** 6Degrees:

Can see connections between people, with different colours representing the type of connection (business partner, friend, lover, enemy) and intensity showing depth of that connection, both of which can be different at each end (so you might see a connection in canon worm between Missy and Dean that shows they're coworkers, friends, and Missy's end shows more).

The two ends have to be visible to the parahuman, so no tracking people across the world by their family connections, and it doesn't get in the way of normal vision.

*** Well, you've just become an excellent way to track moles in your organisation, depending on how the power works. Say you had a mole from coil, and you checked how they were related to their PRT superior. The superior would view the relation as one of coworkers, while the mole would view it as one of an authority they must be cautious of the attention of. It really depends on how subtle the colours you detect are - you can presumably compare with a known mole at some point to make sure. Even pointing out suspicious people would help, as false positives can be somewhat easily dismissed (although it won't make you many friends, as paranoia increases in your presence).

The power also makes you adept at looking through disguises, if you know the original person well. If someone had a massively different connection to you and everyone else than they did yesterday, you know something's up. Same thing with noticing extremely similar connections in and out of costume. Basically allows you to build up shifting profiles of people over time. Use a notebook (preferably in a code of some sort) to record these relations for ease of MS detection. The code should probably be complex enough to change on a person to person basis so hostiles can't just transcribe certain words or phrases from one entry to another. It's not fool proof, but it helps.

If someone who you would really like to get in contact with appears in a public event, look for strong connections between them and their aids, their aids and crowd members, etc. You probably already know this by the power's name, but if you can form a chain of people who owe favours to one another, you could ask them (in costume) to tell this friend to tell their friend (and so on) until they can get you in contact with the person you want. Excellent networking opportunity.

A more villainous opportunity is blackmail. Find someone in a sexual relationship outside of their partner, and threaten them ominously over the phone to reveal the information unless they transfer money to you or something. Only has to work for a few people, though you should make sure to this as anonymously as possible. Over burner phone at least. There are other relations you can use to blackmail people like this, but cheating seems like the most obvious choice.

Detect corporate espionage if you see someone employed under multiple competing companies separately. Doesn't have to justifiable under law, as your employer just has to fire the offender.

Severely damage relations by pretending your power is revealing things it isn't - an example of this would be telling someone that you can tell X is a mole when they are actually innocent, or telling y their partner is cheating on them when they aren't. Divide an organisation by infiltration in this way, but it's a risky move. Probably better to reveal existing ties.

Detect abuse between people. Detect if someone is stalking someone. Maybe your power can't be used in court, but it can be used to encourage closer investigation by detectives and police.

Do some detective work to find out drug dealers. You can see and remember a dealer's connection with their clients, and cross-reference that colour with random times you see it in the street. Example: A deals to B. You note the connecting colour. The next day, you see two unrelated people walk by each other on the street. C and D are connected by the same colour, so you know one of them is a dealer. Investigate to gather actual evidence, and you're doing well.

That's some things to think about, I suppose. Hope it helped!

** You can freeze time.

You are also frozen, apart from your brain.

Don't worry it doesn't age, but still works.

Extra: while time is frozen you can enter a 5m3 empty room. You don't age, breathe, get hungry, etc. You can bring what you're carrying into this room, if you don't carry it then it stays there

Extra 2: the same except the power controller is nice enough to allow computers to function, except bans programming (otherwise the rational choice would probably be to go in and make general AI in the infinite time you have).

What do you do with frozen time where you can't move? How can you exploit this?

*** Spend a subjective few days working out how best to use this, to start with.

Depending on how long it takes to freeze/unfreeze, I'd suggest immediately going to your computer, setting it up to flash pages from textbooks up as quickly as you can freeze/unfreeze, and spending your frozen time reading each page, internalising it, and memorising it. Once you've learned the state of modern science as fast as you can view the pages it's written on, the next step would probably be to advance mathematics, theoretical physics, and other fields that can be progressed with infinite thinking time.

The extras make it a lot easier to accomplish this, and open up progress in other fields that can't be advanced through thought alone. I don't think banning programming is enough to stop you trying to make GAI, since you can at least work on the theory and plan the architecture.

Extra 1 means you can become the perfect safecracker of any safe you can carry, simply by trying every combination. Extra 2 is much more valuable, as you can spend your infinite time brute-forcing encryption.

You might also like to look at [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5wMcKNAwB6X4mp9og/that-alien-message][That Alien Message]], [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/starwink.shtml][Starwink]], and [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-kKR3YxQZkf9bnHC5Cpd_e7zXsSBeOE-Tqum44Ajss/edit][Queen of the Savannah]] for inspiration, as they have similar premises.

**** You wouldn't be able to change where you are focusing since that would require moving eyes.

I guess you could look at defocused areas with your mind. Not sure how that would work practically. Good idea though.

I suppose you're right about theory and the such but at least you don't immediately get the power then come out with a USB stick the next instance that conquers the world for you.

I've never heard of those stories, thanks for the recommendation. I'll be sure to check it out.
