** Well, I'm immediately worried about gender essentialism, but /c'est le Dune/. I enjoyed reading this on the train and now want to try to test my probability calibration.

** Are you planning on making the story understandable to anyone who hasn't read /Dune/?

*** Good question. I am hoping that it will be understandable! It's not going to stick too close to Dune, really, so I will have to explicitly introduce most things. What do you think so far?

**** You wrote out the conversations very well. I clearly saw Paul as a gifted student with his quick, clear, and simple responses to Thufir's questions. I can't say how well you explained the concepts for the reader, because I already have a decent understanding of calibrating my confidence levels and predictions. But if it's at all possible, I recommend including an illustration of the graph that Thufir is drawing to make it easier for the reader to understand. In addition, include examples for the nine out of ten and two out of ten predictions that Paul made to help the reader better understand what was happening.

The only correction I actually want you to make is the 15 second breathing cycle Paul is doing for his meditation. I typically breathe in for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, breathe out for 5 seconds, and hold for 5 seconds in a 20 second cycle. It's called [[https://www.google.com/search?q=square+breathing&tbm=isch&imgil=3_w6sWrgDiuAhM%253A%253B8Gboznfl0NC-nM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fvisuals.autism.net%25252Fmain.php%25253Fg2_itemId%2525253D138&source=iu&pf=m&fir=3_w6sWrgDiuAhM%253A%252C8Gboznfl0NC-nM%252C_&usg=__9YEadTlIuODDBaYjQQJQ84kqIpk%3D#imgrc=3_w6sWrgDiuAhM%253A%3B8Gboznfl0NC-nM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvisuals.autism.net%252Fmain.php%253Fg2_view%253Dcore.DownloadItem%2526g2_itemId%253D138%2526g2_serialNumber%253D4%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvisuals.autism.net%252Fmain.php%253Fg2_itemId%253D138%3B900%3B870][square breathing]] and I was mildly surprised to read a version where Paul is breathing in immediately after breathing out.

I liked the story enough to follow it for at least the next few chapters. Try posting about this on a few other subreddits or social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.

***** Thanks!

I did make a Twitter: [[https://twitter.com/fourthwayfremen]]

The 5-5-5 breath cycle is from an actual book I read, but it was a book on mesmerism, so maybe not the best. At least the author thought 5-5-5 was good. Like you, I find the immediate in-breath unnatural... I figured it was "logical" though, because you are not gaining anything by holding for 5 seconds with nothing in your lungs! I'm going to take your advice nonetheless and change it to square breathing.

Quick googling found this, which recommends 4-7-8 (again with immediate in-breath after out): [[http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART00521/three-breathing-exercises.html]]

As for adding an illustration and more example predictions, I definitely agree, but I'll probably just move on to the next chapter rather than putting that much effort into this one... (to keep it a fun project for me).

** This looks very promising. /Dune/ is one of my favorite series (excepting the prequels of which we do not speak), so I'm glad to see rationalfic in that universe. I look forward to this with great interest. :D

How often do you plan to update?

Also, are you going to keep up the little blurbs at the start of each chapter in the style of the original books? I always enjoyed those.
