Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm working on a setting where humanity is limited to "hard" science solutions to problems. Despite this, they've colonized large swathes of the solar system and have permanent outposts around every planet, including pluto and other far out keiper objects.

Assuming a large amount of energy to play with (ie fusion, nuclear, and solar), as well as mature technology fo space travel (launch stations, energy lasers, etc.) how long would a journey to a far out keiper object take? Something on the order of 30-40 AU?

There are a couple of tables, that list a round trip to various locations in the solar system. Pluto is listed, and while not a far out kuiper belt object, illustrates that far out kuiper belt objects are probably gonna need some damn good spacecraft. Launch lasers would help, but still make that painful to slow down unless the kuiper belt object has a system set up as well.

**** Thanks, that's a good resource for me! Yes, both ends are built up. The station is basically "For when you /really/ need to get away." It helps that they have stations around all the gas giants, so you're only looking at the delta v for whichever one's closest, but that still seems to be ridiculously long.

***** Based on the engine and payload I mentioned above, you'd be looking at the I-3 column if you shaved 26 MT off the payload. That would be 11 years, 4 months to get to Pluto. You could manage to provide enough life support and thrust to carry 2,445 passengers, based on the pre-calculated engine specifications.

******* So, the source linked by WilyCoyotee states:

#+begin_quote
  Impulse trajectory I-3 is near the transition between delta V levels for high impulse trajectories and low brachistochrone trajectories (it is a hyperbolic solar escape orbit plus 30 km/s).
#+end_quote

So, how much delta V is that actually? Solar escape velocity from Earth is 42.1 km/s [[[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-escape-velocity-from-the-sun-And-from-the-solar-system][Ref]]], but Earth already orbits around the sun at an average speed of 29.7 km/s, leaving only an additional 12.4 km/s to achieve escape velocity. However, Earth's gravity will slow you down a bit as you move away, so you actually need about 16.4 km/s [[[https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/escape-velocity-from-solar-system.662985/#post-4221895][Ref]]]. So, the values for the I-3 column appear to be based on a delta V budget of 16.4 km/s + 30 km/s.

So, how much delta V do we actually have? If you dig into the references I cited for magneto intertial fusion, there's this [[https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pnwmsnw/NIAC_PhaseII_FDR.pdf][presentation]]. I assume we're starting from low earth orbit, regardless of how we get there, so I ignore the 12 km/s delta V noted for earth orbit insertion. After that, you've got 16.5 + 7.3 + 13.2 km/s for the round trip. That's 37 km/s of delta V, which is a bit shy of the 46.4 km/s of delta V that we'll need to match up the I-3 column's stated travel times. Of course, if you reduce the mass of the payload a bit, then you can get more delta V out of the design. For expediency, I just took 37/46.4 to get how much I'd need to reduce the mass, which ends up with 79.7%. The ship is listed as 133 MT, so if you took 27 MT off the mass of the payload, you'd have at least 46.4 km/s of delta V to work with (and really, more than that).

For a more accurate calculation, you could take 79.7% off the average mass of the ship during the trip. The propellant is listed as 57 MT, so average mass of the ship during travel should be 104.5 MT, and taking 79.7% off of that reduces the mass by 21.2 MT, which is all you'd really need to take away from the payload to get enough delta V to match the I-3 column.

As to whether it's the best of practicality, efficiency and power? For an authoritative answer on that, you'd want to talk to NASA. Barring that, the best answer I can offer is that on the reference I provided earlier for it, the author cites it at the top of the page as "This is the best fusion-power rocket design to date."

*** Trying to work out the math at the moment. About how far in the future is this? Do you have nuclear fusion engines? What about cryonics?

*Edit 1:* You're looking at a ∆v of around 16.4 km/s for the lowest-cost annual launches. That's probably going to be very slow, but I'm still working out exactly how slow.

*Edit 2:* Would at least the low-gear [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#id--Pulse--Inertial_Confinement--Magneto_Inertial_Fusion][magneto intertial fusion]] engine be appropriate for your setting?

*Edit 3:* Food should add about 0.83 kg per person per day, including packaging. [[[https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html][Ref]]]

*Edit 4:* Atomic Rockets suggests that life support (including air and water recycling, food, temperature control, power, etc.) should be about 4,606.2 kg per person, plus 2.303 kg per person per day. It estimates a bit more food than I'd expect, but it's reasonable to have some extra mass allocated there since many of the recycling systems are unlikely to be able to provide 100% yield. [[[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/habmod.php#nasatranshab][Ref]]]

*Edit 5:* Assuming people weigh about 80 kg and their equipment and personal belongings add another 120 kg, then the payload is about 4,800 kg per person plus 2.3 kg per person per day.

*Edit 6:* The previously-mentioned magneto inertial fusion rocket was based around a payload mass of 61 MT, and a ∆v of around 37 km/s. Using the habitat figures above, that would correspond to a ship carrying no more than 12,708 people, with the actual number of passengers going down the longer the trip takes, since we'd have to dedicate more of the payload mass to food storage. It would be 10,816 passengers if the trip takes a year, 9,415 if it takes two years, etc.

**** 200-400 years, I haven't decided yet.

I'd say yeah, the civilization is at the point where people are colonizing every space they can, even if that's just cuz they can.

Almost everyone either lives in a matrix like vr system or interacts in the real world with drones. Brains are stored in the most redundant and failsafe way possible, and they are definitely not limited to the general shape of modern humans. Augmentation exists at every level, from the nano to the macro. This is because GAI/Simulations aren't currently possible due to [reasons], and it also means that AI are often wetware.

****** Yes to both, though cryonics would be more coma than cryonic, and there's less need of that considering they live large portions of their life in vr and VRMMORPGS have perfected asynchronous/lightspeed delay games (things like a realtime strategy/subterfuge based solar system simulation, where your avatar matches your IRL location).

Nuclear fusion energy engines are available.

Edit: Power -> Biological energy is done as a matter of course, so food/water/etc isn't necessary beyond what's need for the closed loop.

*** Do you have an acceleration limit? Humans shouldn't be exposed to much more than 1G for an extended period of time. If your people are modified, or live as simulations on computer chips, you can raise that. But electronics have a G limit too.

There are several constraints on your answer, but one of them is however fast you can get there by accelerating half way and reverse accelerating the other.

Both endpoints are built up, and launch platforms exist around all the gas giants, though how useful they are depends on how close the destination is at time of launch.

*** None of this should be taken to support the idea that anyone in 40k is making a good decision, has ever made a good decision, or is capable of making good decisions. I'm just covering places where some of these decisions could be rational under the right circumstances.

#+begin_quote
  There are trillions upon trillions of guardsman, but only a million space marines in the entire galaxy. The numbers are so skewed that even if a single marine was literally worth a million guardsman, the guard would still be able to massively out number them. That would be fine if you were getting some kind of unbridgeable jump in quality - but you're really not.
#+end_quote

That presumes the costs are proportional to their numbers. Say a space marine is 100x as effective as a guardsman and costs only 10x as much; then making as many space marines as possible (or useful) makes sense. But if there are throughput limits that say you can only produce 1000 space marines a year no matter how much you spend, the total number of them remains quite low.

You can also support absurd casualty rates in training if the cost of human life is low enough. In this model most of the cost of guardsmen would be their equipment; the person is an afterthought (an economy that is horrible, but not inconceivable). They may also have higher support costs; if we have to ship rations between planets then anything that gives you fewer people starts making a lot more sense.

#+begin_quote
  why even bother with gene seed at all? Why not just extract top quality brains, stick them in a robot body, and that can be your super soldier?
#+end_quote

Assume that there's a maximum prosthetic replacement rate of X% per year before the body starts rejecting the robot parts. The gene seed increases X.

#+begin_quote
  Do you know who pilots space marine tanks? Space marines.
#+end_quote

Somehow this is funnier to me than all the other ways 40k is irrational.

You could hammer this into something resembling sense if one of the benefits of a space marine is that they eat less than a regular human, and the primary cost of your space military is shipping rations between planets. It still requires that the only way to get the "eats less" benefit is to do the entire space marine process (or doing just this costs as much), which is weird, but 40k does come with a half-justification for nobody ever being able to innovate things like this, so if that's what the technology you have looks like that's what you get.

#+begin_quote
  super soldiers, trained from birth to be a master of war, employ tactics about as sophisticated as I did when I was six playing forts in the woods
#+end_quote

Everything ending up being infantry battles is the fundamental stupidness of 40k. Tyranids engage enemies in hand to hand combat despite having the capability for orbital bombardment and a motivation that doesn't care about structures except in that they might be full of meat. I have no fix for this, which is a problem since justifying infantry battles is the goal.

*** One problem I frequently see with fictional uses of infantry is that authors don't seem to understand when/why to use them. The main point of infantry is to exercise restraint, analyze a situation, and use minimal force to achieve your objectives. This is only applicable in a fight where there's something you're trying to protect, like civilians, or infrastructure, or hostages, or people's homes. If none of that matters, then you'll have a much easier time just using artillery, air strikes, carpet bombing, bunker busters, drone strikes, cruise missiles, or even nukes.

So, if you're going to have a space marine to begin with, their role should be to capture enemy equipment or personnel, most likely for reverse-engineering or interrogating people for intel. To achieve that, they should be trying to take the enemy by surprise, before they can destroy their own equipment, activate any kind of self-destruct, and/or commit suicide.

From these three videos, it looks like the marines land on a rebel ship. If you're going to kill everyone but spare the ship, why not just use a neutron bomb? Everyone on board dies of acute radiation sickness, but the ship itself remains intact and salvageable for intel. Alternatively, if you don't need the ship or crew, blow it up with missiles. You should only be sending marines in if you're trying to take prisoners.

***** Of course, both of those features - cheap and stealthy - have gone out the window by the time we're talking about anything to do with space. At best, you could maybe achieve 'inconspicuous' and 'unexpected', as infantry could be loaded onto a known civilian ship, registered with fake IDs, and the ship could conceivably carry them to a station where they could launch a surprise attack after docking.

Beyond that, the only thing even remotely resembling cheap or stealthy in space combat would be micro-drones under a centimeter in radius, possibly harboring biological weapons, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo][grey goo]], or being used as tiny high-velocity guided kinetic-kill weapons to knock out satellites and space stations.

But anyway, agreed, space marines are generally a bad idea and poorly implemented. They could maybe have some niche uses in very rare circumstances, but using them as a regular first-line attack is stupid.

*** Disclaimer: I know nothing about Warhammer, and I thought that video was pretty dumb.

I think the space marines from James A. Corey's /Expanse/ series are an example of this done right. Highly-trained soldiers kitted out in extremely powerful armor & guns. That said, the setting is way different, and it is explicitly shown that a few smart & lucky people can take a marine in power armor by using its momentum against it, scrapping low-caliber ammunition and just tossing bulky shit at them, etc.

Expanse is ~hard sci-fi, so totally different setting, but an example of the trope executed well. Also Bobby is a badass mothafucka.
