** I have not played the game nor have i read you particular spoiler, but why are you suprised that a random story/game is not rational? Isnt that the assumed default, thus this subreddit focused on finding things that do try to be rational?

*** It is an assumed default, yes. But while this game does have mystical elements, there is nothing to say that Magic A Is Magic A as a trope is not in effect. It's just that under the spoiler is something so absolutely massive that I want confirmation from more rationally minded people to help me confirm if I've missed something equally massive that would make it make sense. The story certainly doesn't seem irrational otherwise.

Edit: And like I added in my post, I don't mind trying to delete the post if it doesn't belong.

**** I think it's fine as a top-level post since you are discussing aspects of fiction and how it can be rational or not. But in the future I recommend posting it in the Friday Off-Topic Thread first and then only posting it as its own post if you haven't gotten any answers.

Note that I'm not a moderator, and this is simply how I would have done things as someone who has been posting here for a while.

***** Good to know. I'm not a regular enough around here to have known about the Friday Off Topic Thread. I've never been there.

** I-m currently playing the game. So I will not read your spoiler. But it is cool to read about that game here.

** (Title comment: I initially thought this was a Forrest Gump (which I also have not experienced first-hand) reference; 'Forest' has a single R.)

[[#s][Disclaimer: I will not have an opportunity to play this game for at least several years. Spoilered thoughts nonetheless in case they give you ideas:]]

*** Forest indeed has a single R. However, by the time I noticed, I found I was unable to edit the title.

I think I'll just go ahead and delete this post... It's steadily losing points, so it's pretty safe to say it's largely not wanted, I think.
