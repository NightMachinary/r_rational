Since when? Using other people's life force is generally considered to be impractically hard, and so the typical usage is simply to pay off a demon with it. Not helpful in this case.

There's been no indication anywhere that becoming a lich can or should or usually does involve human sacrifice.

  One was that the release of the primordial was tied to the activation of the divine safeguards on its prison. If the safeguards activated before the month was done, regardless of the reason why, Zach was considered to have failed in his mission. Zach's perception did not matter here -- the contract could detect the activation of the safeguards innately, and was apparently tied to them on some intangible level....

   the good news was that the enforcement of that particular clause of the contract depended entirely on Zach's own perception, just like Zorian suspected. Zach was the one who determined whether a violation of the contract had occurred or not. If someone knew about the time loop but Zach never found out about it, the contract would never know either. It pulled information straight from Zach's senses, thoughts, and memories
#+end_quote

it says 'that particular clause' refering to people knowing about the time loop. so if zach didn't know ppl knew, then it won't activate. but the panaxeth part is based in the safe guards triggering, zach's perception be damned

**** I'm fairly confident his plan is to combine his research into getting around mind blank, his practice with Spear of Resolve on editing perceptions of reality, and the magic graffiti he secretly spread around town.

Specifically, he's going to alter Zach's perceptions while he's under mind blank to show Zorian dying. Since Zach has every reason to think Mind Blank is inviolate he'd believe fully honestly that Zorian's dead, and thus the secret of the time loop is left to only him (after some much less harmful memory shenanigans with Xvim, Alanic, etc.), and the contract is fulfilled.

And then, once Zach is freed from the contract, Zorian reveals that he's alive after all, and both of them get to live.

Even after time loop collapse The five treasures of Ikosian Emperor still have abilities in real wolrd.

The Crown in posession of QI, a super personal mana battery.

The Dagger is kept in royal treasury have an ability to cut spirits, might be stolen by RRJornak

The Ring in possession of Sulrothum High Priest, granting a person soul perception ability.

The Orb in possession of Zorian, a super large pocket dimension.

The Staff is held by Violet Eye mage dragon, a teleportation device that can teleport a person between recall points. Remember when QI tell Zorian that RRJornak was sending his simulacrum to Koth to build a gate, even for Zorian to reach Koth almost take him a month, 20 days with ship, 15 days by using teleport platform under ideal condition. I worried this Staff might be in RRJornak possession.

Dubious. There's no teleport transit between Altazia and Blantyrre. Silverlake would tell RRJornak even Zach/Zorian require an airship to cross the distance initially, relying on Bakora gate afterward. We can safely assume the scepter is still in Violet Eye's possession.

But hey, let's entertain the idea, what's use of 12 charge of teleport staff for battle that happen in a single city? Sure, it'll immensely help the Church contain the wraith bombs, especially if priests capable in containing them is rare among their rank. But what use of it for Zach/Zorian? /Gasp/, we unintentionally found a topic for Saturday Munchkinry Thread!

Even disregarding all of the defences that he would surely have (because if you can get close enough to touch him, there are lots of simpler ways to kill him, so he's bound to have ways to stop that from happening), the staff only works to take you to markers that you've previously set.

** We've finally reached the final battle! And so much for Zorian's plans to stay quiet and hidden after it's all over, eh?

It's pretty neat just how many parallels there are between Zorian and Jornak. Both are resentful young men who are incredibly meticulous and crazy-prepared, with their strenghts lying in said plans rather than pure strength. They're both like Batman; When versus someone, it's just a matter of how much time they have to prepare.

Jornak has Zorian's pragmatism and pettiness turned up to eleven, and unlike Zorian whose resentfulness and anger toned down as he progressed, Jornak's just got more and more intense.

** I think it's rather brilliant to use Rea's smelling sense to deduce Zorian's involvement. Keeping cat as pet myself, I think cats are awful sniffer. But repeated exposure from unexpected source will indeed strengthen the suspicion. Bravo. Anyway, including mine, I counted at least three comment questioning how Rea's able to ambush Zorian last chapter. Did the discussion help you refine the logic behind today's chapter, author? Rea knowledge of Zorian's absence from class is what solidify the plot, because smell is rather feeble in its lonesome.

-- Onto the praise for the chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “Look, what do you even expect of me?” Zorian asked Rea, frowning at her slightly. “I don't know where any kidnapped children are being kept. Do you think I would just sit on that information if I knew?”
#+end_quote

For Rea, this basically confirmed Zorian's rather high position in the conspiracy. Zorian's at least the chief among the group's scouts. Brilliant subtlety! We can expect Zorian will have some measure of fame among the cat shifters.

#+begin_quote
  “Success,” simulacrum number one mumbled.
#+end_quote

It's rather dubious for Haslush to catch on previous quote. He's not portrayed as sharp as Rea after all. But this quote, if Haslush heard it, he will start to think Zorian is a great diviner. He might even think Zorian is Mr Kesir's apprentice! How could Haslush not when Zorian can tell the spell is successful when he is virtually separated from the ritual. We can expect, at least, Haslush consulting Zorian in solving cases in the future, if not zealously trying to recruit him to the force. Cool stuff!

-- Criticism

None really. Typo is rather worse than usual, and double delay is painful. But the end product is as excellent as always.

-- Personal note

Aw, Zorian failed at playing down his involvement. While it will net him positive reputation from Rea and Haslush, the ship for Raynie could be threatened. Romance rarely blossom from asymmetric relationship. In today's chapter, Zorian could be seen as savior for Raynie's woe. If I'm Raynie, I would see Zorian with great measure of gratitude and respect. But for romance? She might be reluctant for it. More reluctant than when both of them are virtual stranger.

*** There's a kinda pretty large shortcoming/issue author overlooked. if you think about simulacra, it is just an ectoplasma or some golem. How would that think smell?

It should stand out very easily for Rea or Rayne. Two simulacra beside her or the one near Rea should have no own smell. So they should have noticed that. Any shifter with improved sense of smell (canine/feline based) should be able to identify simulacra.

So what are the chances all those people interacted with original before visiting Rea and carried his smell. (and not the original odorless simulacra).

[[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] - the body odor comes from physical sweat glands. Is it oversight? While it would be possible do strap some add-on which would spread some smell, but any shifter should be able to sniff it out.

**** The smell should be there, since Zorian has to create all the simulacrums and they weak clothes and use tools that he made for them... but it would be way fainter than that of the original Zorian, as one of the other comments noted. I think Rea and other scent-capable shifters would know the simulacrums were very weird, but wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that they're fake copies. They mostly behave like real Zorian and know everything he does, they're tangible, and Rea probably never encountered that type of magic before. She'd probably think Zorian was doing something weird to himself, which would add to the mystery but not exactly tell her /what/.

***** you are the author here, but I would argue that shifters and their heightened senses should be very effective against simulacra.

It is not just the sweat/smell. Every living person breathes and shifters should be able to spot breathing patterns very easily, especially if they are making. Also this is supposed to be end-of-summer and usually this is the hottest season - so no sweating should be very noticeable.

Besides smells, the other senses would work very well identifying living body. Polygraphs work by monitoring reactions on very tiny detailed levels. Did the heartbeat accelerated? Maybe some extra sweat/whatever. The shifters with their senses would keep very high attention on the person (to check if they are lying) - the matter is related to the very close relatives. Any shifter worth their cost would try to monitor heart beat and most likely fail to detect it. With large focus with super powerful senses from shifter side the simulacra would trip a LOT of alarms.

I would argue that golem frame helps with mana usage and durability, but there should be a negative impact on stealth. At least at some stages solution to moving golem was pre-record some actions (like move a hand) instead of low level management - but those records, also no need for muscles/whatever of golem to spend energy while being frozen should push simulacra into "uncanny valley" area. Some perfect-still-freezes, repetitive/exactly the same motions - if anyone is paying close attention, there should be some stiff movements to give it out.

It is not that hard to fix too. Zorian would kick himself for not spotting this earlier and he needs to make a mental note to not sent simulacra to interact with shifters. Also he might ask via his simulacra Alanic - is there a way to fool shifters and their senses and have simulacra present at the meeting instead of real body.

At the ritual site he is being in person and the simulacra doing the ritual are less important.

There's alse one random scene previously where simulacra invites Rayne to the date to spike original off. She could have noticed the difference about Zorian, especially since the invitation - she would pay a close attention.

In general, this would undermine usability of simulacra spell by allowing some easy detection on a lot of scenarios. It is too OP, needs nerf :)

****** If I can butt into the conversation, I don't think a simulacrum ever asked Raynie out. Zorian's interactions with her ended before he learned the simulacrum spell. I think you're confusing the event with when a simulacrum invited Akoja out.

You bring up some good points though, with how Rea was mentioned to have superior hearing before she probably is at a level where she should be able to hear a simulacrum's lack of heartbeat. That said, I can think of two arguments against her noticing it (at this point in time). One is that she only encountered the simulacrum Zorian this chapter, when she was a little freaked out about how highly Zorian was connected, so she might just not have noticed it yet. Two, if she ever worked as some kind of agent against mages, as some cat shifters probably would, it's not unreasonable to think she encountered mages behind silencing wards before, which would prevent any sound from leaking out from their area, and she could simply be assuming simulacrum-Zorian was using something similar for some reason.

I don't think simulacra are controlled purely by magic though, in the way you're describing, to the level of having to puppeteer its body. Both ectoplasmic and golem simulacra has its castor's mind copy attached (as well as being able to share the castor's soul), so whatever body movement tics original-Zorian had should still be reflected in his simulacrum, except maybe for chest movement from breathing. And I would be surprised if the ectoplasmic shell failed to replicate approximately the muscles just under the skin, since the skin is one thing that's duplicated in its entirety, in contrast to the copy's innards.

********* I'm pretty sure the cats not being used as cat-sniffers is more related to the fact that they are much more harder to train than dogs and not to physical ability.

Cats clean themselves up (lick?) so they would have as little smell as possible.

anyway random google suggests: Scent

Our canine friends have an amazing sense of smell, and we use their scenting ability in many ways. However, cats have an even better sense of smell and can identify differences between a larger variety of scents

Dogs and cats are crepuscular rather than nocturnal animals. Their eyesight is designed to pick up on the slightest movement in the low light of the twilight hours of dusk and dawn. They can also see ultraviolet light which is invisible to us.

Dogs and cats use their ears to express emotions, and both have remarkable hearing. Even in the wee hours of the night the world is a noisy place for our pets. Dogs have 18 muscles in their ears allowing them to move each ear independently to better detect where a sound is coming from. They can hear frequencies up to around 45,000 hertz.

Cats have an even greater range of movement with 32 muscles that allow them to rotate their ears 180 degrees, and they can hear at higher frequencies than dogs -- up to 100,000 hertz.

Bottom line -- both dogs and cats have amazing senses!

******* They talk via magic/sound illusion (like spear of resolve spoke to the alchemist when they visited the underground at the start of the story).

Yes, I am aware of simulacra attached to golem frame - simulacra controls golem directly, not remote control. I don't think the design is that much more different from combat golems Zorian was creating, just on different scale (the base at least).

Anyways, even if it is directly attached, is it really a exact copy of human skeleton? It should have too much freedom or too little - there are some limitation human body has - like muscles and tendons. Golem is being moved via animation spells, AFAIK, so the freedom range is much large. Also, when a regular human is idle, (like the command to body is - be still), we are still using/balancing muscles, alternating them. shifting from one leg to another, etc. - all those micro movements. The golem can be perfectly still - there's no need to compensate/balance the body for it constantly. Even if some of the stuff can be animated, since it is being by spell, it should be exactly the same and humans are very very good at spotting patterns.

IIRC, the design goals for simulacra golems were survival and upkeep concerns. There might have been some other goals strapped on - but I'm sure the stealth/mimicry of the real human body is not the top priority.

Ah, but that changed in chapter 74; the simulacrums all went on strike until Zorian assigned two of them the full time job of improving their frames. In chapter 79, simulacrum #2 noted that the golem frames now felt indistinguishable from a normal body.

** I'm pretty sure whatever illusion Zorian cooks up is not going to target Zach exclusively. We will probably see Zorian die at the end of the next chapter or the chapter after that (at the end of the final fight).

The thing is if only Zach saw it even if he was under mind blank at the moment it might not be enough to convince him. But with all the telepathic relays around the city Zorian can convince Zach that he and some other key figures who have knowledge of the time loop died (some of them will actually die though).

Once some of the contingencies trigger after his death along with the massive illusion which happens during/after the fight, Zach will no longer need to die. This is all necessary because Zach already knows Zorian was trying to find a way to bypass the rules of his contract so he will already be suspicious that shenanigans might be at play so he will need overwhelming evidence in order to actually believe that they all conveniently died even after they won the war.

This is also why Zorian might actually go to lich route if it is necessary to sell the lie. He doesn't drink/get laid anyway :D and any other pleasure I'm pretty sure he can use self illusions :) not getting laid though because he doesn't know what that feels like...

**** There was a passage where it said - and I might be misremembering - that Zach had a compulsion to hunt down those who knew the details of his contract with angels. But that compulsion ceased after a while. And if I'm not wrong, quite a few people like Alanic are also at least aware that there is a contract in place. So those people need to die or at least appear to die. There is also a similar rule regarding knowledge about the time loop.

I think Zach might not believe what he sees and might investigate afterwards as to what really happened including asking questions to other people and their answers might convince him further. Like Taiven crying about it and Hashlush bringing a letter to Zach (or sth similar) as per the will of Zorian. So I believe a mass illusion including multiple people might sell the lie better.

And I think people will actually die because they are about to engage in the final battle and it would be unbelievable if no body important really died...

***** No guarantees about my memory either, but I think the compulsion was only if his mind was read, and the thing about him having to kill everyone who knew was just Silverlake interpreting "otherwise he'll die" as "must". But yeah, we do still need for Zach to think they're all dead.

I'd been assuming there wouldn't /be/ an afterwards. I'd also been assuming the final battle would happen on the night of the summer festival, and I forgot to take into account the change. Now that you mention it, Zorian might not be able to keep up a convincing illusion for 24 hours straight, in which case there's complications like you say. Wait, can he just trade off with simulacrums? They need to sleep, but it doesn't have to be at the same time, right? (Also, I have no idea how tricky it is to fake everyone's reactions like that. The matriarch did see some flaws in his illusion when he was testing, so it might be worth making it last as short as possible.)

I understand more than one like Zorian said, but the plan is to destroy the town via invasion and Primordial, and the wraiths should only trigger upon Jornak's death (Or tampering, but I find that unlikely to happen during the invasion), and they should take alot of time to make, so shouldn't they just plant the bombs meant for Cyoria in the Capital?

Chapter 90 was before they leave the time loop all it have was Zorian's conclusions/suppositions after they meet the primordial.

  "So if I understood you three correctly, the contract is as follows..." Zorian said. "You make a death pact with Panaxeth, swearing that you would either free him within a month or die trying. He then takes your soul and 'incarnates' it in the outside world. That is to say, he creates a brand new copy of your body in the real world, at the start of the month, in effect physically ejecting you out of the time loop. Included in the created body is some kind of kill switch that will kill you if Panaxeth is still imprisoned at the end of the summer festival."

Zorian not only gets to steal knowledge from people with impunity due to being mind mage/time loop wiping out consequences, he also partnered with several extremely powerful/intelligent mages towards the end of the time loop to do intense research. Other than the extreme expertise of Xvim, Alanic, Silverlake, etc, theres also the government scientists he coopted, and all the aranea he worked with. Zorian learns through his simulacrums, as well as giving himself mind modifications to be smarter, as well as natural higher-processing abilities as a natural mind mage.

All those things plus being able to spend those years studying under intense pressure (end of the world), with nigh-unlimited resources and no physical risks no matter how crazy his experiments, it makes sense that if anyone were to become that skilled in 8 years, itd be zorian.

**** Shaping is tedious and difficult, and shows results slowly, so it makes sense that a lot of people don't bother with it--I'd compare it to math or science in real life.

What hasn't made sense to me is that the noble families, who have tons of money and desire for strong/useful heirs, don't force their kids to practice shaping before they send them to college.

A few years of practice would give them a huge edge. Xvim sort of explains that shaping is viewed as mostly useless, but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, given that any advanced mage should know you need shaping skills for more complex magic (and it lets you stretch your mana reserves, effectively increasing your mana pool.)

The government should have a similar incentive to have this done (especially as most of them are probably expecting a war.), but instead they just have four years of schooling, starting at 14 or so.

Maybe magic isn't usable until you're older? Zorian did mention that Kirielle likely couldn't do much, when she asked him to teach her, but I ascribed that to him basically blowing her off, as he thought she would get to learn in a few years.

If that's the case, then the current situation makes a lot of sense. Shaping takes a lot of effort and time which you aren't spending learning theory and spells, which are more immediately useful.

And yet STEM degrees are very powerful tools for success, meanwhile they don't require genius. All that's needed is a lot of hard work.

For these reasons, it's entirely believable to me that hardly anyone invests the time to learn shaping when in the real world, math departments are among the most underpopulated on most campus. And even then, most students who pass though math departments do so just to meet one or two graduation requirements for statistics or are engineers who only take through differential equations or linear algebra, which is hardly anything; stopping before real analysis means they don't really have any sense of what math beyond calculation feels like.

******* I see them more as a foundation or springboard for the kind of growth rate you can achieve if everything lines up perfectly in your favour (for instance, if you have nigh-infinite resources, few societal obligations, the ability to hunt for forbidden knowledge with no fear of dying, talented mentors, inherent natural talents, etc.)

What made Zorian so strong wasn't getting 8 years to train. It was getting 8 years where he could grow at speeds so reckless the only possible way they could be sustained is if you had a ridiculous cheat code for infinite money and no consequences.

And even then, there's only so far he can go if his fundamentals are weak, and that's where shaping comes in. If Zorian had great shaping skills and none of the tutors, resources, or freedom from consequences he got in the time loop, he'd get really good at the few beginner things he safely learned, and then go learn a professional skill at normal, safe rates. It's not really a strong payoff unless you're already growing ridiculously fast for other reasons.

So, yeah, Zorian isn't this powerful /because/ of shaping, but he wouldn't be this powerful without it, if that makes sense.

******* Shaping exercises are only a part of his bullshit - it was also the ability to throw himself into dangerous or even suicidal situations and experiments to improve his skill, and essentially infinite resources due to all of it being reset after being spent, and the ability to cultivate one-of-a-kind teachers through repeating loops until he can convince them to teach him.

​

Shaping exercises are good and powerful, but they're both exponentially more difficult and they're only genuinely, honest to god useful at like a PHD level - before then, they're a party trick, and most people don't need to spend the time ignoring other things they could be learning in favor of practicing shaping. Normal magic is getting a normal college degree, while full on shaping and multimagery is like a PHD that takes 3-4x longer and you might not even have the talent to do it in the first place.

Consider chapter 27, where Zorian went wandering around the countryside: "He did not stop his magical training, but in the absence of any sort of clear goal or a convenient repository of spells like the academy library had been, he defaulted to the most basic of advancement methods -- shaping exercises. It helped that most of the rural mages he met on his journey had some private shaping exercise they were willing to show him... and unlike Xvim, who simply told him the end result he wanted and refused to elaborate, they actually had detailed instructions about what to do and in what order."

How many mages would have the motivation and capability to do that? Would academy students from well-to-do backgrounds want to become footsore and weary in a low-magic environment, traipsing all over the countryside doing odd jobs? Would those with useful talents choose to walk away from the libraries and tutors that would help them to refine those talents, not to mention ignoring the many potential employers? Would concerned parents be happy for their children to go out and risk being eaten by giant salamanders and winter wolves? If everyone tried it, would all those rural mages be so open and willing to share?

And that's just one of dozens of examples of how Zorian's experience was atypical.

***** Do you know you could spend hours and hours focusing on learning certain things and get a job making millions of dollars? Why haven't you done it? Oh you want to read stories, play video games, watch anime, instead of focusing 100% on a subject to become an expert in something thats very valuable.

​

People in this world is much the same. You can either learn the cool spells you want at 1X the speed.

Or you can put all that on hold for years and master shaping for years so that you can learn things at .10 the speed.

In the short term the person learning cool spells at 1x the speed are learning a lot of stuff and able to do cool things. They have picked their specialty and 1x the speed is fine for studying for their specialty. They also spend time hanging with their friends and doing fun things. Plus there are certain shaping spells that are specialty specific they learn so they might be learning things in their specialty at .5 speed or something. This wouldn't help for other branches of magic but they aren't on the "arch mage path." Very few but the most motivated would go with the shaping spells method first. Even fewer would spend their free time studying shaping spells instead of having fun and hanging with their friends. This probably goes doubly so for mages from rich families. How many rich kids do you know that are super motivated hard workers? Yeah... most I know are lazy and have everything handed to them.

​

Zorian is normal in many ways but:

1. Uniquely motivated. Trapped in time loop means that he has the motivation to work long hours for years to try and get strong enough to get out.\\
2. Not really that social/into romance. Means that he is hyper focused unlike zach who spent years just hanging out with various people.
3. Once he found out more informatin he became even more motivated.
4. Unlimited funds.
5. Willing teachers. Zach taught zorian a lot and with zorians shaping skills he was able to pick up zach's spell library fast. It took zach 50 years to assemble that library. Not because it was hard to learn the spells, but because mages are very secretive.\\
6. Zorian has mind powers which he used to his advantage.
7. Zorian in the end turned his brain into a calculator and greatly improved his memory capabilities.

​

All these things turned zorian from being a normal mage into an incredibly powerful one. He still isn't going to be fighting off zach or the lich in a straight up fight.

***** Think of it like maths. Basic math is necessary and everyone does a bit in school. But most jobs don't require that much of it after all so you let go of it to explore your field of interest. You'll study trade or architecture. But if you become a math beast, at the end you'll realize a lot of doors open because having that math background easily gets you to the complicated part of each fields. Don't know business? doesn't matter, you know math, go become a business analyst or a trader. Don't know architecture? doesn't matter, you know math, go become an engineer. Input from experienced masters is still valuable and Zorian gets it but he has the tools to go in depth once he understand the gist of it.

So why is everyone not doing a PhD in Maths? Well a lot of people aren't really interested in it and prefer other fields. Same in the story. The way magic evolved also contributes to how underrated a skill it is. Before it was necessary but as mages started organizing themselves it became less needed which is the current situation

***** Shaping is tough to learn and takes dedication. It way easier to learn spell formulas, however this leads to specialisation and an inability of mages to perform more than 1 or 2 roles. On the other hand economically the market is flooded with lots of mages that can do specific things, can't move jobs easily. This means overall more magic can be done but there is very little overlap in domains - similar to how our economy of skills functions. We're at a point where cross-disciplinary skills are becoming or are important and eventually that will happen in Eldemar too but it's a long ways off.

***** Bit of a necro post, but still the current chapter.

​

*Shaping*:

I did not see anyone mention this, but shaping also consumes mana. Mana is not unlimited and the main reason the magic academy is at that location is because they have near infinite ambient mana due to the mana well.

​

#+begin_quote
  Being a mage out there in the periphery was a lot different than being a mage in Cyoria, Zorian mused. Without the massive quantities of ambient mana gushing out of the Hole, conserving mana was actually a noticeable issue -- even shaping exercises tended to deplete his reserves after a couple of hours, whereas back in Cyoria his main limitation had been his patience and existing obligations eating into his free time. That was another reason why Zorian focused on shaping exercises in preference to any actual spellcasting while traveling.
#+end_quote

​

So shaping 24/7 is not possible outside of certain areas. Areas in which the cost of living will be higher, prohibiting certain people from doing it. How many people have the funding available to dedicate themselves to such tasks? This means Zorian is in an optimal place to spend the time loop, one in which his expenses are covered (at least his living expenses).

There is also a limit to how much mana you can absorb at once, so even the mana wells likely have limitations on how long you can do shaping. There is also the question of whether it is truly healthy to shape so long. Pushing your mana resolves too far can utterly wreck your shaping skills due to your mana reserve growth.

While shaping exercises are much less mana intensive I wonder what would happen if you strained your mana reserves for so long without being able to magically reset yourself every month.

And that is assuming someone is actually dedicated to their magic.

​

*Why Mages & the Academy Sucks*

The thing to remember about this world is that it exists under feudalism. Royalty, nobility, the church, shifters, and other factions are constantly jockeying for power. While the King is nominally at the top, that does not mean he is all powerful. He has to gather support and play the different factions against each other.

This is partly why the House system was so effective. Houses get privileges which allowed the Ikosians to gather outsiders into their system. The Houses also teach their own, passing down decades or centuries of experience and tutelage, something many mages are reluctant to give outsiders. Houses are also easier to manage. A dozen or hundred mages have as many goals and needs, a House with them collected will be united and self managing. Easier to manage a dozen houses than thousands of mages. So you end up with a self perpetuating system that creates elite mages AND has convenient centralized goals and leaders. So much easier for a King to manage. You don't even need all the Houses to back you, just enough. They will also help manage each other, preventing them from turning on you.

​

/Then/ /+The Fire Nation Attacked+/ /The Splinter Wars & The Weeping Happened./

The flower of mages was cut down. Much knowledge was likely lost, and the systems that upheld order were broken. It is not a coincidence that so much technology is developing, the existing order is broken and new things are emerging.

Eldemar needs to not only consider how best to counter the other nations, but how to continue maintaining unity and control over itself.

The Mage School was the solution. Mages are force multipliers, and with the Houses broken more power was needed. Standards were lowered, and the process of creating tons of weak mages was started. Raising many weak mages is better than nothing. It is also a good return on investment.

It also serves the purpose of countering the Houses. Many Houses fell, and the power that was once distributed widely is likely far more concentrated now. Having a bunch of weak mages that owe their livelihood to the crown is a good way to counter the now consolidated Houses. These mages are a good short term solution in that they owe much to the Royalty, but are a nightmare for the future. tangent ->>! (Part of what makes them easier to manage now is that they suck, are an existential threat to the Houses and therefore seek sponsorship from the King, and are disunited and lacking resources. But what if they weren't? The Magic Guild is already exerting power (as we see them effecting the legal system). Look at the Cult. They are a mutual cooperative society. If they were out in the open and composed of a larger amount of the mages in the country they would be super powerful. This was a good short term solution but will have far reaching effects on the existing order. There may not be a Royal family in the future, it could just be a mageocracy.)!<

But why weak mages? Partly because of cost, partly because the system is so fucked. Even if the School really pushed shaping, how many kids would actually listen?

Standards had to be dropped anyways, and the number of student makes direct tutelage costly.

The natural counter to a weak curriculum is the Mentor system, but that also has problems. With so many expert mages dead, the remaining can demand much higher pay and benefits. They also have a status raise, due to the lack of remaining expert mages.

How effective do you think that system is? Even Zvim is kinda shitty as a teacher. You need to be dedicated to be a good mage, and many of the students just aren't. And without a complete system ie A House to push and aid them, they will always be a mediocre mage.

So why not just create a mass of weak cost effective mages, and I don't know a special class for the gifted. And there you see the Advanced Class. One which is defeated in its purpose due to the corruption and power of the Houses and Wealthy.

The entire system is screwy. Look at how spells are categorized, there is a lot of political gamesmanship going on.

​

Shaping aside, Zorian had lots of time, an amount of money that no Country could possibly dedicate to any student, the ability to take risks and come back from death, and the ability to learn from different factions without others becoming enemies.

​

Everything comes at a cost. You could dump a load of money on the Magic Academy. But then that money could have been used to develop better guns or artillery. Or on black projects like Necromancy or Mind Control. Or on medicine or healing magic, to counter the threat of another Weeping or just fill the gaps the crippled Church left behind. Or on rebuilding the damage from the Splintering & Weeping. OR on Time Dilation Rooms. Rooms which you can not only reward your supporters but make them better.

​

Any mage you spend money and resources on can still die from stupidity or a gunshot. They could also be disloyal. The King is balancing multiple powers and concerns against each other, it is not as simple as just make the academy better. Because what about the head of the Mage's Guild? He is clearly spending a lot of time on the Cult and his own research. Is he really focusing on the School? Would anyone else you appoint be any better? Flying ships are a threat for the future, what other threats are there the reader has not been exposed to? What projects may doom a nation that overlooks them? The world is changing very quickly, and resources are finite even without the equivalent of the Black Death sweeping through.

​

The point is, the Academy is making fodder not real mages. In a decade or two, I would expect curriculum to get harder once enough fodder is in place, institutions are a bit stabilized and hopefully the crisis has passed. The Houses are tutoring their own anyways, so the only mages really effected are the new class of lower class mages. Which again, do you really want a ton of powerful mages running around without being tied to something you can control?

I kinda sad people point to shaping exercise as the main cause for Zorian awesomeness. It contributes, but it's not that. It's the loop. Receiving feedback for whatever you do is immense boon and Sovereign Gate gives more than ample amount of that. Without immediate feedback provided, the cutting edge mage can only do guesswork to advance their skill. Guesswork costs resources that can't be recouped, opportunity that might only happen once in a lifetime, and above all, time. Both time that spent on deliberate consideration on where your resources should be allocated, and time that was sunk for failed enterprise. Outside time loop, the skill advancement is several magnitude slower!
