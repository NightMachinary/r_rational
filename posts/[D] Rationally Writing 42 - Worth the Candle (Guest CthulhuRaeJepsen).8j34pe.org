*** Interesting talk. Thanks a lot for making it and posting.

You sounded a bit rambly at times, but you managed to get the point across really well, and I like how you both got going further out

**** Would definitely be happy to have them on, I reached out about a year ago but never got a response. Wasn't sure if they missed the message or were just too busy for podcasting (and their writing speed has just gone up since then!), but I'll try reaching out again to see :)

***** Glad to hear. Yeah the Patreon support, even without any real reward structure that others might have, has really boosted the amount of time it seems that EE has been able to devote to writing so perhaps the schedule would be more open to the podcast now.

** We will probably do another episode on this at a later date, perhaps down the road once either more has been written, or when /Worth the Candle/ has reached its conclusion (same goes for /Pokemon: Origin of Species/).

Is there anything you'd like for us to talk about in a future episode about /Worth the Candle/? Things you wish that we'd touched on in this one? Questions about writing (or the writing process) would be especially appreciated.

(Incidentally, we haven't done a Mail Bag episode, and I kind of want to at some point.)

*** Just wanted to comment on something you brought up in the podcast -- you mentioned that you're concerned that the characters may spend too much time talking about what they're going to do. I really like that we get to see how they think about things, and I think the rhythm it gives the story is a good one. Where Worm and Twig are exhausting because there's very little time out of crisis, and Mother of Learning for a while felt like there was no pressure, Worth the Candle maintains a sense of need for forward motion while still having moments of an adventuring party's equivalent of domesticity. Relationship development can serve the same purpose, but that can be just as fraught as actual combat, as demonstrated by the last few chapters. Having room to breathe makes it even more intense to have the wind knocked out of you, and it's great!

There are tons of other things you do well, and I love your writing in general. Just thought you might appreciate feedback on this specific thing. As always, can't wait for the next chapter!

*** I started reading Worth the Candle after listening to this episode and I have binging it a bit. Very good so far!

I got to the part where juniper starts learning Groglir and I think constructed languages could be interesting topic even as a standalone episode.

** Question : Are transcripts of these podcasts ever made? I find that I prefer reading to listening. No pressure though; just curious :)

*** We don't have transcripts. They're requested fairly often, but super time and labor intensive to produce. I've played around a bit with machine transcription, but the free stuff didn't really give satisfactory results, and the paid stuff costs money (imagine that!).

The best solution would probably be to have a free machine transcription that's then edited through crowd-sourcing.

If someone has a counter-recommendation, or some (amateur) expertise in the area, let me know; part of the problem is that I'm not well-versed in machine transcription, so a lot of time is spent on research and trying to figure things out. If it were as simple as "press a button to get a translation" we'd probably have those up already. (Same goes for uploading the back-catalog to Youtube, which I need to take some time to figure out how to do.)
