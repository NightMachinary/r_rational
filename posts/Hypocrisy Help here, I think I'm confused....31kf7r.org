Ok. I just got into an argument with my parents. Nothing big or damaging or anything, but it WAS confusing. And I want this sub's opinion on something.

My mom is very against listening to hypocrites. I made the counterpoint that someone being a hypocrite doesn't necessarily mean what they're saying is incorrect. Someone who doesn't believe in math telling me "2+2=4" doesn't make them any less correct. A fat person telling me I should reduce my calorie count and exercise more to lose weight doesn't make them incorrect, just because they are incapable of following their own advice.

Now, obviously, I'm not saying you should let your accountant tell you how to distribute your military. You shouldn't believe someone just because you don't know if they're right or wrong. My point was that, you should be able to rationally determine if what the hypocrite is saying is true. Obviously, there are times when you can't, due to lack of information. But my mom discards the statement entirely, instead of evaluating it, which is my big problem.

I just wanted some feedback on how you guys feel about this issue. Also, and this is a sidenote, not my main question, how you feel about MY take on the issue.

*** The formal version of it is /tu quoque/.

- X claims Y.
- X does not act on Y.
- Therefore, not Y.

An example:

- Joe says smoking is bad for you.
- Joe is a pack-a-day smoker.
- Therefore, smoking is not bad for you.

Never mind that Joe could have a death wish, or be speaking from personal experience and trying to quit, or be friends with someone who believes that smoking is a moral obligation, or otherwise be unable or unwilling to not smoke.

** I am exceedingly tired of people being dismissed just because they aren't perfect. There are lots of people who are deeply flawed but still have plenty of worthwhile things to say. And just because you fail to reach a certain moral standard, doesn't mean you have a bad idea about what a moral standard should be.

*** Pretty much what I said to her. She tried to defend her point by saying there's a difference between hypocrisy and "making an error in judgement". For example, someone who got pregnant as a teen could still advise people about using protection. She wouldn't consider them a hypocrite. But a smoker, or an alcholic (someone who's hypocritical behavior is ongoing) wouldn't be able to advise her on the dangers of either activity. She wouldn't put value on what they say.

***** I understand you not wanting people to judge you, if they themselves are doing the same thing. The pot calling the kettle black, as it were. But I'm concerned as to why she can't take factual information from it. If a smoker bitches at you because you smoke. Fine, de-value their words. But if a smoker tells you that you shouldn't smoke because you'll get yellow teeth and trouble breathing, seems like you should believe them.

**** In fairness to your mom, "not putting value in what X says" is not the same thing as "thinking what X says is wrong because X says it".

Like, if someone tells me smoking is bad, but they smoke -- if I were on the fence about smoking, I would be /less significantly influenced/ by this than by someone who tells me smoking is bad and they follow their own advice. Hypocrisy in a person leads me to value less strongly their own rationality and knowledge, and thus put less stock in their ability to know/believe correct things, and thus put less stock in what they say. Guard myself against aligning myself alongside what they say just 'cause they say it. Etc.

That doesn't mean I would necessarily ascribe /negative/ value to their statements, though. At worst it might drop down to zero.

Do you think it's possible your mom was trying to say something like that? Or was she actually anti-believing something based on the fact that a hypocrite said it? Like, she was on the fence before, but since a hypocrite said it she's /against/ it now, sort of thing?

**** Did this start off as an object-level argument which involved a hypocrite making an argument against something your mom believes, and then get into a meta-level argument about the general validity of hypocrites' advice? Particularly this post about errors in judgement vs ongoing hypocrisy, while potentially a legitimate distinction, also feels like it could be the result of backwards reasoning from "I believe A and a hypocrite #1 is arguing against it" and "I believe B and a hypocrite #2 is arguing for it," then trying to find a distinction between the two hypocrites which makes one's observation valid and the other's not.

Yes. A hypocrite is someone whose /actions/ don't match their /words/. That's a moral status, not an epistemic one. Hypocrites often make true statements, they just fail to actually follow through on such.

  A fat person telling me I should reduce my calorie count and exercise more to lose weight doesn't make them incorrect, just because they are incapable of following their own advice.
#+end_quote

Yes. But a fat person /might/ be more likely to have false beliefs about the best methods of not being fat compared to a thin fit person. Not every fat person always, but it may be something that's /generally/ true. (Because if they knew how not to be fat, and if they prefer to not be fat, they wouldn't be fat.)

Is this a vast oversimplification, and are you better off evaluating arguments based on other, better criteria? Yes. So you're /more correct/ than your mom.

** Something to consider: evaluating if something is true or useful has a cost, in time/effort/frustration. Since we have access to so much information (internet, books, etc), coarse filters on what information to not bother evaluating seriously can make sense.

As an example, consider advertisements, on the internet, billboards, tv, whatever. Tons of information being thrown at me. Sure, some of it might be true or even useful to me, but I ignore everything that looks even a little like an advertisement because it's not worth sifting through the shit.

*** Fair point. But I feel like, barring strangers that engage YOU for some banal reason, the very fact that you bother to have a conversation with someone indicates you care about what they're saying, at least a little bit. Enough to consider what they say, and judge if it's worth a second look.

*** There haven't been any specific incidents, but here are some hypotheticals that were thrown out. Specifically, she says that she'd never let a fat person tell her how to lose weight. She would ignore what they say. Same for smokers telling her how to quit. Her thing is that, "If you can tell me how to do something, or give me advice, that you can't follow yourself, what you're saying has no worth." And I understand where she's coming from. You wouldn't take stock advice from someone who's always losing out on trades. That indicates they're not good at what they're doing. I'm cool with assigning /lesser/ value to the words of a hypocrite, as it's possible their advice just doesn't work, hence why they seem like a hypocrite. But assigning zero value seems stupid.

Here's a better example. I'm fairly overweight. But I've been to the gym a couple of times (a few 3-4 week stints over the past couple of years) and I have a couple friends that go to the gym. As a result, I've passively acquired a good chunk of knowledge about things like strength training, weight loss, etc. I couldn't be a personal trainer, but I'm not totally clueless. But if the subject comes up, and I try to contribute anything I've picked up (reducing carbs is a good idea, frequency of eating is a good thing as it keeps your metabolism up, etc.) she discredits it because I'm overweight. Which, I try to argue, makes no sense. That's kind of how the discussion started.

Is there anything she's not perfect at, but she still thinks she has some useful knowledge about? If so, you could compare it to that.

** I would say that not listening to hypocrites is a relatively effective use of time. Not that what they are saying is definitely wrong, but its less likely to be correct, in the same way that it is more likely that a science teacher will give you correct information, versus some religious preacher that will mention some scientific "facts". Sure both might tell you the truth, but the first one is more likely to do so then the second. If you have lots of time it would be fine to research both, to be sure its correct, if you don't have much time it would make sense to attach some probability to the information being correct and to work with it, so the teacher would get higher probability while the preacher would get a low one.

** Eh, depending on the context it could be a rational decision that something isn't worth your time. Additionally, hypocrisy & other personal failings can strip the speaker's words of the benefit of the doubt, which is worth noting. "Ad Homenim" arguments are perfectly fine if you're saying "this person isn't worth listening to" - it simply doesn't /refute/ whatever that person said.
