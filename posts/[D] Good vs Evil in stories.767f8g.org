A common theme of a lot of stories is, in a lot of ways, the conflict between good and evil. The villain of the piece is often extremely obviously evil, a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain][Card-carrying villain]]; or just obviously misguided in some way. Recently the trend has been towards sympathetic villains, or anti-heroes and the observation that in morality there are many [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayingMorality][shades of grey.]]

The almost /universal/ trend is that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodGuysAlwaysWin][good wins out in the end.]]. Why is this? I think that fundamentally, on some level, we /wish/ that were the case. I mean, one of the main genres often displaying this trope is literally called "wish-fulfilment fantasy."

Is it true in real life that good always wins? It's pretty clear that the answer to that is no, and there's no fundamental reason why good should end up winning. Utility functions can be completely arbitrary, and "effectiveness at achieving your goals" is /rationality/, which is unrelated to which particular values you have, except in the sense that a utility function is the standard by which you judge which actions satisfy your values. I mean, we all know about paper-clip optimisers and so on.

But I'm still confused. Even in /explicitly rationalist/ works, for example HPMoR which sort of /started/ the trend, Harry wins out in the end, even though Voldemort is extremely competent /and/ more experienced. Of course, Yudkowsky did have that "final exam" chapter, where if the readers failed the test, then Harry would also. But we're not in a world where he failed; indeed the solution turned out to be really obvious, disappointing and a bit boring. Some of the answers people came up with were way more fun than what ended up happening.

Was the point of HPMoR that "the power he knows not" is somehow "a desire to do good"? Is it possible at /all/ that "trying to do good" somehow /also/ makes you better at achieving your goals? I can't figure out what I think about this. It might just be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect][halo effect]] bias showing up; we think that "good" is good, and then our bias predisposes us to generalise that feeling in an invalid way. But this is ultimately a heuristic. So I guess the question I'm thinking about is, to what extent is there a relationship between "the desire to do good" and "being effective at achieving your goals?" What would would we expect to see in the world, if there somehow /was/ a positive relationship?

It's clearly obvious that trying to do good does not /cause/ you to actually achieve good results in the world. But I suppose the flip-side to that question is, does wanting to do good actually make you /worse/ at achieving your goals? That intuitively feels wrong to me, although I don't know how to make a good argument from that. To the extent that our intuitions are accurate, we might feel like the relationship between "wanting good things" and "being effective at achieving your goals" should be at least non-negative.

But what the hell am I saying? Am I actually suggesting that the real world is like a fantasy story? I must be going insane. I think I've just been reading Worth the Candle too much. I'm starting to see the world in terms of "quest hooks" and assign meaning to coincidental events (like how Joon received that book and Fenn keeps insisting that "not everything is a clue," which I agree with.) So if I am starting to feel like every little coincidence is a clue, that must be wrong, and I need to work to change that feeling, if I can. The real world is fundamentally /random/ and you should not assign any meaning to random coincidences.

I really like the story but after writing this out I think I have to stop. It's become an unhealthy addiction.

So um...am I completely crazy? Should I seek help?


** I beg to differ on a fundamental point of your argument.

Harry does /not/ win in HPMOR. Rather, Dumbledore does, making great sacrifice and using superior information to end the threat of Voldemort and ensure that the human race continues. (The fact that Dumbledore ends up trapped in the mirror does detract slightly from his victory, but it does not prevent it from being a victory).

--------------

As to whether the good guy wins in the end. I think that there is a point to be considered here - the winner is the one who gets to write the history books. And that will make a big difference. Consider the example of South Africa.

Before 1994, the Apartheid government was in power, and history books spoke mainly of the European settlers and their descendants. The Great Trek featured heavily, and the formation of groups like the ANC was not at all dwelt on.

Post-1994, the Apartheid government was abruptly (but peacefully) replaced. Suddenly, the Great Trek vanished from the history books, and a whole raft of freedom fighters were suddenly important figures in the school syllabus - where they had simply not been mentioned before.

There was a distinct and sudden shift in the most accessible narrative. Researchers inclined to look in depth would still find much the same information - but to the ordinary school student, the definition of the historical 'good guys' had just shifted to someone else.

--------------

So, then you also bring up the question of whether or not being good helps you achieve your goals.

To a degree, I think it does, and the reason is this; that a lot of the time, being 'good' involves cooperation, while being 'evil' involves doing things that other people would rather prefer that you didn't do. There are costs to running directly contrary to your neighbour's utility function; for one thing, your neighbour might turn out to be a persistent fellow with a thirst for revenge. On the other hand, an evil neighbour might take advantage if you're feeling cooperative... but if you both cooperate, you can get a lot more done together.

*** Problem is that the farther removed you are from the people you're cooperating with, the less you'll /feel/ cooperative. And the less you understand what the other players are doing, the more they'll be able to get away with without you being any the wiser. Good probably wins more often when there are fewer players involved and the group is trying to achieve a simpler task. Make things too complicated with too many agendas and someone might be able to get away with cheating more easily. And then the good guys have to become less cooperative just to keep up and stay in the game. That being said, it's probably all a matter of incentives. Make things less complicated by agreeing to organize your system better, make the rules norms and expectations more clear to all the players, and then it becomes much easier to tell when someone defects. Then you can punish the defector. The punishment for the defection must of course be made clear to everyone as part of the rules. Its a lot easier to stop someone stealing food from their fellow tribe members in the ancestral environment then it is to stop Putin from interfering with the US presidential election in 2016.

Well, yes. There's limits to the power of cooperation over competition. One of the big ones being that it's a lot harder to stop someone who's got his own group that he's cooperating with than it is to stop a lone rogue.

And whatever else you may think of Putin, you /really/ can't call him a lone rogue. He has the whole of the Russian government to work with.

  The almost universal trend is that good wins out in the end.. Why is this?
#+end_quote

Because stories are, first and foremost, normative. The myths and campfire tales that have existed since forever are pretty much universally just hyped-up versions of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goofus_and_Gallant][Goofus and Gallant]].

#+begin_quote
  You, a small forager-child, sit with your grandfather by the fire. He is in a reflective mood. "There are things you should do, and things you shouldn't," he says.

  "How do I know which is which?" you say.

  "Well, that's easy. Every night, I tell you stories. Stories my grandfather told me. And there's a reason he passed down these stories to me, and a reason I pass them down to you."

  "See, there are two kinds of stories. There are stories about winners, and stories about losers. Someone in the future might call these 'comedies' and 'tragedies.'"

  "A /comedy/ is a story about someone who succeeds. The point of a story like that, is to teach you about what qualities winners have. You learn that winners do this, and winners do that, and then you know that if you want to win, you'll do those things too."

  "I never needed to /tell/ you any of that, though, right?" he says, a wise smile on his face.

  You nod slowly, pondering the stories you've heard. You knew what point a story was trying to make, because a good story makes you like a hero, and so you just want to be like them because you feel like they're your friend. It was never really about winning... was it?

  "But grandpa, why does the hero of the story have to suffer, then? Why don't they just win from the start?"

  "Oh, it's to build empathy, certainly, if that's what you're thinking. But it's also to demonstrate that these principles---these things winners do---don't always work over the short-term. They're only good strategies over the /long/ term. Things like generosity, they might get you in trouble if you come across a sociopath. But they also make you friends and allies that will help you beat up that sociopath. The qualities winners have, the things that make them triumph, are the same things that make them struggle."

  "Ah." you say. It all seems a bit less magical, put like this.

  "And a /tragedy/, well, that's the opposite. The qualities losers have, the things that make them lose in the end---they might work over the short term, but they won't work over the long term. So a tragedy is a story about a person with a flaw, and teaches you the pattern of how having that flaw will play out: it might help them in some ways, but it will end badly. You know all those stories 'bout revenge? You know how everyone in them ends up dead? The point is that wanting revenge doesn't work out in the end. It's a flaw."

  "Stories are just candy that make the medicine go down. The medicine is a lesson about what kind of person it helps to be, or hurts to be. The candy is an entrancing series of events... and the /best/ kind of candy makes you wonder which kind of story this story is going to be. Whether the traits the protagonist has are really good ones or bad ones in this world."

  "You ever heard a bad story?" he says. You nod. Your little brother tells some sour stories. They never go anywhere, and then they're just... over.

  "Well, a bad story is just a story that doesn't leave you wondering that. If every one of the protagonist's qualities is obviously going to be helpful or harmful, and they all add up the same way, and the world in the story seems to already have an interpretation in mind... then there's nothing to be found by listening. It's not exciting to hear about Mary the Good who everyone loves. It's not exciting to hear about Xander the Downtrodden who everyone spits on. But if you've got Xander the Good-at-heart, who gets spit on; or Mary the Egomaniac, who everyone loves /for now/... well, /there's/ a story that's going somewhere. A story that has something to chew on, about what this kind of person will do."

  "Huh..." you sigh. "I don't know if I want to hear your stories any more, grandpa. It's all a bit like... brainwashing, isn't it?"

  "Surely is! Or it tries to be. But even little kids recognize a story that's just reinforcing a moral they've heard before---and they don't want to hear it. Boredom is the best tonic against propaganda. And stories that aren't---stories newly-told, speculative fiction about how people act in situations you've never imagined before---well, just as much as being about who's a winner, they're about inviting you to consider those situations at all. Critical thinking never hurts a good story none; it just gives it children!"

  "So you know what you do, the next time I tell you a story you don't like?"

  "...tell my own?"

  "That's right. And give it a different conclusion. Tell it to me, and see how I like it. That's called /philosophy of ethics/."

*** I just read some Terry Pratchett. I've never read much of him before, just one book which I can't quite remember the name of. What I remember of the experience was that it was fun and I laughed a lot. So why have I been avoiding him?

I guess I just couldn't see the value in it, ultimately. A lot of his writing is /actually meaningless/, or at least, I have to work too hard to try and understand it. I /want/ to believe, although I don't /feel/ like I believe /right now/, that "blind faith" can be justified. I've said in the past that I /despise/ blind faith. But maybe that's because, without trying to be too specific about what I really mean, in my honest, emotional experience I /feel/ like in order to be a better person I need to have some faith. That a lot of people think faith is good /in and of itself/ should be a clue that it might /actually/ be good. Specifically, that, for at least /some/ things, the most practically effective thing to do /really is/ to /specifically not ever think about too hard about the reasons for why things are the way they are./

There are, as best I can determine making use of my current knowledge, just /Things Man Was Not Meant To Know/. /Wondering/ about these things is absolutely fine. Asking, what if? Isn't that something essentially human? But /sometimes/, the most practically effective way to be who you want to be is to become /less/ self-aware; and have a /less/ specific understanding. I, in essence, /really want/ the Obliviators to come and remove certain knowledge I /think/ I have about the "Masquerade." Why do wizards not more directly help muggles? Wizards seem to have a soul and muggles don't. The things wizards do don't seem to make any sense at all. They're stupid, but I for some reason feel like it's still overall better to be a wizard than a muggle.

I specifically /do not want to think about why this might appear to be the case right now./ "Causally entangling" your beliefs with reality allows you to very effectively take actions that change your actual experience. You don't have to make any particular effort to realise that this is the case. And isn't it /really true/ that no particular person's perspective is ultimately more valuable than any other's? Without digging into /why/, I /want/ to believe this. And so now, I /feel like/ I understand dreaming a little better.

#+begin_quote
  It's not so much that I don't have a choice. It's more like I am not aware that I have a choice at the time. Lucid dreaming, as far as I can tell (and I haven't ever really bothered with it much) would be mostly about realising, while dreaming, that I have a choice.

  As if I'd willingly suspended disbelief and then willingly forgot about it.
#+end_quote

As best I can determine, /having this ability and using it correctly will make you more effective/. To the extent that I think "effectiveness" relates to "good" in some way, I should want to believe, unjustifiably, that /some/ self-delusion is good. But I /don't want to know about it./ I /dislike/ self-delusion. Must there /necessarily/ be no way to live a happy life while honestly attempting to believe true things?

This question is simply /too hard to productively think about/. So I both want, need, and hope, that my experience of reality will help me just /forget about the question,/ trusting that when the time comes to think about it, the world will let me know somehow. There's /no good reason/ to believe this. /It's a willing self-delusion./ But I genuinely believe that some self-delusion does make you more effective over the long term. It helps put some distance between you and things you find painful, when the intensity of your emotions is just too much to deal with.

And so I find that, what I really, honestly /want/ right now, is to sort of, act a bit according to my model of Rapunzel from the movie Tangled. /She/ doesn't know that she's in a Disney movie, that no one is really bad, even the villains, and that because she happens to be in that world, /a necessary consequence is that things will turn out all right for her./ If she /knew this for sure in advance/, wouldn't that make the whole thing a little bit more pointless? She wouldn't feel like she had any choice about the ultimate result of the actions she took. She would just be "acting" afraid, and curious, and trying to fight those she perceives as enemies for no other reason than that /she feels she has to behave that way, given what she knows./ The real, honest best thing to do for her, in that situation, is to /remove any and all knowledge that could convince her to realise, even by complete chance, which world she is actually in/, (which we know, from the outside, happens to be a Disney movie). In short, she should have some /totally unjustified faith/ that things will turn out all right, even if what she really believes at any /particular/ point in time is that they won't. She /shouldn't even try/ to figure out the reason for this feeling until she is actually ready for it. I'm not ready at this time.

And so, I feel like I really just need to slow down, relax, forget about hard questions and have some /fun/. I'm /choosing/ to believe that when the time comes, I'll eventually be able to tackle these questions, /if that's something I turn out to actually want/. But I /might be wrong about what I want./

What I mean by that is, intuitively understanding how "understanding" feels can feel like certainty; that you have a lot of confidence in your understanding which gives the impression that you are quite certain about some things. The important point Daniel Abraham makes in his Dagger and Coin series about "feelings of certainty" is that "spiders" having the ability to "directly, magically create" feelings of certainty /turns out, as best he can determine in the fictional world he created/ to be /really bad./ And yet /despite/ the magical spiders, and only them, who are evil, having this unique, extremely strong ability, /good still turns out to win anyway/. Through bringing people together and genuinely trying to do what you can, in whatever ways large or small, to make the world a better place. But you /really didn't know the result in advance/, before you actually /read/ the story, did you? No matter how much you might, at some particular point, /feel/ that way.

How true is this in our own world? The answer is that /I really don't want to know, and I want to forget I ever asked./ Sometimes fiction /really is just fiction/.

But, on a meta-level, what I /really believe/ is that at any /particular/ time, your /entire understanding of the world can turn out to be wrong,/ even if it's incredibly practically effective and /feels/, from the inside, like you've made some meaningful progress. Maybe you have, but maybe you haven't. You don't, can't ever, and as far as I can tell with my currently available knowledge, /should not even try to accurately figure out/ "precisely" how "true" any /particular/ understanding might be. All you can ever productively do is to /suppose/. Supposing that acting according to this understanding reveals some interesting and useful information to me, what are the /necessary consequences/, if I /were/ to happen to be in /one of/ the /potential/ worlds that /might/ be this way?

I think there's something fundamentally human about the desire to create rational fiction. But /maybe not/. Maybe, although we're genuinely doing what we really want right now, that's /actually bad/. We shouldn't be unjustifiably sure that we /actually/ know what's "right," at any particular point in time. And so increasing your uncertainty, realising the ways in which you /really don't know/, and /really don't even want to think about it right now/, seems to really help with reducing emotional pain.

I believe there are Things Man Was Not Meant To Know. Not /permanently/, like, if it /turns out/ that we actually can deal with this knowledge in a practically effective way, we then have the choice of whether to look into these questions more closely. But /until/ our best judgement determines us to be at that point, we should pay attention to what's sort of vaguely fun and interesting, /specifically without/ thinking too hard about why that might be. And if you, by chance, happen to end up thinking too hard anyway, then you need to do things that help you forget. It's not like Obliviators are actually /real/, after all. They can't /actually/ come and erase your memories, here in the "real world." Harry Potter and all its fanfiction is just a story, which can only affect you in ways you /let/ it.

Somehow I feel...strangely positive. That seems good. I'm really tired, I just haven't slept well in the past few years, even, and what I really want /right now/ is to just go to sleep. After all, some people have made the argument that the "resources" of the "universal computer" are limited; that each person's experience consumes some sort of limited resource. Because this possibility exists, I can feel justified in wanting to go to sleep, if that's what I emotionally need. But I really just want to forget I ever read about that and /do tiring things/.

How does this story make you feel?

**** I'm not sure what Terry Pratchett has to do with valuing blind faith. His books espouse much the opposite really. There is the whole book focusing on religion where the [[#s][tag]] There is also this quote from Unseen Academicals

#+begin_quote
  The Patrician took a sip of his beer. “I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that's when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.”
#+end_quote

Blind faith is bad because it is the kind of thing that leads you to jump off bridges, crash planes into towers or act as if the power of your positive thinking will actually do anything for children in Africa.

When you talk about Things Man Was Not Meant To Know I think you underestimate our ability to cope. Nihilism is curable without a blind adherence to an ideology. In my case it happened in highschool when I found that even though I was stressed and freaked out because life had no meaning and nothing had any purpose I still didn't want to fail my assignments. I went meta and discovered that I could and still did care about things. I found that I didn't need to worry about falling into hedonism because I still had the same distaste I had for it before. Of course there was still that little part of me that was obsessed with it and wanted to die but the rest of my self wasn't going to be dragged down with it and got rid of it after a while just by blocking it out. (Admittedly I think I am better at suppressing than the average person. When I did the Pink Elephant exercise I keep trying until I could do it. The trick was just to think about what I normally think about when pink elephants stuff isn't involved)

If you think self-delusion will help you make better decisions you are wrong. The problem isn't with your beliefs it is with your decision processes which are somehow giving you the wrong result when you feed it the right information. By the sounds of it you already know what the right result should be so should just skip the process. (As an aside it is very difficult to consciously lie to your self and if you get better at it then your brain will either adapt to make it harder or make it easier such that you lie to yourself about other things.) Also remember "If we nothing we do matters. All that matters is what we choose to do". In regards to morality I generally favour a blend of Utilitarianism and Stoicism. Stoicism is something I think you should look up because it favours a very intuitive secular view of morality.

I don't understand what you are talking about in regards to a masquerade but you shouldn't be constantly thinking your worldview is likely to be overturned. Beliefs are probabilistic. Generally each time you have an innovation or revolution in an area that means you are less likely to have another one. There is only so far you can go to get to the Truth.

You might want to have a look at the lifestyle advice [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/13/things-that-sometimes-work-if-you-have-anxiety/][here]]

Edit: Another big one is to only feel bad or happy because of stuff your actions (or lack thereof though that can lead to bad spirals) cause. Anything else will cause you issues when you try an adopt a larger perspective.

*** I suspect stories are at least partially a way of signalling. If you expect doing good to help you win, then you'd expect that in your stories good people would win. And if you expect doing good to help you win, you'd do good, so you can win. It's good for other people if they associate with good people, so they associate with people who tell stories about good people winning, since they're more likely to be good people. And since they're associating with you, that's good for you.

Though I suppose being normative is important too. Kids learn what to do based on what they see, so if you tell them stories (which the primitive human mind has trouble distinguishing from things that happened) about people behaving a certain way, they'll think that's normal and behave that way.

I agree that this effect works out the way you're talking about /today/. I've personally made friends who started out as fans of my writing, and they're some of my closest friends now because they were self-selected based on liking what I wrote. I put a lot of myself into my writing, so liking my work basically translated to getting along with me. (And for a community "story": Eliezer's wife Brienne started out as an HPMOR fan. Self-selection!)

But I feel like this wouldn't be a powerful-enough effect to be causal for the evolution of the whole behavior in the first place, because

1. most people /don't/ tell stories. It's not a human universal, like language; only [wild-assed guess] 25% of human beings have ever written even a scrap of fiction outside of forced situations like school assignments.

2. the people who /do/ tell stories, in the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA, for short), were people who already had people there to tell them /to/. Today, when we write stories down, we tell a story to nobody in particular and /then/ we give it out to people, with zero marginal cost for each person the story is shared with. Before writing, you had to have a captive audience who would sit down and listen, someone who either had the potential to---if they were impressed---go out and get more people to come to your /next/ telling of the story; or someone who was willing to memorize the whole thing as you told it, and then help you spread it by telling it themselves as well.

3. again in the EEA, tribes were small (I've heard estimates of ~25-125 members) and mostly constant in membership, other than people marrying in or being exiled out. You already knew everyone in your tribe, and already had established relationships with most of them. There's no need for the sort of self-selection filtering+bonding tool that stories provide in such an environment; anyone you could get to sit down and listen to a story of yours is going to be someone for which you're "preaching to the choir" by telling such stories.

Mostly, I think, in the EEA, stories were told by people who everyone felt /obligated/ to listen to---that is, elders and authority figures. The person who can get everyone to shut up around a fire---and won't be shouted down when they start to tell a story---gets to tell it. (Oddly, I think the pretty-bad movie /The Croods/ got this exactly right. Story-telling is mostly /dads/, annoyed at something one of their children has done, intimidating their families into silence and then couching their paternalistic warnings in narrative.)

But there were definitely more "epic" stories, more rarely told; I think these were less people brute-forcing their way into "holding the mic", and more people who everyone respected enough to be quiet when they talk, e.g. old people who have fought in previous tribal conflicts and remember them. Such stories were probably desired mostly for their /true/ aspects---the parts that "really happened"---but the story-tellers probably wanted to either exaggerate details of them to fix them better in people's minds, or wanted to jam normative details in there (being paternalistic dads themselves once-upon-a-time, or being matronly grandmothers now.)

But in the case of elders telling stories, I would bet that a lot of the time it wasn't so much an elder volunteering a story, as a child /requesting/ to know about something, and the elder trying to find a way to spin a tale that would entertain them. Simplifying things (including the morality of a conflict) to a child's level of understanding, adding action elements that would excite children, and trying to come up---often on the spot---with some normative advice to spin in there, since the child is listening so attentively and it's a good chance to "raise them right" a bit (maybe in a way different to how their own parents are doing.) From there, it's memetic evolution: the stories that, by happenstance, happened to be the most viral, got retold, and mutated to be more viral still. That vitality is mostly to do with what entertains children to hear, but also a bit about what pleases story-tellers (again, probably either intimidating dads or respected elders) to re-tell.

The two forces---deliberate fiction told to communicate a norm, and memory bent toward normativity as a spur-of-the-moment decision---then come together when someone decides it'd be a great idea to combine elements of stories. And thus you get *myth*: tribal elders doing actual, recorded, mundane things, but also throwing lightning and shouting mountains apart, all part of the same story, which always turns out to communicate a carefully-crafted norm even though the historical event did nothing of the sort.

** Rational fiction is still /fiction/ - you should assume that the authors are going to fall genre convention over realism.

Please don't assume that reading fiction necessarily makes you more intelligent or aware of real life's genre conventions.

** Fiction /in general/ follows a sort-of universal model, which Joseph Campbell identified as the monomyth, and Dan Harmon calls the "story circle", but it's also part of the larger (non-fictive*) "comfort zone" model of human states. Most stories are about a person leaving the zone of comfort, which elevates stress and anxiety (and in turn, concentration and focus), and then returning to that zone of comfort, having changed. That's the basic story structure.

* I don't actually know how solid the social science behind this is, but I have a toddler and this is one of the primary models of toddler/child behavior patterns, which I immediately recognized as sharing a lot of similarities with story structure.

*Rational fiction* is still usually attempting to be *good fiction*, and so will lean toward many of the same conventions. This means that the good guys win, detail is conserved, guns introduced in the first act get fired in the third, etc. The /difference/ is that a good writer of rational fiction is aware of how the audience marks all these principles and works to subvert or re-contextualize them, /and/, in making a work rational, will justify why these things are the case, if they happen in-universe. In other words, the good guys win because that usually makes for a more satisfying story, and in rational fiction the good guys don't just win because they're the good guys, they win on their merits, within the logic the story presents.

I think "good guys always win" is only a false trope when taken in the aggregate; it's not unbelievable that the good guys win one story, but it's unbelievable that all the stories we have, with few exceptions, are ones in which the good guys win; it indicates a huge sampling bias. You don't need to worry about that sampling bias when writing one individual story, in my opinion, if the aim is realism.

  Was the point of HPMoR that "the power he knows not" is somehow "a desire to do good"?
#+end_quote

I'd like to point out that HP:MoR doesn't really aim to be realistic in the first place. The whole "Good vs Evil" thing is an unrealistic dynamic to begin with; in real life, conflicts are between people with incompatible or competitive goals, not between a 10-yo and a bored sociopathic demigod. The conflicts we see in HP:MoR is engineered by higher forces (Dumbledore, Fate, Voldemort).

Real life conflicts don't have to be zero-sum. They can be (for instance, there's not much common ground between Occidental interests and Daesh's interests), but most conflicts are borne out of coordination problems, not fundamental differences. Regulatory capture, realpolitik, immigration crises, poverty, corruption, etc. We solve them through social engineering, better law-making and technological advances, not finding evil people and punching them in the face.

If we're talking about large scale "my army of knights vs your army of orcs" conflicts, then again most fiction isn't realistic. Stories are about individuals, superheroes, super-spies, charismatic rebels, secret agents, etc; but in real life 99% of conflict is massively controlled by governments, because governments are /based/ on having a monopoly on military strength. A "government" can take the form of feudal lords, bureaucratic institutions, a ruling caste, etc, the general principle is "the ones in charge are the ones with the most guns". Good and evil and ideologies don't really factor.

#+begin_quote
  So I guess the question I'm thinking about is, to what extent is there a relationship between "the desire to do good" and "being effective at achieving your goals?" What would would we expect to see in the world, if there somehow was a positive relationship?
#+end_quote

A good first step towards being effective in the struggle between good and evil is "Don't break the law because then you end up in jail".

We like to glorify being an underdog, being the lone hero who has to defeat the cunning villain, but in real life? People like Voldemort are the underdog who must hide from the law. Real conflict isn't between the likes of Batman and Joker, it's between Random Cop #48 and Random Thug #21, and Random Cop usually wins.

#+begin_quote
  To the extent that our intuitions are accurate, we might feel like the relationship between "wanting good things" and "being effective at achieving your goals" should be at least non-negative.
#+end_quote

That sounds like magical thinking to me. I mean, in most social situations, not being an asshole means people respect you meaning it's easier to get your way, but it doesn't /have/ to apply, and it certainly doesn't always apply in high-stakes situations like business or politics.

On the other hand, enlightened self-interest and the invisible hand of the market are a thing. Institutions with less corruption are more profitable, trade deals make war less likely, allowing women to drive is good for the economy even when you're Saudi Arabia, etc.

That doesn't mean "being on the side of Good gives you a boost on your stats", because on an individual level there are effective selfish people and ineffective altruistic people, but on aggregate, over long periods of times, institutions made of selfish people are out-competed.

tl;dr: Most conflict isn't about good or evil, it's about governments, coordination problems and people not being consequentialist enough. Good eventually triumphs over evil because it makes more money.

** *WARNING:* This post may make you depressed. Not as much as I am though.

Good always prevails, Truth in real life because of the anthropic principle.

If evil ever truly wins, then humanity is extinct.

Otherwise, evil victories are only ever temporary. As long as humanity continues to exist, eventually, by sheer random chance, evil will lose and good will win again. At which point everyone can go "oh look Good wins in the end!"

Which is of course, cognitive dissonance at work. We live in a world full of evil and suffering, and no one has found a way to do anything about it. So we have all convinced ourselves into believing that good wins in the end, or that good ever wins at all. I mean, sure, that's technically true, every force of evil will eventually be defeated by sheer random chance. But what has Good actually won here? All that's happened is we have learned to say that the truncheons hitting us on the head are awesome.

It's the same in fiction too. Saying "Oh look Voldemort is dead, GOOD WON!" is self-delusion at its finest. All of the evils wrought by Voldemort have not been righted. Harry's biological parents? Still dead. An entire society of wizards is still scarred and traumatized by the magical war. The truth is, the moment someone is murdered, Evil has already won, for all eternity. Unless you have some kind of resurrection power, that person is dead forever. And even if you somehow resurrect the victims, the damage has already been done. Their lives have been permanently and drastically altered against their will.

If you came from somewhere where good truly wins, where no one is ever murdered/raped/assaulted/etc, you would not call anything that happens in reality or fiction a victory for good.

*** "History is written by the victors."

If you could /retroactively/ make Harry's parents /not have ever been real/, would you do it? Of course you would never want Harry to /know/ you'd done that, because he would want to feel like his parents are real, valuable people. But they died. They didn't win. They /don't get/ to write history. This is a terrible thing. But is there really /nothing/ we can do about it? Or is it just that it's so hard to even think about what we might try, that the whole thing feels pointless?

Do you really believe that there are at least /some/ good people in the world, genuinely trying to act according to what they believe to be right? If confronting what you really believe to be true makes you feel terrible, then you need to seek some comfort from people who you perceive to be good. But don't /take/ it from them; neither you nor they want that. Just observe how you feel, when someone really tries to help you, even if they don't actually /succeed/ in doing so. At least they tried, right? That's something valuable in itself. Or at least I think so.

**** Oh, don't get me wrong here. I am saying Good has never really won, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to be Good or that trying to be Good is pointless.

The way I see it, being Good is all about reducing your losses. You can't revive those that have already been murdered, but by defeating murderers and other evil-doers, you can help to reduce the number of future victims. That's pretty important, even if it isn't a victory.

** I think the phenomenon happens a little differently. It's not that the author (necessarily) picks a "good" side and a "bad" side, then makes the good side win. It's that the author picks a side they intend to have win (in regular fiction, through the use of plot conceits. In rational fiction, by messing with the initial conditions), and once that side is picked, the author makes that side sympathetic.

Now, theoretically speaking, any side could have been picked to win (for example, tolkien could have picked mordor, and then made mordor the sympathetic side), but that's when we get into narrative casuality: authors are more interested in writing about characters that fit into particular patterns, which means that most stories that get made feature characters that the authors enjoy making win, which in turn means that characters following the morals of the author win.

Which leads to a rather interesting point: that in many stories, there will be no "good" side (as defined by your morality). But you don't choose to read stories written by, say, neo-nazis, or ISIS, so you're not exposed to the "bad" guys winning.

** It depends on your definitions, of course. Trivial example: if you define "Good" as "has the strongest army" then generally the Good country will win.

A more common definition of Good would be something like "that which promotes human weal and averts human woe, both to the greatest degree feasible". By this definition, Good will still tend to triumph, because:

1) Humans are social creatures who are capable of working together well

2) Working together makes it easier to accomplish more and bigger things

3) In general, humans dislike social defectors (the greedy, the liars, the murderers) and will punish them -- send them to jail, kick them out of office, etc. There's a certain amount of net 'Evil' (i.e., their 'Evil' actions less their 'Good' actions) that an individual can get away with, but if they go beyond that point they will suffer consequences that reduce or eliminate their ability to do 'Evil.'

4) Civilizations that are run by 'Evil' individuals tend to collapse, as too many of the resources are consumed by the leader(s) instead of being devoted to food, irrigation, etc. Also, 'Evil' leaders make other nations nervous, which often hastens their demise.

Given the above, most nations that survive for long periods will be 'Good' and most people within those nations will be 'Good'. Obviously, there are major exceptions, such as nations run by xenophobic lying bigots guilty of sexual harassment, fraud, and collusion with the enemies of their country. Still, those people typically end up ousted eventually.

So, yes. 'Good' does tend to win. You can tell by the fact that the world has been getting better for a long time. I'm obviously generalizing a great deal and there have definitely been major bumps in the upward road, but the road /is/ upward-trending overall.

** I would say that a lot of it has to do with the fact that a satisfying ending is a stable point, and forces of good represent stability, whereas forces of bad represent chaos. Some rationalist media have a victory for both the good and the bad at certain points, but usually end on a “good” ending because the universe is at a stable point

That is historical. History is written by winners who designate themselves as good. Sometimes even by neutral party support it because it is fate/gods will. After some generations revisionist historicians step in and good/evil become greyish.
