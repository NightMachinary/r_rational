  Strange, it hadn't occurred to me before now that the muster of heroes on the other side was essentially a tenth and two officers. I had been tired, and there'd been a few days a while back where I'd had vicious headaches. Must have been the lack of sleep having unforeseen consequences. We were all feeling the pressure: even Vivienne and Masego had been out of sorts.
#+end_quote

This stood out to me. The commentators seem to think that this and the differing number of heroes (14 a few chapters ago, only 12 now) means that Absence was discovered, fought, and erased two of the heroes, as well as the memory of the battle from everyone's mind. Not sure if that's the case, but I don't know what else this headache could mean. Also not sure why them making up a tenth and two officers is important.

It might be that Saint and Pilgrim aren't with them, but I think it's better if it's Absence.

***** The end game is to go beyond good and evil. That's only become clear to me in the last few chapters. Cat wants the world to be run by human decisions and laws made for the good of the many. But the structure of the world requires "good" vs "evil" which do not map onto utilitarian good. Heroes and Villains will always exist, so Cat wants to confine them to do battle in a fighting pit. They can have their stories and kill each other where they don't ruin the lives of ordinary people.

**** One of the themes has been Good and Evil versus good and evil.

Cat has been playing that out on a practical level, and it's only natural that starts affecting the broader narrative and the Names. Cat has huge narrative importance and that's reality-bending in this world.

I think on a narrative level Cat has to more explicitly move beyond Good and Evil. I'm excited to find out whether she does that by becoming fully Fae, or by some other means. I'm hoping it's the latter!

Not the leaders of the Crusade, the lowborn officer's in the Crusader army. It serves multiple goals.

First it is a show of force, a way to communicate to the enemy that she could kill any of them at any time.

Second it reduces the enemies capabilities by reducing the amount of officers they have to lead their troops.

Third, and most importantly, it accomplishes the first two without pissing off anyone politically connected. If she kills highborn officers, their families will oppose any peace - so she must target the lowborn officers.

*** They backfire if you /rely/ on them, which makes stuff like flying fortresses and magical swords a more unreliable variety of the artifacts, since they are used continuously until they break. The artifacts that have discrete uses (like the Greater Breach generator in Liesse) are essentially guaranteed to work at least once when properly foreshadowed. This is why stuff like the signal whistle and the Stairway is remarkably story-proof: they both were designed to work only once.

It is becoming abundantly clear that Cat cannot continue the string of successes she's had if she's constantly having her mental processes fucked with by Winter. It doesn't matter that she knows it or can plan against it, it's too powerful a checkov's gun to not fire into her foot at this point.

The only Gods worth believing in are the Gods Below because they champion agency. You can do whatever you want. It's just that most people who swear themselves to them tend to have homicidal and/or sociopathic tendencies.

In other news, this Crusade doesn't seem like a Crusade to me. The folks in it don't seem "brainwashed to fight any evil anywhere at all costs" (Book 2). If this was the case then Cordelia wouldn't need to have struggled to get the Dominion or her allies committed to the cause. The Angels can just descend from the Heavens in each Principate, brainwash everyone and declare somebody in Procer as the champion of the Crusade. Said Champion can then lead all the armies East.
