I noticed that there haven't been too many works added to the site, Rational Reads, recently and I'm asking if anyone has come across any story or work of literature (in electrons or dead tree form) which is either rationalist, rational, or has qualities of rationality that they think should be added.

Also if you haven't heard of this [[http://rationalreads.com/#/][site]] before, it's a website which records all of the rational or near-rational fiction and provides links to read or buy the mentioned stories.

Although, please don't post anything which is already on the site.

Thanks!

** There should be a best of 2015 list on the site. Good entrypoint for people new to rat/rat fics.

Would compliment the all-time rankings.
