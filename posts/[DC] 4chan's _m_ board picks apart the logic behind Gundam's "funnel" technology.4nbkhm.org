** tl;dr (edited for English):

#+begin_quote
  Just by existing, [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Universal_Century_Weapons#Funnel_and_Bit][the funnel]] disproves the entire military legitimacy of [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Weapon#Mobile_Suit][mobile suits]].

  If you can pack the maneuverability and firepower to kill a mobile suit or a [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Battleship][battleship]] onto something as small as a funnel, then there is no excuse for anything like a mobile suit to exist in the first place. Just build bigger funnels with more room for ammo and fuel, and send them on hunter-killer missions. If you still need [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Newtype][Newtype]] control, you put that Newtype on a battleship protected by lots of armor and cannons, not on a robot he's piloting himself.

  If you don't have the technology for funnels to be practical, they are worthless. If funnels are even remotely viable, then a [[http://homeworld.wikia.com/wiki/Hive_Frigate][Hive Frigate]] setup makes mobile suits laughably obsolete because they can deliver all of the offensive ability of mobile suits from a safe distance at a fraction of the cost.

** Oh my god YES. It's not often that I see people pointing out the flaws inherent in mechs. Mainly because I don't go looking for them and people (and me) usually accept mechs as part of the the suspension of disbelief. (I love Macross but hate the mech parts.)

But I have this one friend that will defend the shape and functionality of battle mechs to the death. He'll proclaim that limbs with detachable weaponry provide superior firepower and coverage despite exposing more surface area, having more moving part complexity than a turret. He'll say a human-shaped hand acts as a great way to hot swap modular weapons instead of having universal hardpoint that, I don't know, actually connects the weapon so the vehicle can provide ammo or additional power.

"You can't know that if technological progression will makes mechs viable" he says. MOTHERFUCKER, by definition a mech has unneeded moving parts and extraneous surface area to volume that would reduce the theoretical effectiveness a war vehicle could obtain.

To be fair though, my dislike really only applies to Gundam/Macross style mechs where it tries to mimic the human form unnecessarily combined with long-term hover/flight capabilities. Exoskeletons get a pass because they're working at a human scale. Certain leg-using vehicles get a pass if they're using the leg part for terrain purposes and don't have infinite-hover/fly. Like mechwarrior is fine. They need the legs to traverse terrain, they don't have stupid fingers but actual hardpoints, and usually the cockpit is in the torso without extra random head parts.

** The "reasonable" explanation for arms on a spaceship is that it lets you vector all of your thrusters freely, which lets you point your main thrusters in any direction (which means you can carry as many thrusters as you need for your maximum desired acceleration in any direction, rather than separate fixed thrusters for every direction) and use your main thrusters for major attitude control if appropriate (lol). You mount them on lever arms instead of circular tracks basically because levers are mechanically easier to deal with. Mounting them on long levers additionally moves them further out, simultaneously giving you better attitude control giving you more freedom to move your thrusters around without burning your other arms off.

With unlimited materials science and power engineering, the maximum-maneuverability spaceship would be... roughly the shape of your main gun, missile tubes, engineering spaces, whatever else you want to stuff in, with three-plus main thrusters mounted on tentacles with lengths roughly around to the diameter of the sphere, increasing with the number of thruster-tentacle pairs and decreasing with the sphericity of the ship.

These conditions... start to go away as you reach more and more real-world-Tsiolkovsky-limited engagement ranges. If reality encourages year-long missile duels at light-hours of range, then this entire thing goes entirely out the window. If reality encourages laser duels at a tenth of a light-second, then maneuverability becomes paramount.

*** The Gundam universes have a lot of interesting technologies. Depending on the suit and the era, many mobile suits and large ships are not limited by Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation.

In the Universal Century timeline, and in shows that reboot it, there are Minovsky particles, which are the ultimate chaff. They scatter any frequency of electromagnetic radiation higher than the near ultraviolet, making radar and radio useless, and allowing interesting things with nuclear reactor designs. They're what make Newtypes' collaboration with Bits and Funnels so amazing: it's long-range communication without radio or lasers.

Some shows have autonomous AI-driven mobile dolls - these are almost universally deployed by the bad guys. And because of Minovsky-particle-constrained combat, there's not usually a way to issue a recall order. These are Unfriendly AI.

If you want a realistic hard-sf Gundam show, watch 08th Mobile Suit Team.

If you want ludicrous power, watch G Gundam.

Anything else is in between.

#+end_quote

Is that a typo, and you meant that they scatter lower than infrared? Higher than ultraviolet would be x-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Lower than ultraviolet would be visible light.

How much of the show happens in space? If it's any reasonable portion of it, then I feel like I could win the setting by putting a bunch of effort into camera optics and computer vision for detection, visible-light comm lasers, and lidar scanners.

At some point I probably should watch some Gundam. I marathoned Gundam Wing one weekend, but it was the weekend after I'd gotten my wisdom teeth out and I don't remember any of it.

[[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Wiki:Technology#The_Minovsky_Particle][The wiki]]:

#+begin_quote
  When the Minovsky particle is spread in large numbers in the open air or in open space, the particles disrupt *low-frequency* electromagnetic radiation, such as *microwaves and radio waves*. The Minovsky particle also interferes with the operations of electronic circuitry and destroys unprotected circuits due to the particles' high electrical charge which act like a continuous electromagnetic pulse on metal objects. Because of the way Minovsky particles react with other types of radiation, radar systems and long-range wireless communication systems become useless, infra-red signals are defracted and their accuracy decreases, and visible light is fogged.

Most of the conflicts have separatist space colonies on one side and Earth (plus loyal space colonies) on the other side, so battles usually occur in space, but some may be fought on Earth as well, depending on how well the Spacenoids are doing.

***** Thank you, yes, that's a typo. It scatters things [[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/electromagnetic_spectrum.png][lower than infrared]]. It scatters radio and microwave communications, and makes radar useless. In several shows they used laser comms and optical scanners, but as far as I know they never explicitly mentioned LIDAR.

There are lots of different Gundam shows. I like G Gundam, 08th MS Team, and Turn A Gundam the most. Wing was eh. G no Reconguista was okay. Unicorn is turning out okay.
