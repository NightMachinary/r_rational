** Often it works by emphasising what it is that the characters do care about. To take a TV example, the central characters of HBO's Rome are all slave owners and rapists. But what is emphasised is their own values around honor and duty. E.g. There's a major conflict where someone kills a slave, because he didn't ask the owners permission, and its made very clear how big a deal this kind of violating of the property of another citizen is. A character in that setting might agree in some abstract way that the death of a slave is morally bad, but it doesn't compare to more important things.

Yeah I think this is one of the easiest ways for a reader to grok the value dissonances. Humans are social creatures, and they pick up on what matters in a social context. Show an example of a moral decision, then show people's reaction to that moral decision. Basically show a culture war item in context of the current culture. If such an item would not be fought over, then you'll have to do a ton of exposition to cover the ground that social context would provide.

I think rape is a bad example for the story to get into, because it seems mostly like a dead item to the relevant participants.

I think EY might have been able to make a more interesting example from abortion and reproductive rights. Especially since it would have been far more relevant to the alien baby-eating happening in the story.

Some scenarios off the top of my head:

1. Someone gets a hold of the DNA of the [British Royal Family/Famous celebrity/or just plain old ex lover]. They proceed to create stem cells from the DNA, and then egg/sperm cells from the stem cells. Then they mix their own egg/sperm cells to create viable embryos. Original DNA holder doesn't want lots of their offsping coming from rando person. Debate happens while the offspring is [embryo/fetus/baby/child].
2. Someone uplifts lions to an intelligent species. Lions have painful sex. Should they correct for the painful sex? They want to make further genetic edits to correct for the painful sex, but the already uplifted lions don't want them to.
3. Someone starts vat growing a bunch of clones of them-self in a haphazard way. Causing some clones to die painful deaths. Technically they are just inflicting harm on alternate versions of themselves. All surviving clones don't care about the practice.

Take that scenario and have the different characters have a sort of culture war fight over the appropriate response. If you are dead set on having a fictional world with legalized rape, then have one of the characters casually drop it as an argument. Like in the first scenario "Yeah the royal prince even tried to have the DNA thief tried under the ancient rape laws. Which caused them to get rid of the laws altogether since they were so antiquated." The rape laws are clearly gone because actual rape is just no longer a crime. Which I think conveys the whole point EY was trying to make.

**** But all of these you can see both sides for.

Isn't the point that past people would never recognise a justification for gay marriage as reasonable?

The same way we'd never see any justification for rape as reasonable. Isn't the whole point that they rebelled because it is was unjustifiable? Maybe the reason is to be exciting on a date and for us that's not remotely acceptable

***** If you want to demonstrate something is really far beyond the range of acceptability, then just show where current acceptability is, and make it clear that its a spectrum.

<-----A------B-----C--|--D---->

A = thing you want to demonstrate is super unacceptable.

C and D = "reasonable" position on either side of the issue (reasonable according to the society you are exploring)

B = position that D claims holders of position C espouse, in order to smear position C.

You could probably just change out the words on some of the culture war posts from TheMotte in order to get this exact scenario. If you write it well enough using social ques, most readers will wholeheartedly accept these positions as dogma within the story, and they have no trouble understanding that A is just not what reasonable people believe.

If you watch game of thrones (I dont watch it, so maybe i got this wrong), there is a scene I heard about at the end of the series where someone basically proposes democracy as a form of government and he gets laughed at. As far as I can tell, most viewers understood why he was laughed at. There were different shades of monarchists representing C and D, and this guy proposes viewpoint A/B.

** Honestly while I understand why it puts people off, I rather think the /point/ of the passage in 3WC was to be unappealing. We are after all in that generation that, in the book, "thought the future had gone wrong". That's us. We think it's insane, and that's the goddamn point. The choices of the future generations are as mystifying to us as they are to those of our fictional counterparts.

Making it appealing or understandable would just turn it into another sci-fi Hope For The Future, which as the OP notes is not the intent. Justifying it would demystify it, and would make the decisions of the future generations Reasonable And Understandable, instead of Horrifying And Unfathomable.

The past is a foreign country, and we are the barbarians who can't grok the future world.

​

While in Threes Worlds Collide (which is overall a fine story), when I read this passage my emotional reaction was "woosh EY you really bungled the attempt on this here". Took me right out of the story due to its poor execution. I got "the point", but I didnt feel it at all the way good narrative does.

***** Art is made with the intention that it will be consumed. If this is not universally the case then it is at least the case for art which has been posted on a public website with a comments section.

Some works of art, though they may not be "incomprehensible to the human mind" levels of /alien/, are still strange enough that they give me a sense of alienness without being apparently orderless and baseless. If the art is meant to give me a sense of the alien, then these cases are superior to works which may be objectively more alien but are also so incomprehensible that they cannot be grasped at all.

(And this is assuming that "alien" really does, in this context, mean "fundamentally incomprehensible" rather than "/presently/ incomprehensible". Given that these are biological humans whose /culture/ is the primary source of difference from us, it can't be anything but a failure that EY was able to make the doctrine of the superhappies, and even the doctrine of the baby-eaters, more understandable to me than the mindset behind "Rape is legal now").

In response, I was saying, “No, actually, some of those pieces are quite aesthetically pleasing and I enjoy them very much, so while we may not be able to read minds and truly know for certain the intent behind their creation, we can at least say that they /can/ be consumed.”

Or in other words, my comment with the links was supposed to be an "if there are people who look at that stuff and see deep/meaningful/valuable art then I don't see how any of EY's fiction could be considered disqualified.

** My reaction to the specific example had a couple levels to it.

1: Wait, what? Those people are evil.

2: Ugh. EY fell into the trope of using "rape" as a genetic evil. Lazy.

3: EY should have used something less cheap & shocking. Like them being ultra-pro-gay rights.

4: Wait. Ultra gay rights isn't actually repugnant to me. It's just "my tribe, but more!" That's shocking to my out group

5: thinking about it, I can't come up with any good things that (1) fictional people could be for (2) would be more repugnant to me than my outgroup and (3) don't come off as cheap.

And that's kind of where I left off. And it annoys me, because now that I'm looking for it, I can't help notice how edgy characters have the same few "Morally Acceptable Vices"

Like, Gregory House is a misanthrope. And that OK because he hates everyone. But if the writers made him racist towards some specific group, he'd be stop being an antihero and just comd off as bad.

And now that I've noticed this, it has really undermined certain classes of fiction. Now if feels like authors are trying to create the impression of iconoclasm, while walking very very carefully past the things that my tribe actually holds sacred

******* I guess that's probably giving /way/ too much credit to "most people."

I still hold that the fact that it's been socially acceptable in a great many cultures over the millennia is in the back of [[https://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/2902][at least enough people's minds]] to have made it likely that people who voiced objections to its inclusion in TWC would have been met with replies explaining its cultural historicity, which might've kept the backlash from spreading the way it did.

Also, that's kind of what members of one of the two major political parties in [/a certain country that I can't name because of the rules of this sub/] already believes, that it's been a slippery slope from interracial rights to homosexual rights to transgender rights and it's going to eventually slide down into pedophilic rights. That's what "Pizzagate" was about, kind of. Many people can /clearly/ imagine the path of history taking that trajectory. There's no trajectory we can imagine to get from "here" to "legalized rape," so there really wasn't anything else that could have made the point you were trying to make about blue and orange morality, unless I've seriously misunderstood your intentions in including that in the story.

** Ozy criticizes the values dissonance in Three Worlds Collide because she feels it doesn't adequately explore how the different values work. She then undermines this by asking a bunch of questions that are, in fact, answered by the text.

Here is one of her questions:

#+begin_quote
  Am I at risk of rape when I'm walking down the street?
#+end_quote

She follows this up with two possible answers, and follow-up questions based on each.

#+begin_quote
  Yes.

  What if I have an important appointment, or I'm giving birth?

  Is ‘I was busy getting raped' an acceptable reason to delay something or are you supposed to build in time for that?
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  No, because everyone carries pepper spray at all times.

  Is it legal, or will you be arrested for assault?

  How does that affect relationships with strangers? Do you have to be continually on your guard that someone might attack you?
#+end_quote

Now consider this passage from the text of Three Worlds Collide, in which the Confessor reveals himself to be an "honourable ancestor":

#+begin_quote
  "And there are /no/ words that I can speak to make you understand.  It is beyond your imagining.  But you should not imagine that a violent thief whose closest approach to industry was selling uncertified hard drugs - you should not imagine, my lord, my honorable descendant, that I was ever asked to /take sides/."

  Akon's eyes slid away from the hot gaze of the unmixed man; there was something /wrong/ about the thread of anger still there in the memory after five hundred years.

  "But time passed," the Confessor said, "time moved forward, and things changed."  The eyes were no longer focused on Akon, looking now at something far away.  "There was an old saying, to the effect that while someone with a /single/ bee sting will pay much for a remedy, to someone with /five/ bee stings, removing just one sting seems less attractive.  That was humanity in the ancient days.  There was so much wrong with the world that the small resources of altruism were splintered among ten thousand urgent charities, and none of it ever seemed to go anywhere.  And yet... and yet..."

  "There was a threshold crossed somewhere," said the Confessor, "without a single apocalypse to mark it.  Fewer wars.  Less starvation.  Better technology.  The economy kept growing.  People had more resource to spare for charity, and the altruists had fewer and fewer causes to choose from.  *They came even to me, in my time, and rescued me.*  Earth cleaned itself up, and whenever something threatened to go drastically wrong again, the whole attention of the planet turned in that direction and took care of it.  Humanity finally got its act together."
#+end_quote

​

Emphasis mine. It is here established that the Confessor, an ex-thief, thug, and drug dealer, was "rescued" by some unknown technology. That is to say, Earth, in its advanced sociological and educational sciences (see their assertion that it takes a hundred years to become a real expert) has devised a way to convert violent crooks into honourable, trustworthy Confessors.

Furthermore, because humanity has got rid of its bee stings, we can infer that they've done this with everyone, and there are no more crooks, thugs, or career criminals on the entire planet Earth. Everyone has received all the treatments and lessons and therapies they need to be their best self. In a way, they're much more akin to the Superhappies than they are to us.

There are many other quotes I could pull. Akon says they can only learn about war from books because holos are "too horrible to watch":

#+begin_quote
  "No," Akon said.  "Not /that/ much stronger."  He looked around, in the silence.  "The Babyeater society has been at peace for centuries.  So too with human society.  Do you want to fire the opening shot that brings war back into the universe?  Send us back to the darkness-before-dawn that we only know from reading history books, because the holos are too horrible to watch?  Are you really going to press the button, knowing that?"
#+end_quote

​

This sensitivity is so extreme that even a dry, matter-of-fact description of a horrible thing is enough to induce three people to vomit on the spot:

​

#+begin_quote
  "The children don't die right away," said the Engineer.  "The brain is this nugget of hard crystal, that's really resistant to, um, the digestive mechanisms, much more so than the rest of the body.  So the child's brain is in, um, probably quite a lot of pain, since the whole body has been amputated, and in a state of sensory deprivation, and then the processing slowly gets degraded, and I think the whole process gets completed about a month after -"

  The Lady Sensory threw up.  A few seconds later, so did the Xenopsychologist and the Master.
#+end_quote

​

From this we can infer that everyone on Earth is too sensitive to intentionally hurt another human being. The quote Ozy herself includes in her essay shows Akon failing to imagine how nonconsensual sex could be a bad thing - in the exact same way as he assumes that everyone on Earth was consulted about whether to go the Superhappy route. He can't imagine the evils of the past because they're totally beyond his frame of reference, and they're beyond his frame of reference because technology has abolished evil.

In other words, Ozy has completely misunderstood the values dissonance in Three Worlds Collide. They aren't okay with rape - they're the opposite. They can't even imagine it. They didn't legalize rape, they abolished it so thoroughly that they didn't see any reason to have a law against nonconsensual sex!

To answer Ozy's question, no, you do not have to be afraid of rape when walking down the street. You don't have to be afraid of anything. No one on the planet could bear the thought of inflicting pain on another person.

**** Honestly though, if violence, traumas and mental damage are impossible, what makes rape worse than, say, getting hit by a snowball? The only thing I can think of is that rape takes time and you might have had other priorities. That said, when I first read the relevant section in 3WC I assumed that assault, battery and unlawful imprisonment were all still illegal, so the only legal rape would be that where no one actively tries to escape and does so unsuccessfully for more than a few seconds.

** Values Dissonance is hard to write. The writer may want this group to push the Overton Window for plot reasons but going too far would make them too detestable in the eyes of most viewers and beyond their ability to stomach (and continue reading). A book that nobody reads is worthless.

Rape is one of them extremely sensitive tropes that is almost impossible to rationalise at all, in modern society it's often judged to be worse than murder. I mean, a society of murderous cannibals (e.g. Orks from 40k) would look better to most readers. Worth the Candle has corpse fuckers and that turns people off less than rape in that story. It's a subject even "edgy" stand-up artists (e.g. George Carlin) avoids for the most part, and Carlin is famous for his opposition to obscenity laws.

Hell, for [[/r/rimworld]] where people joke about turning prisoners into leather hats and unwilling organ donors, a subreddit that is loudly proud to be banned alongside the Crusader Kings series and Dwarf Fortress in [[/r/nocontext]] for being "too easy", the subject of rape is still somewhat sensitive.
