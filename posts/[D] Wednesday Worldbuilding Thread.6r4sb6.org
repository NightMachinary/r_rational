Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Nobody's posted yet today so I'll put in a small question that I will of course ask in a very long winded way: how affected do you think vampires are by their "human" lives?

Like, obviously a vampire who is <200yo would probably be very affected by it. But many vampires are a thousand years old or more.

There's a thing about subjective perception of time, something like at the age of 30 you've already filled up half of your "memory space"/"subjective time space" - so would vampires have a logarithmic memory, where there are bigger chunks of "storage space" devoted to earlier stuff? Or would it be like that character in Dr Who where the brain can't hold everything and so forgets? (Probably not for My Vampires, but maybe for someone else's, since My Vampires have very good memories)

I'm trying to write more vampire POV scenes and I started having him remember his human life, to try to relate to his human lover (you know, "humans are different, but I was one of them once, what was important to me then? What could be important to him now?"), but it seems so... lame and tropey, to have a guy in the 1940s remember the forest of Gaul c.600 CE. My instinct would be that he'd have so many more experiences in his long life that the long-lost days of his youth would be less relevant than, say, a human he took pity on and spared during feeding in say 1400, or a bard's poem he happened to listen to.

But maybe it would make sense to lock onto your human past in order to try and capture the subjective emotions? But would it be something you would even think of as being part of you and your experiences in any meaningful way after so long?

Like, I was thinking of writing a little thing about Vampire, I don't know, talking to himself in his Original Language, or singing an old war-song, etc, and being sad/broody about the fact that nobody alive would understand it, that those words and syllables are the last survivors of the people he knew and loved as a human. And then I'm like, "for all I know he might have spent a couple of hundred years being worshipped as a sky-king by a cult in iraq c1100CE, would that sort of thing really be on his radar? and if it was, would he weep for the loss of that ancient iraqi cult just as much?". And then I'm like broody depressed All My Friends Are Dead vampires are lame and that's not what I want.

I don't think that it makes sense from the point of view of someone who's taking a step back and adopting the Outside View, but unless vampires become perfectly rational beings upon joining the ranks of the undead, something like "maybe experiences from my short human life will be more relevant than those from my longer, post-mortem unlife" is, if not perfectly reasonable, then at least something I would expect to see.

There are really happy, really old people who are neither broody and waiting to join all their dead friends in the Big Sky Party, nor nihilistic and uncaring about the present despite having seen it all before. If you can find some articles or interviews that give insight into how they categorize things then that might be helpful (and I imagine that the majority of old vampires have figured out how to find joy in the present, because suicide is as easy as leaving the curtains open before you go to sleep).

#+begin_quote
  how affected do you think vampires are by their "human" lives?
#+end_quote

Some vampires may think upon it fondly, not exactly in a way that makes them mourn what's been lost but in the way that people think fondly upon their childhoods. Others may be incredibly embarrassed by their former lives. I mean, I'm embarrassed by who I was just a few years ago, so I'm pretty sure that I'd be embarrassed by who I was a century ago, had I been alive back then.

Also, how do your vampires deal with the shift in morality over time and across cultures? Among other things, I've been thinking lately about how people often make the argument that there have been "moral advances" over the centuries but, at the same time, there are people who lived two thousand years ago or more and whose positions on animal rights, pacifism, equality between the sexes, caring for the unfortunate, and so on would put most modern people to shame, despite how many people today think that the ancients were all savages. For a Jain or follower of Modi who was turned into a vampire a very, very long time ago, it's probably a weird experience to not only see mainstream morality shifting, as it always does, but shifting ever more closely in accordance with the values that everyone else once considered to be wackadoo nonsense. On the other hand, someone whose values have been left behind will likely be infuriated by that but it must give such a person pause to see how morality just keeps on shifting and to realize that morals have /always/ been shifting. It's one thing to complain about the younger generations and another to see that younger generation then complain about the next one, for five or ten iterations on, but see everything move along all the same.

Yeah, but given the particular vampire is somewhat integrated in human society, and vampire culture is continuously "refreshed" by newly turned humans, it's probably not going to be an endless source of hilarious misunderstandings either. I'd imagine vampires would be somewhat interested in human culture (if only because they depend on it not just for food but for things like e.g. getting their mansions built), so while they might not always know the specifics, they'd be no more out of touch than the average parent, if you get me.

My partner is convinced that just being alive for 1000 years would make you more rational and analytical, because you'd have time to realise it's the best way to get what you want.

That's a tricky one. My first instinct was to respond with "they are a post gender post racial society who instead focuses on age differences which are an absolute proxy for power, and of course humans are only worth anything insomuch as they are considered property of the vampire who 'owns' them", but then I'm conveniently /basically/ giving vampire society Values Of My Ideal Society Probably, which seems like a hell of a cop-out. Like, they're beyond racism and sexism but they are still OK with killing humans? Society today is getting to be beyond racism and sexism and at the same time getting to be beyond killing animals for food, and the vampire-human gap is smaller (especially for young vampires) than the animal-human gap.

The thing is, I don't want vampires to be racist or sexist, so I guess I need to pull vampires further ahead of "modern" (1940s) society, or give them a weirdtopia thing (which I can't even begin to think of any candidates for, beyond perhaps thinking of religious iconography as "unclean"; they already have a superstition against touching money; but none of those are weirdtopia because it needs to be something that is proper weird or seems wrong/gross rather than "isn't this interesting")

I've recently written an interlude where Catholic!Vampire!William visits a catholic priest, does a confession, and after getting the divine forgiveness (which is an extremely long-standing part of catholic dogma it turns out), he kills the priest because he's a heretic anyway, but he's the least heretical of the many heretics who are out there practising their unrecognisable religions.

Maybe this is just my vision of William, but I view him as being amused/interested/entertained by all the various changes in human culture, fashion, and values. I've got a plot bunny where he goes to a gay nightclub in the 80s and sees a guy wearing a mesh shirt and is like "oh my god! This is amazing! who thought this idea up? I love it."

#+end_quote

I'm not sure how much of my draft you read, but the central conflict in the human-vampire relationship ends up being about slavery and their different impressions of that, and I think it's pretty weak at the moment because I have to make it a "genuine miscommunication that gets worked out", whilst at the same time having a 1500 year old vampire decide that slavery is wrong, and I'm just kind of uncomfortable about the whole thing, especially because I'm not even American let alone African-American so I'm not sure how well I've handled the topic /at all/.

So in the end the vampire objects not to slavery itself but to enslaving equals for no fault of their own (rather than enslaving lessers - eg vampire enslaving human - or enslaving war losers). I read an old SSC post where Scott is talking about how American Slavery was kind of an aberration as far as slavery goes, and many slaves in antiquity were able to save money to ultimately buy their freedom, so I might do some more research into all that sort of thing and see if that ticks some more boxes.

But then I don't want to have the vampire say, "slavery isn't wrong, but it's wrong if you don't allow someone to buy their freedom back after working for you for 7 years and also if they didn't do anything to deserve it" - because that's kind of a reprehensible thing to say, and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a character in a story I put out there saying those things.

So it's tricky, especially because slavery seems like the best point of conflict as it came out organically as a conflict point between the two characters when me and my coauthor were planning the story via roleplay. So I really don't want to have us pick something else (which may be difficult).

***** I have a weird and probably out of place idea for how to make vampires post-gender post-racial, give them some limited form of shapeshifting. It can be like regeneration in Doctor Who where every once in a while their whole body changes, though they might have some more control over it. I like the idea of it being influenced by "you are what you eat" as a way for their species to blend into their surroundings.

So when a vampire moves to a new location and feeds on the locals, they'll eventually change to more resemble them and have to take on a new identity in their society. After spending multiple lifetimes as different ethnicities and genders, it's harder to rationalize prejudice. The older, more worldly vampires would discourage such behavior from the younger ones and encourage them to experiment.

****** I really love that idea, but I don't think I'd be game to use it.

I can see so many cool consequences of it, too. Young vampires who knew about this from the get-go would probably try and stick to a very specific type of prey to maintain their own apperance. Maybe those serial killers who target young blonde women are vampires?

But as vampires got older they'd start caring less and less about who they ate because no matter how many beautiful young blonde women they eat, their face would no longer be recognisable to them, since their own bone structure would have long since faded into mystery.

Would also explain why vampires are so beautiful, as people tend to prefer "the average face". And as a corollary, old vampires would probably have a "look".

My Vampires also run on nanites that use their DNA as a blueprint, so you'd even have a mechanism for this - the DNA from the blood they drink regularly would dilute the DNA that the nanites get from the "original" corpse. (Though a lot of face stuff is epigenetics/growth/etc but let's ignore that).

It's a very cool idea! I wish I could use it.

******* Maybe you could still use it if you made it completely optional. Vampires don't have to change their face if they don't want to and the main character never did, which isn't uncommon. It's just that most of the older vampires have at some point, due to either necessity of the time period or eventual dissatisfaction with their appearance, so they're big on encouraging others to look beyond the labels humans give each other.

Nobody wants to get caught disrespecting their elders, since ratting out such behavior will curry favor, and multi-millennia of experience tends to make their punishments more....creative. For all we know, vampires could be as old as the Stone Age or even predate modern humans, so the oldest would've needed to change faces as humans changed. Some may even remember when they were beasts who gained sentience by eating humans.

I wasn't meaning that they'd be bored with life, just less fundamentalist about things because they've seen so many changes. Like, it's hard to argue that gay people are destroying society when you have three hundred years' experience of seeing people make the same argument about other groups to no effect.

As for being post-racial, I can't imagine that the older vampires would even identify in racial terms that we'd recognize and it would be hard for them to take our conceptions of race very seriously. "Look, don't try to talk to me about how white people are better than everyone or race-mixing is bad or multicultural centers are hellholes, I remember when the Irish and the Italians weren't white, etc. etc."

You might also want to look at different strains of anarchism. I don't think that's quite where you're going with vampire society, but their society is loose enough that you might find some interesting ideas to play around with so far as professed virtues go.

No doubt vampires may well have thrown their hands up in disgust - or they might have their own outcast caste.

Anarchism might be a good well to draw on! Neoreactionaries, too, maybe. (Honestly the neoreactionary way of thinking might ultimately be what would appeal most to one of my vampires, but no reason not to give others different ideas.)

I remember when two of my friends and I were walking through a part of a subdivision was near to where we lived but which I'd never been to, and we ended up getting lost because each of us assumed one of the others knew where he was going and would interpret small movements like "glancing in this direction" as indicating that e.g. we're going to take a turn in just a moment. Because this resulted in each of us making our own movements it somehow turned into each of us following someone else and not realizing that the other two were doing the same thing.

Maybe something similar happened here, people all persecuting the Cagots because they interpreted a less extreme action as persecution and, well, you don't want to look like an idiot by asking /why/ the persecution is going on, do you? It makes sense to everyone else, apparently, so just shut up and get with the program.

And really it's just that three guys at a bar made some jokes about their Cagot neighbor one time and then things got out of control.

*** I like how [[/u/callmebrotherg][u/callmebrotherg]] suggests them thinking about their human lifetime similarly to their childhood, and I think you could take that a step further and treat the various identities they've taken over the centuries as careers they pursued. Some lifetimes were happier than others, but fate gave them opportunities that they took advantage of in order to prosper.

Vampires have to adopt and abandon identities in order to stay hidden and support themselves, so they might think of them as jobs they've worked. Some were more pleasant than others and some required relearning what they knew, but it was always something they had to do and helped define who they were. Of course, jobs mean different things to different people.

I don't think there's anything wrong with your vampire feeling nostalgic for the past, though if he were introspective about how he's changed as a person since then it might avoid the cliche. He's not the same person he was before and may wonder if that's a good thing, but he has been many different people over the centuries by his own choices and the compulsions of others.

In the case of him being sentimental about the past, perhaps he doesn't long for his old life but just wants to remind himself of it. He doesn't want it back, he just doesn't want to forget how important it was to him. Maybe he wants to avoid making the same mistakes or continue to honor the memory of losses he's come to terms with. For him, it's like taking an old photo album out.

Great analogy. The really rough stuff I scratched out the past few days basically has memories of the long past coming to him, unbidden, when his human partner is talking about his own life/thoughts/worries/etc.

I don't think I want to go ahead with it as written. I like the idea of it being a kind of "focused meditation", where he chooses to think those thoughts in that time and place, perhaps to gain insights into what humanity is or maybe just because he has fond memories of his long-dead wife and children.

***** Another good analogy might be an adult finding a toy from their childhood that they long since stopped playing with, but seeing it again brings up some happy memories. Unlike other pieces of their past they got rid of, they like having it around even if they'll rarely do anything with it. Maybe they decide to put it on their shelf instead of leaving in the attic because they decide they don't want to forget again, or finally give it to someone else because they don't need it anymore.

I don't know if comparing vampire's relationships to humans should be comparable to humans and objects, though, even if people vary in their respect for their possessions. However, pursuing the angle of the human reminding the vampire of happier times he'd forgotten about could be very romantic. I keep thinking of scenes from Pixar films like Ratatouille and Toy Story 3 where we see characters rediscover their past and become better people as a result.

Yeah, I think the story is going to be a lot about transitions and adapting to your partner as you both go through different stages of your lives - though with a vampire and a human who goes through various stages of supernatural bondage to the vampire before ultimately ending up as an independent vampire himself, it's just slightly more turmurtulous than the average human might deal with.

This is very tricky to handle right, you're correct. It's especially bad because I can't conceive of how a 1500 year old vampire dating a 22 year old human is going to be anything /other/ than pretty squicky when you think about the vampire's POV in any sort of depth. The human winds up adopting a dog and my partner was saying he thought the whole dog plotline was very transparent in terms of "vampire is to human as human is to dog", when all I really meant by that was wanting to give the human a dog because he would be lonely during the day otherwise. But hey, if the shoe fits... it is a pretty perfect analogy.

And like I said above, it's all about the transitions, so ultimately the vampire will be seeing the human as more of an equal - just not straight at the beginning of the story.

******* The squicky part may be dealt with in a manner I just thought of, but be aware, it will significantly impact your worldbuilding.

Vampires are attracted to the age range they were attracted to as humans. You were hot for mature partners? Then you'll keep being that way, since that's an intrinsic part of your make-up. If V/V romances are a thing, only vamps with mature looks will be attractive to you, regardless if they're actually older than you or not.

Another, rather more squicky approach could be you're attracted to the age range you appear to be in. You were turned in the tweens? Well, that's your hunting ground, you better like clubs these days. You were turned in your nineties? Well, you better start prowling retirement homes. You were turned as a child? Yeah, good luck with /that/.

******** It's not about who you're attracted to, though. It's about the fact that if you have a 2000 year old vampire who appears to be 13, the thought of her sleeping with a 13 year old boy today gets very rapey, very fast. Like, you hear about those 9 year old girls who are married off to 60 year old men in Saudi Arabia or wherever? Even setting aside the physical issues with them consummating the relationship and the elephant in the room of consent, the age gap is just squicky - what common ground would a 60 year old and a 9 year old possibly have?

So yeah, that's the issue. Not whether it would make sense for a vampire to want to bump uglies with a human of any age, but whether it's /appropriate/ for a vampire to seek out a human lover, whether it's exploitative, whether it's just a huge mismatch of... everything. And at the end of the day my story kind of hinges on such a relationship happening, so you know, I'm stuck with it!

Aside: [[http://jezebel.com/mens-favorite-ages-are-20-21-22-and-23-a-data-dive-1731660984][according to an OKCupid analysis]] apparently hetero men like ~22yo women, and women like men close to their own age. So the "attracted to people my apparent age" thing isn't going to look like a good option. "Attracted to people I liked as a human" would work fine, though. But it still doesn't solve the problem of a 1500 year old vampire falling in love with a 22 year old human in a way that doesn't seem to be gross on its face.

I mean, from a broader perspective all vampires with romantic interests in humans will be essentially ephebophiles, at least judging from their life span compared to that of their prospective romantic partner.

The consent is a whole other issue I don't wanna poke with a ten-foot pole. I think this again comes to the vampire's general perspective and views of humans. Will it be something like in societies condoning and encouraging slave ownership, i.e. they're not /real/ people, and they don't have the civilisatory maturity for actual meaningful relationship? Or does it go even further, viewing humans as chattel and relationships are on the level of pet-owner, and any vampire pursuing more is viewed the same as a sodomist in modern societies?

Stuff for thought, I think. This clash of views could actually be a fault line in vampire societies, insofar as such a thing exists, with clans with shared views forming political factions and such.

There's an age gap, experience gap, and a power differential you can drive a truck through.

  I mean, from a broader perspective all vampires with romantic interests in humans will be essentially ephebophiles, at least judging from their life span compared to that of their prospective romantic partner.
#+end_quote

I don't know; the self-professed ephebophiles I see talked about online are in their 30s or 40s, so we're talking about "only" a 20 year age difference. There's a difference between a 100 year old vampire dating a 30 year old human and a 1000 year old vampire doing the same thing.

Yeah, this is something my story touches on. The human thing is more-or-less on the pet-owner side of the spectrum. That said, loving humans goes into and out of fashion, in the setting it is currently out of fashion but maybe becoming fashionable again. The sodomist comparison is more or less apt.

#+end_quote

Man... you've made me realise that although I gave My Vampires a feudal sort of hierarchy, they would probably also have "clans" of sorts. Likely to be around other vampires with similar sorts of views.

/Perhaps that's why vampires organise "under" more powerful vampires/. Wow. I always struggled to explain that. They support each other politically, and the younger vampires are protected from older, more politically powerful vampires. The letters the vampires are always sending each other can also include, perhaps, books and papers where they try and convince each other of political views.

Now I need to think of some "blue and orange" vampire morality things that the different "vampire nations" might have. That would be a fun thing for next week's worldbuilding thread if I can remember to post it!

Thanks for that - I am not sure why you went to a worldbuilding thread that was a couple of weeks old and posted with your thoughts but I am really glad you did. That is probably the seed of a decent worldbuilding breakthrough for me!

*********** Dunno, prolly because it was the most recent worldbuilding thread at the time I joined the discussion.

The blue/orange morality thing is difficult, in my opinion. In general, I mean, particularly for viewpoint characters. You can always have incomprehensible characters with unearthly motivations, but when you derive the characters from relatively baseline humans, then their motives and morality would be informed by their origins. After all, humans drag a /shitload/ of impressions and opinions with them that they acquired early in life. It's part of the reason there's always a generation shift in various fields; holdovers of old theories aren't so much convinces as they die off and new practices can take hold.

Anyway, blue/orange: maybe look at the issues a gerontocracy (which is what you're effectively proposing for vampires) may have to deal with; I'm sure there will be treatises on that on the internet. One of the top of my head would be the age divide: if only older generations are ruling, young aspirants will never have a chance to sit on the throne themselves, so to speak.

When I read Hamilton's first /Confederation/ books, this was actually addressed in a byline; one dynasty ruler was considering opening up the higher echelons of the dynasty not to just the first two, three generations of children he sired, but to the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, to infuse new blood. (pun not intended, but welcome nonetheless)

Lastly, I'm a bit ambivalent about the religious conflict being so transgressive it covered the whole world. For instance, at that time Australia was still undiscovered, travel times between continents was many months, and the vampires likely recruited their ‘offspring' from all kinds of human religions.

This isn't to discourage you from using that trope; I just felt it necessary to mention possible future issues pointed out to you by readers.

************ Yeah, it's tricky.

Australia was definitely discovered in 1700; the local peoples were living there for 50,000 years, no doubt including some vampires. But there certainly wasn't fast travel between them.

You're right on the world-spanning religious conflict being tricky though. Vampires who are old enough can turn into bats, which lets them fly - probably not as fast as a plane though, which means they probably will have a tough time crossing e.g. the pacific ocean.

A magical plague seems the best way to accomplish what I was hoping to accomplish, though whether 4% of vampires just happened to resist the plague vs 4% of vampires found the antidote is another question. Random resistance of the plague requires less thought, but it also stops a good worldbuilding opportunity of "what made all these vampires band together and find the antidote?"/"what made the guy who found the antidote pick these particular vampires?"

That said, has the problem of the vampires who survived the plague of 1700 being somewhat uniform in terms of appearance (i.e. the 250 chinese-origin-vampires that should proportionally exist would have mostly been living in China and perhaps not physically able to access the antidote: which is great if I want to justify why everyone is european, but I don't really care whether they're european or not, but if the vampire catastrophe centered around eastern europe (where the vampire myth originated in 1700; the catastrophe explains somewhat why that is), then a disproportionate amount of vampires are going to be from europe and the middle east.

Doing my head in!

************* Well, you can accomplish a lot by defining the rules by which (this) magical plague works. Does it spread by contact? If so, then more urbanised vampire societies will be quicker to be infected. What's the incubation period? Days and it will burn itself out before it can infect many vampires; if you want to have a thorough infection rate it should be years at minimum, or it's active at a very low level for a long time, fighting off the superhuman immune system (think certain cancers or magical AIDS), before it reaches sufficient inertia to kill the host. Maybe tie the plague to a certain event for going active; then it would have had decades to infect the most vampires before suddenly impacting everyone.

Hm... an idea just now was having the plague be a kind of human virus that crossed the ‘species barrier' in the worst possible way for vampires, and in search for a magical antidote they acquire that weakness to holy symbols. I don't know the particulars for your mythology, but there's some room for speculation for the plague's background.

************** Yeah, if I go the magical plague route, it's going to be a decades long plague that spreads by airborne transmission or something. Crossing the species barrier is interesting, the idea of it all being just a tragic accident is kind of poetic because Life Sucks Sometimes You Know?

The holy symbol thing isn't important like at all. My main vampire goes to a catholic church on occasion, so you know, he's probably OK with all that junk.

The Catastrophe, while ultimately very important to the worldbuilding in many ways, is also ultimately irrelevant to the story in many others and it kind of bores me to speculate on it because it's... not the story I want to tell, you know? Like, for an analogy, say I'm writing a setting where the South won the civil war, but it's 2091 and slavery is still going strong and the slaves all have cybernetic implants or something. And I have all these ideas about my cybernetic slaves and their struggles and whatever, and then people are saying, "okay, but how did the Confederates get enough supplies to defeat the Yankees? The yankees had access to better rifles in reality, do you think the Confederates in your timeline invented better rifles and won with technology or do you think they aligned better with Mexico to overcome it?" (or whatever: I know nothing about history). And meanwhile I'm like, "I'm really not interested, that's all background noise, the point is it happens and now I have cybernetic slaves in high school playing pranks on their teachers, which is what I actually want to w rite about".

Not to say that the catastrophe isn't important to the story, and it has a LOT more implications on vampire society than I'm letting on: but focusing on it just makes me go "okay, that's well and good, but /my vampire/ wants to kiss this human, and that's /so much more interesting to me/". I think I need to be locked in a room with no food or water until I come up with A Perfect Sketch of the Catastrophe^{TM}

Thank you for your help though! The more I think about the Catastrophe the more comfortable I get with it.

I think I sound ungrateful and I very much don't mean to.

  And then I'm like, "for all I know he might have spent a couple of hundred years being worshipped as a sky-king by a cult in iraq c1100CE, would that sort of thing really be on his radar? and if it was, would he weep for the loss of that ancient iraqi cult just as much?".
#+end_quote

Being worshiped as a sky-king would get pretty mundane if you looked at activities on a day-to-day basis.

If I met the King, I'd be having a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Adrenaline's going. And I'm imagining telling my grand-kids about what it was like to be in a massive hall.

The King is on his seventh meeting of the day. He's probably running on autopilot. "Minion shows up. Looks like generic scribe. Nervous. Tell him Joke #3 to get him to relax. Ok, he's saying his thing. What decision do I need to make here? Can I get this done before lunch? Man this chair is uncomfortable. Didn't i tell someone to fix that yesterday? Oh. Scribe stopped talking. Look serious. What was the question again?"

The experience might be like living on a cruise-ship, except with people nervously interrupting you every 30 minutes. Plus, your friends want to steal your stuff. And you have to spend large chunks of time stoically 'presiding' over random gatherings.

You'd get used to the physical perks (Food! Whenever you want!) and they'd fall into the background. Decisions are filtered through orders given to 3-10 close advisers. So the actual experience of ruling wouldn't be all that different than managing a regional chain of video rental stores.

So, becoming a God-King is almost certainly memorable. But the actual day-to-day experience wouldn't necessarily be any more intense than anything else. And I don't think it would make your vampire unable to appreciate lesser positions.

--------------

For relationships, I'd look to dog ownership. Bernese Mountain Dogs live 6-8 years. I knew a guy who lived on a bunch of land and had 4 of them at a time. A dog breeder, over their lifetime, could easily have owned 40+ dogs.

You'd never expect a dog breeder to be all broody and depressed over dog-ownership. Even after decades, they'd still be excited to see a puppy learn a new trick. And they'd still mourn when a dog passed away.

I think they'd just be kind of pragmatic about the whole thing. Lives come. And they go. You celebrate when it's time for joy. And you mourn when it's time for sadness. Experience the feelings, and know that things change.

At the same time, not all dogs would fade from memory equally fast. The dog-breeder probably remembers a bunch about his first puppy. Those experiences were new and extra intense. And he probably has a handful of really special dogs who stick out in his memory, as The Champion Show-dog or The Amazing Friend.

If you apply that to human/vampire relationships, I'd expect that the vampire has several relationships going at once. They could be staggered. You might have the 20-year-old he's just meeting. The 40-year-old who's now raising a human family / running a chunk of the vampire's empire. And the 80-year-old who he meets to reminisce about old times.

Alternately, if the vampire is a 'serial monogamist', I think they might optimize for partners who are intensely memorable in some way. Here, I'd look for superlatives. It's someone who's beautiful AND driven to achieve ___.

--------------

Finally, for reminiscing, I'd think about what it's like to explain childhood minutia to a foreign friend (or someone from a younger generation).

A few weeks ago, I was talking to a co-worker about a time that I'd forgotten my ID when trying to buy beer. The clerk challenged me to sing the chorus from the "Gummy Bear" theme song.

Co-Worker and I launched into a terrible rendition of it. The people under 30 had absolutely no idea what we were singing. And the people under 30 from outside the US were lost. Not only did they not know the show, the whole "Saturday Morning Cartoon" thing relied on a bunch of cultural context that they just didn't have.

I'd expect your vampire to have similar feelings about Gaul. He wouldn't pine for the forests for the same reason that I don't pine for the early 1990s. It's too different, and I'm too distant.

Instead, he'd have memories of really small things. The thing itself might be easy to explain ("this is a conker! We had them when I was young"), but the cultural context that made it special would be almost impossible ("You'd tie a string through your conker and then swing them at each other. No, not to hit the other player. That's 'hot cockles'. You hit the other conker. And then you see whose conker shatters!")

*** Well, I can only advise you to speak to elders in retirement homes, to steer the discussion to how they relate their current life and character to who they were in school, because that's what basically the human duration of the vampires' life was, school. The learned how to be people and all that stuff, and just like school a big part won't be relevant for their adult (vampire) life, but it will still stick with them, both in hands-on as well as social skills.

A human trader will probably become a vampire with wanderlust, and they will retain lots of their methodic skills, their tradecraft, and it will be just as useful in later years.

To expand on that simile of human life = school for vampires, their first years as a vampire will also leave a large impact on them. You can relate it to an apprenticeship in that simile, I think, and not be too far off; you'll learn valuable skills and make connections, and it will impact you, but it won't /necessarily/ limit you in your character. Depending on your environment, of course; if apprenticing in vampirism is basically the same as joining a coven or cult, then ‘graduating' would become more difficult.

**** Thank you for your input!

Yeah, the vampires definitely seem to have an "apprenticeship" going on, because My Vampires have such inscrutable social rules that you'd need someone to teach you. I'm contemplating whether they have periodic "mass turnings" where a group of ~20 vampires will try and turn 20 humans (about 10 will take). Those 10 successful vampires would then be "raised" in a "school" to become successful members of society.

But I'm not sure who would be motivated to do that. Maybe a fringe faction of vampires. Then again, My Vampires go through a serious population bottleneck c. 1700, so it could be that a few "cohorts" of vampires were mass-birthed "out of necessity", "to continue the species", etc. But whether the bottleneck!population would care about the proliferation of the species or not is kind of strange? I guess it gives you social allies because they owe their existence to you? But they won't necessarily stay on your side long-term. Vampires don't /need/ to be surrounded by other vampires, they just tolerate them.

Or maybe that's stupid and tropey. Maybe vampires like being surrounded by other vampires to talk with and spend time with, even if they have very tense undertones as any one could defect; but in practise once you've lived somewhere a few decades, you and all the local vampires are pretty comfy for at least a few more, just because you share the same hunting grounds.

***** Be aware of the pitfalls---and opportunities---the founder effects offers to you in the case of bottlenecking populations. You're essentially reducing a broad variety of options to but a few. The surviving population will express these options much more readily and will derive sub-options based on them. This is true for genetics, certainly, but also for other more etherical issues, like political opinions. Say you have the major factions A and B, but also minor factions C, D, E, F. By chance the bottleneck affected C and E less, but killed off D. After the bottleneck the major factions are C and E, with minor A, B, and F. E goes on a power binge, extincts F, and over the result of this E splits into E1 and E2. Go ahead a couple generations and you have a political structure that looks completely different to what it was before the bottleneck.

You know, the more I think of it, the more I realises vampires would essentially be hunter/gatherers for longer than humans were, since, like for some predators-prey relationships, a big collection of prey can kill the predator. Only with the urbanisation of peoples would the hunter/gatherers settle down, since they now have a hunting ground that would be able to absorb losses with drawing too much attention to the apex predator. And while before the long stretches of loneliness drove vampires mad and killed them (madness and sun doesn't go well together), only when cities became a thing and they could socialise with other vampires did they develop an actual society.

Depending on your level of conspiracy, you can even have the whole thing flip around, of course; have vampires be naturally more social, and have them induce / reward conglomeration tendencies in the humans, which would then lead to a shift to agricultural and urbanised societies, and so on.

****** Yeah, that's definitely been a big thought: because it won't feature in my story I haven't done /heavy/ thought into this, but the sketch is that the bottleneck was /probably/ caused by some religious extremist vampire getting some power and converting people (or just being fabulously powerful in and of themself). The religious vampire wanted to exterminate the vampire race because it's evil, didn't work but almost did, maybe an et tu, brute? moment, etc. Helps explain the folklore about vampires being killed/scared by crosses since they were prominent in a "hateful regime". (Thanks to [[/u/ccc_037]] for coming up with almost all of this).

I picture the population going from ~20k to ~800, but in 1900 the population's back up to 20,000, a growth rate of 1.5% pa that puts the population at 40k in 1950 and 100k in 2000. About a third of the story's set in 1944-5 and the rest is "present day" (2017 vampire population: 130k).

So it does let you sketch up the composition of the demographics likely represented in the 800 surviving vampires:

- Probably some of Powerful Vampire's cronies, who converted or pretended to convert but are secretly working to kill all vampires (the latter probably v. bad idea: kill all vampires is easily accomplished by breaking the masquerade and revealing a lot of secrets that vampires still definitely have some 200 years later, so probably the only surviving vampires from Powerful Vampire's Cronies were actually defectors)

- Some vampires who believe in continuing the species and make babies as often as they can (which is every 20 years or so)

- A few individuals who, seeing the opportuntiy to seek political power by raising people in their image, turned as many humans as they can (again every 20 years or so), but in a selfish way rather than the "altruistic" way of above

- Some religious vampires who weren't THOSE religious vampires and now hide their religious-ness

- Handful of vampires who were not involved in the conflict at all (e.g. just chillin' on tahiti)

This is, of course, excluding the vampire demographics that we'd know would exist that were unrelated to any of "The Catastrophe" things. You know, like the vampires who are really into communism or something.

Speaking of vampire demos, I actually looked at the world population distribution in 1700 and worked out which country most vampires would be from assuming they were distributed by population, just so if I ever need to grab one of them "at random" I can make sure it's not all white europeans because my imagination is bad. [[http://imgur.com/a/FiIzZ][Turns out 250 of the 800 survivors would be chinese]] (of course). I randomly generated a character's nationality and age and she was from Korea, and looking into Korean prehistory and mythology gave me a hell of a lot of really cool ideas for the character concept! So it was excellent.
