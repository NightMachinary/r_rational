** RIP Black?

It seems pretty final. The jig is up. A win, a draw, and now a loss.

Well, I do hope Black and Warlock find their way out alive, if for nothing else but the fact that the series was going to be about them at first. Who knows? Maybe when Hanno was [[http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/276/749/286.jpg][studying the blade]], Black dug up some new stories to use. One can hope.

I do like how the ability to draw on past heroes' memories provides a counter to Black. They had to grind through an abattoir's worth of heroes to map out all of Black's tricks. All the more reason to accuse the Heavens of cheating, I guess.

So now it's Black and Warlock (maybe Assassin?) against White, Witch, and Champion (wearing Captain's dead body? Did I catch that right?). On its face, it does seem like the villains are going to get pasted all over the mountains. I hope not. That would be pretty disappointing.

Oh, and finally a dragon!

*** I believe Black explicitly mentioned in one of his interludes in the third book that no pattern of three formed between himself and the White Knight. It was this that led him to believe that he had only a year or two left to live.

In terms of extra-textual reasons, I don't believe Black's death, far away from Cat with little to no interaction between the two in the proceeding year, would be a satisfying resolution to their personal story.

I really don't think that will be permanent, I'd be thrilled if it was the case, but I get the feeling death isn't that cheap (for POV characters) and she's the big bad, in that she is the hand of God enforcing status quo, and a major theme seams to be breaking the pattern.

******** Sure, what I was trying to convey was that Anaxares' judgment was extremely powerful because his rejection of the great game was effectively an earthly tribunal rejecting the meddling of the Gods Above and Below, and as such it should have a massive impact on one of their tools, the Bard. If she and the Assassin are diametrically opposed, it serves to reason that he should be equally impacted by such a ruling, though by different means.

I'm guessing Black will straight up avoid 1v1ing Hanno since that's just fitting into the pattern of three. Maybe he will fight Champion? He has a revenge story there with Captain, and if Champion wears her fur cloak to battle all the more narrative weight will be given to Black.

*** Yeap. One of Hanno's ability is to go through the experiences (memories) of dead Heroes and relive through them.

His second aspect, Recall, allows him to remember the skills and fighting styles of dead Heroes and switch between different Heroes. From his 2nd battle with Black in Book 3, it seem that he can only focus on one at a time and every time he shifts, the cooldown time and shifting time increases.

That, however, was 'shifting' in the middle of battle. From this chapter, he went through the experiences of the Heroes before the battle to simulate Black and choose the most effective anti-Black techniques beforehand.

Given that: i) Hanno and Black currently have a Pattern of 3-ish pattern (Round 1: Hanno Lost, Black Won & Retreated, Round 2: Hanno Lost but Black Lost so Draw?) and ii) Hanno's 3rd Aspect has not been revealed, it's also likely Hanno's 3rd Aspect is going to be anti-Black.

I'm picking up Black deathflags throughout the entire chapter.
