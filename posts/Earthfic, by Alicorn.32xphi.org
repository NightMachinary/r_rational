** Saw other stories by Alicorn being posted, so just wanted to make sure people enjoy this one too. It's particularly relevant to those of us who write and enjoy fanfic :)

*** I was kind of slow to cotton on. I thought that it was referring to spec fic in general, and not fan fic in particular, until "earthfiction.net" was mentioned.

***** Speculative fiction. Catch-all term for fantasy, science fiction, and everything else as well.

****** Oh yeah. It was hilarious when I realized that the earthfiction is a parody of fanfiction with the copied work being real life.

*** Or speculative fiction in general. Or, indeed, those of us who find it boring to read about something where only everyday, normal things happen.

** I think the point of it is not that it refers to any particular genre, but to the entire conceit of discriminating based on such a broad genre.

** I like the writing itself, of course. Alicorn knows what she's doing. But I totally dislike the comparison to fanfic and the specific way it's handled. Primarily because of the parts that are just /wrong./

*** Seconding the desire to know what's wrong, especially since I spent a third to half of the fic thinking it was about spec fic, not fan fic, so I may have missed something.
