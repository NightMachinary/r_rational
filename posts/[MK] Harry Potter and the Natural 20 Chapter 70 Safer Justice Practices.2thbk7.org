So...justice consists of trying to contain the jizz of villainy and Fiona is what allows it to escape?

**** Justice gets contracepted in the story's metaphor, so in this case justice is the semen and Fiona is the crazy girl who pokes holes in all her boyfriend's condoms.

***** I think, in the story's metaphor, justice is a healthy baby, so when justice fails, you get a miscarriage. But wizarding legal system is so ridicoulous, the baby doesn't have a chance to even conceive.

On a side note, Fiona is displeased that Black didn't get a trial (when even Nazis did), I wonder what she'll say when she discovers what farce passes for a "trial" in the wizarding wolrd.
