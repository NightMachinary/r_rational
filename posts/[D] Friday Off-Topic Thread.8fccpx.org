Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

**** In the same way that the current flag is 4 rows of 5 and 5 rows of 6, you could resolve a flag of 53 stars into 3 rows of 7 and 4 rows of 8. Granted, that would squash the flag, but you could make the stars slightly smaller and introduce a small amount of space between each row to compensate.

On the other hand, if you want a return to nice looking concentric circles, you could have a single star in the center, then 4, then 16, then 32.

That way you will have 53 states complaining rather than 52, which is actually a better situation all around.

**** I was scrolling through my messages trying to find one and realized that I never replied to this. In short, /Worth the Candle/ has no set update schedule, I release chapters when I think they're ready, and grouped in what I feel are logical or narratively compelling ways. If people donate, they do so knowing that, since that's how I've been doing it since starting the story. Every month, I post an update on how writing went that month, with some basic word/chapter count analysis.

I find writing to a strict schedule to be really stressful when I'm having trouble with some section of the story, and in the past I've felt like I've compromised a work by rushing things. I /also/ find writing "bad" status updates to be really stressful and unpleasant, which can send writing output into a downward spiral.

Doing things the way that I'm doing them has a cost, which is that fewer people are willing to donate if there's no guarantee. That's a cost that I'm fine paying, since I think the freedom is (currently) worth it. If you'd be uncomfortable donating, then don't donate.

** I'm looking for a story about summoning demons that I read at some point, but can't find. I think I might have originally seen it from the rationalist-sphere, so I figured I'd ask here ([[/r/tipofmytongue][r/tipofmytongue]] didn't help). Does it sound familiar to anyone? Here's what I remember from the story:

Demons are believed to be extremely manipulative, and can trick people into selling their souls. You can summon demons, and they will sometimes do things for you. It is possible to prevent a demon from talking to you when you summon it, so that it can't manipulate you, and this is generally considered safe. The main character at first refuses to learn how to summon a demon, because he knows he wouldn't be able to resist letting it talk. But at some point he is overcome by curiosity, summons a demon, and has a conversation with it. He does this many times, and the demons actually seem like kind of normal people, so he concludes that everyone has misunderstood demons. The demons convince him that selling souls to demons isn't a real thing, and that some demons just pretend to accept peoples' souls as payment for helping them just to mess with people. The main character sells his soul multiple times, believing that this doesn't actually change anything. After the main character starts talking to demons, some people avoid talking to him to avoid demons manipulating them by proxy.

People usually have to pay demons something in order to get the demons to help them. Paying the demons with sex is common. At some point, a demon helps the main character in exchange for blog recommendations, or something like that. At one point, someone says she summoned a demon just to have sex with it, and this left quite an impression on the main character.

While it's amazing they caught a guy who murdered more than 12 people and raped more than 50, does this spell a death knell for privacy? In 20 years time will the fact your cousin submitted her DNA to a geneology service mean that you will never be able to get out of paying a parking ticket again?

Yes.

Or more realistically, I expect to see in-person crime significantly decrease as privacy approaches zero for your regular citizen, but since offensive technology typically outpaces defensive in the modern era, new ways to commit crime despite the limits placed on privacy will be invented.

** So I accepted a job offer in San Francisco starting June 11th. So much to work out. The big thing right now is how long to rent an Airbnb and if I should move a week early or two. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm exited and nervous.

*Edit:*

Some more info. I'm starting as a software engineer at a startup right after college. The pay was more than I expected even accounting for the cost of living and I think I should be able to pay between 2k and 3k for housing eventually

My basic plan right now is:

- Fly down near the start of June with a backpack and checked bag

  - Weeks worth of clothes
  - Basic hygiene stuff
  - Probably very basic kitchen type stuff if room

- Find someplace to rent more long term within a week or two
- Buy basic stuff

  - mattress
  - bedding
  - Maybe a bit more kitchen stuff

- Start working
- Ship more stuff from home

  - Extra clothes
  - More kitchen stuff
  - More bedding maybe
  - Desktop stuff

The big pieces I'm unsure about are how long it will take me to find somewhere to rent and if I should actually try to find somewhere to rent and move in before I start work or if it makes more sense to do that while I'm working.

I'm also sort of worried as I don't have much renting history. I do have a fairly good credit score (just under 800) and quite a bit of savings so I could offer to pay for the first couple months ahead of time or something.

The job is with a startup as software engineer. The companies small enough that I'd rather not say the name as it would probably be enough by itself to identify me, but they have on the order of 30 employees right now.

*** The high 700s is more than enough to rent decent housing and tenants who can pay ahead of time is every landlord's dream. It's generally wise to settle down your housing before starting a new job in a new place. You don't need the added stress of finding someplace to live while learning the ropes or settling into your new job. Once that's over, I recommend investing in a good mattress because a good night's sleep makes everything else easier. You might want to visit a mattress retailer because you can only trust anecdotes and reviews to a degree - it's more about what your body likes and finds comfortable.

[[/u/phylogenik]] Unless you're a mattress collector/aficionado, you'll never know the difference between a $1000 or sub-$200 mattress until you've tried both. I have a Tuft and Needle myself, but I didn't find it particularly better than my previous decade-or-two-old spring mattress. Don't fall for the fallacy that pricier = more comfortable for your body type. Though, from general reviewer consensus, mattress quality is pretty terrible nowadays at the low/middle-end unless you're buying off a trusted retailer.

Having a foam mattress for the past few years has been much better than having an innerspring mattress, it's much easier on your back. Also, they deliver it to you in a box (it's shrinkwrapped and "inflates" when you unroll it and take off the plastic) and all three of the ones I mentioned are less than a third of the cost of a good quality innerspring mattress. You could buy a cheap foam mattress from Walmart to get you through the 8ish days it'll take to deliver your real mattress and still come out spending like $2000 less than you could spend on a good quality traditional mattress.

(of course, there are mattresses that cost several thousands of dollars which may or may not be substantially different from those mentioned)

For 8ish days I'd also just consider getting a blowup, much easier to get rid of/donate afterwards, or keep for occasional guests. Though as a software dev maybe those temporary costs and inconveniences become pretty trivial.

I wouldn't know, but I do know that memory foam tends to not do so well with airflow and heat distribution so it tends to get hot, and the ones I listed all do things to counteract that with proprietary foam blends to keep the foam from trapping your body heat so you stay cool.

Casper has advertised on just about every Rooster Teeth show (and RT's subsidiaries like Let's Play) for several years at this point, and that's part of the reason I got a Leesa mattress instead of Casper, just out of spite (also has to do with the fact that they're incredibly similar and are priced similarly, and most people want/need a "firmness rating" of 6 or 7 and Casper's sitting at 6 while Leesa is at 7).

I did the blowup mattress thing the last time we moved, and I wasn't happy with it, but YMMV.

He tried to define truth as both "factually correct" and/or "evolutionarily advantageous". I don't think Harris really got to the bottom of why Peterson wanted to redefine the word like that, but some commenters pointed out that he was likely trying to do so in order to be able to say that his religion is "true" without proving it correct.

I'd be happy to hear that the podcast was a bad first impression, and he's actually completely different, but if it was a representative sample then I have little interest in listening to someone willing to play such word games in order to score points.

It's all jumbled up in my memory because I listened to one of their reactions to the second video then watched highlights of the first then highlights of the second video then reactions to the first, or something like that.

Over the past year or so I've begun having a hard time focusing on things I previously took interest in. Like, I would read for hours or watch hour-long videos of people playing video games on youtube or 2 to 3 hour long podcasts, and now I'll watch 5 or ten minutes of a video then pause it and read something for 5 minutes then watch 10 minutes of a different video then look at reddit then circle back to the first video for 15 minutes then go back and continue reading for half an hour then start watching a new video before I go back to one of the ones I already started, stuff like that.

Consequently, even though I've exposed myself to a lot of Jordan Peterson content, it's mostly been in the form of 5 to 15 minute long highlight videos. I feel like I have ADHD. I presume it's a result of some sort of depression.

It doesn't help that we "sold" our house in January, but the buyers are leasing until July because they're moving from another state and the bank won't give them a loan/mortgage/whatever until the guy has had a job in-state for six months, so we can't buy a new house and move until we get the money when our house closes, so we've been living at my grandmother's house since February. Being here has significantly impacted my sleep schedule.

She wakes up at like 5am, and by 8 or 9 she'll be hammering and sawing and building and all sorts of other stuff that people people in their late 70s shouldn't be doing anymore (and if she's not doing that, she usually takes a phone call from a friend at around 10am and she's partially deaf so whenever she's on the phone she "talks" (practically screams) like she's trying to communicate with a person standing across from her on the opposite side of a busy street), which wakes me up after I've only been asleep for 6 hours, so I'll lay there for an hour or two until the interruption is finished and go back to sleep for another 3 or 4 hours, and then I'll go to sleep later the next night/morning as a result of waking up later, so I'll only have been asleep for like 3 hours when she starts banging around the next day, and basically it pushes my sleep schedule around the clock until I'm scheduled to go to sleep when she starts doing her thing, so I'll wait until she's done to even begin going to sleep, but then when that happens I'll only sleep for 6 hours for some reason and the next morning be scheduled to fall asleep at the same time again, so I'll try staying awake until 7 or 8 or 9 at night so I can wake up at 4am, but having been awake so long I'll sleep for 9 or more hours and wake up at 6 or 7 in the morning, and then instead of getting sleepy 16 hours later the extra sleep will keep me awake for 18 or 19 hours, and then it just starts going around the clock again.

I'm on a "try to stay awake all day" day today and it's about 2pm, hence the extra ADHD. I apologize for the atrocious 297-word sentence I just spit out, god, if novels are 150 words a page that's a /two page long sentence/, what an unholy abomination.

We'll be doing a cross-country move to another state here in the next few months, and I'll get a job and situate myself and things'll go back to normal.

  You'll be keen to note that Peterson hasn't disagreed with anything you've mentioned, in his first video and in the Senate hearing he agreed that the amendments to the Criminal Code are benign on the surface, because they address the things you address; ie; a reasonable amendment to the Criminal Code.

  His objections are in how the Human Rights Act interprets gender identity and gender expression, using the definitions provided by the Ontario Human Rights Code

  "I noted in the videos that the policy statements surrounding similar laws already in place in Ontario and several other provinces were dangerously vague and ill-formulated. I also indicated my refusal to apply what have become known as “preferred” pronouns to people who do not fit easily into traditional gender categories (although I am willing to call someone “he” or “she” in accordance with their manner of self-presentation)."

  "I noted that under the new provisions of federal Bill C-16, now past second reading, discrimination for reasons of “gender identity” and “gender expression” has now become not only illegal, but part of the special category of hate crime."

  He's again, referring to surrounding policies, most notably the Ontario Human Rights Code and their definitions of gender identity and gender expression. The following paragraph is correct in that Bill C-16 will add those two categories protections under the Criminal Code from discrimination and hate crimes.

  Tangentially, it should be noted that the Ontario Human Rights Tribunals defined hate crimes and discrimination differently than the Criminal Code.

  "The fact that my discussion may have already been rendered illegal by legislation of the type I was objecting to was precisely the point I had been originally making. When I first made the videos, several articles immediately appeared, penned by lawyers, stating that I was making too much of the dangers posed by federal Bill C-16 and its ilk. However, as far as I am concerned, the letters from the University of Toronto indicated that my concerns were well-founded. Why else warn me that my actions potentially contravened the Ontario Human Rights Code?"

******* I did actually read through yours, it just didn't strike me as particularly unbiased enough for me to trust their analysis, and their refutations all seem weak or disingenuous, as they keep trying to insist that Peterson actually thinks something more reasonable than what he said.

The quoted comment in particular kind of highlights why I feel that way. Peterson is fantastic at saying multiple things in multiple places that each sound reasonable in context but are somewhat contradictory when put side by side, and he does it in that very set of paragraphs. He cannot be calling it just the start of a slippery slope if he is also asserting that his discussion "may have already been rendered illegal." He also has said that his lectures might be labeled a hate crime. There is no call for that sort of implication. It's hyperbolic and just nonsensical, and the only defense he offers is that his university sent him letters expressing concern.

So he trusts his university getting nervous about what he was saying over lawyers telling him he was wrong. There are a dozen reasons why his university may have sent those letters, from being stupid to being overly sensitive to liability to being pressured to appear progressive. The university sending the letters is very weak evidence that his interpretation of the law is correct.

I've heard the term Status Quo Warrior (the polar opposite of SJW and I think it fits). A lot of philosophical stuff (and other areas outside his expertise) he gets outright wrong (and the way he gets it wrong aligns with the alt right view of postmodernism and “cultural Marxism”).

I loved (still love) Bernie Sanders and everything he stands for, and I understand that machine automation and A.I. are going to replace /all the jobs/ over the coming decades and there's no way to make a post-jobs economy work without some sort of "socialism." I was big into #OccupyWallstreet while it was going on. Down with the 1% and all that jazz. That doesn't mean it's possible to fix income inequality by going out in the street and yelling about it, or that it's reasonable to expect the system to be capable of turning on a dime and fixing it overnight. That's the problem with SJWs. They think that if you just scream loudly enough at enough people, you can just make problems go away by beating the opposing side into submission. It's SJWs' fault that the alt-right exists. It's SJWs' fault that Trump got elected.

And it's /great/ that alt-right kids / young adults are listening to JBP. He's center-right, it's wonderful that far-right kids on a path to fully embracing fascism are being drawn closer to a reasonable middle.

I don't agree with his rhetoric about "Marxism," but I do agree that SJWs and identity politics are an insidious force. The right likes to say the SJWs are "far left," but they're not, they're totalitarian and authoritarian and in a lot of meaningful ways they're more conservative in some areas than the alt-right kids. It's terrifying. Generation Z is so effing conservative that even the liberal ones are conservative.

This is the standard conservative party line to dismiss anything younger generations say about the fucked up things the people with power use it for. This was said during the Vietnam protests, and the Iraq War protests, and yes Occupy Wallstreet, and countless other progressive, youth-led movements. It's not new or any more true just because he put an impossible bar to reach in front of it.

And singling out "kids" is not helpful for this. Many of the "kids" being referred to here are in their 20s and 30s, which is an age group which includes some of the smartest and most informed people I know. Yes, most people marching in the streets are not super informed of all the nuances of the issues they're protesting. Occupy Wallstreet in particular was frustrating because of how much it lacked coherent and knowledgeable leadership to make use of everyone's anger.

But if everyone waited for their lives to be perfect before they tried to fight for change, literally no one would fight for change. There is a grain of good advice in "clean your room first," but Peterson does nothing to distinguish that grain or draw any sorts of lines around when it's okay to fight for what you believe in rather than "mind your own business."

I'm sorry, but this is just nonsense. This is what alt-rights people and Trump voters love to say, and it's just ridiculous to believe them without actually examining where things stand and why.

First off, the alt-right has existed in some form for DECADES. American fascism isn't new. White supremacy isn't new. If you honestly think that the SJWs spawned institutions like Breitbart or Stormfront, then I legitimately don't know who you think "the SJWs" refer to, or how long ago you think they coagulated as a define-able mass.

Second, Trump did NOT win because of SJWs. People who already have reason to dislike SJWs keep saying this, and it's utter bullshit. Trump won because ~80,000 people in the Rust belt voted for him. Rural voters in dying manufacturing and coal towns weren't sufficiently placated by Clinton and went with the guy who promised them the moon, despite him showing no way at all for how he would fulfill those promises.

Again: rural, older people voted for Trump. And they largely don't give a shit about SJWs. They don't live near or on colleges. They don't get angry about idiots on Tumblr. They care about jobs and immigrants way more than they care about some man-haters giving feminism a bad name.

I get the dislike of SJWs. I get being frustrated by them as a progressive. But all you're doing by buying into and repeating the alt-right and Trump voters' narrative that SJWs are to blame for their own shitty beliefs and decisions is diverting attention from the actual problems.

I have the question: What would a rational superhero costume look like? For example, a flying brick or spiderman would wear and have climbing/safety harnesses to be able to evacuate/transport people. And most would have backpacks with first aid stuff.

*** I think you could simply post a discussion thread about superhero armor. It would fit the current rules, as it would be discussion of rational decision making in various rational stories posted here.

In regards to your actual question, I think the vast majority of superhero costumes would benefit from additional armor. Unless some aspect of their power makes wearing armor impractical, it's the simplest way to increase survivability and utility. Especially for the glass canon type people, relying on your ability to dodge any incoming attacks is just silly. Most of the time in comics, they just wear spandex. Which, as far as I know, has no appreciable ability to stop knives or bullets.

One of my favorite regularly updating stories is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With this Ring]], where the main character is a Lantern. It's on the lower end of the power scale for DC, but the main character has stated and demonstrated that his base level defenses are capable of blocking tank rounds, and his active defenses are variable but can hold out against orbital bombardment. Despite this, he has spent significant effort making the best power armor available, and at this point is the second most armored Justice League affiliate. The only reason he isn't the first is that he doesn't have any divinely forged protective equipment, and he won't use any equipment that he can't make/repair/maintain himself (i.e. magical materials). He's mentioned that his power armor is essentially a human sized space craft.

I'm more thinking of people like Robin, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Black Widow, or Captain America. They are generally shown to not wear any significant armor, even when armor would be extremely helpful. Maybe Cap's suit is actually some really advanced Kevlar or something, although I kinda doubt it, but Black Canary wears a jacket and fishnets. Their fighting wouldn't be significantly hampered with some additional protection, and as it is they're really vulnerable to knives and bullets.

**** Discussion thread would probably get more replies than weekly thread. But I checked the rules and it sounded like only about written stories. (But I guess the rules are old, and most don't follow them)

You assume that all superheroes would be fighting. (Yeah, probably true.)

But what we need would be some stereotype superheroes type:

[[http://superheroesandvillains.wikia.com/wiki/Types_of_Superheroes][like the first I find with google]]

And then look who would need how much armor. And what kind. Or what else would they have. Like a brick should have at least a taser (like every hero with instakill powers).

A teleporter (depending on limitations) should have at least 3 secure rooms/holding cells to teleport people in (maybe with less pressure/oxygen). And maybe rope, if they need to touch someone.

A gadgeteer should have always tools and some materials like a power source. Better a tank as a mobile workspace if possible.

A mastermind should have as many ways as practical to communicate with the team. Like gps tracking and conference calls with headphones. Bodycams.

Or for example, I would say armor, that is only supposed to block bullets is quite stupid, if you can take tank rounds naked while sleeping. If it also protects from ABC weapons, it would be worth it for a brick/tank. But maybe not, if nobody uses even mace and the armor gets shredded every fight.

But yeah most could use more armor. At least a bulletproof vest would be nice for most. (Also real spandex suits look stupid, no clue what hollywood does.)

Still you would need to look what objectives they have, what they do regulary and how they be more efficient (while still being superhero, cause Rule of cool). For example spiderman could have rope with him. He would save so much web fluid.

Or airlines would paint markers on the airplane where superman should carry them.

I will read the stories, sometime... I will add it to the list :-)

** /(A question at least tangentially related to Roko's basilisk.)/

#+begin_quote
  Companies, whole industries, and governments are either already gathering data on users \ citizens to build psychological profiles, or will start doing so soon enough, when the ones that do so now will prove how useful this approach is for targeted advertisement, voter manipulation, riot prevention and control, etc.

  Among the biggest such entities are facebook and google, and if the recent developments with facebook and CA have made at least some people weary of it, the trust towards google (and that it won't be abusing its capabilities) is still rather high. Though even if google somehow manages to maintain some of its morality code down the line, there's still the possibility that some of its gathered data will get leaked or stolen.

  And given how large a presence google has on the internet (chrome, gmail, google search history, google analytics, etc), this data will be enough to rebuild a virtual copy of an internet user, even if that copy will not be a 100% accurate simulation.

  Besides google and facebook there are also many other companies that specialise on data mining like this, and their data too can be abused --- or stolen\leaked and /then/ abused.
#+end_quote

So what happens 10, 20, 50 years from now, when the technology of creating fake virtual people becomes a regular thing, and when this technology can use mined data to generate simulations of real-life users that, even if imperfect, will still have high resemblance to the originals?

If such a development occurs, there will be no need for a vengeful AI --- people will play the role on their own:

- governments --- targeting as many people as possible, level of simulation quality as high with the available funding (and current point on Moore's diagram) as possible
- advertisers --- targeting as many people as possible, level of simulation quality as high with the available funding as possible
- neo-religions \ neo-religious cults --- targeting only a few people as the minimum, but trying to make the simulations as high quality and accurate as possible. Such religions will have real, self-made “evidence” to back up their afterlife consequences blackmail for influencing believers and non-believers alike.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal][“rolling coalers”]] --- people who don't think simulated minds should have any rights, and are pointedly simulating people on machines available to them to underline that point
- gameplayers, lonely people, etc --- imagine people 50 years from now who want to play a multiplayer game released in 2010s. How many of them will be ready to populate that game with simulated players, if they will have the means for it? Depending on the type of the MP game, the number of targets and the quality of simulations will vary.
- etc, etc

So my question is, doesn't this mean that by our current point in time it should already be an advisable decision to delete all the social media accounts, make backup copies of all past e-mail correspondence and then delete the versions stored on the cloud, and to start taking online privacy much more seriously, [[https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html][Stallman-style?]]

And what other measures would you see worth applying in addition, if this were the case?

--------------

p.s. I don't know if during the period when Roko's basilisk was all the rage, the discussion was revolving mainly around a blackmailing AI or if it was more widespread than that. If if was the latter, and the subject of my comment has already been discussed --- please link to the relevant discussion pages.

The "while imperfect" here is kind of a cop-out. The simulations you could make of someone with 2070 technologies and Facebook access will be "imperfect simulations" in the same sense that tigers in Far Cry are an imperfect simulation of real-life tigers: they look like real ones, but most people wouldn't be especially broken up about torturing and killing them.

If the practices you talk about emerge, they'll be closer to things like burning someone in effigy, or torturing someone's Sims avatar, things people do right now which aren't really tearing the fabric of society apart. I'm not worried.

Do you think that's actually possible? You think deleting facebook and your emails and search history is going to actually remove everything you've done from the internet? You think that even if you succeed in "being forgotten" that it'll make a difference?

It's been a long number of years so I don't remember everything, but around 2012 there were conspiracy theories about a (legitimate, official) government thing called TrapWire where public security cameras were being replaced with facial recognition cameras that could track your movement basically across the entire country. Your face has been seen by at least several of those cameras.

Think of what you're talking about. All the internet activity from all these people who have interacted with you, all the data from security cameras tracking your movement, your purchasing history, your documented residences and education and employment, and you think a sufficiently advanced system with extraordinary computing power couldn't create a 99.99999% perfect simulacrum of 99.9999999999% of all the people to have lived over the past several thousand years by triangulating all the decades of accumulated data? That It couldn't fill in the blank spots ("blank spots" being people who It doesn't even know exist due to a complete lack of data), just based on the way that everything else around that person bounced off of or bent around the "blank spot"?

Isn't that the point of R's B, that in the even farther future It will be even more advanced than sufficiently advanced and have computing power even more extraordinary than extraordinary and be able to triangulate the placement of every individual particle at every point in space/time all the way back to the beginning of existence?

  99.99999% perfect simulacrum... by triangulating all the decades of data?
#+end_quote

No:

1) Human errors on simple tasks - which we might take to be elemental: IE, the basis from which any life action are built - are basically unpredictable by /that human/ immediately before the event, and occur at a rate of about 1% (for broadly interesting classes of actions, IIRC). So it would seem to me that any non-branching/non-stochastic model of a human that does better than 99% is modeling at (at least) a nearly neuron-by-neuron level of detail.

Given that specific neuron changes only weakly effect human output - there's a number of ways to learn something, each of which produce the 1% error at different points, but all which produce the 99% correct signal - this means that you'd have to gather a rather large amount of evidence on any trait you were interested in to produce the model of #1... a data requirement for any trait you care about, not complex position-on-a-spectrum things like extroversion score (which have very limited predictive power for our "nefarious purposes"), but every little thing, like "how did the person encode statement #15 from this 5-minute youtube video?"

I'd expect that people don't write, say, or (probably) leave that much video evidence about their lives. (Consider that a human on traditional English corpuses leaves an entropy of about 1 bit per character. A superintelligence with a "this was written by John" prior, should be able to do much better. (I mean, do you have any idea how often I say "should be able to x y z (punctuation) I mean"?))

This would mean that, since people don't say that much, /the unobserved internal experience of watching/ */youtube videos alone/* - even after you know which ones the person you watched - is sufficient to destroy the accuracy of your model.

2) Constructing a 98% accurate model still requires predicting the existence of each of these very detailed traits with 99% accuracy, requiring 7 bits of information per trait - or about two words at the absolute very least. Most people still don't write that much about their lives.

(Though I bet that most people's internal dialog "says" that much about their life, so an auditory cortex tap would probably be sufficient to get a 98% accurate model, once you fed the data to a superintelligence...)

That's the thing though, I'm not talking about Roko's basilisk, because some of the leaps of logic that the classical thought experiment makes can be rather dubious. They can end up being true, they can end up being false, but whatever the case my intention wasn't to start a debate about Roko's basilisk. It was to consider human agents as the triggers for generation of simulations --- no SAI --- and to consider how the availability of potential information for them can at least be minimised as much as possible.

Infiltrating corporations should be at least a little easier than infiltrating government networks (though, admittedly, governments themselves have been known to carelessly handle personal information as well), and infiltrating companies that specialise on targeted marketing should be easier still.

So I'm not asking about an all-or-nothing solution, but about steps that could be taken to at least prune somewhat the number of /people/ who could get their hands on the data-profiles about your person in the future.
