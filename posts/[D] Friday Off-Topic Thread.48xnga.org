Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

I am usually very frustrated by this sort of thing. I love complex stories, but I hate complicated story-delivery mechanisms. Usually I give up on a piece of fiction if I can't easily figure out basic things like what order I'm supposed to read it in.

*** I just finished watching it last night.

The good news is that it's much better than season three was, which was my big concern. The bad news is that there are a few places where they leave realism behind for a bit in favor of story and drama. The worse news is that they're leaving a lot that won't get resolved until season five.

Taking those in order, and staying as spoiler-free as possible ...

For the most part, it's a return to form as far as scheming, backstabbing, play and counter-play go. This is where House of Cards has always (to me) been best and for the most part they don't get bogged down in the ponderousness that plagued the third season. The moments of people soulfully staring at things are mercifully short and the majority of the character and plot development is done through dialogue and action. This is a vast improvement.

My complaint about realism is mostly about spoilery stuff. I think they /know/ that it's far-fetched, and try to sell it anyway, which is only partially a success. It leads to good moments, but there's a small part of me scratching my head and thinking that this isn't the way the world actually works. I think /stories generally/ tend to be best when they're grounded in some way, and this is true of House of Cards in particular.

The lack of resolution leaves me deeply troubled. My defense of season three was that they were setting up for Frank's downfall in season four and the completion of the series. /House of Cards/ is a tragedy, it takes its cues from Shakespeare in a plethora of ways, and the narrative arrow is pointing in the direction of Frank losing everything that he's built up, having sown the seeds of his own destruction. This is implicit in the metaphor that gives the series its name. Also, it's the general path that the British series followed.

The show seems to be in no hurry to resolve /anything/. The complications keep piling up and the deceptions keep getting layered on top of each other, but this is meaningless until there's some actual resolution. I hate this with a passion. They've already announced that there will be a season five, and my worry is that there will be a season six, then a season seven, and so on until it's no longer profitable and then there's no ending. Even if there /is/ an ending though, building up to a climax has diminishing returns, which I think this show hit somewhere in season three. It's still good television, but it can only leave me with narrative blue balls a limited number of times before I cut my losses.

For longer stuff, writing as I go tends to get me in trouble, so despite not really enjoying it, I do quite a bit of planning prior to actually writing anything. I'm not sure how much fruit this bears though; ask me again in a year or two. Sometimes I'll take a have measure and bang out a chapter before trying to figure out the overall structure.

** Which video games do you prefer to watch /with/ commentary? Which video games do you prefer to watch /without/ commentary?

--------------

In my opinion, video games can be grouped into three broad categories for this purpose:\\
*1.* Too simple to benefit from explanation\\
*2.* Too complex to be explained in real time\\
*3.* Both complex enough to benefit from explanation and simple enough to be explained in real time

/More detail:/\\
*1.* Most platforming games, for example, are pretty simple. The controls are universal--moving and jumping, and maybe some other items such as running/dashing, gliding/hovering, or long-/high-jumping. Anyone who's playing *or watching* a platforming game knows at a glance /exactly/ what actions he wants the on-screen character to execute. There's no need for a commentator to explain what he's doing when the viewer can understand immediately what's going on.\\
*2.* Most fighting games, for example, are pretty complex. The controls for executing a move as simple as an uppercut could be completely different between /The King of Fighters/, /Street Fighter/, and /Super Smash Bros./ A person casually watching a fighting game has no idea what buttons are being pressed by the player, and cares only about watching the on-screen spectacle of the battle, which progresses at a pace too quick for a commentator to explain in a satisfactory fashion. If I'm watching a match of /Under Night In-Birth/, I /might/ be interested in hearing someone explain how one move was an exact counter to another move--but there's never enough time for such a full explanation, so the commentator will instead regress to saying, "Oh! That was a great anti-air DP!" Even if I know what an "anti-air DP" is (a rising attack used to knock a jumping enemy out of the sky), I really don't care about the tactical background of the action if it can't be explained /play by play/, and discussion of such matters only drags me out of immersion in *the spectacle of the battle,* without replacing it with anything as satisfying.\\
*3.* In the middle of this spectrum are games that are simultaneously complex enough to need explanation and slow enough that they can be explained in real time. For example, in a slow-paced game such as /The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth/, there's always enough time for a commentator to explain *in detail* the rationale behind his choices, since those choices are separated by long periods of repetitive combat that doesn't need much explanation beyond a few simple tactics (which are mostly obvious, as in category 1).

***** You can pause at any moment and do pretty much anything while it's paused. The games even encourage this by auto-pausing when a new event comes up. So generally speaking, the games tend to play like they're turn-based, because play divides up into chunks of sitting at a paused screen trying to figure out what to do, and sitting around waiting for things to happen, even if they're not discrete turns.

This doesn't apply to multiplayer though.

You don't need to know which buttons are being pressed to understand that one of the players is spacing his attacks better, or seems to be playing more patiently.

The best Smash commentators talk about the players' playstyles, the general flow of momentum and what a player may need to do more of in terms of ideas, not physical button-pressing.

*** This isn't a memetic hazard, this is a monologue /about/ a memetic hazard, and an anomalous one to be precise. This doesn't need a trigger warning (for what triggers? it doesn't warn you of /anything/) or a caution, because anomalous memetic hazards are only hazards fictionally. Additionally, you don't even give the appropriate context by saying "R's literal B" because probably only a very few will understand that those are abbreviations /and/ then make the jump to 'Roko' and 'Basilisk,' and this has nothing to do with Roko in the first place. The warnings feel so very edgy. Don't use warnings for things that don't need them, it dilutes the warning's usefulness as a signal for /actual danger./

**** It may be a fictional hazard, but it's still a hazard for some. I remember a post by someone mentally unstable having a breakdown after hearing tell of acausal blackmail; since then I've taken the threat of the idea very seriously when speaking publicly. The intent was to warn people like that. What words might better serve that intent? I've made the title explicit, since it doesn't matter anymore.

***** But this is not a hazard in any case. It's a description of a fantastical hazard. This is dangerous in the sense that the story about the fractal basilisk image is dangerous, or that Snow Crash is dangerous. It isn't a memetic hazard, it's /about/ a memetic hazard. And, I repeat, an anomalous one, which is not possible for /entirely different reasons/ than Roko's Basilisk. This is completely unrelated to Roko and has nothing to do with acausal trade!

The idea that we have been in hell all along is a memetic hazard. The idea of hell is a memetic hazard. The idea that [[#s][]] is a memetic hazard. The idea of a literal basilisk that paralyzes people with indecision is a joke.

Your edited warning is even edgier than before.

****** Ah! I understand your objection, now. It is indeed a joke; it's supposed to be funny.

You're viewing the parent's hypothetical scenario as its own case, whereas I've been never stopped associating it with the original RB hypothetical. [[#s][]] What code is that? Rot/n/ didn't decode it.

I'd still prefer to err on the side of being overly cautious, for I think it /can/ trigger someone whose sanity was previously unseated by Roko's Basilisk; and for that, just an explicit title will suffice. Warning removed.

**** Contagious dangerous information - the idea is that knowing it would be bad, but also make you want to tell others. In reality, these might be things like very convincing fallacies, or any effective propaganda. Some stories, usually horror, discuss fictional memetic hazards with more extreme properties - the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/understanding-memetics][SCP Foundation]] has [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/infohazard#pages][several instances of this]].

That is, the one where you lose whenever you think of it.

**** It's a term made up by the /SCP Foundation/ horror wiki. In that setting, there are not only magic books that are dangerous to read and magic music that is dangerous to hear, but also magic ideas that are dangerous to think.

The closest real-life equivalent would probably be a song that you can't get out of your head. Or a conspiracy theory plausible enough that you keep entertaining it for a long time after hearing it but you don't have the time or knowledge base to disprove it. Or an assertion about human nature that confirms your pre-existing biases and lets you ignore people who try to disprove it.

This particular one is a hypothetical future timeline with just enough basis in lesswrongian ideas (simulation arguments and the inevitability of strong AI, specifically) that it sounds plausible to someone used to thinking in those terms - but is sufficiently far from established science-fiction that it's not obviously fictitious.

***** No, there are real memetic hazards - the danger is indirect but no less real. Think eg. anitvaccination memes, and so on.
