I'll probably call this the end of "Book I: The Drauga War" and will start into the next after I finish it. That said, there's still a few more chapters left to wrap up the details, so you'll keep getting drops for at least another month.

(Aside: this should really be Books I-III, since 80,000 - 100,000 words is typical for a novel and I'm closing in on 300,000.)

I do have other things that I'm interested in writing, so there's some question about whether I'll go right into a sequel or take a break for other stuff first. You'll still keep getting weekly drops of SOMETHING, though.

** I don't buy Suze's reason for keeping it secret. People shouldn't expect others to hand them opportunities on a silver platter, especially if it's something they could easily ask for themselves. Being a "servant" has nothing to do with it, if someone who has carte blanche to act with Imperial authority can even be considered a servant.

As a result, her resentment put the entire mission - and by extension the entire world - in danger. Nevermind that it's still stupid for a group with millennia of tactical experience between them, a median IQ and wisdom quotient^{^{TM}} of 200, not to expect a mindscrape when it's their opponent's signature move; once she had that realisation she should have informed the rest so they could all have hidden information from the Icefi's. It was only by the dumb luck of Neklos not bothering to perform the free action to capture Suze's soul like he had done with every other soul in the party that the mission wasn't a total failure.

However, the author has a history of plans within plans within plans. [[http://predictionbook.com/predictions/43636][My guess is]] that this is still not the innermost layer of the onion and Suze had more legitimate reasons for her actions. Besides, my tropey sense is tingling, saying the Goddess of Secrets still has to do something important to justify her existence in the narrative, so we can't be at the end yet and there are still secrets left to uncover.

******* Without prestige classes, feats, and alternate systems there actually wasnt much to go through once I got a chance to work on the build.

It may have been said, but I couldnt remember if Suze was NG or LG. I went with LG. I assumed her starting stats were the elite array except for an 18 int. Distributed as: str 8, dex 10, con 12, int 18, wis 14, cha 13.

The build:

#+begin_example
  Suze (no items)        
  Commoner 1/wizard 20/archivist 20/knight 20/factotum 20/scout 18/paladin 3/dragon shaman 1/dragonfire adept 1/marshal 1/ninja 1/
  spellthief 1/spirit shaman 1/swashbuckler 1/sorcerer 1/ranger 1/beguiler 1/duskblade 1/favored soul 1/healer 1/warmage 1/monk 1/
  fighter 1/cleric 2
  1516HP, BAB+76, Init+21, Fort+69, Ref+59, Will+83
  Str 14, Dex 28, Con 20, Int 34, Wis 20, Cha 18    
#+end_example

I pretty much ran out of classes to take.

Flavor-wise: Knight/paladin seemed weird at first, but fit Suze more and more the longer I thought about it. She wants to be recognized and respected, which is literally what knights fight for by the class fluff. Paladins fight for a cause but are recognized and respected for it and it is a natural extension of the knight. As for Ninja, while it doesnt fit in with the setting Suze's ninja-like stealth cannot be ignored. The class is also from complete adventurer so it isnt actually from a different campaign setting and can be taken in vanilla greyhawk type d&d silly-ly enough.

Mechanics-wise:Commoner level is simply because thats what she had when she went into the flea. Only way to get rid of it is with rebuilding and she hasnt had time for a rebuilding quest.

Wizard/Archivist is pretty much 95% of the builds power. From everything Jake has done I think it is safe to assume Suze realizes that combat is a game of rocket tag. Having more spells/day from other classes really doesnt help when you have 1 standard action and combat ends on turn 1. Being lawful, Suze cant be a bard so wizard/archivist has every possible spell she can get. Most noncasting classes do not have any features that compare to spellcasting and are thus useless.

Knight is a normally crap class with two amazing high level abilities. Impetuous endurance means Suze doesnt fail a save on a natural 1 and that is IP-proofing gold. Loyal Beyond Death lets Suze ignore dying due to hp damage for a round for every daily use of knight's challenge she expends. You could drop an anti-osmium mountain on her and she would live through it. Sadly doesnt help against disintegrate and the like though.

I already mentioned Factotum before. Int to initiative, bypassing sr/dr, temporarily gaining other 15th level classes (ex) features, gaining more standard actions, etc. Stuff that augments Suze's existing abilities.

Scout 18 gets (ex) freedom of movement. Enough said.

Paladin is for cha to saves, disease immunity, and fear immunity because why not. Re-reading your rules, I noticed you said paladin's lose class features if they ever take levels of "thief or assassin" . I was excited to take levels of rogue for a second until I noticed you also renamed rogue into thief, but at least factotum still isnt a thief :)

The rest of the classes are there just for their +2 save bonuses at 1st level and an extra cleric level to fill space. Nothing really impressed me out of all those classes. spells>melee combat, better saves>more spells/day off lists Suze already has. Honestly, those levels can be replaced with anything: the end result is more or less the same.

I thought about monk 11 for poison immunity or dragon shaman 4/9 for sleep&paralysis immunity/1 energy immunity, but ultimately Id rather have base saves over something I can easily get in item form. If saves come up you are probably already dead, but might as well try for a fighting chance.

I havent even started to look at items yet. Im pretty sure the answer to what items Id take in Suze's position is "yes". With lots and lots of scrolls/wands to have all spells "prepared" at all times.

******** Not going to pretend this is properly optimized or even complete, just what I got before I called it quits. Ive more or less just gone through bunko's and the ol' list of necessary magic items to pick some crap out. I assume Suze went through the big list of magic items Jake asked for way back and that combining two magic items is fair at level 120. MIC has rules for adding on common effects to certain slots for no penalty, so I also did that.

#+begin_example
  head (cowl of warding+headband of conscious effort+6cha) 
  face (hathran mask of true seeing+third eye clarity+6 int)
  throat (hand of glory+amulet of second chances+6 wis) 
  shoulders (starmantle cloak+minor cloak of displacement+5 def to ac) 
  body (+1 soulfire, proof against transmutation, glamered, deep robes+robe of eyes+5 nat armor) 
  torso (shirt of wraith stalking+custom-continuous foresight+5 resistance to saves) 
  arms (bracers of armor +8 heavy fortification+something+6 str)
  hands (something+something)
  waist (belt of battle+custom-continuous haste+6 con)
  feet (boots of temporal acceleration+sandals of the vagabond+6 dex) 
  ring1 (ring of sustenance+ring of anticipation) 
  ring2 (universal energy immunity+nine lives)
  ring3 (ring of fly+something)
  slotless-all of them. Fill a quiver of ehlonna with 60 wands, fill a handy haversack with pearls of power, etc. 
  Custom item of at-will prestidigitation and mage hand is mandatory of course.
#+end_example

AEG has rules for adding special abilites on bracers of armor. Make the base item for the arm slot a wand bracer from dungeonscape for nonmagical swift action wand retrieval. Also makes for good party trick.

As for custom items I would improve an item I have always hated, the infinite scrollcase. Despite its name, it only holds 50 scrolls. So give it the storage space of a handy haversack to hold a few thousand scrolls, then toss in wish every round to create a scroll of a spell the user knows but is not already in the scrollcase. Now thats an infinite scrollcase worthy of the name (bonus effect: spells/day are now irrelevant).

Gods are immune to "effects that...banish them" My interpretation of this is that you can't move them around with mortal magic -- you can /ask/ them to show up, but you can't /force/ them.

But, if you don't like that reasoning, try this:

As a greater god, Neklos has spell resistance 32 + divine rank (20) = 52. In order to move him with a Wish, you need to make a caster check to beat his spell resistance; unless you're level 32 in that class(*), you can't possibly do it. (Note that you can't take 20 on the check, since you have to pay a cost to use Wish.) Because of this, no one who hasn't gone through the FLEA is going to be able to Wish him out of the hole. (Some of the Lich Kings might be an exception, but even they aren't going to have a great chance.)

Now, Neklos could lower his spell resistance to make this straightforward but that takes a standard action and he's currently trapped in a non-magical Temporal Stasis. (He is immune to the magical version, but not to simple physics-based time dilation, just as he wouldn't be immune to the Flowing Time trait of a plane, if I were allowing those to exist.)

tl;dr -- He can't be Wished out of the hole because he's a god and gods are immune to that. Even if that /weren't/ the case, it wouldn't be practical for any caster who actually exists.

(*) From the SRD: "To make a caster level check, roll 1d20 and add your caster level (in the relevant class)" So, if you're Wizard20/Sorceror20, you only get to use 20 as your caster level.

Of course, he can just PAO into a non-undead, drop levels with a negative-level-fail-save trick and go from there.

To the extent that she's angry with him, it's because he's treating her with the same type of thoughtlessness that all the other nobles do...but in his case he's always treated her well and she actually likes him, so that moderates the situation a lot.

Suppose you create the singularity 10m above you. (Above is so that it's equidistant from the gods surrounding you, which probably does not matter but is conveniently symmetrical.) You have 3.33x10^{-8} seconds to live, your time. How much time passes on the outside is a function of the mass of the singularity.../and you can make up a number as big as you need it to be/.

********* Do they know that there is another habitable planet? It'd suck if they got teleported to the same planet, or some place where the strong nuclear force is 3% stronger.

Also, can you do both a Wish and a black hole simultaneously with both taking zero time?

Oh, and what if one of the gods has a Readied Action for if a mortal tries casting? Would that allow them to do something in zero time and escape? (I knew a thing! Thanks SirPoley!)

********** The Summoning ritual used by Flobovia to find their rulers makes it clear that there are multiple versions of the Prime Material out there. (This used to be part of D&D cosmology. Not sure if it is still canon, but it is for 2YE.) The operating assumption is that this is a Copenhagen model of QM, so the number of Prime Material variants is effectively infinite, and each universe is the size of our own. In total, this means that there is an infinite number of planets, some percentage of which are habitable. Therefore, there are an infinite number of habitable planets.

Wish can transport you anywhere on any plane, so all of these worlds are reachable.

Yes, you can do both a Wish and a black hole with zero time between them. You just do what Suze did: use readied actions. In her case she used a Celerity spell to give herself a readied action after already taking an action; that works, but you could also just have two people cooperating. Better yet, you can REALLY go nuts: two people are cooperating. Each has both a readied action and a Celerity which gives them ANOTHER readied action! Anyway, yes: you cast the Wish then, using a readied action, you cast the PAO:X-to-singularity. The PAO resolves first and then zero time later the Wish resolves and transports you out of there. (If you do it the other way around then the Wish resolves first, so your PAO resolves at your new location and you die.)

Now, could the gods interfere with this? You betcha.

There are roughly 50 gods here. Each of them can have a readied action and a Celerity-caused readied action. They can also have a Contigency which gives them another another Celerity, meaning they effectively have three readied actions prepared.

Let's assume, provided they have a chance to act:

- All of the gods have the power to stop a mortal from casting one way or another
- All of the gods have the power to escape from a just-formed singularity
- The gods are working together to make sure they all survive.

In this case the actions of the gods form one long chain with the first god (Al) readying three actions with the trigger "If a mortal starts casting, I smite him". The second god (Bob) readies his three actions with the trigger "If a mortal starts casting and Al doesn't smite him, I smite him" and so on. There are effectively 150 actions stacked up in front of you, and you need to go before all of them. The only way to do that is to declare your action after all of them...but the only way to make all of them TAKE their actions is to make sure that each of them fails in turn, so you have to have more than 150 actions stacked up yourself.

Long story short, you'd need to have way more mortals than gods before the gods wouldn't be able to shut you down.

A black hole of a billion solar masses would be 39.5 AU in radius (if Universe Sandbox is reliable about black hole radiuses, which I sincerely doubt) and would most definitely eat the solar system regardless of size. The milky way is only a thousand times that size.

** Hmm, if I was mindscraping people I would always do it before and after disjunction since people are highly likely to be going to be using magic on their thoughts.

Now, if no one else thought they were going to get mindscraped then why did Suze of all people predict it to use Programmed Amnesia?

I'm surprised the Gods teleported to him instead of teleporting him to them, seems awful uh, ungodlike I suppose, though it's not clear I suspect if he had teleported it a note would be made.

They knew they would get Mindscraped. They chose to not protect it because they had nothing to hide -- the whole POINT was that they were there to help Afi, so it was in his best interest to work with them.

***** There is a subtle implication there that perhaps not all salient divine abilities (the ones which particularly target 'mortals' for example) work on Jake.

This may be because of his status as an Outside Context Problem.

Some powers obviously still work, and anything which creates a true magical effect or a gross physical effect obviously does (see - painful death and time regression resurrection).

Sure, singular, there's never been a reason for them not to be the one to teleport to him, though I am also of the position that it was ungodlike when he was being given into trouble.

A hall of God judgement is just the kind of place Gods would have, and summon mortals there to feel very Godly and dious, them teleporting to him all the time feels like he's in charge u get me

** I'm not sure I get how the whole God Portfolio Sense thing works. Herrun seems to be implied to be constantly aware of everyone's secrets - she's aware of secret knowledge only discovered or posited after her formation since it was pointed out that scheming against her is difficult since trying to keep your scheming secret makes it known to her.

Since Neklos's portfolio is death, and the protagonists take pains to avoid a plan that actually kills him, it seems to be implied that he is aware at least of anything that could lead to his own death, and in conjunction with the way Herrun's Portfolio-Sense works, I'd hazard a guess that he's able to sense every death before it happens.

Shouldn't Suze's use of the anti-osmium to kill everyone he had Soul Trapped tipped him off that something was about to happen and prevent the surprise round? Even if Neklos' sense doesn't quite extend to literally every potential death, it seems contrived that his sense would give him foreknowledge of his own death, but not the imminent death of a dozen souls he had under his personal control at the moment.
