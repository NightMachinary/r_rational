I've been chewing on this one for a long time.

Brain-reading is a technological reality with a number of extant applications, but brains are a relatively uniform hunk of hardware. Most brain development happens in the womb, and most of its structures are evolutionarily ancient. /Minds/, the iterative clumps of memory we call "you" and "I", are individually constructed on a moment by moment basis over the course of our lives.

We may both have comperable things in mind when we think of Idaho or Ronald McDonald, but the architecture of those concepts and the paths our neural impulses make to recall them are certain to be almost completely unique. Layers upon layers of cross-reference have gone into establishing complex referents like those.

Even if I could discern every brain impulse, and separate out the only the mindiest portion, the challenge would be less like someone who speaks only English translating Basque into German, and more like somebody raised by wolves translating Basque into Dolphin.

Is there an obvious solution I'm missing, or is a rational mind-reader stuck cold-reading off of autonomic, sensory, and emotional impulses?

Any fiction recommendations that wrestle with this topic?


** When I hear questions like this on computer forums, usually my first response is "Step back. What are you trying to achieve?"

If you're trying to write a rational story in which a character has a mindreading ability, you don't need to know the details, you just need to create a setting where there is a plausible explanation. Every story is allowed one Suspension of Disbelief token--but /only/ one[1]--that it gets to spend on its main premise. Any of these would work:

- Scientists have spent fifty years building up a database of brainscans of everyone on the planet in realtime as they aged and then supercomputers did frequency and traffic analysis in order to determine correlations so as a result we can read thought-images in real time, although we can't read memories.
- An alien crashlanded on Earth. His Universal Translator is damaged but semi-functional, and....
- We have this person who has this ability. We don't know how it works but it very clearly does.\\

*** Absolutely, but what makes world design in science fiction fun for me is figuring out the nuts and bolts of how such SoD tokens work. Having the mechanism mapped not only provides the quirks and limitations that keep a story interesting, it can also lead directly to plot points and possibilities I would have never even imagined if I just leaned back and said "A wizard did it".

That's what I'm trying to achieve: Inspiration via conceptual understanding.

*** I generally agree, but thinking about these things can be good for adding in some details to sell your premise. If you have a form of mind-reading that works on "surface thoughts", and you have some relevant scientific literature to back it up, you can describe exactly what different modes of thinking "look like" to your protagonist.

(Much in the same way that you can "sell" New York City a lot easier than you can sell a fantasy city, because you can just look at New York City and borrow some images that you see there rather than having to make things up.)

***** hmm. that sounds plausible, but must a human mind-reader go through the whole "neuron->waveform" rigamarole? it seems to me that in this sense we can model a brain as a sort of advanced black-box encryption mechanism, and with an audio output that's a big problem. however, if what you want isn't unencrypted in the first place -- if you're perceiving a pattern of neurons firing /anyway/ -- can't you cut out the middle man? couldn't a mind-reader just superimpose whatever relevant patterns the subject is experiencing over their /own/ brain?

****** That only works if the mind-reader's brain is similar enough that a) it can support the same pattern, and b) they translate to (roughly) the same subjective experiences. Also, I'd argue that mind-reading is a lot more practical if it doesn't just consist of replacing (parts of) your mind with theirs.

** If I were trying to create a mind-reader without breaking neuroscience too badly, I'd have their ability tap into the "area" theorized to be the internal/self monitor, responsible for metacognition. I say "area" because, as far as I know, this is one of our higher cognitive functions, intimately tied to consciousness, and at this point, very poorly understood (i.e. it's somewhere in the prefrontal cortex, probably)- which leaves it more open to your fictional fiddling and interpretation than, say the visual cortex or other parts of the 'animal' brain. You could, for example, claim that it not only receives input from the senses and listens in on the internal monologue, but maybe when memories are recalled they are presented before the monitor. And maybe because the monitor's 'job' is to take all of these neurochemical inputs and observe and understand what they are in the mind it is /in/, it might do the same job for the mind-reader, whose special, extra listening power connects their monitor to others'.

** I suspect that a form of frequency analysis might give a degree of accuracy. Looking at a snapshot of someone's mindstate may not be of use, but monitoring it over months or years as they are subject to various inputs and deliver outputs could allow some solid guesses as to what a mind is perceiving or even contemplating.

It might even be possible to read off an image that the mind is specifically concentrating on, if it activates a suitable number of neurons in the visual cortex.

** Why are you modeling mind reading as reading the electrical\chemical structure of neurons in the brain firing?

Thats like trying to figure out the password stored in ram from a computer by reading EM radiation\heat coming out of it when it's running, sure it might be possible, but its overly complex for no reason, you could just freeze the ram stick and connect it to another computer, as long as it has similar design there's a pretty good chance it will be able to read the content, even if one ran on linux and the other was running windows..

You could imagine it more like an actual neural link between the person doing the mind reading and the person being read. Or lets say a copy of the neurons of the person being read being connected to the mind of the reader, obviously neurons can communicate with each other, so i wouldn't really say that it is stretching it too far to assume that if such a neural connection was made the reader will be able to read the state.

**** Read what i said more carefully. I did not say its not possible(btw the ram as opposed to the screen is significantly less em active..) But instead i said that it is overly complex, and that there are easier ways to get the same result.

Also regarding the "credible threat" you mentioned, a quote regarding tempest attacks from the top reault on google: "However it's painfully hard and extremely expensive to successfully complete such an attack".

I.e. for most points and purposes setting up a successful tempest attack is more expensive then the data you will get with it

Anyhow the attack i was thanking about while writing the example was [[http://www.tau.ac.il/%7Etromer/acoustic/][http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/]] if you are interested.

** There's always evolution. There are some truly bizarre evolutionary pathways creatures have taken. If your 'suspension of disbelief' token is that Neanderthals were able to read each other's minds (They did have a different brain configuration), and humans were able to cross breed with them (Which is true), then, well, in the right circumstances, the trait for mind reading might breed true in humans even to this date if the right genetics were passed.

** There is apparently some hardware that allows thought transference between brains [[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/scientists-transmit-thoughts-brain/story?id=25319813][here]].

Apparently the words thought in one brain as a command translate in a feeling or urge in the recipient, bypassing the need to translate. I guess in effect the brain is translating for you, crudely. A Harvard team in the article did transmit specific words.

Theoretically, a mind-reading mechanism would need to pick up the EEG from the recipient somehow. You may need to handwave this with a powerful signal that is currently undetectable or is the result of a some future development. In addition, your theoretical telepath would need some biological or mechanical apparatus to pick up signals, as well as enough experience to unravel the thoughts of various people (which is achievable through training). Perhaps the theoretical telepath would need to spend more time around people learning to interpret their thought patterns or adjusting her receiver.

*** It looks like both sender /and/ receiver had to be trained, both to send and to detect specific signals. The creation of a telepathic language is a fine use of the tech, but I don't think this discovery says anything about whether either senders or receivers would be able to process much usable data alone.

** What about test patterns? Like, a telepath broadcasts a certain signal into the target's brain, analyzes the resulting pattern, and when they can predict the result, uses that as a method of backtracking signals, or even just pinging words and images off various regions and interpreting the associations. Not quite quite mind-readin, but enough for surface reading and figuring out that "Johnny" brings up memories of hatred, guilt, blood, anticipation, and regret.

#+begin_quote
  *Waterbed theory* is the observation, ascribed to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall][Larry Wall]], that some systems, such as human and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][computer]] languages, contain a minimum amount of complexity, and that attempting to "push down" the complexity of such a system in one place will invariably cause complexity to "pop up" elsewhere. This behavior is likened to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterbed][waterbed]] mattress which contains a certain amount of water; it is possible to push down the mattress in one place, but the displaced water will always cause the mattress to rise elsewhere, because water does not [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)][compress]]. It is impossible to push down the waterbed everywhere at once, because the volume of the water remains a constant.
