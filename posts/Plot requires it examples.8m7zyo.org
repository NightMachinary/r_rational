I'm trying to figure out "plot requires it" situations in novels/webnovels I've read, and I am wondering if it is something like '...it's the n^{th} eon since x has happened and our lucky MC has luckily arrived in time to luckily participate in this fortuitous event that may cause him to rise into infinity and not smell stinky like everyone else.' Is that an example?


** People stumbling onto each other/plot relevant situations while traveling through wilderness or while lost. Sometimes it's okay at the start of a story, if it's the coincidence that sets the plot in motion, but often times it's just a way to move the story along despite the improbability reaching absurd heights.

For example, you could write something Cthulutech-ish where the main character(s) routinely stop numerous world ending events, like anti-matter munitions, daemon summoning, deep one land invasions, and chicken shortages at Popeyes. It's not that the world is set up for them to save it, but rather that it needs saving a lot and it makes more sense to hire experienced people who have done it one (or more then once) already.

**** Hmm, the issue with that type of story would be that it could easily run afoul of [[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law of Magic]], because the reader can't reasonably understand what the character can and can't do. So any plot problems that get solved with the power come across as a Deus Ex Machina.

Though you can still tell stories about this type of character, but you just have to focus on different aspects. Like how the character handles the freedom of consequences his power likely grants him.

And it looked like pretty much the power to nudge /coincidences/ - that is, if Person A and Person B both planned on arriving at the same town, then this power could be used to ensure that they did so at the same time (and thus met on the docks).

** Was it really in character for Darth Vader to simply allow Luke and co. to pass through the shield around Endor, instead of, say, having them surrounded and seized by the many Imperial craft that were certainly in the vicinity?

How about Sauron having /not a single orc/ guarding his private volcano where he forged the One Ring? Or the fact that, despite being literally a giant flaming eyeball, he never noticed intruders carrying that ring into his domain - for weeks - until it was too late?

Why did Lord Voldemort stage dramatic confrontations with Harry Potter, but never anyone else? Eg Quirrell allowing Harry enough freedom to fight back or run, Diary!Riddle sending the Basilisk after Harry /while holding Harry's wand and not using it/, resurrected Voldemort allowing Harry to be untied from the gravestone and get a fair fight? Sure, he started to get over that tendency as Harry made him more frustrated, but we never see or hear of him even offering it to anyone else. And why, when captured at Malfoy Manor, were Harry and Hermione simply disarmed and locked up, instead of, say, being /literally/ disarmed? Broken bones are easy for a magical healer to treat, but very difficult for a prisoner to work around.

***** Tongue removal is not even that debilitating under default canon. It's a problem not because people are unable to do it, but because there is little training in it. Using magic non-verbally and wandlessly is clearly possible (see "accidental magic"), but people don't make a conscious effort to learn how to control magic in that way. It could also be theoretically possible for the pain of being violently disabled to be enough to induce an outburst of accidental magic to the detriment of the captors, and so it is avoided unless absolutely necessary.

** Let's take a wade through everyone's favourite redheaded stepchild, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'll stick to Phase I.

/Iron Man/:

- Okay, they set up a good reason why Stark might have a spare Arc Reactor downstairs, but it just happens to be in a place that he has /just barely enough/ energy to reach when the plot demands it.
- Pepper's appointment with Agent Coulson just happens to be scheduled at the exact moment where she's fleeing Stark Industries with the incriminating data.
- Tony's spare reactor has just enough power to escape Stane for /just long enough/ to reach freezing altitude.

/The Incredible Hulk/:

- The window Banner drops down in front of while escaping in Brazil just happens to be the cute girl from work, not one of the thugs harassing her.
- Betty decides to go for pizza (implied to be a rare event) when Banner is in the pizza shop.

/Iron Man 2/:

- Hammer is at the race when Stark is attacked by Venko
- Not only does the new element Stark uses to power the Arc reactor /not/ have the toxic effects of palladium, it instantly cures them.
- They get all the information they need to figure out that Venko is going to attack /just/ in time for Tony to arrive at the very end of Hammer's presentation.
- The timed detonator on the Venkobots give Tony /just/ enough time to rescue Pepper.

/Thor/:

- It kind of makes sense why Jane was in the perfect place to run Thor over the /first/ time: she was investigating the Bifrost, even though she didn't know it. Running over him the /second/ time, on the other hand, is much too contrived.
- Jane's notebook is in a place where it can be easily grabbed by Thor on his way out of the compound
- Heimdall thaws at exactly the right time to bring Thor back to Asgard to stop Loki

/Captain America: The First Avenger/:

- The regiment that Cap goes overseas to perform for is the same one Bucky, his childhood friend, is attached to, and Agent Carter, the Colonel, and Stark are all present there too.
- Bucky is both the one who is /currently/ being experimented on when Cap arrives to free him, and the one for whom the experimentation /worked/.
- The Howling Commandos from the Captain America propaganda films look /exactly like/ the Howling Commandos that he rescues along with Bucky.
- The /one/ time Cap gets kissed by a girl, Agent Carter is there to get jealous.
- Somehow, all the world's known vibranium has been made into a prototype shield, that is lying nearby when Cap needs a new shield.
- The delays of blowing up all those factories work out so perfectly that they arrive /just in time/ to intercept the plane being launched.

/Marvel's The Avengers/:

- The one character personally killed by Loki on the Helicarrier is the one with a personal connection to each of the Avengers.
- Tony has his next prototype armour (the Mark VII) in the final stages of development just as he goes to confront Loki in Stark tower wearing a barely-functional Mark VI.
- Loki's Sceptre, being actively used throughout the Battle of Manhattan, which is the only thing that can stop the Tesseract, is dropped atop Stark Tower, right next to the Tesseract.
- The Mark VII has /just enough power/ to take the nuke through the Wormhole, and then fails immediately afterwards.

...That's just off the top of my head, and that's just /Phase I/.

I wouldn't describe your "rise into infinity" scenario as being a "plot requires it" so much as something similar to the anthropic principle: if your MC wasn't the one to participate in the fortuitous event and become awesome, then someone else would, and the story would be about /them/ instead. If it happens /multiple/ times to the same MC, then yeah (e.g. Harry Potter, who has already defeated Voldemort twice and cemented MC status, is in the right position to attend the Triwizard tournament and the Quidditch World Cup, both happening in Britain for the first time in ages).

"Plot requires it" events are generally more like the MCU examples. It's not that there's a Chekov's Gun for the MC to use, but that the MC gets thrown by a "random" explosion so that they're lying /right next/ to the Gun.

**** Again, though, if the MC "just happens" to walk by the event that makes them become awesome, that's less "the plot demands it" and "that's why this character is the MC." For instance, take /Charlie and the Chocolate Factory./ Charlie didn't win ownership of the factory because he was a paragon of virtue, he won because every other child was a the kind of horrible person who pestered their parents to buy enough chocolate so that they couldn't help but find a ticket. Any average child would probably have done well enough to outmatch the spoiled brats on the tour: Charlie was just the one who found the candy bar first, and thus became the MC. If he hadn't, someone else (probably equally poor, given the neighbourhood) would have, and the story would have been "Caroline and the Chocolate Factory."

** If it happens once, then it depends. A farm boy becoming a hero is not in itself an instance of "plot requires it", because stories are subject to survivorship bias. Think of it from an in-universe writer's perspective. Obviously, someone has to be successful. Once someone has risen from rags to riches, the writer traces history back to his humble origins, and it looks improbable until we remember that there were millions of /other/ farm boys that died unknown and unsung.

But if your farm boy starts on a journey and /at the end/ of it discovers that he is of noble origin then it's it. (One notable exception is the self-fulfilling prophecy thingie)

Luke in /Star Wars/, on the other hand... of all the moisture farmers on Tattooine, what are the odds that a message from Princess Leia ends up in the hands of Luke Skywalker, son of a Jedi?

**** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera][Threepenny opera]] by Brecht & Weill. I was referring to the scene when the mounted messenger arrives to pardon Mack the Knife, and he also gets ennobled, oh and also a castle, oh and also a yearly rent, by decree of the king (a pony was not explicitly included). The scene is so over the top that you get the sense that he really gets executed and you are watching a bad fix-fic. And the song of the messenger is quite funny at that.

In the original German version, there even is an announcer in the theatre who explains that Mack now needs to get saved because people pay more for happy endings, since they don't get them in real life. I don't know whether this got cut for the broadway version.

This is how I felt when reading the end of crime & punishment. The first arcs were brilliant, but the ending left me very dissatisfied; not over-the-top enough to fully break suspension of disbelief, instead stranded in the uncanny valley of "the plot/morale required it".

PS. If this fourth-wall breaking sounds cliche, it is because Brecht kinda pioneered its use in that way, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_theatre][here]] for why Mack actually must get saved (Brecht was pretty transparent about his style). Maybe I read Dostojewsky too literally, and the "Entfremdungseffekt" was intended; but it somehow did not sit right with me.

For all that ninjas are awesome, there are some things that don't even make sense. Particularly, the massive idiot ball that allowed Kaguya and 'The Ultimate Mastermind' Black Zetsu to be sealed again...

I mean. What in the world was Black Zetsu thinking not learning every single technique he could in all those years???!

...and his apparent genius was so overrated. Even moreso than the Fourth Hokage. Why didn't he advise Kaguya to BFR each and every remaining member of the last team or simply use whatever means to kill off Obito (or Kakashi, in case he really had adapted to use Kamui without Sharingan eyes just like Madara was skilled enough to use Susanoo without having special eyes...)

1. Kill Teleporters.
2. BFR Sasuke and Naruto into different dimensions and kill Kakashi and Sakura. (Or use them as bait for step 2.)
3. Let them starve.
