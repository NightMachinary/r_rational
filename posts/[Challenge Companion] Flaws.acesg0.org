*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/acernf/biweekly_challenge_flaws/?][weekly challenge]]. Post ideas, comments, recommendations, or general chit-chat here.*

Special note: the next challenge, *Endings*, will be the final challenge.


** I'm sad to hear these are ending, as I still haven't worked up the courage to enter any, and I think some really great short stories have come out of it (including the last winner). It may make sense to edit out the “add a prompt” section in the main post, on another note.

*** I'm sad about this too. I entered two of these, but I could have entered more; I just took it for granted that I'd have other opportunities, every single time.

I'm going to enter this one and the next one. I hope you do too :)

** u/LupoCani:
#+begin_quote
  It's a more open-ended one, but the kernel of the idea comes from looking at corner cases where systems tend to fail, or the way that we attempt to fix aspects of ourselves that are broken, or the ways in which simulations sometimes don't map to reality. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.
#+end_quote

Typo, that last sentence is repeated.
