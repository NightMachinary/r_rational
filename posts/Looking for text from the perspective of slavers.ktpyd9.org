TLDR: I want to write a setting with slavery, with moral rationalists which condone this. I can't seem to understand how someone could, but know its possible due to history. Maybe reading some fiction/nonfiction from this perspective can help me understand it better?

Full version:

I want to write a Pokémon FF, where Pokémon are treated closer to how they are in the Anime but am having trouble getting into the mindset of benevolent slavery being treated as normal.

For the world: Pokémon have different levels of intelligence, but most are smart enough to communicate with each other (In my world, Pokémon are not normal animals from earth, and part of their "magic" is an auto-translator. Which humans don't have hence the one-way communication)

After recently reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38240/realm-of-monsters][Realm of Monsters]] it made me realize that cultures existed where slavery was considered normal and justified even for superficial reasons (such as in America due to skin color) and the fact that Pokémon apparently can't communicate with humans, and are completely different species, would seem to make a culture like this much easier to arise, so it seems like a setting like this *must* be possible to make rational.

The issue is, I am having trouble thinking how characters such as Prof. Oak and all the other well intentioned characters would not even consider the moral gray-ness of just the attitude of expecting Pokémon to "belong" to an individual and all that entails. Even if Pokémon are viewed more like family than property and have their own rights and freedoms (like if a Pokémon wants to leave a trainer, by law the trainer cannot force it to fight for him/her) and even if due to Pokémon biology magic, "trainers" are strictly beneficial in 90% of cases, I still find it hard to get into the mindset of a Moral Rationalist who does not see an issue with Pokémon effectively being a different societal class.

So to solve this, I thought to ask if anyone knows any works of fiction or non-fiction from the perspective of people who treat slavery as normal and justified, specially if it talks about this issue specifically. Also any suggestions directly regarding my dilemma are appreciated as well of course.

Thanks.

Start by thinking of the people you enslave as not only ignorant but stupid and incapable of improving. Like pets or beasts of burden, you are restricting their freedom for their own good; they have safer, more comfortable lives working for you than they would if they were free to make their own mistakes.

Their complaints about the situation are like those of children; they don't, can't, know better. It's noblesse oblige; it's your responsibility, as their betters, to take charge of them.

Moral, rationalist and posessing an accurate theory of mind: if you want a character who is a slaver you can have two of these, but not all three.

You have this reaction because you can pattern-match this to a variety of known bad things, but without that it takes significant work to reason one's way out of the status quo from zero, as demonstrated by actual history. Few get there, though some do.

Perhaps you can make your story about that?

[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0851HYMXV][This]] has a reasonably charitable discussion of slavery, fwiw.

This stuff really isn't that far in the past. Certainly not far enough back that one can relax the fight against it, especially in the present political climate. I've had acquaintances literally defend the british empire to me as being a net good for the development of the countries it managed.

I mean I don't think it is likely at all that Australia would become as good a country as it is now without the British empire. Does not mean what they did to the Aboriginals is morally good though; and this is I think the exact issue I feel in the setting I am trying to write. In this world, the semi-slavery of Pokémon is a net good for them, but it doesn't change that the same good can be achieved *without* the assumed ownership part, and I can't seem to get into the mindset that these two are not separated: In the British empire example: The empire could have done everything positive they did in Australia without all the heinous things they did to the natives, If you want to go to the extreme, they could have respected land rights and ownership even and still brought technology and population to Australia. What I can't seem to do is get into the mindset of someone who thinks this colonization is a net good AND thinks that treating the natives like anything less than humans is also justified.

It could have. But would it have? The empire is not a charity. The massive profit that comes from plundering a country and exploiting the natives is the thing that drives the rest of its actions. People tell themselves stories in which they can paint themselves as heroes, but the good effects are side effects - the driving force is the profit motive. Without that, only the truly altruistic act, which is a much smaller group, with no significant funding or backing, where it is an organised group at all. Again, none of this is even very far in the past; indeed, it is still happening in parts of the world right now, and some products on your supermarket shelves are made through arguably unfair exploitation.

(This is also a huge problem with stories set in space that are trying to tell some version of the war of independence: if the expectation is for colonies to rebel, colonisation will slow to a crawl or stop entirely. Who would fund it? There will be no return on the investment. Unless you come up with a way to solve that problem you can't - rationally - tell that story.)

This seems to be premised on the idea that an institution powered purely by goodwill can exert as much influence on the world as an institution fueled by some form of extraction.

The empire is made up of people with varied and conflicting motivations. The promise of treasure can mostly align them toward some action. The aspiration to do good will move fewer. They need to put food on the table somehow.

An organization that aspires to do good (or do anything, really) needs resources to fuel it. These can come from donations by people who believe in its mission, concessions from people who benefit from its actions, or extraction from people or things it has power over. There is giant area of ambiguity between the second source and the third one.

**** Are you actively morally opposed to how people treat(ed) work animals? Horses, dogs? Slavery is the same thing, except applied to persons. So your answer is clearly that the slavers need to have a reasonably accurate theory of mind of the enslaved, but one that does not grant them personhood in their view. You want the reader to see the enslaved as persons (otherwise they won't see slavery), but not the characters.

As such you need the enslaved to actually be somewhere at the edge of personhood, or their personhood needs to be subtle / not expressed externally much. I think that was a theme in one of the Ender books? (some race that were actually people but humans didn't realize)

I mean, someone with this thought process would be certainly /close minded/ - in our world, at least. Today, you have to make a wilful effort to believe it. Centuries ago, I /may/ kinda buy someone would believe it in good faith. Coming from a civilisation that has steel, guns and ships, they find people still living like prehistoric tribes, and don't exactly appreciates the finesses of how and why availability of resources and other environmental factors shape technological discovery, they /might/ be justified at first in thinking that these humans are indeed less smart or capable of innovation. That justification quickly vanishes upon prolonged contact though. And in addition, even if you /did/ consider yourself having a caretaker duty, no one would take their children (whom they have a caretaker duty towards) and put them to hard work in a cotton field, so let's face it, that's just bad faith; a rationalisation used to coat simple convenience. Check out Benjamin Franklin's writings - he went from the default racist views of his time to abolitionism simply by intellectual honesty and observation.

So yeah, not sure how or why you'd want to write this. There's a reason why you think slavery does not compute for someone who is trying to be both rational /and/ moral. It does not. Some ancient philosophers in Greece and Rome already were clear sighted enough to point this out, even living in societies that absolutely depended on slavery (EDIT: actually I have probably misremembered some ambiguous stances here, don't take my word for it on this). The only way I can see for someone to think it rational to keep someone else in slavery is perhaps a situation like house elves in HPMOR - one where the slave group is /actively/ seeking to work and serve, for whatever twisted reason (and that's already got to be pretty contrived and probably by design, seems a bit of a weird quirk to arise naturally). And even then you'd still try to be as graceful and kind as possible, aiming to maximise well-being of the creatures you're taking care of, not your own well-being. Even when it comes to animal farming, we can't really say we're being moral. We do it for egoistic purposes - life is easier for us with animal products. The animals are only treated the way they are because they're weaker. Even in a good farm where they're left with more space and freedom than a factory one, they're still at our mercy. Everything we do supposedly for their sake is actually for our own, to lessen our sense of guilt towards them.

To be blunt, we don't know for sure that dolphins or killer whales aren't as smart as us. They're probably at least as smart as our toddlers. Them not having a technological civilization like ours is hardly proof; they live in water, they have no prehensile appendages, what are they supposed to do? Had you landed on Earth one million years ago, humans and dolphins wouldn't have looked like they had such different lifestyles all in all.

I would say it's a tad more refined: they had to invent deficiencies in nature, applicable to only some people, that would make those people inherently incapable of the same autonomy as themselves. Cue phrenology and other half-assed perversions of biology to sustain the belief in some way or other.

The deficiency was often, but not always, applicable to intelligence: it was also claimed to affect the moral sense (e.g. British asserting inate alcoholism/addiction or laziness of the Irish). A variant was also that the natural setting itself (the country where they lived) did not permit the required emancipation or hampered it - too hot a climate for thinking 'straight' or enough, or causing an excess of passions unsuitable for self-conduct, or poisoning their senses or mind with some cultural food...

** I don't have any particular works but here's a few reasons for why people might be OK with slavery:

1. Pokemons have a better life being slaves compared to being wild because they are more likely to survive/evolve quicker/have more stable food/have more love/exist in civilized cultures.
2. It's just normal. Many people don't question the normal and even inquisitive people are usually only 'really' inquisitive within specific domains.
3. Given that people are more intelligent than pokemons(just look at the culture of their society/technology/whatever) they are apex predators and thus deserve to rule over pokemons.
4. Even if slavery is abhorent the world would eat up humans if they didn't have pokemon to fight for them.
5. Pokemons aren't sentient/conscious, they are only following instincts, and thus they have no moral value.
6. Pokemons actually want to be enslaved and pokemons that look like they don't just don't know what are good for them.

Gets into interesting philosophical and legal territory with the mentally unwell, or with assisted suicide. Legally binding documents can be thrown out if the person signing is not able to make the adjudication themselves, but those people tend to have a guardian who can make decisions on their behalf - that's VERY similar to ownership, though maybe not in line with your preferred vein of moral rationalism. Many jurisdictions ban assisted suicides, even though someone may have a sincere and reasoned desire to commit one.

** Those poor purple savages. Look at them... They lack the brilliant works of art specific to my culture, they don't know the truth that is my religion, and they don't live in the beautiful architecture style of my people. Clearly, their lives are squalor and misery, regardless of how happy they might appear to the untrained eye. It's probably because they are the immediate ancestors of humans, right on the brink of breaking through to full human intelligence. As an enlightened green person I have a moral obligation to help the purples. They will be far better off living under my rule, being forcibly inducted into my culture, on my property over here on this civilized continent, than they would be living in their own culture among their own people on the land that their families have lived on for thousands of years. Conveniently, I have a lot of land that needs to be farmed. It is entirely reasonable that they pay me for my generous efforts and expenditure of my time uplifting them into true sapience, and given their lack of intelligence the easiest way for them to do that is to farm for me. They are lazy so I will need to provide them motivation and they aren't smart enough to appreciate the advantages that money can buy, so paying them a wage is pointless. I'll have to use negative motivations, i.e. beatings and hangings. And, of course, the easiest way to raise them up into true sapience is to mix my superior genetics with theirs. It's a great sacrifice on my part, but it's my moral duty as an enlightened green person. Fortunately, they are close enough to human that some of their females are quite attractive.

My god has told me that I must rule over the purple people. If I do not then my loving god will flay me over and over for all eternity. He will do the same to them if I can't force them to perform the appropriate sacred dances and tell Him how wonderful and loving he is. I am saving their souls from eternal flaying by ruling over them in the ruthless manner commanded by my god.

**** I think you may have to make compromises when it comes to morality if you truly want to stick with this concept.

The truth is that humans are rarely moral in all aspects of their life, even the ones who we consider to be good in hindsight. As was the case with Slavery in real life, there may even be people who consider the act of slavery to be immoral (or are at least question its morality) while they actively participate in it.

Instead of trying to consider how a good person could rationalize slavery as being good. Maybe you should consider why a person who is mostly moral in other aspects of their lives would make an exception for something that they know or suspect to be evil.

I'm no expert on this, but I think the gist of it is that once you're used to a system of evils that you are profiting from, it's incredibly hard to stop participating in that system when you have no similarly convenient alternatives.

Imagine a world where electricity was created by pinching babies and making them cry. There is no other way to create electricity and as far as modern science knows there never will be another way to create electricity. The only choice someone has is to either condone the pinching of babies or live their lives without any of the modern conveniences they enjoy.

Most people will rationalize this by saying things like "It's not like the pinching does long term damage to the babies." "Lots of babies don't even remember being pinched after they've grown up."

The more pragmatic folks will say "Yes it's a shame that we need to pinch babies for power. But the benefits of electricity outweigh the collective pain that the babies feel".

And the thoughtful and compassionate people will take note that the babies who are being sent to the pinching factory are generally those who belong to the poor and marginalized members of society. The people who receive the most benefit from the pinching are not the people being pinched, or even the people whose children are being pinched. Pinching babies is exploitative at best and evil at worst.

And some of those compassionate people will boycott electricity and try to shed light on its evils.

But most of them will realize that without electricity they can't perform the jobs that put food on the table. They can't have simple pleasures like watching tv, or even turning on a lightbulb to read at night. Even if their goal is to shed light on the evils of baby pinching, they recognize that it would be hard to even organize an anti-baby pinching rally without using social media.

And lets say that they themselves were able to boycott electricity entirely and never use it in their homes or at work. It wouldn't do much good if everything they buy is made with electricity and everyone they know uses it as well. Essentially the only way to fully boycott electricity is to live by yourself in a cabin in the woods. And how many people actually have the means or the necessary skills to do so?

So instead, most of your compassionate people try to work within the system. Instead of getting rid of baby pinching entirely, they try to campaign for cutting down on electrical power usage. They try to get laws passed which limit the amount of time a single baby can be pinched per day/week/month. They work for incremental progress to reduce the horrors of baby pinching, because they don't believe it's practical to abolish the whole system all at once.

And all the while they make use of electricity while recognizing that it is clearly the result of someone else's suffering. Yet they hope for a day when society progresses to a point where it doesn't have to be.

Obviously replace baby pinching here with catching Pokémon and I think you get a semi-realistic view of how a mostly moral person could support pokemon slavery.

Edit: I chose electricity to represent the benefits of Pokemon usage because in the TV show Pokemon are much more versatile and prevalent in society than slaves ever were. They provide benefits that cannot be replicated by simply replacing Pokemon with Humans, because pokemon can do things that a human cannot. Unlike real life where the difference between slaves and their owners was arbitrary, and the benefits only came from having free human labor.

If ethics are a way to convince others to act accordingly, and you are a utilitarian, then you must want others to be utilitarian. Maximizing happiness or good comes with the obvious inverse of minimizing pain.

The pain animals feel is empirically and instinctually real. Furthermore, the separation between humans and other living things is empirically a matter of degrees rather than distinct categories.

Therefore, by creating an arbitrary separation between humans and animals, and ignoring the pain of animals undermines the principle of utilitarianism, which makes it less widespread and less of a total belief, which makes it less useful.

************ Animals are a variety of 'utility monster'. If we (humans) include them in our calculations of utility, we have to take actions hat harm humans to help animals. Meanwhile, animals cannot themselves be utilitarians, so convincing them of the merits of utilitarianism is impossible.

While humans will still value animal welfare due to the fact that we are hardcoded and culturally impelled to, that means the welfare of animals should only be considered important by utilitarians as a means to achieve human welfare.*

In general, utilitarians should only seek to extend the principles of utilitarianism to groups that would themselves reciprocally support the interests of utilitarians, otherwise there's an active disincentive for people to commit themselves to following the principles of utilitarianism.

* speaking in slightly less absolute terms, some animals are indeed smart enough to display intelligent reciprocity in a manner that supports them being given utilitarian weight, but they're the exception, not the rule, and they're still worth /less/ than humans. I've lost the comments, but I shut up and did the math to figure out the value of a dog life vs a human life to find out that an arbitrary dog (rather than a specific family pet) is worth about 1/1,000th to 1/10,000th of a human by either economic or neural measures.

And if you're still going to include all animals into your utility function, at least some animals can still be ethically eaten since a human would gain more utility from eating them than they could feel. Specifically, I used neuron counts + connection density to estimate the utility of a human eating a honebee (very smart for an insect) vs. the disutility that bee would get by being eaten, and it turns out that if you even marginally enjoy it, low-end estimates of the utility you could feel outweigh even high-end estimates for the maximum possible disutility the bee could feel.

1. That your decision making process at least occasionally has you do things which are morally very bad, or,

2. That that particular ethical philosophy (whatever it may be) does not reflect morality, at least as it pertains to meat eating.

Firstly, it is important to keep in mind that what seems obviously true to /you/ is neither necessarily obvious to /others/ nor, as it turns out, necessarily /true/ at all. There is nothing privileged about your own perspective which guarantees that you'll never be the one who gets Eulered by a seemingly convincing but ultimately flawed argument. As such, it's extremely uncharitable to assume that anyone who arrives at the opposite conclusion from you must have done so through an embarrassingly basic failure of rationality.

Secondly, though I hesitate to point this out, you seem to be positing that the people who eat meat must realize that they're doing something wrong and rejecting any moral framework which tells them so, because they'd rather have a moral framework which is flattering than one which is correct. Might I suggest that perhaps /other/ people are more morally self-consistent than you are? That when other people say that they're OK with something, it really IS because they're OK with it and NOT because they (like you) recognize it as bad, but have decided to keep on doing it regardless? I don't mean this as an insult, I just find it deeply weird that you apparently object to meat eating, but can bring yourself to do it regardless! If I thought slaughtering and eating animals was even a tenth as bad as slaughtering and eating a person, I'd prefer to starve.

Thirdly, can I recommend taking a look at various social contract theories when you get the chance? It's not all Kant, trust me. In particular, I'd recommend Gauthier's "Morals by Agreement", which rather neatly lays out the case against utilitarianism egoism and suggests instead a system of 'constrained maximization' where people agree to a basic social contract to enforce cooperation toward shared values while allowing individuals the liberty to pursue their own aims, so long as they do not come into conflict with said social contract. Also worth considering is Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" which lays out how one might fairly determine the contents of said social contract through something analogous to pie-cutting algorithms and other game-theoretical formalizations of the concept of fairness. None of them directly touch on animal rights issues, but the obvious objection would be that chickens (for example) are not our peers, offer us no reason to respect their preferences and only merit consideration under the social contract insofar as the general public has strong preferences about them which can be universalized under a Rawlsian veil of ignorance. And even then, it wouldn't be because anything is owed /to the chickens/ (or other animals), but because we have promised it to the /people who like chickens/.

That sounds like a morality that is purely based on how useful people are to your society and how much everyone requires appeasement in order to remain useful instead of becoming disruptive for their own benefit. That's less morality and more enlightened self-interest projected on a naturally social species. It also allows for the complete trampling upon everything that can be enslaved without risk or the ability to pull at our emotions.

Like, under such a system you can't even a priori say that chattel slavery was necessarily evil. It just turned out to be a bad long term investment and the former slaves and their non-slaver allies managed to pass a new agreement with the rest of society.

I'm sorry, but I don't subscribe to complete moral relativism. But if you have an argument on how meat eating can be considered morally positive or neutral without making away with the whole concept of objective right and wrong, then I'm all ears.

Rawls's veil of ignorance concept is based on formalizing a solution to precisely this sort of concern. Chattel slavery can be universalized as wrong precisely because even the most heartless and selfish slave owner would prefer to ban chattel slavery if they found themselves in a position where they might have to live the life of the slave instead. That's a very core moral intuition - that if you wouldn't want it to happen to you, you shouldn't allow it to happen to others like you - simply stated more formally.

That's a very core moral intuition - that if you wouldn't want it to happen to you, you shouldn't allow it to happen to others like you - simply stated more formally. Slavery is bad because nobody would want to be a slave.

How does this concept not also apply to, say, pigs then? Even the most avid meat eater would rather the world were vegetarian if he could somehow find himself having to live the life of a pig in a meat factory.

**************** Racists will say racist things, news at eleven. That is a problem for every system of ethics from utilitarianism (see the dishonest crowing about crime rates) to virtue ethics (with the supposed logic that some people cannot be trusted to govern themselves). The correct response here is to affirm that every human being is deserving of equal dignity and that anyone who disputes this quite simple premise ought be ignored when matters of morality are being discussed.

But let's go ahead and steelman that arguement. What would a person have to be like in order for them to be offered no moral consideration under a social contract theory of ethics? In no particular order:

- They would have to be incapable (or unwilling) of respecting the social contract themselves. Not in the sense of being unable to contribute to society or being somehow less productive than other people (neither of those is a disqualification to human rights - we would still want to be cared for even if we were unable to contribute as much as others) or in the sense that they are unable to articulate the abstract principles at work (we can hardly expect that of everyone), but in the more fundamental sense of being, like the pigs in our earlier example, unable or unwilling to moderate their behavior out of consideration for others. Humans can be assumed to possess this ability unless and until they have given ample evidence to the contrary.

- They must /permanently/ disabled in the above fashion. If their state was brought on by injury, there must be no possibility of recovery; if they were born that way, there must be no chance that they might grow out of it. If there is any chance that they might recover their ability to abide by the social contract, it is our duty to offer them the same level of care and respect that we would desire for ourselves if we were in their position, out of respect for the person who they will become once they regain their senses or grow into maturity.

- They must have no established preference for their care in the event of this disability. Even someone who is irrecoverably and obviously dead deserves that respect be given to their wishes during life. Likewise with someone who has become comatose or who has become too mentally ill to care for themselves - we owe it to them to carry out their wishes regarding their own care with all the respect and deference that we would hope to be afforded to our own wishes should it be us who passes.

- There must be nobody who cares enough for their welfare to take custody of them. Let's say there was a rare genetic disorder which prevented a child from ever growing up - they would remain a helpless infant forever. If the parents of such a child decided that they wished to keep their child and care for them all the same out of love for their newborn, we would have a duty to allow that and to afford their child all the protections of any other child - because if it were us with the child who we wanted to extend the protections of law over, we would want them to support us just the same. (Note that this same principle would also govern a pet pig - if you are caring for an animal, noone has the right to simply kill and eat the animal without your permission. A pig keeper has the right to his pig.)

- There must be no /marit ayin/ considerations at stake, wherein an otherwise permissible action is forbidden because it might lead onlookers into believing that a similar seeming forbidden action is acceptable. In this particular case, you're not allowed to hurt a being who /looks/ like a normal human, even if the above requirements are all satisfied, unless you also make it abundantly clear to everyone involved why an exception ought to be made in this case. Similarly, you could not use such a being to put on a macabre performance that would upset or offend onlookers, as this goes against one's duty to those onlookers.

** If you want to understand behaviour that seems alien to you, start by considering if maybe it's not alien all and you're already doing it without being aware of it. Iphones are made in sweatshops, aren't they? But this doesn't stop most of us from buying them because, well, we're not the ones forcing people in that position. We're just benefiting from a system that already exists - and hey, doesn't that sound familiar?

Or what about servants? We're perfectly comfortable with having people wait on us in restaurants. And some of those people may be treated badly, or paid poorly, but we don't think about it very much because hey, we didn't create the system. There are many poor people who are constantly stressed and terrified of losing their jobs. Women who must put up with sexual harassment from their boss. But that's acceptable, we say, because they have a "choice". Well, slaves also have a choice to kill themselves, but most don't make use of that option.

In fact, actually owning a slave and treating them well might be considerably *more* moral than being a modern day employer who treats his or her workers poorly. It's all a question of how you act based on the circumstances you grow up in, and the beautiful thing about society is that nobody feels complicit in creating the system even though in reality everybody is.

**** Okay, sure, I wrote you a story :P

#+begin_quote
  One upon a time there was a happy little girl called clementine. Little Clem lived in a beautiful farm with her father, and although it could be a little lonely sometimes she was as happy as could be. She would play board games with her father (and usually win!), she gave names to all the animals she was friends with, and whenever she got bored she would go play with the boy who lived at the other farm further down the road. Then one day, an alien showed up and shot her father.

  “AAAAAAHHHHHHH!” said Clementine.

  “Are you all right, tiny human?” The green-skinned, bug-eyed alien shot her a concerned look. “The evil slaver did not hurt you, did he?”

  Clem looked at the alien monster in horror. “You shot my father! Why'd you do that?”

  The alien stared at her, perplexed. “Because the human had robbed you of individual agency. He was forcing you to do physical labour against your will, wasn't he?”

  “That's called doing chores!”

  “But our ship's sensors could clearly hear you complaining as you did them,” the alien said, confused.

  “Of course I didn't want to do them,” Clementine said. “I'm just a kid. Daddy knows what's best for me.” She rushed over to her father's side, checking his breathing the way she had been taught to do when their gelding had gotten very sick. “Oh thank Gosh, I think he's still alive.”

  “Of course he is, we only stunned him,” the alien said, frowning. “But why are you showing such concern for your slaver? It appears you might be suffering from what you humans call /Stockholm Syndrome.”/

  Clem glared at him. “I don't have any kind of /syndrome!/ My dad really does know what's best for me. He's stronger and smarter and he knows way more stuff than me.”

  “Well of course he is,” the alien said, nonplussed. “Slavers are always stronger and smarter than their slaves -- otherwise, they would be the slaves and not the other way around. Isn't that how human history always goes? The strong ruling over the weak?”

  “Uhm, I guess so,” said Clem. She was suddenly regretting not paying more attention in history class. “But that's not the point! Slavery isn't bad because having power over people is wrong, it's bad because it comes along with, like, beating people with whips and stuff if they disobey.”

  “Our ship's sensors could clearly see your father-”

  “Spanking is /not/ the same thing,” Clem said, crossing her arms. “You're not listening! It doesn't matter what /words/ you use to describe things. What matters is if people are happy or not. I love my daddy, and sure it'd be nice to have more freedom and stuff, but that doesn't mean I'd be better off without him!” She pointed to her pet chicken. “Take Clucky here, for example. Sure, you could say I /own/ Clucky, but she's way better off with me than out in the wild and that's what-”

  “AHHHH, SLAVERY!” cried the alien, and shot Clementine.
#+end_quote

Okay, so that one is from the perspective of a slave and not the slaver. :P

But seriously: I think it would help to understand that historically speaking a lot of people were perfectly fine with being slaves. In ancient Greece, you had slave teachers who instructed the children of the ruling class. In Ancient Rome you had slaves who would willingly fight to the death to protect their masters. There's a podcast (Hardcore History) I remember listening to about the fall of the Roman republic. A general was forced to flee from his enemies, and his trusted slave and comrade told him to run away while he stayed behind to buy him even a few seconds of time.

If you want to understand the perspective of a slaver, imagine growing up alongside your best friend, someone who's willing to fight die for you, only for some weirdo to show up and tell you that you are somehow oppressing this person just because you have more social status than they do. And imagine being told this by a person who themselves are perfectly happy exploiting their own high social status to mistreat others. :-)

** Another option you can consider, though it might not be exactly what you want:

Consider a settings where slavery exists. A moral rationalist realizes that it's evil, and vows not to keep slaves. However, he/she is rich, and sees slaves being treated horribly. So isn't it the moral imperative to save some by buying them and treating them well? But now our moral rationalist owns slaves, and obviously he now has to manage them / deal with infractions, and possibly organize them into some sort of work force so that he can get more money to buy more slaves... and the more efficient / more money you make, you can buy more slaves to 'save'. So you get a truly moral person, with a weak form of condoning slavery, and a whole set of slippery slope / difficult choices.

In Pokemon, maybe this person buys trapped pokemons, but they can't be returned to the wild, and require treatment, and money... same principle.

"A long time ago" isn't 200 years ago, it's 2000, and this isn't about US chattel slavery (which is not the Only Slavery That Ever Existed, as Americans often seem to think). In Roman times this was absolutely a thing. Also the conditions of the slaves varied. Really, in antiquity "slaves" were effectively just the lowest social class of all. But there was more social mobility, both downwards and upwards, than in US chattel slavery, because your race or nationality didn't brand you as intrinsically deserving of slavery. Some slaves bought their freedom, some free men sold themselves into slavery out of despair. Some slaves had it much better than others, so there actually was some kind of social ranking among slaves themselves. Some freed slaves moved on to be tremendously successful and rich. Petronius makes fun of one such character in the /Satyricon/, and while he's portrayed as a tasteless /nouveau riche/, it's still clear he IS a big shot.

****** It was not THE cause, but it's true that in Roman times slavery was much closer to a social class issue than anything like what we're used to in modern times. Slaves were, simply put, whoever was on the last rung of the social ladder. They may be war prisoners, or poor people - the point is, they were slaves because they /became/ slaves, not because anyone said, "well, this race of people clearly has to be kept in slavery, they're too dumb for their own good". Slaves could be teachers and secretaries (famously, Cicero's secretary was a slave who then bought his freedom, and they remained close associates), they weren't assumed to be automatically beastly and subhuman. It was a different mindset. The racist rationalisations for slavery in the modern era had to be made up /because/ slavery used to be normal, but then Christianity made it bad, and so it became unacceptable to most. When it started to become really fucking convenient to just enslave the locals while colonising the Americas, it wasn't exactly easy to justify it without looking evil - so the idea started to form that "oh, well, but these guys are savages, they couldn't do anything without us! Also they need to learn the truth of Christ! Really, we're doing them a favour!". And then they all died so the colonists looked at Africa and said "oh, more savages! More people who need to learn about Christ! Let's go pick them up! Look how good we are!". But the rationalisations were necessary fundamentally because people already saw slavery, generally, as a bad thing. In Roman times, that wasn't so. Slavery was just the normal state of things. It was like poverty today. Some people will tell you it's bad, but many will say, well, that's how the world works, some people will always have less, and they wouldn't be motivated to work anyway if we just gave them money.

Since we're on the topic of racially motivated slavery, in both cases (slavery 2,000 years ago and racial slavery later), people involuntarily became slaves and their children automatically became slaves as well. That there were /also/ people who sold themselves into slavery fails to fulfill the spirit of the grandparent comment, if not its literal interpretation, and I don't think yours or his comment address OP's question (which was how a moral rationalist could mistakenly conclude that slavery was moral).

(Unless the person I responded to meant to say that since pokemon were miserable in the wild, the trainers would believe it to be moral to enslave them, but that's either a case of rationalization, or a rational reasoning going so wrong that it requires further explanation, else it leaves such a big part unexplained that it doesn't really explain almost anything, IMO.)

(Generally, my impression is that most comments in the thread answer the question "how could an otherwise moral rationalist /rationalize/ pokemon slavery to themselves," not OP's question (paraphrased) "how could a moral rationalist mistakenly conclude pokemon slavery was ok." Having the rationalist fail at rationality is one way of solving the dilemma, but I think the least interesting one. (Unless we each interpret OP's question differently.))

[[/u/Slyvena][u/Slyvena]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome][I'm not /sure/ that's all that compatible with Wikipedia]].

I addressed the OP elsewhere. Essentially, if you put physical and mental welfare as more morally important than individualism and personal autonomy then its easy to rationally conclude that systems taking away the later in return for the former are a net moral good.

As to why you can't just give them both? Well, the rationalist would need to be unaware of any model of governance that can do that for pokemon or enough understanding of pokemon physiology to understand they possess that capacity within themselves.

The overall point being that some form of unrecognized racial bias is not necessary to rationally arrive at a pro-slavery view. They do need to be missing the full scope of modern understanding, but there are multiple paths toward such an incorrect yet rational view.

Classical Era slavery was almost always something you could work your way out of. Baring specific kingdoms and cultures that took on more xenophobic stances, it had nearly nothing to do with race/sex/etc.

You didn't even need to be desperate to do it. Many had a chance at a much more secure life by becoming the slaves to a rich and powerful person in the area.

It was still wrong and the room for abuse was massive, but the racial undertones are a product of colonial era expansion. In the modern world, you can usually assume someone is talking about the later form of slavery unless they explicitly reference earlier periods.

** This one might seem orthogonal, but I hope it helps with perspective. What do big game hunters, the fossil fuel industry, and Kenneth Copeland have in common?

They all imply by their actions a belief in man's superiority and dominion over the world, especially when it supports their "greater good".

For many, this comes from creationist or fundamentalist religions' teachings that a god created the world and everything in it for man to make use of to honor them and to further the mission of their faith, so the profits they make they must use in exercise of this dominion and contribute to the spread of their gospel, monetarily or through evangelism (see: the family behind [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_Lobby#Controversies][Wahhabi Lobby]]). The impacts today do not matter because all is for god, and the more they make, the more they honor god. They also believe the world will end and everyone who is like them will be eternally rewarded in the measure of their contributions, either in the afterlife or by rapture. It is fairly literally a death cult and the antithesis of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori][memento mori]].

This is only one example, but the slaver mindset is systemic, not individual. It's enabled by the human desire to be a part of an institution and to know where in it you fit. It's also pervasive today, so if you don't recognize it around you, you likely suffer from some memetic immunity to its signs.

You could familiarize yourself with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism][Social Darwinism]] and eugenics, which are foundational to modern anti-democratic ideals, inequality, racism, and genocide. I think EY covers this pretty well in HPMoR as the basis of the Death Eaters' "blood purism" belief, but you can also read about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson][Andrew Jackson's]] ([[https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/content/brenda-wineapple]["The Impeachers"]] covers it well) or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas][Bartolome de las Casas']] writings for a good idea of what genocide looks like first hand and draw your own conclusions on how they reached their views.

I once went to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Estate][Biltmore House]] where I saw walls lined with sketches and portraits of statesmen, philosophers, thinkers, royalty, and other prominent historical figures leading back to antiquity. I thought, "this is a little fanboyish", until I realized that they'd interspersed their own family tree through it, tying them inexorably to greatness. They had always been great, masters of the world and leaders of men, because it was /in their blood/. So many wars, subjugation, death, all because the mad believed in blood magic.

The point is, you're probably more aware of a slaver mindset than you realize if you can model the upper class, royalty, or any sort of ruling class or elites. Being able to dehumanize someone or exepr permanent authority over them because you haven't lived their experiences, think of people in terms of how you value what they contribute to society or how much power they have, or otherwise being able to suspend your empathy to gain advantage over others are indicators, even when they don't recognize what they're doing for what it is. Buying an iPhone or Beyonce product when you know it was made in part with slave labor, contributing to those who do the slaving without care are looser examples of how tolerance enables its existence.

See also moral relativism. Eg- you're not a better person for not understanding power dynamics, as it implies apathy and privilege.

** I suggest reflecting on why it's hard for you to think that a moral rationalist necessarily would see an issue with pokemons being different classes.

We can make an imperfect comparison with animals. At one point Yudkowsky has publicly claimed that animals aren't conscious, with an argument along the lines that it takes multi-level modeling of other individuals to achieve awareness of self and thus consciousness, and therefore have no moral value.

Following the same logic most pokemons would not be conscious even if they sometimes acted like it. There isn't long from thinking that 'X isn't conscious' to 'the suffering of X is just mechanical and there is no qualia' to 'slavery of X isn't actually slavery because there is no real suffering'. I think it would be especially easy to make those conclusions if X was the only thing that stood between you and being a snack to the next dragon that flied by.

(1) The evolutionary reasoning still holds. (2) You don't know that they understand humans as well as other humans. You might see a cat acting as if it understands humans but with the current technology it is impossible to experience it from the cats perspective so all you can do is making deductions and there is a real chance you'd be wrong. (3) Pokemon don't execute complex tasks as well as any other human. Pokemon cultures, insofar as we can call them that, almost never use tools which implies they are less intelligent for some kinds of intellect.

(1) What I am seeing from this is that you're actual question is 'how would someone who is good, as defined by my personal moral system, be okay with slavery' and the answer is that they just wouldn't because your personal moral system doesn't allow that. Recognize that your moral system likely have flaws and consider how someone might arrive at a different system based on the points I and others have made.(2) Do you live on the street? If you don't you are holding capital that could be used to feed or house people who do. That implies that either you accept that those people don't deserve your money as much as you do or that there are areas of your moral system which you are willing to compromise on in order to have a pleasant life.

By functionalism, if something acts conscious, it is conscious - the question is if they don't act conscious often enough for it to matter to people.

Pushkin [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Captain%27s_Daughter][The Captain's Daughter]] take part during [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev%27s_Rebellion][Pugachev rebellion]] and have protagonists interacting heavily with rebels (who composed in part of slaves) while he himself is part of counterinsurgency force. The gist of it is that while both protagonist and author are sympathetic to rebels and slaves, slavery is a part of established system, and overthrowing that system is disastrous for everyone. That was position of liberal part of Russian elite in the first half of XIX century - slavery is bad but slave rebellion is much worse. Failure of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decembrist_revolt][Decembrist coup]] provided liberally inclined nobility with moral justification for tolerating slavery - some of them tried to abolish it, failed and now it was not their responsibility but that of Tsar.

In that case, the missing element OP wants in his story might be pokeballs that reprogram the pokemon to want to be a pet/friend (those who haven't joined the trainer voluntarily).

Then I could /maybe/ sort of see a moral rationalist believing it's ok - after all (Professor Oak could reason), in the anime, wild pokemon that will not follow the trainer without being captured against their will are kind of like hostile animals.

  It would also help if there were no real historic incidences of massive abuse in slavery in your story. In our world simply knowing your history shows you the dangers of slavery, but in a world where all the history tends to colour it somewhat truthfully as a net-positive, its much easier to arrive at a supportive stance.

Which I think is very true. So I will be going with; Its a complete net benefit, mostly (or the system is intended to be) consensual and there aren't any historical examples for people to use as emotional arguments against it.

** The other thing that you should consider is not humans as a dominant force as i kind of implied but humanity using pokemon slavery in your words as the only way to keep a human state in existence with well the forces of nature that pokemon as a whole are. Like it's one thing for you to speak of it like we would be the dominant species, but why would we be the dominant species if every pokemon was as smart and generally more physically capable than us?

Like the other way is the Roman's where someone enslaved could buy their own freedom by learning a trade that they would have had the fees covered for by their owner. In that the slave owner is both gaining the upfront cost back and also some percentage of the money made while the slave is still enslaved. Conversely there's more like the Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire who were well slaves well trained and kept well fed who were used as well soldiers.

Converesly there's the whole problem with more intelligent beings making up the majority of food chain where well intelligence would be much less valued if even your food crops are feeling and thinking beings and that treatment probably would get rid of a lot of general empathy towards non-humans. But even then amongst most people living on subsistence farms there isn't the widespread vegan-esque uhh equivalence of animal life to humanity. Like we shove animals that are pretty intelligent on the whole into zoos or well food markets without much thought the idea that more intelligence would make us more sensitive to relative equivalence in uhh humanity is kind of naïve.

** I actually teach History, and Stanford reading like a Historian has a great accessible selection. I think you need to make an account, so I'll put a selection from a slave transport captain's diary. It is quite honestly one of the most evil things I have ever read.

/Captain Thomas Phillips, 1732/

#+begin_quote
  Having bought my complement of 700 slaves, 480 men and 220 women, and finish'd all my business at Whidaw fon the Gold Coast of Africa], I took my leave of the old king and his cappasheirs [attendants], and parted, with many affectionate expressions on both sides, being forced to promise him that I would return again the next year, with several things he desired me to bring from England. . . .

  There happened such sickness and mortality among my poor men and Negroes. Of the first we buried 14, and of the last 320, which was a great detriment to our voyage, the Royal African Company losing ten pounds by every slave that died, and the owners of the ship ten pounds ten shillings....

  [reddit poster note: my best research put this at around three thousand dollars in modern day currency for each slave. Which would mean the company lost about $2m, which seems about right from other numbers I've had.]

  The distemper which my men as well as the blacks mostly died of was the white flux [diarrhea], which was so violent that no medicine would in the least check it....

  [Smallpox attacks the ship.] All the assistance we gave the diseased was only as much water as they desir'd to drink, and some palm-oil to annoint their sores, and they would generally recover without any other helps but what kind nature gave them. . . .

  But what the smallpox spar'd, the flux swept off, to our great regret after *all our pains and care to give them their messes in due order and keeping their lodgings as clean and sweet as possible, and enduring so much misery and stench so long among a parcel of creatures nastier than swine*, and after all our expectations to be defeated by their mortality. . . . *No gold-finders can endure so much noisome slavery as they do who carry Negroes; for those have some respite and satisfaction, but we endure twice the misery; and yet by their mortality our voyages are ruin'd,* and we pine and fret ourselves to death, and take so much pains to so little purpose.

Here's selections from a speech from John Calhoun, a separatist and ardent supporter of slavery. He's really the spearhead for the argument states rights prevent fixing any sort of discrimination. Here's an 1837 speech from him.

#+begin_quote
  I do not belong, said Mr. C., to the school which holds that aggression is to be met by concession. Mine is the opposite creed, which teaches that encroachments must be met at the beginning, and that those who act on the opposite principle *are prepared to become slaves.* In this case, in particular I hold concession or compromise to be fatal. If we concede an inch, concession would follow concession...

  [redditor note: Slaveholders love talking about how important their liberty is and how much honor they have. There were jokes about that at the time.]

  Unless [Abolitionism] be speedily stopped, it will spread and work upwards till it brings the two great sections of the Union into deadly conflict... I told him that *the doctrine was tantamount to the assumption of unlimited power on the part of the Government*, and that such would be the impression on the public mind in a large portion of the Union.

  . I then predicted that it would commence as it has with this fanatical portion of society, and that *they would begin their operations on the ignorant, the weak, the young, and the thoughtless* ---and gradually extend upwards till they would become strong enough to obtain political control, when he and others holding the highest stations in society, would, however reluctant, be compelled to yield....

  *Already it has taken possession of the pulpit, of the schools*, and, to a considerable extent, of the press; those great instruments by which the mind of the rising generation will be formed. In the course of a few years they will be succeeded by those who will have been taught to hate the people and institutions of nearly one-half of this Union, with a hatred more deadly than one hostile nation ever entertained towards another. It is easy to see the end. By the necessary course of events, if left to themselves, we must become, finally, two people.

  [Redditor's note: He's consciously using Declaration of Independence language here.]

  *We of the South will not, cannot, surrender our institutions.* To maintain the existing relations between the two races, inhabiting that section of the Union, is indispensable to the peace and happiness of both. It cannot be subverted without drenching the country or the other of the races. . . . *But let me not be understood as admitting, even by implication, that the existing relations between the two races in the slaveholding States is an evil:---far otherwise; I hold it to be a good*. I appeal to facts. Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually.

  In the meantime, the white or European race, has not degenerated. It has kept pace with its brethren in other sections of the Union where slavery does not exist. It is odious to make comparison; but *I appeal to all sides whether the South is not equal in virtue, intelligence, patriotism, courage, disinterestedness, and all the high qualities which adorn our nature.*

  I may say with truth, that in few countries so much is left to the share of the laborer, and so little exacted from him, or where there is more kind attention paid to him in sickness or infirmities of age. Compare his condition with the tenants of the poor houses in the more civilized portions of Europe---look at the sick, and the old and infirm slave, on one hand, in the midst of his family and friends, under the kind superintending care of his master and mistress, and compare it with the forlorn and wretched condition of the pauper in the poorhouse.

*** Alright, so some general points from my years of reading terrible people, like the two above.

- Dehumanization is hugely important, and the first narrative is symptomatic of it. However, dehumanization is very, very, very difficult to maintain through frequent contact. I read a speech from I think Goebbels talking about the mental stress shooting Jews had on SS officers. In the speech he mentioned how everyone had a favorite Jew they wanted to save even if they were in favor of extermination in the abstract (note, even Hitler personally spared his Jewish commanding officer).

- The weirdest thing to think about and truly understand is cognitive dissonance. Many, many, many people are taught / police themselves to not notice or ask questions about conflicting beliefs. I have seen that on /these forums/. The not asking questions part legitimately terrifies me. See 1984 if you want to see it in action.

- The most frequent technique to prevent examination of cognitive dissonance is to change from an absolute for of reasoning to a comparative form. (Look at this, we're much better in comparison to an outgroup.) Thus concerns about right or wrong are minimized.

- Identity politics and transfer is hugely, hugely, hugely important. "If you criticize a practice, you criticize our group, and our group is great so you can't criticize us." Furthermore, supporting and protecting the created group identity is hugely important. Calhoun does his rah, rah, rah, the South is the best in there.

- Appeal to tradition (including imagined tradition) also frequently shows up. Keep in mind that the sacred institutions Calhoun is hell-bent on protecting are /50 years old/ when he makes this speech. Again, this is a way of unifying life into a series of cohesive identities if not a cohesive system for viewing the world.

- The opposite of identity politics, demonization of groups that "threaten" the in-group is part of the maintenance of identity. They're who you transfer all your frustration at cognitive dissonance to. It's not that shit ideas and lies launched a coup d'état in the US; hidden members of Antifa fomented the crowd. Because threats help maintain the identity, members of the group are un/consciously looking for new scapegoats.

In some ways the captain's narrative is purer and simpler evil. He wants to make money so he sells slaves. (The same packet has a narrative from someone who also joined a slave ship for money, and the experiences turned him into an Abolitionist.) Calhoun's narrative is however more typical of a participant in a slave society.

** For non-fiction, The Cornerstone Speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens is what immediately comes to mind. it's essentially a rant that black people are inherently inferior to white people, and subordination to a superior race is their "natural and normal condition."

There's also the southern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States#Justifications_in_the_South][states justification]] of slavery as a "necessary evil" and "a positive good". You will have to looks at the sources quoted, but it will give you some idea of what people thought was a justification for slavery, like this:

#+begin_quote
  If we reason from what passes in the world, we should almost say that the European is to the other races of mankind what man himself is to the lower animals: he makes them subservient to his use, and when he cannot subdue he destroys them. Oppression has, at one stroke, deprived the descendants of the Africans of almost all the privileges of humanity. The Negro of the United States has lost even the remembrance of his country; the language which his forefathers spoke is never heard around him; he abjured their religion and forgot their customs when he ceased to belong to Africa, without acquiring any claim to European privileges. But he remains half-way between the two communities, isolated between two races; sold by the one, repulsed by the other; finding not a spot in the universe to call by the name of country, except the faint image of a home which the shelter of his master's roof affords.

  The Negro has no family: woman is merely the temporary com- panion of his pleasures, and his children are on an equality with himself from the moment of their birth. Am I to call it a proof of God's mercy, or a visitation of his wrath, that man, in certain states, appears to be insensible to his extreme wretchedness and almost obtains a depraved taste for the cause of his misfortunes? The Negro, plunged in this abyss of evils, scarcely feels his own calamitous situation. Violence made him a slave, and the habit of servitude gives him the thoughts and desires of a slave, he admires his tyrants more than he hates them, and finds his joy and his pride in the servile imitation of those who oppress him. His understanding is degraded to the level of his soul.

  The Negro enters upon slavery as soon as he is born, nay, he may have been purchased in the womb, and have begun his slavery before he began his existence. Equally devoid of wants and of enjoyment, and useless to himself, he learns, with his first notions of existence, that he is the property of another, who has an interest in preserving his life, and that the care of it does not devolve upon himself; even the power of thought appears to him a useless gift of Providence, and he quietly enjoys all the privileges of his debasement.

  If he becomes free, independence is often felt by him to be a heavier burden than slavery; for, having learned in the course of his life to submit to everything except reason, he is too unacquainted with her dictates to obey them. A thousand new desires beset him, and he has not the knowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these are masters which it is necessary to contend with, and he has learned only to submit and obey. In short, he is sunk to such a depth of wretchedness that while servitude brutalizes, liberty destroys him.

** Aristoteles was a moral rationalist, and he argued that slavery was permissible under the right circumstances ([[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html]["Politics" Book 1, part 3]]). Mises (which I am aware is a biased source) also gathers ten arguments that have historically been used to defend slavery ([[https://mises.org/library/ten-reasons-not-abolish-slavery][Ten Reasons Not to Abolish Slavery]]). Some moderns libertarians also argue for slavery, as long as people sell themselves into it voluntarily. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Block#%22Voluntary_slave_contract%22][Walter Block]] is the most famous example.

There are currents of modern Islam, [[https://tradetsmakadetorsdag.wordpress.com/2020/10/18/islams-troubling-relationship-to-slavery/][which still includes arguments for slavery]]. The dawa-influencer Daniel Haqiqatjou tries to motivate his position on slavery, partly by referring to secular sources. Insisting that slavery does not substantially differ from arduous and low-status forms of employment - and is better suited to help the vulnerable. He uses the old "you take better care of a car you own than the one you rent, likewise a slave owner is more invested in a slave's health than an employer is in a worker"-argument. In my experience, dawa-influencers tend to assume that Allah is benevolent and rational. If Allah has accepted slavery, then there must be morally rational reasons for this slavery, which one can deduce. Implying a type of "ideal observer" theory of ethics, where Allah is the ideal observer and does not simply decide morality arbitrarily, but at least partially roots morality in some type of utilitarian calculus. Or at least, that is how they present their reasoning to their western audiance.

Relevant to the discussion is also the "[[https://philosophicalvegan.com/wiki/index.php/NameTheTrait][name the trait]]"-challenge from vegans. Almost all of the same arguments used to defend needlessly killing animals who possess advanced minds, social nature, and deep sensory experiences - can be used to defend slavery - with relatively minor tweaking. It's not hard to imagine motivated cognization giving someone that extra push needed to extend those arguments.

Imagine a human society that uses animal X as a source of meat and as a domesticated workforce within the farm (such as letting horses draw plows). They can clearly observe that X can't reason to the same level as humans, can't learn the same things as humans. All X remain on the same intelligence level as pigs. Humans conclude that this trait is immutable. Unbeknownst to them, this species had actually evolved to have higher intelligence than humans. The cognitively weak X they are interacting with, are survivors of a world war fought with bioweapons, one of these weapons was a virus that enforced epigenetic effects that lowered intelligence immensely.

This effect is not permanent. The virus is becoming less efficient for each generation, causing the species to become more intelligent rapidly. At what level of intelligence, would it become morally necessary for humans to free all X? How many generations can humans keep less intelligent beings as forced servants?

This isn't actually all that far from reality. Black and white people are equal in intelligence, in my worldview at least, but this was not always known. Racism within the American south used to be so extreme, that they viewed it as impossible for black people to be taught fully in school. To quote a part of history on that matter: "In 1871, the Georgia legislature created a board of visitors to attend public examinations at Atlanta University. The chairman of the first board of visitors was ex-slaveholder Joseph Brown, who reportedly said that he expected the examinations to confirm the Negro's inferiority. But the recitations of former slaves in Latin, Greek, and geometry forced from him the confession that "we were impressed with the fallacy of the popular idea . . . that the members of the African race are not capable of a high grade of intellectual culture."  And the Atlanta Constitution could hardly "believe what we witnessed. To see colored boys and girls fourteen to eighteen years of age, reading in Greek and Latin, and demonstrating correctly problems in Algebra and Geometry . . . appears almost wonderful" (Sowell, Thomas "Black Rednecks and White Liberals" [[https://books.google.se/books?redir_esc=y&hl=sv&id=JMxpBOnQIH8C&q=ear#v=onepage&q=appears%20almost%20wonderful&f=false][Page 39]] )

I doubt the accuracy of the claim, but it has been estimated that the gorilla Koko had an IQ of between 75 and 95 ([[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44559261]["Koko: Gorilla who mastered sign language dies in California" BBC]]). I am personally skeptical towards the usefulness of IQ, and the accuracy of IQ-tests (there is something close to the truth there, but it doesn't seem to capture the whole scope). I am particularly skeptical towards the whole field of "IQ and race" (it screams bias to me). With that said, the available data, taken at face value, suggest that [[https://www.worlddata.info/iq-by-country.php][there are several countries where the average IQ is lower than 75]]. I've seen people online who combine these two contested facts, too assert that several "races" are less intelligent than gorillas.

My point is that it really isn't that difficult for people to convince themselves that differences in intelligence are greater than it actually is the case, creating the illusion that others are so unintelligent to need the forceful rulership of others as to not cause great harm to themselves or others. Viewing the subjugation of other groups as equally morally trivial as forcing children to partake in studying - sure the child wants to do other things but doesn't know what's best for him/her. You will benefit from the child achieving a proper education, having a family member who can help support you when your old, but that doesn't mean that you are acting selfishly in forcing the little one off to school. So two the slavemaster sees himself as doing what's best for the slave and being naturally rewarded for his efforts without being selfish in his motives.

** What do you mean by moral? I feel moral relativism can be helpful here: slavery seems impossible to justify to you because your understanding of ethics has freedom and equality (extended in such a way that it should apply to sentient pokémon) built in so deeply.

This does not need to be the case.

Moreover, one can very easily not hold these traits in high esteem, consider themselves moral (that is, make their decisions keeping their ethics in mind), and be totally rational. You've heard of Hume's Guillotine?

However, I will raise that it's entirely possible to just... not construct your version of the pokéworld where this is how it is? There are other ways to flesh things out such that the ethical ramifications are ameliorated. Especially if the story isn't about slavery, and no (good) characters are stepping out against pokémon being treated this way... you're kinda just writing yourself into a corner where you have to interface with this really uncomfortable idea for no reason.

*** The thing is, I like the setting and want two write with it, and even think that this form of sudo-slavery would be the logical conclusion of the world I am building, along with actually being beneficial for Pokémon in general. My issue is due to my background this is very hard for me to get into a mindset where this doesn't just feel "icky". I mentioned Realms of Monsters, because I think that does it well, and did help me with this perspective understanding, but not enough. Hence looking for more works.

To clarify: Yes, I know I feel this way because of my subjective ethics, the problem is I can't imagine someone who I would think of as "A good guy" that does not share this ethic, and I want to change that. And all bar the above, works of fiction I have read which use slavery use it as a way to show how the protag is "good" by not condoning it. Which I want to do as well, but ALSO want to have characters who are good and do condone it.

Maybe pokemon just aren't sentient, maybe they just /do/ like it, maybe the relationship isn't very slave like and all pokemon are choosing to hang out/enjoy battling (this is pretty much the tact the show takes). You're limiting your world to a very narrow interpretation of the universe you're writing in and not liking the results.

If, more generally, you want to experiment with exposing yourself to/writing characters with different moral compasses to yours... perhaps you should start somewhere a little safer than slavery?

For the above though, in this setting I intend to have that *all true*: Pokemon in general don't mind it, it IS beneficial to them and it is much more a choice than actual slavery.

A 'good' rationalist may look at all these mostly happy Pokemon being benefited by ownership and simply deduce "Despite my personal misgivings, it is clear that the net impact of pokemon ownership is a moral good. I can try to improve the system and work out its kinks, but it is undeniably good when examining the mental and physical welfare of those under it."

It would also help if there were no real historic incidences of massive abuse in slavery in your story. In our world simply knowing your history shows you the dangers of slavery, but in a world where all the history tends to colour it somewhat truthfully as a net-positive, its much easier to arrive at a supportive stance.

** If we want to talk about moral rationalism, how about we talk about how in the USA, slavery is legal and protected by the constitution?

A lot of us are groomed from birth to not know this. It sounds so absurd and invisible to the lived experience of 90%+ of the population, after all. However, it's true. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcCxsLDma2o][Go watch Slavery By Another Name.]] This kind of thing still goes on. I'm sure you've heard of them from time to time in the news - box packers in Texas, firefighters in California, Janitors in Arkansas, etc.

Now that everyone here knows this and is on the same page. Suppose you think yourself a "good and moral" person. What do you do with this information?

A. Try to build awareness so we can get some force behind reform. However this would involve having uncomfortable conversations with people who'll think you're crazy or don't want to think sad thoughts, so it's much easier to

B. Pretend there isn't a problem. Anyone who says there is, is an annoying liar. But there's always the chaotic evil option of

C. THOSE PEOPLE deserve to be slaves. You know. THOSE PEOPLE. Which people? The kind you don't like. Your imagination of who gets tortured is all that matters. It doesn't matter who that is really, as long as wage laborers get paid as little as possible overall. Just say they're learning "important job skills" packing soap, a job that belongs to a machine outside of slavery and does not exist on domestic soil otherwise.

As for cock fighting with slaves in the imaginary world of Pokémon? You have to accept that what they show you is sanitized cock-fighting propaganda. It is a cartoon. In the real world you won't get some bruises and "faint" from a Charizard breathing a fuckin' fusion orb or some shit at your tree rat, the rat will be dead. *DEAD*. Death is acknowledged really only within the in-game pokedex entries, these cock fights can not ever be a fun and healthy game. Being crippled for life is the best outcome a pokemon could ever hope for after a life of fightin'.

So, much like how Bill Gates is not a "good billionaire" (at a minimum, wealth extraction from Africa and the stuff he probably did to children with his friend Jeff), Professor Oak is not a "good poképrofessor". The man is a monster.

So you either have a miserable, realistic grimdark world that needs some kind of pokéterrorist fighting for the health and freedom of animals (and from a perspective of counter propaganda, the ideal hero of this movement should be nonhuman), or you buy into the fantasy world where being horribly bitten and clawed is only a passing moment of pain. Which is also ok, because it is a cartoon, and a fantasy. Having an army of monsters is cool.

Heh, just the concept of Ash, Misty, Brock and Oak having a roundtable debate about their respective moral philosophies is very funny, though. When the whole point of the thing is to sell toys to five year olds.

** I think House Elves are the best example of this? The issue is barely touched upon in canon because JKR is a terrible person, but various fanfictions (including The Arithmancer) cover the topic in great detail.

In this case, you have an entire species who were created specifically to be slaves. Their culture is formed entirely around their enslavement. Oddballs who want freedom exist, but mostly as a result of horrific abuse; House Elves with masters who don't horrifically abuse them almost never want to leave. Even then, all of them place high value on working incredibly hard their entire lives, with even free elves negotiating their own pay and benefits /downwards,/ in full knowledge that this is what they are doing, and knowing that their employers won't look down on them for wanting more. Elves freed involuntarily almost always spin into despair and die, even if they find new employment.

Given this, given a species with broadly human values and intelligence except an inverted desire for freedom, is it moral to deny them the position they were created to fill? Obviously whoever created these beings should be hunted down like the animal he is, but the cat's already out of the bag and a species that literally wants to be enslaved exists. You could argue that they just do that because they're all brainwashed, but brainwashing an entire species that uniformly seems unlikely. The human values generally seen as universal (empathy, wanting to minimize pain for at least the ingroup) are probably a result of our physiology, rather than cultural conditioning. Even if that isn't the case for House Elves, just freeing all of them at once would probably be akin to genocide unless preceded by generations of careful reconditioning.

At that point, being a slaver starts to make a whole lot more sense. You actually have good reason to think thay not enslaving these people would increase the suffering in the world (as opposed to all the awful reasons forwarded by real-world slavers). There is a coherent argument for slavery of House Elves in even the most progressive of societies, and moral, rational people could probably agree with its conclusions.

But I'm not sure if that helps you. If the Pokemon you want to write also value their own enslavement the same way humans value freedom, or if you can write the story to include such a factor, go ahead, but I don't think it's possible for a rational and good person to be pro-slavery in any other circumstance.

** I'm not familiar with pokemon other than a very vague notion that's perculated through popular culture, so forgive me if this is totally off-base: but it seems that you're assuming that pokemon are conscious, thinking beings. What if that's not true -- or at least, what if the people in your world don't believe that it's true?

From a certain perspective, I treat my computer like crap. I've written some code that compiles, but I think it's a bit dodgy? I'll just run it, and if it crashes, I'll investigate further. I'm not going to waste mental effort in double-checking the code ahead of time to prevent a crash! Want to time some code? I'll run it multiple times to benchmark it, with no regard to whether the computer is "tired" or "hungry" or anything like that. Now, nobody thinks there's an ethical problem with treating computers as slaves / tools.

What about animals? That gets murkier. Some people object to killing animals for food or materials, period. Some people object to killing cute & cuddly animals, but are fine if it's cows or chickens. Some people object to killing animals, unless they're treated "humanely" (be that free-range, grass-fed, sung a song before having their head chopped off, whatever). Some people object to killing land creatures, but fish are fair game. Etc.

At any rate, almost everybody believes that it's ok to treat computers and animals in ways that would be totally unacceptable to treat humans.

So, enter pokemon. In your world, are they considered to be tools like computers? Or animals like fish? Or perhaps more like "cuddly" animals like cats and dogs? If they're considered to be tools, then a whole realm of treatment becomes available without apparent moral qualms.

** Your apparent basic impetus that being an intelligent person truly concerned with ethics and being a proponent of slavery are inconsistent is correct. If someone endorses slavery, they are perhaps trying to dress up their opinion as moral, but something has gone wrong along the way. If you read some books by slaves, such as some of Frederick Douglass's accounts of his time as a slave, I think you get both what pro-slavery people were saying and how it actually affected slaves in practice, as far as first-hand accounts go. If you want slavery in your work, you're going to have to grapple with the fact that slavery, using any reasonable definition of the term, has huge ethical issues to put it mildly. I would advise that if you pursue a story, don't justify slavery in the meta-narrative. Just because so-and-so is the protagonist or an ally of the protagonist doesn't mean so-and-so is behaving ethically in all respects. Honestly, I am kind of baffled this question is being asked in this form.

** I'm coming a bit late here, but here are a few thoughts I had about this

1. It is necessary to enslave Pokemon, because if they weren't enslaved they would easily overpower humanity. Many are much smarter than us, and most are more powerful than us. It is only via our institutional power in the form of slavery that we can hope to have any control over our future.

2. Although in a perfect world the character in question believes Pokemon would ideally be free, there are currently more pressing, and likely more important and more easily solvable questions to attempt to tackle in the present, such as biosecurity threats, AI alignment, and global poverty reduction. Nobody is dying on account of the enslavement of Pokemon, and in general they're treated better as slaves than they would be in the wild. This character also believes they would be at an unfair disadvantage when attempting to solve the other problems they care about if they did not partake in Pokemon enslavement. Thus they continue to enslave Pokemon, feeling slightly bad about it but not too much since it's the status-quo.

3. Politics and Moloch. You rule the region you're in by defeating the Pokemon Champion. If this is your ambition, then you either optimize fully for Pokemon training, or be defeated by someone who did. Thus, if you give your Pokemon off-days and a wage you will lose to someone who pushes their Pokemon 24/7, and puts money otherwise spent on wages to training materials.

4. Pokemon actually prefer enslavement, and it is in fact anything but! The average trainer spends [X] poke-dollars on per pokemon, while the average family spends [Y]. While these are nowhere near the market-rate of the average human labourer, these are likely /above/ the wages which would be paid to these Pokemon in a free market because the humans are paying for housing and food, which Pokemon have repeatedly demonstrated these as non-necessary when in the wild. Similarly, a study conducted in [YEAR] showed that when polled by an Alakazam, 87% of Pokemon would prefer being owned by a trainer than to life in the wild. By comparison, [[https://xkcd.com/2305/][76% of people feel positively about Meowth, 89% of people say fair elections are important to democracy, and 86% of people do not trust Kim Jong-Un to do the right thing]]. We also see a distinct lack of humans renting off their Pokemon, indicating a distinct lack of hired-Pokemon labour. (I don't think this argument is very strong, even with these made-up numbers).

5. A weaker version of 4. The current system /may/ not be perfect. But so far it's working out very well for both humans and Pokemon, and the introduction of Pokemon slavery has been pareto-optimal for both groups. We should generally be careful about overturning traditions as per Chesterton's Fence, especially when these traditions have been as beneficial as slavery.

I think the strongest argument here is 2. Not super happy with 4 & 5, as after 10 seconds of thinking about each I wasn't convinced.

*** Yeah, thanks for the contribution. I think the most valuable perspective I got from this thread is: "In a world without massive historical humanitarian abuse due to slavery, the idea of slavery itself would not have the instinctual negative reaction which it does in our society". I think my whole issue, is that I subconsciously think off all the historical abuse of slavery when considering it, and conflate all the negativity with racism, abuse, etc which is associated in many historical examples of slavery.

I think 4, combined with the relationship between Pokémon and trainer to not be what we consider traditional slavery, but more along the relationship of a pet with a few added rights (Such as a Pokémon's right to leave a trainer or return to the wild, etc) due to the intelligence, makes a morally gray-enough relationship which could perpetuate into modern society.
