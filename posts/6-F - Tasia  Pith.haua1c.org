** I have to wonder what the average Ousting candidate is like. Tasia is pretty humble, but that /has/ to be an exception, right? The average candidate is probably more of a thug; arrogant, confident in their fighting abilities, and desperate enough to reach for any way to improve their station.

In other news, Eliya is a privileged asshole.

*** Is she? We know that she's doing worse than Tasia, and aside from mere tribalism and (from her perspective) Tasia being responsible for killing her former teamate and captain, I can see a real concern about having a teamate with unknown motivations having a close relationship with someone known to be under the enemy's thump. It's certainly plausible that Eliya or someone else on the team is in danger of eventual ousting.

** Damn, Wes wasn't even in this chapter and it still managed to make me like him less. It was hard enough to root for him when achieving his goals would have meant Ana losing her one remaining friend, it's damn near impossible now that we've seen Tasia's side of things. It doesn't help matters that he just wants to go back to a time when his being a privileged alcoholic fuckup didn't have consequences, whereas Tasia actually has selfless goals she's tirelessly working towards with the resources she now has.

On a completely unrelated note, I'm pretty sure this is the first time we've had viewpoint character demonstrate that their life was different before Piths and projecting were revealed to the world at large, so that's pretty neat. It kinda felt weird that nobody was really acknowledging the fact that everybody should be able to remember what their life was like before the masquerade fell.

Sure, there have been a couple of stray comments like "we used to just wipe everyone's memories, but we can't do that anymore," but they've always had a sense of "society used to be different" rather than "my life was different." The former is an acknowledgements of historical fact, the latter is an expressions of lived experience. I'm glad we're finally seeing someone whose perspective has been so fundamentally shaped by the historic events they've lived through, rather than just being vaguely aware that they happened.

*** Honestly I like Wes/Nell. She's getting humbled pretty hard and even though it's a selfish goal, she's developing as a character as she faces the consequences and costs of what she's done. It's going to lead to a fun crisis point when tings come to a head as she develops more as a person.

** I'm pretty eager to learn more about these Praxis vocations that can be 'installed' (which I think is just jargon for learned because I'm pretty sure I remember reading something about not being able to stitch vocations into someone's pith). If Tasia teaches Ana the multi-threading and time-dilation vocations, Ana could be an absolute monster. Also, am I misremembering, or was there a section that talked about how the more vocations you installed the sooner you would experience pith degeneration (essentially Alzheimer's)?

*** I wonder if there's a taboo about asking for installed vocations. Assuming bodily decay is uncorrelated to the number of installed vocations, Ana does seem like she could have asked her friends for help in acquiring useful vocations.

I think pith degeneration ages you mentally, so it would be more like becoming senile than Alzheimer's in specific.

**** I'm no expert on the topic on Alzheimer's, but based off of the first [[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447#:%7E:text=Alzheimer's%20disease%20is%20a%20progressive,person's%20ability%20to%20function%20independently.][definiton]] Google gave me, it sounds like an almost 1-1 comparison except instead of brain cells wasting away it's pith particles.

** A question for y'all: Other serials have discords for discussion and stuff, and I've gotten a question or two about that. However, I'm still not sure exactly how many people read this, or if that's something people want.

Would y'all be interested in a discord channel for Pith? If yes, I can set one up.

Thanks for reading!

*** I still think you should post this on RoyalRoad in addition to your own site. It's a great story, but you're not going to grow your readership very fast if new people only find it when you link it somewhere.

**** That's very fair. I'm still holding off on cross-posting to Royalroad until I build up a larger backlog of chapters and can drop them all at once, but I'm definitely planning to post there in the long term.

Webfictionguide is in the process of getting rebuilt. I'm hoping it'll be back online soon so I can get some growth there.

***** If you want a royal road tip, register your story on the site (with just one chapter) a month in advance of actually starting posting it for real. The algorithm for the trending stories favors ones that aren't brand new versus those that are, and if you're already in that category when you get the majority of your hits, you'll be much more likely to jump to the top.

*** I'd be interested in a Discord server. I like discussing the things I read with other people, and that's much easier and more accessible to do in a chatroom environment than Reddit or blog comments.
