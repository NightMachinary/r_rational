** This looks like it could be the start of Leizu being a major viewpoint character. The story's had chapters from different perspectives before, but those are usually at the end of an arc and tend to be a bit more removed from the main action than this. I could be wrong, but I hope not. I like Leizu and what her perspective adds to the narrative.

Shame about the hiatus though. Hopefully the author recovers soon and we can get more of this great story!

** A bit of a shame that we didn't get any clue as to what kind of eldritch horrors Cao Hui managed to grave-rob/extract from containment before the hiatus.

But health does takes precedence.

The Yokusei Pact sounds like something that should have been broken long ago. It's a classic tragedy of the commons setup plus allegedly some future stability issues for the transgressor. I don't really buy those; and anyway, non-immediate consequences seldom stop human governments, when there is power and money to be gained.

It definitely should have been broken by someone while Shenten was a failed state, if not long before.
