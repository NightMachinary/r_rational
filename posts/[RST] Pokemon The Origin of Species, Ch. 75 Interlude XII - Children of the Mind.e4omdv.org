** Hey everyone, welcome back! Technically still the 1st, with apologies to anyone living east of Germany.

Quick note, I'm henceforth referring to the Mr. Mime family by its Japanese name, Barrierd. There will be some reference to its "real name" when it comes up again in the future, but the simple reason is that its English name is just badly designed on a number of levels; it's the only pokemon family whose names have two words, which makes lower case for non-proper-nouns look strange, and one of the words is an honorific, and it's a gendered honorific despite there being female Mr. Mimes. So yeah. Now it's barrierd, except for regions like Galar.

(Oh yeah, I guess Sirfetch'd has a gendered honorific too. Well at least it's region specific. (Also it clearly should have been called Absir'd, come on...))

Anyway, hope you enjoy the chapter, and if so, you should totally check out Crystal Society, by Max Harms!

*** Your reasoning for changing Mr Mime makes sense, for sure. Do you have alternates in place for Mime Jr and Mr Rime as well?

Also, on a slightly unrelated note, I'm curious about how many of the legendaries actually exist in TOoS. Mostly because some, like the Sinnoh Trio plus Arceus, seem more suited for being a religion instead, but then we have the reveal of Groudon and Kyogre potentially being actual creatures... Well, maybe I'm just caught up in excitement for the worldbuilding, but it does seem a pertinent question.

And I guess while I'm on the topic of asking too many questions, does Kanto have a lower level of Pokémon diversity than other regions (considering the others generally have more Pokémon due to being post Gen 1) or are the native species mixed up compared to what they are in the games?

Sorry for grilling you, but your worldbuilding is so fascinating! So many questions!

Well, yes, since the first four regions map to regions of Japan, but Unova is the eastern United States (which is why Surge, who is in Gen 1 referred to as "The Lightning American," is in this fic Unovan), Kalos is France, Alola is Hawaii, and Galar is England. So you'd expect the Pokemon unique to those to not show up in the first four regions, given how far apart the real-life counterparts are.

I really liked the first two books, and the society-nature of those first two was the major thing I liked; the third book was rather disappointing in how little of the AI view we got.

Related to the Crystal trilogy, I wonder if Victory lacks identification-with-Prime because it was created by the other tulpas, and so will seek to maximize its personal victory rather than a gestalt, kind of like what Growth realized very early.

** This was so incredibly cool. Mewtwo's chapters continue to be my favorite ones, and they just keep getting even better.

I guess Prime is his actual name? It feels good to have something to call him that he also feels comfortable calling himself.

Just, holy shit. What an amazing character, I can't find words to describe how much I love him. I just want him to be happy! I have no doubts about Red Blue and Leaf having eventual happy endings, whatever form those take, but I'm very anxious about Prime's fate, he is so complex. All of them are, and I love seeing how each of their stories develop, even if I sometimes don't agree with them, but Prime is my treasured favorite.

Thank you so much for the chapter!

Why not? The way I see it, he wouldn't call himself Mazda (for the reason mentioned above), and he would definitely not call himself Mewtwo. He'll get asked what his name is by someone, post-escape, and he'll have an internal monologue about it, and he'll decide to use Prime out of habit, if nothing else, mark my words :D

***** Oh right, I had forgotten that Mewtwo stopped liking the name Mazda.

I agree that he will probably choose a name for himself eventually, but I still don't think Mewtwo would pick Prime because that's just the name his tulpas use because they seek direction from it. Also because in my personal opinion that would be kind of dumb to call himself Prime, but I can't really defend that reason, haha. I would probably start to inadvertently imagine Optimus Prime fighting the legendary birds!

**** I don't think it will happen to that extreme, I just suspect that something along that spectrum will occur. The creation of Victory will definitely tilt the plot /more/ than simply making Mewtwo better at combat. You can already sort of see how Victory already has all the others on the back foot even from birth. And as we saw with Safety who was suspicious of all the other tulpas (although not of prime) so it's possible for them to go into conflict.

We've already got a weird situation where Prime is effectively a naive character which is manipulated by the others while the partition is down, which means that Prime is not in full control of this situation.

** Daystar writing characters from pokemon: YOU get an alternate personality that isn't another person exactly but rather just another pattern of neurons firing in your mind that you aren't constantly aware of that you can consciously switch between, talk to, and share memories so it doesn't quite have the traits that would qualify it as dissociative identity disorder and neither personality can be called "real" or not because they are all the same self just with different outlooks but at the same time they are definitely not the same person even though they /are/ the same brain so it begs the question of what a "person" or the "self" is and--

--Anyway, I continue to be unable to predict this story (or start off a comment with anything other than a joke). Was not expecting a Mewtwo interlude, and was not expecting the tulpas. I'm dying to know how Sabrina detected Mewtwo's (Prime's) perfect partition, considering he's literally not even aware of it himself. I'm really impressed by your ability to show-not-tell by letting us feel that Mewtwo in the beginning was acting /off,/ but not straight out saying so. It's like Past Red in that he was still "Mewtwo", but the Mewtwo we knew wasn't quite there...then it turns out the guy just casually split himself into different Mewtwos that could guide his actions and then it made more sense.

** This sort of scenario, where not even your own thoughts are considered safe, and the ruse must be upheld for years on end all while advancing your own agenda, is one that comes up every now and again in sci-fi/fantasy.

This is the first time that I've enjoyed it. Mewtwo is explicitly superhuman, and it doesn't break my suspension of disbelief that he can do it. I find all the tulpas to be amazing to read, always scheming and analyzing beneath the surface only to occasionally send single thoughts or emotions to the surface, and always doubting, always analyzing, never feeling safe, contrasted with the happy and friendly prime who they gently puppet/serve/subvert/are.

Giovanni being their opponent is also incredible. Given his role in the story, he should be considered HPMoR!Voldemort levels of smart and prepared. All that scheming might really be necessary.

** Yes Mewtwo chapter!

It looks like Red's multithreading theory is the most correct. Currently Red's aspects can't be detected, so if he (or Rowan) figured out how to keep them /active/ without merging that'd replicate what Mewtwo's doing. Heck he's already had live discussions between his aspects back in the psych visit chapter, without apparent partition swapping.

When did Zapdos pass over Cinnabar, was this an unrelated attack from the one the gang faced? Did they simulate the experience with a more mundane storm and some lesser, unseen pressure user (like the Absol)?

I'm still really curious about what exactly happened that prompted Sabrina's task/AWOL, it doesn't look like she suspects anything yet. Fingers crossed for a double interlude!

** I wonder how Mewtwo discovered tulpas in the first place? Also why exactly can they be shoved behind a partition and evade the mind scanning for the partition while still being able to influence Mewtwo at all?

But also like there's certainly a part of me that wonders about the you know psychological issues that would ensue from the lack of physical comfort and nurturing that a human would need in his(?)/it's(?)/they(?) place. Like we have more than a little reason to believe that Mewtwo is at least of Human equivalent intelligence/awareness/sapience/whatever, but given that they are a new species and with a new biology it's not my first assumption that they would need to be cared for as a human would in order to not face developmental issues. Or like even within say real life animals there is a lot of information that a lion cub does not receive when raised by people to the point that they need to be taught/trained to be able to exist in their natural habitat. Of course it's that's not a perfect metaphor for the current situation, but like how do you determine normal for a being that's the first/only one of it's kind?

I'm inclined to believe this is a mistake because (iirc) Mewtwo isn't supposed to be aware of his tulpa's existence while his mind is partitioned, and I like Crystal Society the tulpas can't fast track anything directly to the surface, just concepts and memories. If this was intentional I'm interested in what it implies.

** This was a really good chapter. I actually ended up waking up in the middle of the night and planning out how an eventual confrontation between Giovanni and Mewtwo would go, assuming the desired end result is a narrow action packed Mewtwo escape. You may have something different in mind, like a stealthy section where Mewtwo escapes via teleportation before they even finish realizing he's not on their side, or maybe Giovanni WINS and shuts down a Mewtwo escape by planning THAT well. And if so, that's fine too and I will happily read them! But since I really felt inspired about this, I wanted to share:

First, it seems inevitable that a confrontation will happen and you've set it up nicely. Giovanni and Sabrina are skeptical that Mewtwo is being honest about fighting prowess. The general approach to dealing with a Pokemon that isn't doing what you want, but that you don't want to kill, is to put it in a pokeball, because they come pre-equipped with training and analytic technology. Giovanni has pokeballs that work on sentient targets. There is no way I can imagine Mewtwo accepting being put into a pokeball. It would be weird if Giovanni didn't think to do this, unless I missed something about the scenario, although since I can predict it will lead to trouble, he can too. But if you assume that Mewtwo is going to resist being put into a pokeball, a confrontation might go something like this:

Giovanni assumes that Mewtwo will resist being put into a pokeball, and also that because they are generally skeptical of his mental state, it's not safe to assume he is actually sleeping when he is sleeping. So while he is sleeping, under guard, he gets a Wigglytuff or some other sedative style pokemon to further deepen his sleep.

Mewtwo has multiple partitions, so likely a front partition will fall asleep, but a rear one (Victory) will not. So the initial pokeball probably gets deflected at it's user and sucks him up instead. A bunch of backup pokeballs get tossed at Mewtwo by the rooms guard trainers, and he deflects them all back at their users. All of the trainers had their pokemon told to take backup orders from Giovanni, so Giovanni orders their pokemon to attack. Mewtwo endures the fastest attacks (priority breakers like Quick Attack) while he tears down the ceiling and uses it as a shield to block the dark attacks that are a bit slower. Mewtwo is hurt, but can continue to tear through ceilings to fly right out.

Giovanni will guess healing is available (otherwise Mewtwo would know it would be doomed in an escape attempt) and will shrug off suggestions that Mewtwo is dying and immediately calls in reinforcements, led by Sabrina to find him. Those reinforcements teleport in to some nearby point that had been previously kept out of Mewtwo's line of sight (I can't imagine they'd want him having practice teleportation until he's VERY trusted) But Mewtwo has been hiding his talent at psychic powers, so he can reverse engineer the effect to teleport back to where the reinforcements teleported from, and then heal and fly away. This also sets up, but doesn't require, Mewtwo running into Red in some sort of early appearance, if Sabrina teleported from her Gym to get there.

Thanks for writing and I look forward to the next chapter!
