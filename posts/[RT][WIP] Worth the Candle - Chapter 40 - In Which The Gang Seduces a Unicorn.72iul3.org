** I'm curious how unicorns are born since they're these solitary virgin-harem-seeking creatures. Conceived by nature, parthenogenesis? With a low reproductive rate, I have this notion that they'd be an endangered species (so Joon can't capitalize on farming them for quick skill-ups), what with the wealthy's penchant for seeking panaceas/highs (look at rhino horns, and that's considering they're practically snake oil). They're absurdly hard to fight in a frontal assault, but they have that obvious glaring weakness that the party exploited. I can imagine the rich kidnapping or hiring virgins to use in similar ploys. Virgin sacrifice would take on a whole new meaning.

In other news, worldbuilding fans rejoice! I poked the author with a few questions and was undeservedly rewarded with some nuggets of details.

--------------

- How could Larkspur afford Fireteam Blackheart when Anglecynn's black budget couldn't muster the authorization and funds for retrieving a billion obol (ideal expected investment value over a short 5+ years) item? By their own admission, they were a below-strength team, so they could have been a disposable insurance policy sent on a low-cost, high-risk, high-reward mission. But given their relative effectiveness, it was a pretty high value gamble.

#+begin_quote
  Amaryllis was part of one faction of the Lost King's Court within Anglecynn, while Larkspur is part of a different one. It's not "Anglecynn's black budget" so much as "the budget that could be moved around by one faction without accountability checks or information leaking". I can't remember how much of the background is actually littered around the text thus far, but the Amaryllis-faction was at the point where they knew they were probably going to have to admit that they had lost the key and that they were setting up this secret research facility, and were hoping that they could wait it out so as to lessen the political impacts of this revelation. And then Amaryllis gets this kangaroo-court indictment, which she thinks she can/will be freed from, and things go to shit from there. Larkspur, meanwhile, is Foreign Security Director, so he's drawing on different budgets and working within different constraints. (The whole thing is basically a clusterfuck of overlapping plots, poor information timing, half-measures, and coverups being worse than the crime.)
#+end_quote

- "because the teleportation key we had was ridiculously valuable and if anyone saw us arrive they would either try to take it from us, or go tell someone who would then try to take it from us."

  Why is their group so cautious in this regard? How are they at any more risk than a regular group of 5 people traveling to a touchstone (and assuming hundreds of keys are used multiple times daily)? Touchstones suggest routine usage and an officially sanctioned terminal. Supposing you can't trust some (Barren Jewel), aren't most safe? Or does each local polity have their own version of the TSA to vet arrivals?

#+begin_quote
  Private ownership of a teleportation key is basically unheard of, and unscheduled travel to a touchstone is also basically unheard of. Going to a touchstone would basically be like an unregistered 747 appearing over La Guardia airport and requesting to land; it would be cause for alarm. And yes, teleportation keys are one of the things covered under imperial law, so almost every polity does have a regulatory agency that deals with teleportation keys, if only because losing a teleportation key is a very big deal that gets lots of attention. (Teleportation into a private place like Weik Handrum would usually be handled by traveling from a touchstone and then sending the teleportation key back via bulk teleportation, with the inherent risk covered by an extensive and expensive insurance contract and significant collateral, often with an officially authorized 'rider' who is trusted and presumably lowers risk (and the involvement of a lot of major players in the event of theft or loss).) Oh, and then some of the keys are held under exemptions from imperial laws, almost exclusively by state actors, who typically use them outside the systems of touchstones for a variety of reasons. Normally they would have a ready-room prepared ahead of time and use personnel who had been there, or in rare circumstances they would pre-schedule arrival via touchstone (which leaks information about movements and capabilities, and if you're going to do that, better and less expensive to just use the public keys).

  None of these answers are canonical until they make it into the story, which they might not.

I wonder if its like in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality where unicorn blood quickly loses its power and potency once its out of the unicorn, otherwise they just wasted an enormous amount of healing potential. She only drank a handful of it and it healed everything, a horse has roughly 50 litres of blood, thats a lot of unicorn blood tinctures. And even if the blood lost its power once out of the unicorn, you could still keep the unicorn alive while farming it. Keep it in some kind of immobility enclosure while you bled it whenever you needed it.

Why not? The fact that (in Ch. 33) the revision mage could change his actions after revising himself from dying so that he dodged Joon's attacks (which previously hit) suggests that he did retain his memories. Or at least that, if he doesn't, there are ways to get around that.

****** I took that to mean that the revision mage was expecting Joon to perfectly replay his actions (because Joon wouldn't remember), but Joon was behaving differently each time (because he /did/ remember), which was perplexing. And which the revision mage would only notice if he /also/ remembered.

I favor this interpretation because the story is pretty solidly locked into a first-person limited viewpoint, so Joon shouldn't have been able to describe the qualia of rewinding+replaying if he didn't remember it. He'd have just described the final replay + time suddenly jumping forward.

My guess on /why/ this is, is that while Joon's body is "in" the world-sim and vulnerable to physics skullduggery, Joon's /mind/ is an external brain-em program being synced to that world-sim, and as such is not affected by in-world time travel. It's Joon's "game avatar" that was trapped in the time effect, not Joon himself. He was there on the layer above the sim, "watching" as the sim's full-dive UI reported the whole revisioning thing.

******** Hmm. On the one hand (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  and the thing was /I knew this was happening/, I had read all about it in the Commoner's Guide, I knew that single combat with a revision mage was essentially pointless, I knew that I *must have been* landing those hits because there was no way that he was dodging from blows he couldn't even see coming.
#+end_quote

So, yes, each swing was his "first" swing according to his memories.†

But on the other hand (again, emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  But I also saw Amaryllis, who *to my fractured perception was teleporting down the hallway towards us*, holding a sword hilt in her hand, and after the third time I hit Colwin, I stopped just shy, because Amaryllis was right next to him and he had a sword sticking straight through his head.
#+end_quote

If Joon means "teleporting" as in once---from far away to very nearby---then that coheres with the above. But if he means "teleporting" as in a series of steps, then something more complex is going on.

My own (new) guess: the revision mage doesn't rewind time "all the way" to the same previous moment each time. Therefore, there are bits of memory left "at the beginning" of the fight that are scraps of the beginnings of each rewind that were not completely overwritten, which are experienced as the external world making discontinuous progress quite quickly around them as the revision mage repeatedly uses their power.

/If/ this is true, then I wonder if it's an inherent property of revision magic, or maybe of /imperfectly performed/ revision magic (i.e. revision magic not skill-levelled to 100; or revision magic done in a hurry under distracted conditions.) I would expect that one could "take 20" to do unopposed revision magic perfectly, neatly erasing back to the same keyframe each time.

† In this instance, Joon probably attacked with "the same" series of attacks each time, so the revision mage was doing what was essentially a tool-assisted speedrun of a deterministic fighting-game CPU opponent. But, given a little cleverness, and the "imperfect erasure implies an advancing temporal context outside the bubble" hypothesis above, Joon might be /able to/ counter with /different/ swings each time! This is sort of like the thing Harry did in HPMOR with the piece of paper and the Time-Turner---it's numbering your "self" given a context, and then changing your action depending on which "self" you turn out to be. In Joon's case, he could look at the world outside the bubble, do a quick heuristic "hash" of what's unique about it, and then strike based on an index of that hash into a mental table of possible attacks.

********* I think you're overthinking this. What happens, if you read the chapter:

1. Glove comes out, Amaryllis shoots Aumann, Joon hits Rev mage with paperweight.

2. Joon + Rev mage rewind, Joon does the same swing, Rev mage dodges.

3. Joon swings again (after having done the first swing) and hits.

4. Rev mage reverses that hit. Now to Joon's perception he has already swung once and missed and is on his second swing.

5. Joon does another swing, which misses.

6. After the third swing (which initially hit) has been reversed, enough time has passed for Amaryllis to reach the mage and stick him with the sword.

So at the start of each swing, Joon would have seen Amaryllis appear to teleport closer.

There are a few other things we can infer about Revision Magic from the text:

- It appears to be a targeted effect. Earlier in the same chapter Joon sees the gold mage send some bullets out to test for wards, which are then reversed back with Revision Magic. If Revision Magic was affecting the entire world, or even just a large area, he wouldn't see the bullets fly back in reverse. Nothing would have happened at all from his perspective. This happens several times in the chapter, for example:

#+begin_quote
  And then I was treated to the sight of those ball bearings reversing their motion and coming back to him as he rose up from the ground, with movements that made no sense unless physics were running in reverse. I dashed forward, sword drawn, none too hopeful about my chances, and brought the Anyblade down in the form of a two-handed greatsword that nearly clipped the ceiling, right as I saw the hole in Aumann's forehead fill in with flesh.
#+end_quote

- Revision Magic doesn't affect "time" at all; just causes "physics to run in reverse" within a target area/object/person. Everything suggests that this happens at the same speed as the original events, in the reverse direction. Could also explain why it can't reverse magic; magic essentially produces physical discontinuities, so the (physical) simulation would have undefined behaviour if it tried to get past those. The important takeaway is that revision takes time to happen, while the rest of the world continues as normal.

#+begin_quote
  The Anyblade hit him in the head and clanged off him, twisting in my hands. Aumann stared at me in confusion for just a second, then brushed the Anyblade with the back of his hand, sending it flying from my grip and through the wall, breaking several bones in my hand. Then he touched me and the world lurched sideways.
#+end_quote

This is Aumann, the gold mage (not the revision mage), just after he's been revised from dying to the first void rifle shot; there's several reasons he'd be confused. Joon is physically attacking him (pointless against a gold mage), and from his perspective Joon appeared out of nowhere.

However, as far as we can see, the text suggests that the revision mage /does/ retain memories of what he revises, because he dodges Joon's attacks after revising them away. Nothing suggests that Joon is somehow changing his attacks with each revision.

  Essentialism: What is it?
#+end_quote

I think it's programming.

In reality, essentialism is, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism][as Wikipedia is kind to note]], a philosophical concept which suggests that "every entity has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function". Essentialism as a game skill would be, then, about manipulating fundamental properties of things. Since our primary hypothesis is that Aerb is a simulation, it stands to reason that fundamental properties of things are defined by programming code; this skill is used to manipulate it.

Perhaps on higher levels it would allow Juniper to hack into the root account of the computer simulating Aerb.

*Edit:* Or perhaps it would be read-only. I.e., it would allow Juniper to read the code, gathering objectively true and complete information about his surroundings, but not edit anything.

(Of course, it could just be "metamagic", i.e. the practice of creating magics such as blood/bone/velocity/flower ones. Would be less SoD-breaking, and fit the theme of everything technically being latent magic. Would be much less exciting.)

(Or maybe it's just to argue philosophy really good.)

**** Sweet thanks for the clarification - just going by how you write it seemed like you wouldn't be the type to leave things like that hanging, and you seem to keep a good balance of exposition/world building and actual stuff, so can't fit much more in hah

Love your work!

*** To be clear "In Which the Gang Seduces a Unicorn" is not the actual chapter title, but when the chapter was posted it didn't have one, because I forgot (which I do on occasion).

I almost /did/ take the title of this post as the actual chapter title, because I thought it was hilarious, but settled on "The Feminine Mystique", which is the title of the book largely responsible for sparking second-wave feminism.

**** Yeah. I'd say a higher-level Joon should start farming Unicorns after stat-heavy level ups, but the way they took this one out seemed pretty unique and non-repeatable. But, now he knows what's up with them, and the next time they'll all be higher level...

For those who don't know, it refers to a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/27ujw5/oc_pancakes_nsfw/][story]] originally posted to [[/r/HFY]] which resulted in pancakes being a reference to sex like coffee is in sitcoms.

*** The armor is immovable not invulnerable. Its ability to resist damage when locked comes from its ability to hold each molecule of the armor in place. Now, the immovable rod, which this is based on, should really be called the very hard to move rod, because you can move it with a strength check of 30, or a natural 20 plus 30 STR (this is very high for normal D&D play). However that is to move the entire armor. To move a much smaller point section of armor, say a few grams of metal, would take much lower strength (or in physics terms, total force applied).

It's similar to how a bullet and a fist have roughly the same kinetic energy (ballparked) but a bullet has far far greater penetrating power.

(I will confess to not actually having run the physics for this, if someone else wants to, and the show that I'm wrong about relative force of an arrow and a unicorn, or at least the assumptions you'd need, let me know.)

(On mobile, apologies.)

***** 50 m/s is pretty close to the right speed for an arrow, so you'll note that if an arrow takes .1 seconds to stop, it travels about 2.5 meters (uniform deceleration) while stopping.

To recalculate, I'll note that for these sort of situations with unknown timescales, it is generally best to use an energy-based analysis, and... if the arrow got its energy from being pushed by a force of 0-linearly-to-450N through 1m, then a force of 4500N (1000 lbs) would stop it in .05m (We hope the dents can be beat back out!)

So unless the immobility plate affords the entirety of the protection to the point of impact, rather than having volumetrically distributed immobility, it won't do much better against arrows than

Also note that 1000 pounds is roughly (order-of-magnitude) what you're going to need to push a 1/2" diameter point through 2mm thick mild steel (calculation omitted due to obscene number of assumptions) AND that 1000 lbs over the area of a 1/2" diameter arrowshaft is about 5000 PSI - about the compressive strength of strong woods. (At which point the the shaft splinters into little bits, mostly decoupling the weight of the arrow-shaft from the collision, and so decreasing the energy available for armor-peircing by a factor of three or so)

This is, of course, probably why the armor in question was about 2mm thick: any armor good enough that it'll block everything but a dead-on shot is good enough. (Incidentally, it looks like arrows are going to follow a linear-square rule: an arrow twice as big takes twice as much force to push through, but is four times as strong. Followed by an application of the square-cube law for drawing arrows, this will show why giants don't bother with armor when fighting other giants, while gnomish warfare mostly involves holding the enemy down while drilling holes - when the field is too muddy for the the sterotypical seige and explosive weaponry.)
