Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You/humanity has the ability to upload skills and memories into brains. (Like in the movie Matrix)

(But not to make the brain faster. Or to mind control people directly. Or read unwilling minds, if willing they can still lie.)

How would that impact society? What could be done with it?

*** Evidently, you could make your population completely educated at a masters level in every subject at an extremely young age.

Depending on the speed of upload (same rate as the Matrix?), unpleasantness and other limitations, but if memories can be uploaded why not upload entire lives of experience, especially the lives of extremely intelligent people?

You'd on one hand gain a form of mind-copying-immortality for very intelligent people (or anyone who knows or pays someone to accept their memories), but all in all everyone could potentially have hundreds of lives of experience to draw from, and make choices with the benefit of the very best experts in any subject, much like how we today can watch youtube series by the very best educators on a particular subject whereas before we'd be limited to whoever taught it at our school.

Hard to imagine how this would affect society, but I imagine whoever got the tech first would become an economic powerhouse of extremely valued hypercompetent citizens, though it's also possible some stagnation may happen as people are trained with the memories of older people that are set in their ways.

A profession would likely open up where one would be manually educated in subjects so that they may sell their memories of the new lessons that humanity has learned (in addition to the memories of the people that made the new discoveries, including the step-by-step process and their own feelings on what happened).

Altogether, I imagine it would be a /lot/ harder to control these people against their will and in many ways you'd get a singularity effect that would leave society unrecognizable to anyone who was not brought up in it.

*** There's a lot hinging on the requirements; for instance is the hardware expensive or otherwise resource constrained, or can you grab a random baby off the street and stuff their brains full of kung fu. Is there a diminishing returns to the skills, or acclimatisation period? In /Matrix/ Neo knew kung fu, but he still needed time to actualise the knowledge, so while the transfer was pretty much instantaneous, there was still an adaptation period to fully utilise the skill. Where do skills come from? As in, do I pour a dozen ‘X for Dummies', ‘Advanced X for Dummies', and so on books into a magical skill renderer, or do I need to grab a master in X and (perhaps destructively) extract the skill from their skull mush? Are skills completely replicable, are there a limited amount of copies/transfers per source, or does the upload of a skill use up the skill source? All these will impact the resulting society, but in drastically different ways.

That being said, a couple scenarios:

The vast majority of work force will switch to day labourers, if for any given position anyone can do the job. If anyone can have the skill to do anything, the skill of anyone doing anything will take a backseat to their willingness to work.

Alternatively, there may be synergy advantages that aren't immediately apparent. If anyone can do anything, the teamwork cohesion may be a much bigger factor than anyone's ability (or inability) to do a job. Expect any entrance test to be much more about the interviewees personality, and how well they will fit and comply to the expected position on a team or company.

*Skill =/= Talent*. The majority of work will be done by peons for minimum wage, since everyone is replaceable, but the real moneymaker will be those with certain talents. Anyone can manage people / program apps / bake cake decently well, but if you're a natural born talent, you will be that much better at it. View it as a multiplier of some kind, normal people all have 1, but talented people will have 1.1 or 5 or something in the skillset they're talented in. Depending on the skillset, this will reflect in their wage. A talented manager being 1.1 times as good as any other run-of-the-mill manager will make the more money, the more they can make use of their advantage. A similarly talented manager in a small company versus large company would safe the bigger one more money, and could therefore expect a that much higher wage, even though they're not actually better than the similarly talented manager in the smaller company. The more you can leverage your talent, the more you'll be worth and above the peons.

Kind of like cutie marks, except not.

Interestingly enough this would incentivise talent search massively, especially early on in one's life. People would change skills as quickly as often until they found something they would be better at than average, maybe merely marginally so.

On the other hand, if the *upload of skills is limited*, be that resources, capability, or time, spending the limiting factor to find one's talent will be a sign of status. Particularly since I don't expect people to only have one talent, but to be mostly on a spectrum for everything skillable. Imagine a rich person (that is, someone with a significant talent, or child/relative/protégée of such a person) idly jacking up skills to find a hobby and discarding things they have ‘only' minor talents in, while a peon with a minor talent in cleaning or some such is cleaning up the neighbouring room. The latter could be the next Mozart, but never had the resources to try for the less numerous (but still well-paying) skill and just stuck with the first skill they had /some/ talent in, regardless of the magnitude of the talent.

Damn. The more I think on this, the more I want to write it.

*Another scenario*: Assume harsh restriction on the skill. Either it takes a lot of money, or time (but still less than actual training), or the brain can deal with uploading skills only for very few times (reminded of /Rainbows End/ here...). Past a certain point school may very well be a tasting ground for a big variety of skills, all to be trained to some small level, and then rigorously tested to ascertain if they have a talent for it, or simply enjoy it, and only then will the skill be uploaded. Instead of paying off student loans everyone will pay off skilling loans, and there will be quite a few people who are good at something, but don't particularly enjoy it; false positive, for whom the skill selected was wrong, and they'll be stuck with a skill they're not good in and a big dept to pay off.

Or *destructive scanning*: Master Miyagi is dead, but hey, at least you know kung fu, right? If the thusly acquired skill can be copied there'll be a flourishing black market in skills less than legally acquired, but there'll also be a big market for mastering useful skills and bequeathing the earnings.

Again, a whole lot of potential to explore here. The whole concept of skill uploads is a bit like Asimov's Robot Laws; ostensibly simple, yet surprisingly facetted.

**** Hey thanks for the reply, I hope, I can answer what I was thinking about that scenario.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Not too expansive, I think, maybe the hardware is as expansive as cars. 600€ cars exist (they will break soon, and many other drawbacks), middle prize (gets an upload in maybe 10min-1h) and expensive ones too (to be 10% faster, price doubles).

#+end_quote

I would say, it works like in the Matrix. You upload it and then have to train it/your body, depending on the skill/knowledge. And let's just say babies wouldn't remember it/their brain would get fried.

#+begin_quote
  Where do skills come from? As in, do I pour a dozen ‘X for Dummies', ‘Advanced X for Dummies', and so on books into a magical skill renderer, or do I need to grab a master in X and (perhaps destructively) extract the skill from their skull mush? Are skills completely replicable, are there a limited amount of copies/transfers per source, or does the upload of a skill use up the skill source? All these will impact the resulting society, but in drastically different ways.
#+end_quote

Creating a skill can be done in two ways. You could create it from nothing, with describing how all the kung fu moves work. (Problems like maybe impossible moves, and more time is needed to train and adapt it to your body. It is preferred to do this for knowledge.) Or you scan people using that skill. (Which is easier to do for skills, but the skills may be incomplete or mixed with other stuff or so much adapted, that the kung fu move only works for that body with that weight. So they may use more than one source.) And near unlimited copies/transfers.

For example, you copy swimming from one athlete who can also hold his breath for ~5min. You judge now a flooded hallway, if you can dive through it with his downloaded expertise and can't make it through, cause you are not in his body and being slower and not able to hold your breath for that long.

Oh, and a defective skill/knowledge maybe only gives a headache. And you couldn't access it, cause it is defective.

So maybe 'X for Dummies' might be more like 'X for untrained'.

I'm not sure what you mean with talent. If you mean, that some people have better bodies for running, than I agree. Or maybe better fine control of their hands, so they can draw better. What society calls talent, is some form of an inherent trait, that isn't biological (Like heigth, or bigger lungs or being not right handed, thinner blood vessels... ). I think outside of advantages, like height, talent is mostly training (which can be done for fun). I had a classmate that could draw dinos better with 10 than most I know can draw anything. But he draw since he was very little for fun. The time I watched TV, he would draw. I was good with numbers. I liked to add numbers mentioned in ads for fun.

Also, I think at some point of skill level, it is hard to distinguish who is better (or more talented). For example you don't need to be a super genius to play tic-tac-toe to never lose.

But I like your idea of talent searching phase for school. Maybe with the difference, that they would look for skills, that would get them paid the most. (Being the only trash collector, can get you more money, than being a doctor like 50% of the population. Or the master skill to draw is less paid, than the average skill to work excel.) Or just for skills for a job they would like, that pays enough.

Since the creation of skills is not destructive, nor is it to harsh restricted the last scenarios don't work. Still I think there would be a blackmarket (more like dark web) for restricted skills like lockpicking or how to kill. And skill loans has also potential.

I know, I can't believe nobody found that technology in the matrix as awesome as I. The reality bending power is clearly impossible, but we could make memory editing a real thing. (Of course dark city does raise some questions about how ethical that is. But the movie goes more into identity.)

#+begin_quote

Just write about it, I would like to see more stuff about it. In LitRPG you see people getting knowledge of magical abilities or other skill by just leveling up (or rarely investing skill points) and there is no one thinking of using that. Or in DND you can put false memories into someone, but no teacher uses it for good. (Well, I recently read Aeromancer, and one who could do that, says it was stupid, all are afraid of mind control.)

***** Now that I think about it, skill download is the in-universe mechanic for levelling up in Eve Online. Well, ‘levelling' is more appropriate; all players are basically limited to skill uploads, and the process can range in duration from a couple minutes to months, depending on how far along the 5-step ladder you are and what the difficulty of the skill is.

/Talent/ was just a name to call what skill people would be good at regardless. To take your dino dude; he may or may not have talent, but he has joy in what he does and therefore put in the work to get good at it. But regardless of that, people are different, and I feel this would need to be reflected in some quality. The saying is, one needs to do something for 10,000 hours to be good at it. But I surmise that's an average; there'll be people who'll be good at it in 5,000 hours, while others will take 30,000. That's one way to view talent, a predisposition to get good at something. Even if everyone had access to downloadable skills, the moment they start using it, they'll get experience in it. Some will have an easier time to make use of the skill, others will have more trouble because they're innately not predisposed to it.

You mentioned body, and in your example people with the means to get many downloads would have a big incentive to keep fit and limber, to make the most of general skills. If you have the means you could look exclusively for skills that fit your dimensions; instead of downloading /Karate (General)/ you'd look for (and also pay more for) /Karate ([Insert body type], [Insert height], [Insert fitness level])/. In this example there'd be a decent market for people who downloaded general karate to physically train the skill until they're of sufficient proficiency, and then to offer the same skill, but individualised to /Karate (lean body, 160 cm, low fitness)/ or something.

****** I think the rich would even pay people with the same body type to train in the skill they need/want.

Some of my ideas:

- Engineers could just become experts i other fields if they need it for work.

- Workers may be required to upload relevant skills, when they leave the company.

- There would be less dogmatic religions. And those would try to give you their edited holy texts as a download. (There are probably some crazy cults too, cause there are always crazy cults.)

- there would be many self-help stuff. That probably doesn't help more than books from today.

- there would be many prank skills, like How to punch through a wall, (like the scale apps for your phone)

- I would like to think, humanity as a whole would be nicer, cause they can download memories of people in war zones, but not even I am that optimistic.

- Not sure how much entertainment memories are. I rarely remember a good meal, when I could just eat one. But I think some form would be made.

- debates could be fundamentally altered, and the debaters give you their arguments as a download.

- And politics too. The voter can be an expert on everything and check polices too. There would be probably more than one scandal of politicians giving away highly biased (or even lying) downloads.

*** Uploading memories is extremely abusable. Sure it doesn't let you mind control someone directly, but the only limit to your mind control is your creativity (and your ability to create the appropriate memory uploads). For example, I could upload the following memories to some victim X:

- Memories of another person's life, in a world similar to our own but with better technology.
- Memories of playing a virtual reality game where the virtual reality is indistinguishable from our reality, and the player gains memories of their character whenever they log in.
- Memories of gaining the memories of the actual life of X.

This could lead X to believe that he is in a virtual reality game, and that his real memories are simply the memories of his character. I can then manipulate his actions by changing the game objectives. For instance, I could make him think that this world is a virtual reality Grand Theft Auto game, and thus prompt him to go on missions like killing people I choose and robbing banks.

I think the more likely scenario than what dontnod (dev of above game) came up with is that everyone would torrent around/upvote memories until the biggest, best orgasm anyone's ever head floats up to the top and then most people would just wirehead all day long and society would collapse. That doesn't make for a very fun game though.

Alternatively, this would become a new type of drug and all the other memory experiences would become a new form of media where companies compete to provide the most thrilling memories while staying below the legal limit of an orgasm.

Alternatively, someone comes up with a latent virus and sends it around along with a memory of an orgasm. Then you either have the book snow crash or collapse of society.

*** it pretty much depends on the willingness of the government to let a company commercialize the technology, of if the government tries to regulate it.

In the first case, and if I was the company accomplished this feat, I would probably start by collecting complementary "samples" from highly skilled people in order to build a "complete skill package". Once an "up-to-date" package is constituted, I would maintain different versions for increasing prices. And perhaps develop a "premium membership" where each subscriber can get updated regularly.

Of course I would try to maintain my monopoly for a time, and I would /obviously/ not include this technology in the package I sell, but with that much super-intelligent people around, the secret would not be long hidden.

But at that point, I would have ensured an exclusive agreement with the greatest minds of the time in order to offer the best "data package" any company can offer.

I am not sure about the second case. Uploading a full-package to everyone would definitely upset the balance of power, and even then we would probably have to wait for each citizen to reach majority for their personalities to "set in", or we would basically have a single mind in billions of bodies.

But think of it more like Gutenbergs mechanicle printing. Your company would just be the only one selling books.

And democratic government shouldn't force inprint people. But still offer it as education, without propaganda/biases if possible. The single mind in billions is something I want to avoid, so no direct mind control.

I think "complete skill packages" like you are describing, wouldn't be efficient. More data/skills means more needs to be trained at once. (Remember in Matrix Neo still has to train.) But schools were you could buy into courses that goes through one skill at a time would be nice. I like your idea of a company that sells the 'best' skills. With the right marketing they could have a good markup. And people could buy skills and say they are from Company. Like a iPhone or more like a prestige college.

It would be very hard to inforce copyright. Since people could just copy their Company skills and resell them Government regulation would be needed for that.

*** Sure reminds me of /that timeline splitter from worm/ in a few ways -- you're most vulnerable when you make a save state. This imposes a few ground rules, such as

- Don't get drunk/high in fear of accidentally setting your point
- Don't move your point forwards unless you've reached the state you're assigning yourself to a few times, and are confident that it's safe
- In timelines for which you intend to advance your save point, avoid alerting anyone about the nature of your ability until after your save.

In general, if you play your cards right, you can become president / immortal / damm near anything. Just set a save point when you turn 5 years old or so, and live a hundred lives. It would be worth it to investigate if there are others with this (or any) supernatural powers, and if so, understand their powers well. I would be most concerned about people who can disable or steal your power, as well as those who could force you to move your save point. Otherwise, in most cases, a problem can be disappeared by a simple rollback of time (this is inconvenient if this runthrough is 50 years in the making)

Save scum the stock market, halt natural disasters, fund promising research, give advance knowledge to researchers to accelerate their work. I could convince my parents that I'm competent at 5, if I had todays mind! Depending on how the mind interacts with the younger body, it might be worth going farther back even. If you do everything right, you'll have functionally unlimited money. Use this money to hire huge teams of individuals to compose the absolute optimal encoding of the information you want to send back to your "past" self. Hire specalist tutors whose lifes work is teaching you this message. Each time, when you arrive back in your 5yo body, write down as much of that information as you can remember.

Just a little bit of bootstrapping, and you can accumulate a tremendous amount money using stock market and lottery future information. Now we're cooking with gas.

Each time you pass through life, doing this optimal encoding, provided that you are satisfied with this pass, you write down all of that information and advance your save point by a day or two (however long it takes for you to write everything down), afterwards going on to live the next life. Essentially, you have become a future information pump, devoting an entire lifetime into sending back a few hundred pages worth of written content.

Concerns would mostly revolve around other people with powers, and shadowy governmental agencies getting on your case. For this reason, it might be important to try and hide the nature of your powers. Part of this would surely involve doing as many iterations as possible without alerting your 5yo parents that you have this power, or without them alerting the rest of the world that you do. That would be somewhat tricky, but winning the lottery for them or making impossible stock predictions, might help.

Unless there are some higher-tier powers enforcing their worldview on mortal sophonts, what constitutes a murder (and a bad kind of murder that needs to be avoided) would depend on a character's personal morality system. So no objective definitions of good, evil, death, murder, etc (unless there was a way to determine what the “administrators” of the experiment are expecting of the “test subjects”).

*** Explain my power to NASA.

An implication: while in orbit, negating gravity is equivalent to imparting a 1G upwards acceleration to an object (as it tries to fly away from the Earth on a tangent line).

I would convince them to make me an astronaut so I can use my power to boost the ISS to a higher orbit--a necessary part of station keeping--for free. By negating gravity at different parts of the ship I can affect its rotation as well, essentially tipping the station by accelerating one side away from the Earth. That would also be useful for station keeping.

***** It doesn't need to invert it! Canceling it is sufficient. That's the beauty. Of course, canceling it is an inversion of sorts.

The ISS has a large velocity in some direction. Earth's gravity accelerates the mass toward the earth, bending that vector. It's in free fall, though, so nothing inside the ISS notices. Anything suddenly unaffected by Earth's gravity that's in orbit would fly off--which from inside the ISS would look like an acceleration away from the Earth. The object would hit the side of the ISS and start trying to pull it up with it because it still has inertia, even if gravity is ignoring it.

To think of it another way: suppose I use my power on myself, and I'm floating. Then a friend drops a rock out of a window. If I catch it and don't use my power on it, does it pull me down? Do I slow its fall, because it has to accelerate me? Then the rock is experiencing a force from interacting with me, even though I was only floating, and that force is opposite the direction of gravity.

*** Quick question: Negate gravity means Earth's gravity doesn't affect me? Because there's a bit of leeway, like, I'm now actively repelled by Earth, or actively repelled by everything in the solar system, or actively repelled by everything in the universe, and there a lot of scenarios where I go /splat/.

So assuming local gravity is annulled, not inverted, meaning I can make double my mass weightless. Hm...

Okay, another question, does that mean I have to be part of the gravity annulment, or can I annul a crate double my mass and move that while merrily walking on the ground? If this is the case, follow up: what's the distance limitation? Touch?

**** How would you become an infinite energy source though? Nullifying the gravity of two times your body mass doesn't immediately strike me as a method of generating large amounts of energy. The energy would be "free", but the production would be too low to make a significant impact on your life or the world.

Unless... you fatten yourself up to a ridiculous amount. Heck more than that, grow body parts in vitro and then surgically insert them into yourself ad infinitum, rapidly increasing your own body mass far beyond human limits and thus increasing the amount of mass you can nullify gravity on.

****** That doesn't really work. A standard electric generator converts kinetic energy into electrical energy. Your ability doesn't create kinetic energy, it just prevents the kinetic energy that is already there from being converted into gravitational potential energy. As a result, your ability doesn't actually create more kinetic energy for the generator to convert. You would get about the same amount of energy output just by plugging the battery of your fan directly into the generator output.

Now, if you negate gravity while going upwards, and then use normal gravity to accelerate downwards, that could be used to generate energy. But considering the limitations of earth gravity and twice your body mass, I doubt you would get a lot of energy this way (at least, relative to a power plant).

When an electrical generator creates electricity, that electrical energy doesn't spawn out of nothing, an equal amount of kinetic energy has to be removed from whatever magnet is looping around inside it.

So if you tried to continuously accelerate in a closed loop without a magnet: that will work. But if you try that with the magnet and the generator, you will notice that the magnet is pulling you backwards, slowing you down.

There are ways to get around it, like changing mass into energy, but that doesn't happen in a normal electrical generator. You can also create gravitational potential energy out of nothing using your ability by sending something upwards while negating its gravity, but unless you also do strange things like going to a black hole or increasing your body mass to a ridiculous extent, the energy created by your power will be limited to a relatively small amount of energy compared to what is produced in power plants.

***** Make a flywheel with two weights that weigh twice as much as you on either end. They have small extensions toward the center that allow you to touch them easily. Attach the axle to a generator. Spin it.

Energy output is the potential energy lost by the weight falling (the one that currently isn't weightless). That means you can get more power with a bigger flywheel or--crucially--a faster flywheel. Spin it a few thousand RPMs by rapidly flashing your power and your power output could be considerable.

A few thousand (3000) RPMs = 50 Rotations per second = 100 applications of your power per second. And you can't mess up any one of them, otherwise you would apply your power on the wrong weight and thus lose energy instead of gaining it. That's...

That's...

...actually doable if the power is automatic. Huh. You just need to touch the center, and make it such that the weights disconnect from the center before falling and reconnect before rising.

Worth researching what your power accepts as the definition of an object and its detection speed. Wonder what the power output would be.
