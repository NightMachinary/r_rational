** Ok, it's a /little/ disturbing when the Cosmic Mind-People take the same shape as Anti-Spirals.

And I do wonder how they had hyperspace, hyperspatial travel, and an eternal Cosmic AC and /couldn't/ reverse entropy much, much earlier. In fact, I find it hard to believe they figured out the nature of space and time and couldn't come to a conclusion about entropy.

Ah, well: I'm living much later than when Asimov wrote, and at least the Stelliferous Era is projected to last 100 trillion years rather than a mere 1 trillion.

Somehow the comic form is a perfect match for the themes of this story: the awe-inspiring vastness of the universe, the evolution of mankind into something radically different and yet still the same, the nearly religious feelings stirred up by thoughts of our inevitable death and extinction.

** Pretty male-dominated with no justification.

The story mentions vast population growth as a result of immortality. I strongly suspect that, once immortality is generally available, people will wait to have children until they are older, so the rate of new human construction relative to the existing population will go down. Of course, it would have to go down by more than half to make up for the lack of dying, and that only gets you back to the current population growth. (About 330,000 people were born and 150,000 people died each day, last I checked.)

Of course, that doesn't matter when you're measuring the time until the stars have all burnt out. Humans not using a star's energy output doesn't make the star last longer.

Without this being a justification: /real/ feminism has only been a thing for the past 20-40 years, depending on how much advancement of women you need to count it as /real/ feminism.

Asimov was committing a sin of his times.

Lots of women like to have children too. If you not a creationist the simple Darwinian fact that those that are better at reproducing become more numerouse over time is so obviouse it does not need explaining why people 20,000 years in the future are verry fecund. Human instinct to limit reproduction evolved in responce to historical resource shortages. The decedents of interstellar settlers would be descendants of the most fecund of the most fecund of each generation.

*** In the current modern period, novel cultural environments have neutralized allot of the historical triggers for peoples reproductive instincts. But over time those who are better at maximizing their reproductive potential will have more children, and many of these traits will be genetic, so over time these people with stronger reproductive instincts will become more numerous over coming generations. When they have grown to the majority of the population humans will regain the ability to reproduce exponentially when possible like all life unless some kind of Malthusian ceiling limits population growth. So a few thousand years after immortality is invented most people will be popping out as many babies as they can in their long lives because the population was created by parents who did so, and they will of inherited those traits. The future belongs to those who show up.

**** We've got research showing that cultural and environmental features have a huge bearing on the number of children people have. You're essentially taking it as an article of faith that those effects will go away. You're furthermore taking it as an article of faith that people will evolve to churn out as many infants as possible, with everyone who can bear a child being constantly pregnant, and that within just a handful of generations.

I see no reason to believe you.

***** Oh I know that culture has had a lot of influence on people reproduction other the last hundred years (if my post gave you the opposite impression your reading comprehension sucks), I also know that the spread of bacteria is inhibited by the application of antibiotics, but I also know that the continuous application of such inhibitors will breed resistant strains of bacteria. You're essentially taking it as an article of faith like a creationist that simple Darwinian principles dont apply to humans or their brains. But its really quite simple even tautological, those that are better and reproduction become more numerous over time. There are numerous studies that show that genetics has a very strong influence on peoples personalities and behavior identical twins adopted into different families unsurprisingly have near identical scores on all psychometric tests which is what you would expect if the brain was a product of genetic evolution rather than creationism. I never claimed to know how long it would take for humans to evolved genetic resistance to anti natalist cultures but the relevant section of the cartoon is set over 20,000 years in the future. Over the last 10,000 years humans have evolved many new genetic traits such as lactose tolerance, gluten tolerance, alcohol tolerance, and many other genes that have been selected for that we do not yet know the function of, many of these genes are variants of DNA areas that control brain development. But of course as well as genetic evolution there is cultural evolution, there is evidence that the Elites of many previous empires had trouble replacing their numbers before being swamped by more fecund barbarians, it may be that in the grand scheme of things anti natalist cultures never last long enough for humans to evolve genetic resistance to them, but the result may be rather similar anyway.

You are being needlessly combative.

I never accused you of saying that environment and culture are currently irrelevant to reproduction rates. I repeated the fact at the start of my post because it's a shared point relevant to what I was saying later. It was summarizing important background information. I did this because it made reading easier and because your post was long and had no formatting, which would make it hard for someone to grok that context if I had not repeated it.

#+end_quote

You said "a few thousand years".

Genetic modifications that will override all the cultural and rational factors leading to depressed birth rates in educated populations with a high standard of living -- that sounds like a pretty daunting prospect. Granted, the fitness would be high, but getting those genes in the first place would likely be nigh impossible. It's appreciably more likely that a left-handed mad scientist named Rita will engineer such a change than that it would occur naturally.

  lactose tolerance

Human milk contains lactose. It's the production of lactase in adults that is interesting.

#+begin_quote
  alcohol tolerance
#+end_quote

Huh? It's not like ethanol is outrageously more lethal to, say, dogs than to humans, measured in milliliters per kilogram. The data I can find suggests that humans are about as tolerant of alcohol as mice, and appreciably less so than rats.

Did you research this claim? Or any of your other claims?

Please don't insult people for failings that they don't have.

Or are you meaning "over the last hundred years" rather than "other the last hundred years"?

Probably not a great idea to call people out for perceived lack of reading comprehension when you've got ambiguous typos in your text.
