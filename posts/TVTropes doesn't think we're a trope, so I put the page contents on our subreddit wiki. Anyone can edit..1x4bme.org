** Um, what does this even mean. At first I thought you meant there wasn't a page for it, but it's it's like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][right here]]. What's the problem?

*** It was taken down for repair and was being talked over in a YKTTW Repair Thread, where they said that a badly-written page for EY and his back-patting cult was a bad idea.

I can see where they got that idea, despite the fact that if anyone appearing to be me is ever found behaving as a back-patting cultist for EY, you will know that's a fake and should shoot him.

**** So, if I want to add something, should I edit TVTropes page or the wiki page? What is the best course of action?

** Looking at the description they give, the issue doesn't seem to be that they don't think we're a trope (and depending on how close they still stick to "There's No Such Thing as Notability" that shouldn't even be an issue), but that they think the page isn't written according to their standards. (Not that I fully trust the standards of TV-tropes, but that's something else entirely.)

This is a solvable problem.

One of the issues seems to be that there's not enough crosslinking. One of the first things that come to mind is "Awesome by Analysis", which would probably pop up more than once in rationalist fiction.

I'll look over some other trope pages to see if I can find feasible links.

*** I distinctly hit the button to enable everyone editing the subreddit wiki.

Ah, there was a karma setting. Now anyone with +1 subreddit karma should be able to edit it.

*** Yes... it looks like they're happy to have it as a trope page, but want it to be more neutral / less gushy / generally designed to look and read more like a regular trope page and less like a manifesto or an advertisement.

It probably would be a good idea to have the list of stories sorted by medium like most trope pages.

** What? They're totally fine with the page existing, they just want it to be written better. Which I totally agree with.
