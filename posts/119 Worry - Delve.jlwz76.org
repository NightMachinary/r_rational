** Rain's strategy there seemed pretty bad. Not positive he needed to use immolate at the beginning, and I'm sure he didn't need to keep using it.

*** He panicked, I think. But the problem really is the party level is too low so the support with the incomplete build is needing to pretend he isn't a support. Given that they're explicitly trying to herd instead of kill I think at least one of the two higher leveled should've come.

***** I think it's mainly that the lower level people, especially unawakened who won't even get XP, just shouldn't even be here. They're kind of just liabilities. If the goal is to lure the Blue out leave the unawakened outside the dungeon.

** So Rain's slime is getting smarter. I wonder when they'll realize that overmana creates more intelligent creatures and start using that to their advantage. Smarter horses, dogs, and maybe even a bird for scouting.

** The immediate response of the dungeon is kind of silly. Maybe give it 5-10 mins before a massive blizzard shows up to simulate that it had to create it and bring it over rather than just making it appear on top of them almost immediately.

​

It seemed like it took less than 1 minute for a blizzard to show up and try to balance itself. Either it implies the dungeon can just pop environmental effects anywhere at any time regardless of how powerful they are or that it made that storm and moved it faster than sound in their direction, idk which is sillier.

​

It seemed like the author had this idea for a scene and he just hacked it together without any care for reasonableness or realism. Just hey you made too much heat in one small area relative to the total size of the dungeon so I'll just make this instant unreasonable blizzard right on top of you as punishment, so the author can conveniently add some tension and make his scene happen.

*** It seems reasonable to me. Dungeons obviously aren't optimized killing machines or they'd just open into a long drop. And punish X with Y is the kinda game-like weirdness I could easily see a powerful but suboptimal dungeon having.

**** My problem isn't with the reaction or its strength. It's with how fast the response is and to some extent the fact that changing the temperature in a relatively small area inside a place that's as big as that dungeon is got such a response in the first place.

Sure send a blizzard in half an hour that's fine, but putting a blizzard instantly onto it is quite silly.

***** The story has floated the idea that a dungeon might have some cognition---though we don't know how much of that is just Rain's preconceptions---and this dungeon is young. Perhaps this young dungeon is impulsive, a bit petulant, and unskilled at narrative?

Or even if dungeons are too dumb to describe as above, we can construct an explanation at the instinct level: an order-instinct suggested that corrective weather be applied immediately, and won, since the consequences of that (in terms the dungeon cares about, like some sort of fairness / hidden-workings / narrative-instinct) had not been learned yet.

****** My view is that immediate responses should be impossible because everything has limitations, i.e the dungeon can make a blizzard but it takes time, or only in one specific area from which it then has to move to the appropriate location.

The problem for me is more of this making it seem like dungeons have no limitations, rather than trying to justify the response.

******* Given that dungeons create entire pocket realms their limits are likely to be quite high (though non-sentience is a big one). While creating a blizzard from nowhere instantly is probably bronzeplate. It doesn't even do damage, just environmental effects.

*** The blizzard's immediacy made sense to me, because it was in response to Rain using Immolate. If they had entered without the aura being active, then the blizzard wouldn't have shown up.

It's reasonable for dungeons to react to adventurers altering the environment, because that would massively disadvantage the monsters.

Why not wait around? That would require patience and foresight to realize the mage will run out of mana. Instant reactions sounds like a programmed response which matches to the computer-like nature of dungeons.

**** Should it not take time for a response to occur ? For a blizzard to form ? Or for it to reach his location ?

To me the fact that it doesn't seems quite convenient and unreasonable.

I've no problem with the response, only with how quickly it happened. Sure fight the immolate, push back against it with environmental mana, that looks natural, but when right away a blizzard shows up it feels artificial like the author is doing it on purpose to create a scene he wants.

***** The two active reference frames for dungeons are 1) computer games 2) magic.

Neither of these create an expectation of a need to "appear natural" to me. In fact, it would be entirely reasonable for the snow cover to just respawn instead of falling from the sky. The frost storm the ice mage does just manifests around them IIRC. That being said, there are some hints about this dungeon being a bit strange. You could be onto something. But I would not chalk this up to author laziness.

Could something else have damaged your suspension of disbelief and this was just the closest target for the disbelief at the time? Did you enjoy the chapter up to that point? I'm not claiming to know your inner state. And it's perfectly fair for you to not care to diagnose the story's failure for you deeper. It's just that... all events in a story are artificial and done by the authors to create scenes they want. The author is supposed to make you forget that. When you feel that it is happening, something has gone wrong. But the artificialness is not really the problem. The problem is the thing that made you see it. Like, humans having bones is not the actual problem in a situation where your bones are sticking out.

** Not gonna lie, Dozer's part were really appreciated. I love when you get the internal monologue of things that are so different from us. But I sympathised enormously when he tried to think so hard but couldn't understand. I just wanted to drop him in a latrine to make him feel better, the poor thing.
