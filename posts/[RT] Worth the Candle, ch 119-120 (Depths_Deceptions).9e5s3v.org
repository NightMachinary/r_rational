I'm talking about the subtext of "Le Grande Mort". It's clearly a reference to "La Petite Mort", but /what/ it's saying is incredibly unclear. Is it just a pun of sorts? Is it trying to imply that the petite mort and grande mort are linked/causal?

********* ah, yeah, i actually didn't think too much on La Grande Mort, just assuming a sort of pun meaning. now that i have, i don't think it's actually usable here as a poor taste joke meaning "actual death" or "physical death" after a "petite mort".

one meaning would be "the great death" of enlightenment, or ego-death. i'm thinking successfully soul-fucking the locus might get him closer to that state, and actually be more meaningful.

another would be "great death" as in some mass extinction event. so maybe when they conquer hell and eradicate the demons and devils. i'd rather call that straight up "genocide". perhaps they survive some exclusion zone becoming unexclusioned or other mass casualty event the DM sets up.

"Le petite mort" means "little death", is french euphemism for orgasm, /and, also important to explain/, when he first gave Fenn an orgasm the DM hit him with an in game achievement called "la petite mort", making him highly uncomfortable.

So now, it would make him even madder for the dm to write "the big death".

The worldbuilding doc is still being written, in case you were curious about that; the current outline I'm filling in has sections for Magic (~26 varieties), History (pre-Imperial, three empires, two inter-imperiums), Geography, Races (~140), and Cosmology. If you have anything else you think is must-include, let me know (the big one, Gods, is probably going to be written and then left out until/unless they appear in the story, since I don't want spoilers for things that haven't appeared in the text).

Regarding the world building doc, I think exclusions and events related to them are a must-include. And Athenaea, though I guess those could be considered part of the magic section. I'd also enjoy entries for the most important/impressive Entads. And maybe something about cultures separate from races, what with the more numerous ones having multiple disparate nations, not to mention the existence of multi-racial cultures.

*** Perhaps obviously, I think the main criteria for what's in the doc should be things that you already know about and things you're interested in writing.

But in terms of this game /I'd/ like to see - which is admittedly somewhat different from what's a "must-include" - most of it relates back to the people of the world. Who lives where, what the cultural quirks and values of different groups looks like, where and why the alliances and tensions between people lie, who's producing what and who are they trading it with, how the power structures and politics are set up, the vibes of different cities, etc. Etc.

As a general rule I personally find, say, the effects of a magic system on the society and the setting as interesting if not more than the exact rules of the system.

**** The point of fantasy writing isn't the exact content, but how it makes you feel. The dream makes you feel like you're listening to a sensible discussion, which is what Joon would feel like in the dream, so it fulfils its purpose. A more "realistic" dream wouldn't make you feel like joon felt, and therefore would fail at its purpose.

It's kind of like how all speech in novels is heavily stylized-- it's unrealistic, but without body language and shared context, it does a better job of conveying what actually happens than actually including all the stuttering and stumbling and inspecificity even high-charisma people do.

** Goddamn, Valencia makes it so freakin' difficult to parse what's truth and what's lies even when she's not using any devils. This chapter she told Amaryllis she doesn't love Joon, despite that little conversation she had with him back in chapter 77-

#+begin_quote
  “Too easy to see the paths in front of me, too hard to know which one to go down,” said Val. “None of the parts and pieces help me make sense of who I am or what I feel.” She looked up at me. “I love you,” she said. “I know that you don't love me back yet, and Amaryllis says that's just misplaced attachment, something that I'm going to have to find a way to get over, but she has her own issues with you, so I don't know how good her advice is.”
#+end_quote

So now I have no idea if Valencia is simply lying to Amaryllis, or if she's lying to /herself,/ or if she's actually just grown past her fixation on Juniper.

Also, absolutely fantastic work by the author here. I was so caught up in the flow of emotion these last two chapters that I was actually getting frustrated that Juniper wasn't lashing out and hurting someone. I was emotionally primed for violence just from the specter of grief I got following Juniper's thoughts, so his own display of self-control in his conversation with Valencia was all the more impressive given how much more powerful his own desire to pass off some of his pain to others must have been.

*** That's the tricky part of Valencia. If you lived your whole life getting instant mastery-level insight of physics, for instance, even when you shut it off you're going to be pretty good. Checking she isn't using a soul to help just shows she isn't making up new lies or mega-analyzing new situations.

This is part of why Juniper was wise to insist on a total blackout of her looking at him with those skills. Hard, falsifiable rules are how you build trust with socially challenged people (which this is, I mean, plusses and minuses to it, but not being able to be sued is a legal problem too - who would do business with someone like that? - invulnerability isn't so great for trust).

** Trying to figure out what's going on with Valencia is really interesting.

On the one hand, Valencia deciding to break Joon and Fenn up because she can see all the flaws in their relationship is very reasonable. It's a perfect instantiation of what we know about how devils see the world, and it's subtle enough to be plausible.

On the other hand, everyone in-universe seems to have so much respect for the ability of devils to manipulate people, that it seems really hard to believe that Valencia didn't know Joon would be super suspicious of her therapy breaking him and Fenn up, even before Fenn's death. I think there's still a real possibility that we haven't gotten the full story.

(Also, Joon burning Wisdom and /actually acting like a wise person as a result/, at least for a few paragraphs, was wonderful from both a narrative and emotional perspective. Forgiving Valencia had a biggest emotional impact of the update, at least for me.)

It's just that Fenn's death knocked the whole plan off the rails, so now that it's impossible the plan just looks stupid in retrospect.

** I'm gonna shelf the million things I want to say on the topic of the /shitfest/ and just gonna mention this:

In a tabletop RPG, I usually see 3 phases: "the honeymoon", where everyone starts with a clean bill. No desperation, no pressing issues, just trying things out.

Then you have the "divination blocking phase", because that's usually when you start needing it. You start making ripples and should start to paying attention to more than the quest summary unless you want to get backstabbed through a portal.

Finally, you have the "everything gets political" phase, where thing start getting so tangled and you become such major player on the grand scale of things, you can't just solve the problems your have now by punching a few mountains. You stop deciding things about your character, and instead start deciding things for whole countries at a time.

What I'm trying to say is, I feel like Joon and the party are getting to the second phase. And so far weird unexpected magical shit have been the bane of their existence (gold magic, soul manipulation, illusion, soul poison, etc). They /really/ need to start thinking immunities instead of contingencies IMO.

Skills and magic take years to train for anyone else so the higher ranks are clouded in mystery, even more considering the game interaction with them. The party develops quickly but they have hard caps on skill levels due to stats and stats due to level. Grinding is dangerous, and plot can just suddenly happen. Then there are the magic items that are rare as hell, have rules on who can use them and can be compromised.

There's a difference between "representation and gender balance in media as a whole matter" and "one doesn't actually have to pick the same gender for this character archetype every time for whatever convoluted reasons they think they have". Arthur is equating those and then saying Tiff is being inconsistent, then declares that he "won the argument".

Tiff elaborates later,

#+begin_quote
  “The whole argument is about stories and their impacts in aggregate, ” said Tiff. “Set aside your pet theories on causes for a second, if ninety percent of protagonists are male, and ninety percent of love interests are female, and writers kill off love interests half the time, then that's -- I don't know, some math, but you'd run into it a lot of the time, and most of what a girl sees growing up is women having horrible things happen to them as a way of motivating the main character or increasing the stakes. Which sucks.”
#+end_quote

Then Arthur just brushes this objection off,

#+begin_quote
  Arthur shrugged. “Okay?” he asked. “I never said that it didn't suck.”
#+end_quote

Honestly I'm not sure what Arthur's thesis statement in this argument is (or how he thinks he "won") but he doesn't really seem to be listening to Tiff.

I think Arthur and Tiff are both partially correct, but Tiff is more correct, and Arthur is being somewhat insensitive to the social implications of his argument.

Contrast this trope with the "Mentor always dies". Mentor is an even more hazardous occupation than love interest in narrative, but the mentor is invariably killed for reasons relating to the mentor.

Fridging is not. The killer does not care about the victim at all, except as an emotional bludgeon to point at the hero, and would be equally happy to burn their stamp collection. Which is dehumanizing as all hell.

**** I'm not great at literary critic, but here's my take on it:

When you only use the female love interest's death to get at the main character, you're reducing her final moments to a plot device. That is pretty demeaning to her character, kinda like the "use me for spare parts" thing Fenn's letter suggested.

Often a character's death can have meaning to them (besides being an endpoint); like someone consciously choosing to sacrifice their life for someone else, or jumping off a cliff rather than face trial. Having a character just /killed/ takes that agency away from them and turns them into a victim.

Very debatable!

However, I was just trying to force the metaphor. Fenn's not the typical woman stuffed in a fridge, but her death here does evoke the trope, at least in a meta way. The DM could definitely have nudged it so she lived, but she died, with Joon aware of the DM's omission (and implicitly aware of /why/ it was her who died, i.e. love interest, just broke up).

** I have a new working theory for how Juniper got to Aerb and it's all because of this one line in chapter 120

#+begin_quote
  only if you wrote them like I did, you called them suicide notes instead.
#+end_quote

I hypothesize that the last day Juniper experienced on Earth before coming to Aerb, Juniper chose to commit suicide for some reason and was put into cryonic preservation.

The part that makes me suspect this possibility is a throwaway line all the way back in chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  Five seconds ago, I had been passing notes in fifth period English.
#+end_quote

Perfectly innocuous, right? What teenager hasn't passed notes to their friends in class? Except...what friend? Juniper talked about how all of his relationships were wrecked or drifted apart after Arthur's death and there were no mention of him making up with his old friends or making new ones. Only Reimer and Tom was still in the DM group at that point and I'm not sure they were getting along well enough to be passing notes. I speculate that he was actually passing notes with someone who was trying to help him or talk about Arthur (could be Tiff or someone else) and his memories cut out right before he reads or writes something that causes a fight or something awful at his school. So he then chooses to die later that day and is frozen with his memories of his suicide (and its cause) erased or forgotten.

Another weaker supporting point for this theory is how he never explicitly thinks about just exactly /what/ he was doing or seeing in fifth period English. Every time Juniper thinks about how he got to Aerb, it's always how he could possibly suddenly transition from everyday life to Aerb (or the meeting with the DM in chapter 79). But there's no review of the classroom memory for any clues about his impending fate or any flashback to the scene itself of when he transitions (nor does he ever talk about it with his party) and I can't help but think it's a small clue about what is missing from the 'story'/memory.

So, there is a trope where character X moves into a position that makes the story hard to write, and lazy/coward authors just kill off character X.

Imagine that Fenn does not die; imagining the group dynamics afterwards is not easy, and probably not easy to write. Now, it is something that we're not gonna see. In other words, her death cheapens the breakup and robs us of seeing how they struggle to have a working relationship, how Joon does or does not move on, and the same for Fenn.

That stinks. It stinks somewhat less due to the fact that the story talks explicitly about the timing.
