Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}

  How could a modern society put an upper limit on accumulated wealth, while still incentivizing innovation?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure that wealth actually incentivizes innovation, beyond a point it just becomes a game token. Maybe explicitly gamifying control of corporations, maybe creating some kind of stock that's the opposite of non-voting stock, stock that has a controlling interest in the company but can't be sold except through some ludicrous tax process?

*** A wealth tax?

On the one hand, I've never heard of one so I assume that there's something horribly wrong with them. On the other hand, a progressive tax makes a lot more sense to me than a flat cap. If the top wealth-tax bracket was 10%/year on any assets above $100m then it would act quite similar to a cap, but avoid some of the dangers of a rigid system.

I think you will find that the thing 'horribly wrong' with them is that the people who have the power to introduce them would be the ones most disadvantaged by them. Not a lot of incentive there.

***** Money is currently power. Nobles would, instead of accumulating wealth, acquire black market money, connections, and favors, being the nearest unblocked neighbor to wealth as an approximation of power. If you start taxing contracts by how much leverage they give each party on society, more mafia-like structures will have to form instead.

***** I think you're already proposing a wealth tax, but it's a single step (0%@$74.9m, 100%@$75.0m). I think a progressive system would be better, but I'm not sure about the exact values. Maybe 1%@$5m, 5%@$10m, 10%@$20m, 15%@$30m, 20%@$50m, etc.

Unless spilling progressively more wealth into the government grants progressively more power (which you probably don't want to happen), there is no incentive to keep producing wealth beyond the cap.

Something my late father told me:

The Queen of England has kind of a deal like that. As I understand it the state gets all the income from her personal estates, and she gets all her expenses handled by the state. When Victoria set it up, she got the best side of the deal by far, but since then the value and income from the royal estates has increased immensely.

*** Whats stopping those people from investing all their money back into their business? Or is the government going to force them from making their business better?

Say I make 15mil. That's the cap. So from no on instead of keeping the money with me, anything I earn over the 15 mil cap I just put it back into the business. Buying more factories and equipment and such even though I no longer really need it but I can still justify it as a business expenditure.

Personally, I still earn only 15mil. Can the enforcing agency prevent me from growing my business?

***** But then there's not much difference than what is the current capitalist system... Most rich people don't really have billions of dollars laying around in their bank. It's mostly tied up into their business assets or stocks.

So if you do make a tax, even a 100% taxation on anything more than 15 mil than you get the same system we have now just even more tied down to physical assets. For example a CEO will only get 15mil a year but every year he also buys two or three factories(can be anything really) which he says they are part of the business. Thus avoiding the 100% tax. But they will never be used, although they'll have all the paperwork to show they are active. And then if he needs to "change someones mind" he just gifts them a factory stating it as a business merger or something like that. This way he keeps getting richer and more powerful/influential while staying under the 15mil limit.

Honestly, there's a good reason such a thing doesn't exist already in our world. It simply can never work. The only way to make something like that even remotely possible is to give enough power to the government to control everything. And such governments very quickly turn into either communism or fascism.

Also... to make anything remotely like you suggest work, the whole world needs to work under the same system. It's enough that there's one country that refuses to implement the tax and any business that can will move itself into that country.(Kind of like what happened with China once they started transitioning from communism to capitalism.) Also, I vaguely remember an economy book that explained how increasing taxes over a certain level actually results in less tax being collected. The reason? Until a certain taxation level people rather pay the tax than risk the consequences. However, after a certain level it becomes worth it to avoid paying taxes and more and more people risk the consequences. No matter how horrible the consequences may be. And if you make them too high businesses simply move to other countries and then you lose all income from said business. As such, governments can't make taxes to high or people will simply find ways to avoid paying them... which is why taxing the rich is a pointless endeavour.

Sorry for the rant :) I'm just having a similar argument with a left leaning friend.

*** Just have a progressive wealth tax that approaches 100% a $x->infinity in such a way that you can approach the money cap and get endlessly close, but can't actually reach it. Then you'll have people able to compete over how much money they have for prestige, but still not go over the cap. Now, this would still be a pretty terrible system, but technically works.

--------------

What might work better than a hard cap is some kind of asymptote - there is a maximum amount of wealth, but you can never actually reach it, you can merely approach arbitrarily close. Unfortunately, this requires a complete change in the concept of how money works...
