Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Recently did a reread of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/][Three Worlds Collide]], and chapter 4 had this disclaimer at the bottom, which I do not remember seeing before:

#+begin_quote
  A reminder: This is a work of fiction. In real life, continuing to attempt to have sex with someone after they say 'no' and before they say 'yes', whether or not they offer forceful resistance and whether or not any visible injury occurs, is (in the USA) defined as rape and considered a federal felony. I agree with and support that this is the correct place for society to draw the line. Some people have worked out a safeword system in which they explicitly and verbally agree, with each other or on a signed form, that 'no' doesn't mean stop but e.g. 'red' or 'safeword' does mean stop. I agree with and support this as carving out a safe exception whose existence does not endanger innocent bystanders. If either of these statements come to you as a surprise then you should look stuff up. Thank you and remember, your safeword should be at least 10 characters and contain a mixture of letters and numbers. We now return you to your regularly scheduled reading. Yours, the author.

(For those that don't know, TWC is set in the far future and one of the minor things mentioned is that "rape" has been legalized, and how people in the far future are literally incapable of understanding why someone from our time would find this horrifying, either because of a value drift or a semantic one. Also TWC is amazing and you should read it right now)

The Internet Archive tells me this was added sometime within the past few years, and I'm glad EY added it, because people arguing that the story "advocates rape" is irritating. But I'm not sure what % of people who would have believed that upon reading it will not with this addition. It seems like a clear proclamation that Rape Is Bad, but it also adds a quick education on BDSM-culture that seems like it's trying to make an additional point, perhaps by way of explanation for what's said in the story, and I don't know quite how to parse that part.

I'm not here to discuss what exactly is meant by "legalized rape" in the story, since I see it as having been purposefully left vague and have my own interpretations that fit the Weirdtopia and Alien Morality themes of the setting very well, without leading me to believe that this world actually allows anything like what we think of when we hear or say "rape." What I'm more interested in is whether anyone here /was/ bothered by that part feels that this disclaimer helps with it, and if not, why not. This kind of annotation of works by authors to prevent people misinterpreting their words/intentions interests me a lot, and seeing it happen more-or-less in front of me with a small community I can ask about it seems interesting.

(Fair warning: being bothered by that part of the story is fine, and I'm interested to hear your perspective, but please try and be thoughtful about this. If you just accuse the story of advocating rape, I'm likely to come down hard on your reading comprehension and general ability to understand the value of sci-fi)

*** It bothered me, but I never felt that EY was advocating rape. It just seemed like it was /meant to be/ weird, rather than viscerally unpleasant, like a weirdtopia rather than a dystopia. I found it to be a viscerally unpleasant dystopia, which would be fine, but is not (from how the story frames it) what I thought EY was going for.

The problem is that overt acceptance of rape is already a thing that exists in the real world. When you have public figures /in the first world/ saying that a husband can't possibly rape his wife, that's what at least a portion of the readers will immediately think about -- it's what /I/ thought about. It's not weird enough, or at least, it's not /presented as/ weird enough, even if the governing logic behind what we saw was weird enough, because we didn't see enough of the governing logic.

(I might have to come back and refine this later, not sure I'm getting it across right.)

***** Yudkowsky doesn't really define weirdtopia in [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][Building Weirdtopia]]; I think that this is as close as he gets:

#+begin_quote
  invent a world that went outside my pre-existing sensibilities
#+end_quote

The problem is that the /plain reading/ of the actual text of the story is that rape as-we-know-it has been legalized, and to the average reader that's /not/ a world that goes outside their pre-existing sensibilities, it's simply regressive. In fact, it's already /been/ a feature of several dystopias written by other authors, as well as in the real world. It's not (or shouldn't be) outside the existing sensibilities of readers, it's well within them.

And that's the crux of my problem with the role of rape within the story; it takes a fair amount of legwork on the part of the reader to construct a society where plain reading is not a regression to previous standards. In fact, in the comments to the story, Yudkowsky gives his own version of what a "weird" society might be like, and [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y8/interlude_with_the_confessor_48/qso][ends with this:]]

#+begin_quote
  But as I didn't actually write any of this into the story, feel free to exercise the reader's right of interpretation here.
#+end_quote

/And even then/ I wouldn't have a problem with it, because people are free to write about whatever horrible dystopias they want, but the problem is that if your personal interpretation is "oh, so not that much different from how human societies are now", then the story doesn't work as well. [[/u/DaystarEld]] even says above that it /should/ be a Weirdtopia or Alien Morality in order to fit in with the rest of the story, rather than simply dystopia ... but the story doesn't do the legwork necessary to make that the only reading. This detracts from the story.

All that is irrespective of Yudkowsky's personal beliefs. The "legalized rape" bit of the story doesn't do the legwork it needed to in order to send the message that it wanted to send, and so to a certain subset of readers, it sent a different message instead (which is the problem with being that vague).

In a sense, it's the same problem as creating a villain that looks one-dimensional to the reader and then saying, outside the story, "here's one way that they could have had depth".

****** That makes sense, though I rather thought that the Confessor's comments made it clear enough (to me anyway) that whatever we as the readers were imagining as the worst-case-scenario was not what was being referred to when the word "rape" or "nonconsent" was used: that whatever new world our descendants had made for themselves, what we currently consider rape was unthinkable.

#+begin_quote
  Akon's mouth hung open. "You were that prude?"

  The Confessor shook his head. "There aren't any words," the Confessor said, "there aren't any words at all, by which I ever could explain to you. No, it wasn't prudery. It was a memory of disaster."

  "Um," Akon said. He was trying not to smile. "I'm trying to visualize what sort of disaster could have been caused by too much nonconsensual sex -"

  "Give it up, my lord," the Confessor said. He was finally laughing, but there was an undertone of pain to it. "Without, shall we say, personal experience, you can't possibly imagine, and there's no point in trying."

It was a very short sentence with little impact/relevance to the story and yet the amount of splash it generated showed that it had had a marked effect (be that good or bad) on the readers.

Not advocating rape, obviously, but the fact that he chose something so controversial made the statement hit home that much harder, especially considering the reaction the crew had.

In this case I remember being squicked out by that part of the story a bit and thinking it was clumsily done. The added note doesn't help. It's just worldbuilding that wasn't adequately explained in-story because it was supposed to be a vague background detail-- but the story wasn't long enough or maybe written written well enough for that kind of hint dropping to work well.

*** I haven't read Three Worlds Collide, but this description of it makes me uninterested. The whole point of writing up a weirdtopia is to explore what might actually be better than utopian and we just don't realize it yet (see [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y0/31_laws_of_fun/][31 laws of fun]]). One of the important reasons for this is to better understand how to design an appropriate and adaptable moral code for a friendly AI (see EY's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4fCIoUnNs&t=6m19s][lecture on the challenge of FAI]]).

I get that he wanted to write up something that challenges our current morality, but there are so many good and plausible options that settling for "legalized rape" just seems lazy at best. For some good examples of weirdtopia elements:

- In an effort to control overpopulation, the government offers a significant universal basic income, but only to people who choose to be sterilized. Many would argue this is a form of economic coercion which encroaches upon reproductive rights. Is the prevention of overpopulation valuable enough to justify it?

- The government legalizes all drugs, allowing anyone 18+ years old to choose to get a permit to buy opiates, stimulants, steroids, hallucinogenics, alcohol, cigarettes, whatever narcotics your heart desires. The government also implements universal health care but only for people who choose not to get a drug usage permit. Government-run health services are forbidden from knowingly providing anything more than palliative care for people with drug use permits. Is this a reasonable, ethical policy, or is it a dystopian hell?

- The Fairness Doctrine is reimplemented with a vengeance. Websites are required to implement the policy as well. For example, if your friends on Facebook post left-leaning content, Facebook would be required to send an equal amount of right-leaning content that you would need to look at for the same amount of time (and vice versa). For every topic, informational websites must offer an equal amount of the contrary point of view. Does this fix the sharp political divide created by internet filter bubbles? Do people just use the internet less because it's annoying?

- In an effort to fix government corruption and reduce corporate influence, a constitutional convention implements an ammendment requiring all currently elected government officials to be selected at random and appointed indefinitely unless they are recalled. To prevent incompetence, officials must pass a test which is equivalent to being able to pass introductory-level college courses in a variety of subjects including English, math, chemistry, biology, physics, constitutional law, macroeconomics, and sociology. New applicants are selected daily for each vacancy until one passes the tests. Elections are now held only when citizens file a petition with at least 100K signatures, and the elections are only votes on whether or not to remove politicians from office. Is this the end of democracy? Will the system still be corrupted by different means?

- Copyright and patents are abolished and DRM is banned. How much does this harm the music, art, film, software, and engineering industries? Is the value gained from freely copying and sharing things worth more than the harm?

Obviously I'm not arguing /for/ legalized rape. But I think EY choosing that as something he used to highlight the differences in future society (and just FYI, the way this came up in story was that one of the main characters, who's sort of the wise advisor of the ship's crew [[#s][]]

I don't remember whether the disclaimer was there when I first read it, but I doubt it would have made a difference. The way it is worded makes it sounds too much like a [[https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/6MogqPoyYyiDz3eRh/an-apology-is-a-surrender][non-apology]] or some legal ass-covering and it does more to make the problem stand out than to alleviate it.

One potentially interesting thing to note: The inclusion of this detail has prevented me from recommending the story to some of my friends (which is a shame, because it is otherwise a very good story). The disclaimer as written doesn't change this, though I feel that it might if it had been worded differently.

Hoo boy, it's been a while.  If you can believe it, three weeks ago I actually missed this weekly update because, well, I got so far into the zone of actually working on Bill's PC that it slipped my mind to update. Honest to Arceus.  This /last/ week I had a more reasonable excuse, as I came down with bronchitis on Wednesday, didn't actually get it diagnosed until Friday, and couldn't even muster the energy to so much as play games until like Tuesday of this week.  As of today I'm probably back to 95% health, so I can finally get back to working on it proper.

But!  There was a reasonable amount of progress during that time, so there /are/ things to report.  First and foremost, I found a decent hosting solution in github pages, so I no longer have to be hosting on my personal box just to let others see.  For the foreseeable future, this will be the canonical location of the latest version of Bill's PC 2:

[[https://ketura.github.io/bills-pc-2/]]

There's a handful of kinks to work out; css errors are producing 404s for some reason and not all the code is being ran as I expect it to, but this will do nicely.  

First thing to note is that the types grid on the first tab is entirely generated; you can add a new type using the provided widgets to add both a new column and a new row automatically.  When I swing back around to work on the Types tab I'll re-enable cell editing, which is only now feasible because of design work done for the Species tab.

Speaking of, the Species tab has the various sections sketched out, but the real work is mostly invisible.  If you put any values into the forms under Lore and press the Save button at the top, the values /should/ persist through reload...but it's persnickety.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it fails, and I /think/ it has to do with scripts being loaded in the wrong order.  Require.js is /supposed/ to take care of that, but I'm finding that failure or success depends on runtime order, which is non-deterministic for some reason.  It's mostly a visual bug anyway, the data is stored properly in local storage no problem.  I'm sure I'll get it eventually.

At any rate, this shows at least the direction I'm trying to take it in.  No server state, all local data so that it can be ran either remotely (like this) or ran from one's local box with no issues.  Once I have the data loading figured out I'll be adding json import/export and then standardizing this functionality for all tabs, and then I get the joy of actually laying out all the [[https://imgur.com/a/pUlOy][dozens upon dozens of form controls]] and re-creating the graph functionality, etc.  That will honestly be fun; I quite enjoy making useful, usable little tools, and this is about as pure a representation of that as possible.

--------------

The weekend before I got sick, I ran what I call a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQA6Pg2bi6mBQ788nsQ2dQvSKLibeU745gbGhWvHeQQ/edit#gid=0][rival mode run]] of Pokemon Black with my brother.  Rival mode is basically a race where two people play through a canon pokemon game, stopping to fight after each gym and the champion fight. The winner of each battle then gets to choose a reward from the spreadsheet linked above, and play continues.  

(It was actually pointed out to us that it might actually be more interesting to give the /loser/ rewards and make it so the first to 5 victories wins, regardless of whether it's the first five gyms or not.  This is actually a very intriguing ruleset and we'll be using it next time, I think.)

My brother went for more of an early game stomp, only spreading XP among three different pokemon at first, while I tried to get to a reasonable six-unit team as early as possible.  The result is pretty clear in the wins marked in the spreadsheet; I was destroyed early on (some of the fights had me losing six pokemon to literally one (damn sawk -_-)) but started to claw back some dignity in the mid game.  Once I had a decent amount of move coverage and my horrible, horrible EV luck stopped giving me pokemon with MULTIPLE 0 EV stats, I started doing better.  Interestingly, except the final battle, it was very seldom a tense back and forth; one or the other of us usually completely shut out the other, which I would not have expected.

Still, I lost the final battle pretty handily, so I'm 0 for 2 against my brother in these runs.  I /did/ win the what-if match that involved pumping the pokemon to level 100, maxing IVs, manually allocating EVs, any legal moves, but that's to be expected since I have a much broader game knowledge than he does due to this project; I just can't bring it to bear on a blind playthrough.  Oh well.

Emboar / Zweilous / Reshiram / Gurdurr / Krookodile / Sigilyph

Asshat2's team:    

Serperior / Sawk / Druddigon / Ho-Oh / Chandelure / Reshiram

This was the first time either of us had played gen V.  I was not impressed with the transition to 3D for the most part; the designers got far too much of a hard on making you sit on tracks while you are expected to oooh and aaah as you zip around pixelated 3D areas.  I was also not impressed that they decided this meant that every gorram gym had to be a set piece, especially when most of the “puzzles” amounted to holding left or up for a while until you stopped zipping around the screen.  

(I /did/ enjoy that items could now be hidden ‘in plain sight' as it were, with the perspective of the scenery usually hiding items that were right next to you.  This was the only good impact of 3D that I identified.)

The handholding was a joke.  I honestly thought it was a ballsey move to make the very first gym a direct counter to your starter, but then they snatched any goodwill they had made from that decision by /handing/ you an overlevelled direct counter.  So stupid.  

I didn't like the linearity of the map; you go in one direction in one giant circle, never deviating, never backtracking, never really finding a reason to return. They force you to fly back to one of the early towns near the end as if reminding you that the world is in fact open, but then you fly right back and continue onwards.  

I thought Team Plasma was a horrible waste of an actual decent concept.  A pokemon PETA that knocks over pokemon centers and frees whatever they capture into the wild could have been a /great/ villain, but instead it's 100% stocked with wannabe thugs that want to take your pokemon for their own rather than for misguided ‘greater good' intentions, and then the guy at the top knows he's running a scam anyway, so the whole team apparently has not a single person who actually believes the team's stated purpose.  What a farce.

In general I felt like the story and the game mechanics did not mesh well.  Villains were constantly (like, on at least four concrete separate occasions), allowed to walk away because of bullshit reasons like “they would cause to much trouble”.  Bitch, with what, their weakass weasels and cats?  I could have taken on the entire team in one single, unending gauntlet by the time I was past like the fifth gym.  You can't tell me that a gym leader is incapable of knocking even more heads than me.

Yes, yes, I know, I know, it's targeting ten year olds (for some ungodly reason; get your shit together Nintendo, your Red/Blue generation is in its 30s and, I promise you, has far more disposable income than they did when they were ten), but more and more as I slowly work my way through the generations I feel like there's a disconnect between the setting, the mechanics, and the story.  Writing for pokemon games has always been terrible, but with the shift to high-stakes The World Is In Danger type storylines it's become more and more highlighted just /how/ bad it is.  

I can forgive bad writing (I'm not really a writer myself; stones and glass houses and all that), but I can't forgive writing that is directly at odds with a game's mechanics.  Nintendo is usually very good at making the two mesh; they decide /what/ mechanics they want, /then/ they go come up with bullshit story excuses to justify them, with triforces and goombas and whatever they happen to be smoking that day.  Gamefreak don't seem to have ever gotten this memo, however, and the disconnect between the two [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/AZComics/comic342.png][just gets worse and worse with each passing generation]].

--------------

Guess I'll have to shut up and go make a game that enforces a connection between the mechanics and the world :thinking:

If Nintendo made a /serious/ case that Pokemon battling/ownership was wrong, even if that case was intentionally flawed in some ways in order to make the argument easier to defeat, then you run the risk of some people being convinced anyway, or building on that argument to make an improved one for themselves, and suddenly getting uncomfortable with the game.

It's Magical Dog Fighting, after all, so you can't legitimately confront that fact and retain audience escapism, just like an action film stops being a popcorn escapade and turns into sick horror if you acknowledge the violence for what it is.

As in, within the editor? I suppose that's something it will indeed have to support; I had given thought to how that's going to work within the game client, but hadn't considered that of course the (potentially remote) game file editor will need it as well. I'll have to think on the best way to do this, but I'll throw it on the pile.

Yeah, it's just frustrating to watch a medium refuse to grow as its fan base does. There's no outlet for us and we're trapped in a never-ending appeal to nostalgia, which is I suppose the roundabout reason that I'm in this whole mess to begin with, so I ought to thank them for it.

** On Friday, Feb 2nd, I turn a billion seconds old (~11:28PM).

As this is also groundhog day, got me thinking, and here's a question:

Would you rather have:

- Functional immortality

- Fork + Merge

- Arbitrary Time Loops

All powers are reasonably safe and without curse-side-effects (aka, you won't be an immortal shriveled ancient), but aren't fool-proof / absolute.

Functional Immortality, as far as I've explored it, would work like this: You are lucky and never receive injuries beyond what medical science can repair in a reasonable amount of time; such treatments will always work completely; and you'll stop aging before you would start accumulating age-related ailments. If there's no possibility of survival (say, fly a spaceship into the sun), welp.

Fork + Merge, as far as I've explored it, would work like this: You (and any copies) can duplicate, with little fanfare. I'm undecided as far as what gets duplicated with you; "incidentals" seems reasonable (aka, clothing, ID cards...?), other does not (a laptop) but I don't know how to define that line. You (and any copies) can merge, with the best possible combination of git-style rebase/merge; any issues you have wont be a result of the merge, but of now having been a person who did thing you may find reprehensible. Of course, you can always plan to have the fork write a report and then suicide....

Arbitrary time loop, as far as I've explored it, is that you can send your mind back to yourself at any prior point in your personal history. You can't bring anything else with you, and there's graceful degradation; if you send yourself as an adult to you as a baby, you'll 'grow into' your adult memories/self - you won't be a talking baby. Also, should you die suddenly, you'll auto-loop back far enough that you have time to decide on a longer loop.

Thoughts/answers?

*** Arbitrary Time Loops seems like a tool specifically helpful for maximizing my own life's happiness in a very limited way, BUT indispensable for tackling an incredibly difficult goal in a timeframe that my life is critically positioned to tackle. Like if I'm among the oldest generation to exist before a nuclear war wipes everyone out, my "second chance" would be spent almost entirely on building myself anew to tackle that threat directly rather than just thinking it's outside my control, and future loops would be spent trying different strategies for that.

Functional immortality, on the other hand, seems generally superior for myself and the world if multiple tries at the same cataclysm isn't required. I may screw up and makes mistakes that have permanent costs, but ideally I would be able to help a lot more people on a longer timeline, and while I can't maximize my own happiness within my own generically natural lifespan, I get to have a whole lot more of a lifespan to enjoy.

Fork + Merge seems less attractive than both. Not particularly worried about value drift or anything, it just feels like a less optimal version of both alternatives, outside of some edge cases, like me needing to coordinate specifically with other people who have to be me as well to solve some major problem. Obviously I'd still take it if offered without the others as alternatives.

Functional immortality would be useless in case of nuclear war, a gamma ray burst, artificial nano- \ bioviruses, etc.

The Forking \ Merging wouldn't be very effective in the setting of our universe because all your copies would still continue to age; and there's just not enough resources an individual can acquire on Earth to make the total sum (and quality) of lifespan generated through this skill be comparable to what both the functional immortality and arbitrary time loops can provide.

This seems to indicate that the third option is not a single-use skill, but, rather, an activator for controlled [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]] events. So the time-looping choice seems to be vastly superiour compared to the other two --- to the extent of being capable of eventually simulating what both of them were offering out of the box.

*** Huh, I guess I'm more than a billion seconds old. I'm kind of sad to have missed that milestone. But I do turn 32 on Groundhog's Day!

Arbitrary time loops are somewhat lesser-value for me, because I've got a two-year-old son that I wouldn't want to obliterate by going back in time to before his conception. With no attachments, I think it's the superior choice, but I have lots of attachments. Plus I've written a lot of stuff that I wouldn't want to have to rewrite. It's still probably the best choice, because it's the best option for making lots of money and steering the course of history ... but I also find it kind of boring. Not that you shouldn't go for the high-utility but boring things.

Fork + Merge though? That seems /amazing/. Less utility than arbitrary loops, but I would have /so much time/ to do things, I could make /so much money/, I could gain skills /so fast/, I could write hundreds of novels a years, pick up loads of new skills, space out time with my son a bit more while also not having to worry about losing out on time with him -- it would give me a lot of the things that I want, rather than giving me intermediaries that give me the things that I want. But I probably wouldn't pick it, because it does probably lose out on strict utility (maybe not for me personally, but definitely as far as social good goes).

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/][Against Murderism]] turned out to be highly relevant to me because I have come to define racism by consequence rather than motive, but went the extra mile by deciding to hate myself along with everyone else I think enables racism-as-consequence.

So I've got a really big problem here that I don't know how to solve. I'm not a stereotypical SJW who thinks they're above prejudice towards minorities, I absolutely believe I am prejudiced and contribute to racism-as-consequence solely because I was raised in privilege.

I've called in sick to work 4 times in the past week because my constant anxiety over this meant I couldn't get any sleep and felt lethargic all day.

*** You sound /exactly/ like me when I was at my lowest. What is happening to you has nothing to do with how shitty reality is or with justice, and everything to do with the artificial cognitive bias being dropped over your thoughts by what is very clearly some kind of anxiety or obsessive disorder.

If your concern is that fixing this disorder will reduce your will to do something about the injustices you note, that is also the disorder talking. As others have pointed out, you are currently incapable of even attempting to fix any of these problems because you are spending all of your time and energy obsessively ruminating over them and your role in them. This helps nobody, least of all you, and therefore continuing down this path is the least just option on the table.

It is my opinion that you should trust /none/ of your thoughts right now. All of them are subject to corruption and twisting by your brain, and your brain /is objectively lying to you./ For one, there is nothing you, as a single individual, can do about systemic racism over the course of generations. You can improve the lives of those around you, but the ills caused by past injustices will persist. Because you cannot personally fix the problem, worrying about it to the point of physical illness only makes the universe a /worse/ place, not a better one. Likewise, there is nothing you can do about the 'unfair advantage' of being born into what I am assuming is a white middle-class family with a history of education and stable employment. Your brain is forcing you to keep coming back to the topic, not because of any conception of justice, but because it is /fundamentally broken./

Fortunately, we live in the modern era, where things like anxiolytics exist. Going to a professional and seeking medical treatment is not an admission of failure, nor is it a betrayal of the people you wish to protect and uplift. Indeed, since you are incapable of actually doing anything to accomplish any goal right now, it is the only just option both for them and yourself. If leaving your home to get to a professional sounds insurmountable, I highly recommend [[https://www.doctorondemand.com/][Doctor on Demand.]] It's how I get my antidepressants and sleeping pill, they accept most insurance, and if you are uninsured their rates are lower than seeing a physical psychologist because of the resource savings in not needing a professional office. Do it. You deserve to give yourself that much.

As always, if you EVER find yourself planning to harm yourself or end your life, your first and only move should be to immediately go to a hospital. No ifs , ands, or buts, your values as you have put them here demand nothing less than ensuring that you remain alive so you can actually accomplish some progress against systematic injustice. No other reasonable options exist in that case.

The problem from a moral/practical standpoint is that you get caught up in these kinds of anxiety threads too frequently, it will put you at a selective disadvantage to others whose skulls and skins are thicker. So for example, you might lose a job due to missing work too much, or lose friendships with influential people due to being unable to generate good atmosphere, in arenas where someone with less awareness of these issues (perhaps due to less innate sensitivity or more defensive political positioning, susceptibility to optimistic/self-serving delusions, etc.) is able to take your place.

********* The version of you that is most qualified to do moral reasoning is probably not the version of you that is sleep deprived, sick, missing work, and so on.

So your first priority right now probably should be self care. To that end, it could be good to go through a checklist of the things that usually work the best against insomnia and anxiety for you. (You may already have such a list, since you have been at this for a while, just need to remember to use it.)

For me, it would be writing down the anxiety triggers for later processing (pen on paper, not text), taking melatonin, moderate exercise, venting (verbally) to a trusted friend, eating a balanced meal if needed.

Writing about the issue on paper merits some emphasis, I think. Paper instead of electronics is probably more optimal because it is more soothing and has a different effect on the brain than typing. Also you probably avoid most of the Pavlovian triggers having to do with online discussions that way.

The nice thing about writing it down is that you can read it later and be reminded of your current train of thought. That helps address the moral concern that you don't /want/ to stop caring about the genuine problems, you really just want to be less powerless about it. If you can think of anything actionable, your better-rested future self can then act on it; otherwise, the main thing you are communicating is the depth of your intent and how and why it is important to you right now.

Not only that, but the act of writing things down before bed helps internalize new concepts due to the role of sleep in memory consolidation. That increases the chance that next time you have a similar conversation with yourself there will be objectively less to freak out over because your attitude will have already shifted to a more acceptable one. Basically all kinds of attitudes, including racism, homophobia, transphobia, laziness, and so on are just another kind of memory-skill-thing and are fundamentally malleable.

I also have a list of things that sometimes help me sleep after I lie down: Closing one eye at a time, imaginary backwards somersault, mental math (even just picturing numbers/symbols with my eyes closed is sleep-inducing).

  Those potential negative consequences are things that I think will happen anyway because I feel powerless over the world around and within me.

***** First, if you're worried about all the suffering going on in the world, I have news for you. It's not going away anytime soon, and there's nothing you can do about it. /However/, you can reduce the suffering of those around you that you personally interact with. I recommend doing this, and it will probably make you feel better.

Second, systemic racism is not a thing. A quick look at a dictionary defines racism as "prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior." On the other hand, I can't even find a definition of "systemic racism." The closest I can find is "anything that accounts for observed disparities between races." Again, I have news for you: as long as people group themselves by race (or any other factor), outcome disparities will exist between the different groups. The ensuing discussion is admittedly long and complex, but the short of it is that there is nothing that can be done about inequality of outcome. As long as policies are focused on giving everyone equal opportunities, we can let the rest work itself out.

****** So I guess "hot days" and "cold nights" and "big books" aren't a thing because they're not in the dictionary either huh?

  I believe choosing not to worry about politics will contribute to systemic injustice, and even if I didn't I would still think it's immoral to not care about preventing suffering.

It's not a binary thing. You can (or should try to or should try to find ways to) worry about politics, injustice, etc. but not so much so that it makes you incapable of helping solve the issue.

*** Do you have access to healthcare? Even if your beliefs are completely accurate, the physical symptoms are making it hard for you to act on them, and that's something medication and counselling can help with.
