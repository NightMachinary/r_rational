With this post, I'd like to announce a new worldbuilding project:

From now on, I will accept worldbuilding commissions. In the comments, you can provide the initial details for the world you want me to create. By private message, I will keep you updated on my progress, and ask you to make a few choices. Once it is done, I will post it in another page, and link to it in this post.

If you are interested in this endeavor, you can join the workshop as a participant. Requirements are an active imagination and the ability to rigorously explain every element of your world.

Note: This is going to be /rational/ worldbuilding.


** Don't talk to me about worldbuilding. My subconscious dumped an entire setting into my conscious awareness as I was in the grocery store Sunday night.

ONLY LAST NIGHT did it finally start to generate material for the actual matter at hand again.

*** I'm sure I can help if you give me the 'material' :)

**** For that I have quite enough to worldbuild with, and just have to make all the pieces of absurdist bullshit fit together in fun ways.

****** No, but I can take the thing my subconscious dumped in my head on Sunday night, shove it in a Google Doc, and send it to you.
