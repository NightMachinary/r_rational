** The bits in chapter 16 where the Mars-exploring astronaut blithely lays out a series of methods for weaponizing the mass effect in novel ways to the surprise and mild horror of the Asari diplomat was /perfect/.

*** My personal favourite was the part with the Krogan babies. I can't wait for the author to come out of his hiatus - need to read more of those alien articles.. >.<

Maybe we all could leave him a few nudges to let him know there's still interest in the story..

** People say this is a "humanity fuck yeah" story - I think that's just what happens when you put realistic humanity into the setting of an unrealistic space opera.

[edit] I think a possible valuable RL good-idea takeaway from this story is "make first contact with astronauts; they're most plausibly sympathetic."

** Very tentatively putting the deconstructionist tag. If nothing else, the view of humans from the alien perspective is worth a read.

** I love the symmetry at the beginning of chapter 4, where the alien talks about how oddly humans view themselves in literature, while being in a piece of literature about a human viewing humanity.
