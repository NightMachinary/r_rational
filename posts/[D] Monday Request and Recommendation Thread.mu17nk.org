** Today, I read the fourth book in Becky Chambers's Wayfarers series, "The Galaxy and the Ground Within".

I adore this series. I am a complete sucker for hard/hard-ish SF soft-utopias with all of their "yes this is still a problem"s and their "but through collective action and thinking very hard about what the right solution is we can probably solve it". I love that she doesn't pull the punches with the kinds of problems that kind of society is bad at dealing with, and I love that she doesn't fail to highlight all of the ways that kind of society would be wonderful.

I want to hug all of the people in this story and then make them cake. Very carefully, because they're none of them humans and all have conflicting dietary needs, obviously.

** Last week I read and heartily recommend:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that][*Only Villains do That*]]. It's fantastic. First of all, the author is a pro and has already written and uploaded /millions/ of words of their other story, /The Gods are Bastards/. This means the technical quality of the writing reaches levels rarely seen in webfiction and gives me faith that the author won't abandon the story. As for the story, it's pretty fresh. It takes a bog-standard isekai template but does exciting things to it in many new ways and the characters are fun to read. I'm interested in seeing where this story goes, and this is one of the ones where I read every chapter as it's released.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery][*A Practical Guide to Sorcery*]]. I periodically do searches on RR for some of the more obscure tags (in this case gender-bender) to find diamonds-in-the-rough and I found this, which is massively under-read (It's something of a mystery to me how some stories languish so low in the rankings despite having good reviews and content on RR). It's rather good, and follows the protagonist as she lives a double life as a criminal and a magic-school student in a male disguise. The worldbuilding is also rather unique so far, and the more mature magical-school approach with a helping of political intrigue is fun to read about (also, the cover art is great).

I also read:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41521/a-budding-scientist-in-a-fantasy-world][A Budding Scientist in a Fantasy World]] and it's okay. Nothing too special, but a decent enough popcorn read if you're hankering for some portal fantasy. I'd wait though, as with only 60k words, the plot doesn't really go anywhere yet.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38292/an-unbound-soul][An Unbound Soul]] and it's also okay. More portal-fantasy (what can I say, the genre just does it for me for some reason) but it looks like it's on hiatus. Really, I'd probably rate this higher if the main plot (the fact that the whole world is a mind-control dystopia/utopia) actually went somewhere instead of just going nowhere. Right now, it's all about a toddler grinding levels and skills which is really boring (I find litrpg meh in general) and the synopsis is badly written, because it reveals the big twist (mind-control) which only gets revealed in-story after ~80k words. In general, in reincarnation-stories, I much prefer it when the younger years of the protagonist are covered with speed or have some sort of meaning instead of just being a litrpg vehicle for "numbers go up".

*** I have to de-rec /your review/ of An Unbound Soul (not the story itself, which I /do/ recommend).

1. On hiatus? The last update was less than a /day/ ago! And the previous ones less than a week!
2. You complain about the summary... yet somehow manage to miss the fact that the story is a sequel to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37231/a-lonely-dungeon][A Lonely Dungeon]]. As in the /second/ story in a series. Which is /linked in said summary/. What, next you will complain that the second book of Harry Potter mentions Hogwarts by name in its summary?!
3. The plot /is/ going places. Your complaint about it being too slow comes the closest to being an actual valid point, but only by the loosest definition. In the sense that it is a matter of taste. Objectively the story has a steady pace; there is relatively little /combat/ action and lots of world building. Considering that the story is as of today just shy of *60*k words long, when comparing with other progression fantasy works, I would honestly call the pace of the story outright /fast/.
4. While numbers /do/ go up, to claim that it is the sole point of this story is disingenuous at best, if not outright deceitful.

​

Can't say anything about the other reviews, as I haven't read the stories. Any second opinions?

**** Ah, I just checked again. Up untill a day or two ago the story stopped at chapter 27. Whoops!

Nevertheless, I stand by the opinion that it has serious pacing issues. To me it feels like the mind-control stuff is the main plot and it's what drew me in, but after 100k words there's only been the beginnings of what I'd describe as main plot. More specifically, I read the synopsis, got certain expectations, and then read hours of the protagonist growing up. This wasn't badly written or anything, just superfluous.

Also, yes it's a sequel, but the protagonist is not the same afaik.

*** Only Villains Do That was an interesting read. Let me be clear---I agree with everything you said and unreservedly recommend it. I enjoyed The Gods Are Bastards, and expect to have a good time following Webb's new work. The plot is more original than you might expect---it's not the first time someone has done a villain/morally ambiguous isekai or a secondary isekai, but not only does Webb spin it their own way, the other novel elements they peppers into the setting and the plot add up to create an incredibly refreshing experience in a somewhat oversaturated genre.

However, I can't help but think it feels a lot like Webb is writing for their audience this time around. There are some patterns in the work come across as distinctly Royal-Roadlike, which isn't a bad thing, and doesn't necessarily detract from the quality or my enjoyment of the work.

*Major spoilers in the spoiler tags; for spoiler-free commentary, skip to the unspoilered section below. You can also ignore the WtC quote.*

One of the most glaring ones to me is the use of physical and sexual violence against women as a recurring plot device. One of the first things the protagonist does is become offended when he sees a group of bandits keeping a woman prisoner, defeat said bandits, hand the woman a weapon and allow her to enact vigilante justice upon her would-be rapists. Later on, he bribes a Watch captain to prevent some women from being raped in jail. There's an almost explicit implication that the protagonist perceives harm done to women as being more morally consequential than harm done to men. The first unambiguously bad action the protagonist does involves lighting a woman on fire.

The recent Worth the Candle batch is very relevant here, I think, and perhaps what drove me to notice this:

#+begin_quote
  “Raven is wondering why it's always women, which Juniper feels defensive about, and would deflect on, which would risk escalation of conflict. In fact, Juniper knows why it's always women, which is that he personally finds it more shocking and horrible when bad things happen to women, especially if there's some element of sexuality involved. He recognizes this as being inherently unfair to both women and men, but his efforts to reframe his view of the world have so far failed, and in his opinion, so long as his actions don't reflect that bias too badly, he's not going to worry about it. There's some unresolved guilt there though.”
#+end_quote

So much of the story revolves around harm being done to women, harm being prevented against women, and aid being offered to women. It's gratuitous, and comes across as Webb feeding an audience that eats up stuff like this. Righteous indignation at threats of rape. Hero fantasies of saving waifus from terrible fates. I'm sure there are people more versed in the discourse that can explain this better than me.

And yet they manage to keep it all tasteful. Nothing is played out in graphic detail solely for the shock value. No women falling over themselves to praise the main character for his magnanimity or fighting over his affections. The woman he rescued at the start of the story pivots into becoming a useful party member rather than a generic love interest tease. The hardships described are realistic, and the characters in the story respond to them in realistic ways. Everyone in the story comes across as a rational actor. There are no waifus or harems, only tight plot, excellent characters and creative worldbuilding.

Basically, Only Villains Do That feels designed to appeal to the Royal Road audience by smelling like wish fulfillment and weird pseudo-misogyny, yet at the same time work with the sensibilities of the more traditional web serial audience (Worm, PGtE, Wandering Inn, TGaB, etc.) by /not actually being a weird pseudo-misogynistic hero fantasy/, just vaguely pushing the same buttons while being a perfectly rational and respectful story.

It mostly sticks out because it's a departure from The Gods are Bastards, which I've seen being criticized for coming across too strong with its feminist elements and being SJW soapbox. A criticism I disagree with, by the way, because usually they're talking about Trissiny at the start of TGaB, and that's just part of her character. But it drives home the juxtaposition of what reading The Gods are Bastards felt like and what reading Only Villains Do That feels like.

Once again, I really do like OVDT. Great story, great author. This isn't really a criticism, only a weird observation. I don't know if Webb is intentionally writing for an audience, or if it's just how it came out when he sat down and wrote a portal fantasy to a borderline grimdark world with all the harsh realities that entails, as opposed to a fantasy Western setting with a militant feminist cult as one of the dominant world religions.

I would talk about the arguable queerbaiting when Seiji in a fit of desperation tries to cast a spell on another man that makes the caster appear irresistibly sexy to the target until they fuck, but Webb gets a pass on that one because it's actually hilarious.

**** Interesting analysis, and I generally agree.

I think you're on the mark with a more "writing for the audience" approach in OVDT. I mean, TGAB was/is clearly Webb's passion project--you don't write that much if you don't like it--but it hasn't really managed to get very wide readership like webfictions of similar monolithic scale often do. It feels like OVDT is an attempt to use these lessons learned, and write something more popular/widely read (but still excellent obviously), for example:

- Posting on RR gives readers faster than hosting it on your own wordpress
- An easy to understand and familiar premise draws in readers (isekai)
- Small character cast and clear plot makes it easier for a webfiction audience to follow (my main TGAB criticism)

**** (I haven't read TGaB so I can't speak to that. I tried briefly once but it didn't click, easily could've been a persoanl timing issue though so I might try again eventually)

I'm not going to count out the in-universe misogyny and plot points as not being an intentional decision by in-story goddesses pulling Some More Bullshit, the Hero got his full "totally not a harem" party thing started, the stuff happening to the main character could be more of the same. The "magic armour on feminine bodies morphs to being revealing and salacious when equipped" thing mentioned in passing kind of supports that take.

I don't mean to give it all a possible pass by saying that, but I guess as writing its at least a little better than standard isekai trash author line of "its my character's deep and personal choice to wear a chainmail bikini as a personal commitment and reminder to become more open and trusting" or other such bullshit. I'm also not discounting an eventual conversation with one of the goddesses taking the "this world is reflecting on your desires, don't you think that's fucked up?" (maybe to the Hero more than the mc) not so discretely pointed at the readers in a similar vein to the game Spec Ops: The Line has as its ending.

***** Ah, I forgot about the boob armour thing.

Yes, a lot of things can be ascribed to the setting and goddess interference. But that's just the brilliance of it---it's all plausibly deniable. It's like a superposition of two stories, one that's slightly-better-than-standard isekai trash with creative worldbuilding but questionable overtones, and another story that's an interesting metanarrative/deconstruction about a sensible protagonist reacting to an isekai trash world with isekai trash plot contrivances. The protagonist occupies an ill-defined character space that allows both white knight harem fantasy fans and rational/rational-adjacent fiction fans to project their values onto him.

In fact, even within the rational genre, the protagonist manages to simultaneously come across as "hypercompetent uplift SI that's smarter than everyone but the world contrives to oppose him and cast him as evil because they don't understand his sheer brilliance", and "person with flaws just doing his best and making difficult decisions, sometimes making mistakes".

I'm not mad, just impressed. And slightly weirded out.

But I trust Webb---TGaB is one of the most explicitly socially progressive web fiction works I've read, with excellent queer and female representation in characters with real agency, traits and compelling stories. While I'm not going to expect Only Villains Do That to have any gay kissing (except of the lesbian variety, because MLM is ew and WLW is hot) because RoyalRoad readers are allergic to that kind of thing, I trust the story not to go full Savage Divinity on us. If we get a neat arc about isekai tropes being enforced by narrative contrivance, all the better. Regardless, I'll keep reading.

******* From what I remember of Savage Divinity, it's technically well-written and has a bit of rational bent. However, it's also a harem story, and has a lot of the negative traits emblematic of the genre. I don't remember enough to point out specific points, but I remember feeling squicked out and eventually dropping the story. Blue Core didn't annoy me as much as Savage Divinity, and it's literally about a sex dungeon. (I eventually dropped that to, but because I lost interest, not because of the harem.)

******** Huh. I didn't find the harem aspects of Savage Divinity particularly problematic. As far as I can tell, the MC treats his wives well and they are more than pointless eye candy for filling the harem.

What annoys me is the glacially slow pacing and pointless introspection. Most chapters spend at least half of their word count in the mind of the viewpoint character showing how they react or consider different characters and situations. And even then a lot of the thoughts are repeated thoughts that the character often has, such as how fluffy and cute a pet is.

I'm just venting about Savage Divinity now because I've had these greviances for a while now.

I read Blue Core as well, and I've also mostly lost interest at this point. I binged up through 200+ chapters but can't find the motivation to check for updates more than once a month. Too much time spent describing Sim City gameplay and not enough on the interesting characters in the world.

I don't think I can be trusted to give an objective opinion, because anything I say is going to be skewed by the fact that it's a harem story. I'm not going to say that harems are intrinsically problematic, but in practice they tend to be, and they tend to appeal to fantasies fundamentally rooted in sexist thought and objectification even if the author manages to not be sexist or objectify their female characters. More relevantly, harems certainly make /me/ personally feel uncomfortable. So I'm not the person to ask about SD.

You know, I never really got a SJW soapbox feeling from early Trissiny. I got more of a soapbox feeling from later portrayals of the Thieves Guild. It felt like they got more and more suish. Whether "all systems are corrupt" is SJW or not... I don't have strong feelings either way.

***** If I didn't make it clear, I /don't/ think any parts of TGaB is soapboxy. The Thieves Guild I think isn't really something that can be criticized because it's just what the Thieves' Guild is characterized as. Their philosophies get free reign because the only people in on their doctrine is people who are in the Guild, and people in the Thieves Guild are going to be proponents of their own doctrine, especially when it's something as nebulous and unfalsifiable as "all systems are corrupt". I never got the feeling that Eserion was meant to be "best cult", and in fact we get plenty of examples of the Guild failing to live up to its own hype, mostly by basically becoming a system itself.

It's somewhat comparable to real-life communism, which can be talked up academically, but tends to fall short in implementation, or anarchism, or objectivism---the platonic concept of Eserite doctrine is unchallenged because it's impossible to implement on a large scale in reality, and any time the Guild tries to do anything and fails they say it's just because the Boss wasn't good enough at being Eserite, because a /real/ Eserite wouldn't try to do anything organized and meaningful. We just sit around and react to people we think are getting uppity! It's the ultimate feel-good philosophy, because you get to act self-righteous about tearing down the people on top, but when you get questioned about what exactly the point of all of this is, what positive change you're ultimately trying to effect in the world, and what those people are doing over there, hey stop that, you just shrug and say, "I dunno, that sounds like a system, and you know what they say about systems?"

(Note that I don't remember much from TGaB proper, because Trissiny's Guild arc was a while ago, as was the last TGaB update :( so correct me if I'm misrepresenting the Guild here.)

I felt that as time went on the Guild became more of an authors pet. In earlier chapters their PoV bishop was explaining to the elves he's training how there's always a bigger fish so you need to be careful not to get noticed by it. Later on that same bishop broke into the house of the empire's spymaster to threaten him.

In early chapters the Aveiests were criticising the Thives Guild's style of vigilante justice as not being justice at all. In later chapters when Trissany joins the guild on a temporary basis she has no objection using their methods when the Aveiests can't touch one of their own bishops for some reason.

Sorry for being vague, but it's been a long time since I read it.

*** I de-rec /Only Villains Do That/.

As [[/u/jiffyjuff]] mentioned, "So much of the story revolves around harm being done to women, harm being prevented against women, and aid being offered to women." However, I disagree that the author manages to keep things tasteful by omitting exact details. It's a recurring plot device that reeks of masculine white knighthood, robbing female characters of agency.

The female bodyguard? Saved from rape and empowered solely by MC's whims.

The women in the opposing adventuring party? Saved from rape solely by MC's whims.

And don't forget the helpless prostitutes in the red light district who are the only mass recipients of MC's freely spammable, ultra-powerful heal, or the goblin women who (ineffectively, because MC is too good for that) use sex appeal as their primary bargaining chip.

The author/MC seems to view sexual harm and rape as completely different from physical harm, which makes the whole toxic masculinity thing worse in my eyes. Repeatedly burning people until they're on the brink of death and then healing them so you can do it again? MC thinks that's acceptable to accomplish his purposes. Rape with minimal physical harm? Noooo, women are delicate flowers and must be put on a pedestal where they will not be deflowered.

Additionally the main character is an irrational Marty Stu that doesn't try to make the most of his abilities, doesn't stay true to his characterization as a selfish prick, and doesn't rationally pursue his supposedly primary goal of getting revenge on the Evil Goddess that forced him to become the dark lord (like, maybe by teaming up with the Hero, who seems to think that MC is a pretty swell guy). You want to get revenge against the Evil Goddess? How about joining the Hero, or becoming a Healer, or spamming Heal+Slime to create a tidal wave of healing slimes to help the world, or visiting any of the dungeons to get more magic and make an actual difference?

**** The issue is he at least has to pretend to make an attempt at being evil, or be annihilated by the goddesses. I'm pretty sure if he just decides to turn to the light side, neither goddess is going to stand for that, rules be damned. The premise is built to not allow him to optimize his approach. Honestly, I was skeptical of how he even plans to get back at the goddesses, since they're literal deities. Now it's clear that it's likely going to involve messing with the source code of reality, since his special ability gives him a foothold to hack into the system, but before he knew that, it was kind of a hopeless idea. I imagine a less suicidal and more realistically minded person would settle for building an industrialized authoritarian state, leaning on the evil /aesthetic/ and abstract concept of tyranny to win "evil overlord points" without actually doing anything that morally questionable.

But yes, I agree on the treatment of women thing. If it were an unknown writer, I would probably agree that it smells like bad writing. However, as I mentioned, the author has done very good work before, so I'm inclined to give them the benefit of he doubt.

I take your point, but most of my suggestions could plausibly be argued as part of the evil master plan. E.g. subverting the hero, taking over a country by using healing as a carrot, fielding unstoppable armies of soldiers paired with healing slimes.

*** W.r.t. "A Practical Guide to Sorcery" I guess one problem is that it has a "Gender Bender" tag which can be an indication for a bad fic (it's pretty hard to do the topic justice and often can be just left out). I wouldn't categorize a "Song of the Lioness" setup as a Gender Bender either.

And w.r.t. underrated. The litrpg "Gods of Blood and Bone" and sequels ([[https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Azalea-Ellis-ebook/dp/B012CLCCAK][amazon]]) by the same author is pretty good. It has YA elements, but it's better than other YA books. Idk why it isn't more successful.

**** Yeah. If I were the author I wouldn't have included it because typically the tag indicates stories where questions concerning sexuality or identity are critical to the narrative.

In this story, they aren't, and the male secret identity is basically just a very fancy costume (so far). Unless the author has future plot plans concerning this point, I'd advise them to get rid of the tag.

*** I enjoyed Only Villains Do That. So far the character hasn't been significantly evil, and him not being evil by nature (just a dick) is nice. (Ex: compare to Overlord where the main character doesn't seem to care about people) Though, he is undoubtedly going to have to do far worse than what he has done so far.\\
Relatively mild spoilers:\\
The opening chapters he's more unreasonably a dick, but later on he grows to be less of one. Though, I do think the latest chapters have had him grow /too/ kindly, making him your normal competent protagonist. Though the acknowledgement about where he's weak (military history, etc) does help avoid that somewhat.\\
I feel like the story is somewhat grabbing Isekai tropes and trying to subvert them. He's the villain rather than the hero. He doesn't actually /want/ to go around becoming a dark lord, he just dislikes people. He does the usual save person getting attacked and then rather than having them be the usual 'but you are a dark lord!' person who gets converted, Aster handles it far more competently while not being evil herself. The background characters, the bandits are interesting in of themselves.\\
I do agree with others that a surprising amount of the violence in it is of the sort of MC protecting women from getting sexually assaulted. I'm not against them including it, but when the majority of the negative things about this society are this it feels overdone. It would be more interesting seeing the wide array of how fucked up the society is. I think some of this annoyance is how much it comes up in the character's thoughts towards the latest chapters. It didn't harm the story overall too much, and at least the character is trying to do something more notable than just stopping attacks that come to his attention, which does fit with the whole societal change aspect that the story is trying to do.

They email the student about it and get replies that have the same odd mistakes. One of the professors accuses them of being a Chinese room added to the course as a prank by other professors, and fails them for his course, but then later finds out that the student really exists! Eventually the professors discover the student is a genius at writing deep learning algorithms but so lazy that they never put any conscious thought into the coursework and generated all their responses using an improved version of GPT-3. Meanwhile, the student perceives any attempt to make them think critically or be conscious during class time as an attack, and the student protects himself by submitting terrible reviews about each of the professors at the end of the course. “The professor is insane and deliberately confuses the students talking about nonsense. Terrible class and a waste of time!”

*** Let me introduce you to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13796073/chapters/31715919][Life Bends Down]], a Worm no-powers college AU featuring the Cauldron cast. It's not representative of the genre, because it's more of a well-meaning satire of the College AU, deriving humor from the juxtaposition of placing some of Worm's most morally questionable characters into a "light-hearted" setting. Extremely verbose, introspective and technical, which is half of the irony.

I've read quite a few coffee shop fics, but usually they're AUs that happen to be staged in a coffee shop rather than a story who's premise is "coffee shop". One more common example is using it for secret identity gimmicks, where the core humor is the clueless coffee shop worker (or service worker in general) interacting with someone with a Secret™. Unfortunately, I can't remember any off the top of my head.

I have only read one or two college AUs, and they're the same thing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2447843][Hemingway Can Suck It]] is a good one, though strictly one might classify it as an /academia/ AU.

** Two slightly odd recommendations this week:

First, a series of interconnected stories first published on [[/r/nosleep]] called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/][How to Survive Camping]]. It's a series of horror stories narrated by a very blasé campground manager. The main character is very practical in dealing with absurd supernatural things and over course of the first book it built to a surprisingly satisfying arc. It's detailed and lush descriptions of the creatures out of folklore are very well done. I'd say it's a little like Welcome to Night Vale or American Gods at times.

Second, an animated series on HBOMax (or the high seas...) called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Train][Infinity Train]]. The premise is that people facing turmoil in their lives end up on a infinite train where each car is a different environment and learn about themselves. Each season follows a different person's character arc. It does a very good job of creating a surreal and unsettling vibe. The main character for the first season is a young girl who wanted to go to a coding camp. While not explicitly rational, I think many of the people here might see their younger selves in her. She does a decent job of trying to explore a fundamentally irrational place using rationality. Overall, it's one of those kid shows that is unsettling enough you end up wondering exactly who it's aimed at. (e.g. one of the main characters straight up murders someone). There are well done themes of identity and reality, and the show eventually gets into the mechanics of the train to a satisfying degree.

The protagonist meets a man sent back in time to prevent a world-ending disaster who has been sending letters to world leaders to forewarn them of smaller incident to build his credibility. Starts off with him trading the stock market but it snowballs fairly quickly.

It ticks a lot of boxes for me --- I really like the civilisation-building genre and the author has clearly done his research and gets it all mostly right about the military and disaster relief. He goes into a lot of detail about Africa too, which I really enjoy. His views on China and Russia are a bit too charitable, but it was written about 10 years ago.

*** /Youjo Senki/, a LN/manga where a 21st century Japanese businessman gets transported to an alternate world that is loosely based off of early 20th century Earth, and reincarnated into the body of a young girl at the outset of the Great War.

/A Young Girl's Political Record/ is a fanfic/sequel of Youjo Senki. I really enjoyed it and its alt-history. I did find the ending a bit rushed, and the promised epilogue has yet to be written (though half of the last chapter kinda fits that), but overall it was a fun read. I've seen some complaints that it whitewashes Germany/nazis, but I didn't really get that impression, since the MC isn't Hitler and has no interest in being a successful version of him.

Abyssal Road Trip is really, really badly written. (Almost) everything about the technical execution of the writing is bad. The list of things wrong with it is longer than I have patience to enumerate.

And yet I read it anyway, because ... I don't even know why! I wanted to see where the story goes? I like some of the characters? I wanted characters I don't like to get their comeuppance? Fuck, I don't know. I hate myself for reading it, I hate it for making me read it, THANKS I HATE IT.

I'd vaguely consider it rational fiction; the characters use their abilities in interesting and creative ways, characters all have their own motivations that aren't necessarily revolving around the MC, the character is or at least grows to be introspective/meta-cognitive to some extent.

Because the writer wanted the MC to be a tomboy, so instead of writing a tomboy they made it a genderbender. Also, they make an absurd amount of money. It's painful seeing wtc and pgte below $2k and magic smiting above $10k.

****** Many early access chapters are where the money is. Magic Smithing is written well enough that people read up to the current chapter and then see that they /could/ read another whopping 25 chapters for just a couple bucks.

This changes the transaction from "I want to support the author" to "I want to pay money so I can read more" which is more profitable/attracts more patrons

This always bugs me about Cradle's writing style. The author is hyper focused on cutting anything he considers fluff, and that's worked well in many ways, but he goes too far and it feels like he's just getting more extreme as the series progresses.

***** In the last book there were like 10+ PoV characters in a 90k word book. To the point where the much anticipated reunion of Lindon with his family was them exchanging like 30 words of superficial dialogue with each with each other. Same for the comeuppance with his clan, another 30 words of dialogue.

Speaking of which! A proper writer would have actually up set up the betrayal by reminding us of these characters that were first introduced 9 books ago. /Anything at all/ to make it resonate emotionally! Instead it falls absolutely flat because these are all just cardboard cutouts instead of characters, with feelings and motivations that are completely opaque to the reader. Blergh.

Honestly, it didn't even seem like he tried to that, to me. It seemed like he /set that up/, and then never bothered to go back to it. I was honesty kind of confused when the kaiju showed up and not one of these threads had been picked up again. It felt like the book was rushed, for no particular reason.

Entertainment at the end of the day is a tool, if at any point it starts taking control of you or being detrimental it probably needs to be looked at and fixed.
