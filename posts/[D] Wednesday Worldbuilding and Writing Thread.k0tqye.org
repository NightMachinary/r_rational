Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** A set of magics based on map/territory confusion:

The better your "map", the more control you have over the "territory" it depicts. Better in this case means more in the way of detail, permanency, and more artistic ability, with a focus on representation, clarity, and precision. Once a "map" has been completed, it can be altered, and alteration of the map will cause alteration of the territory that the map represents.

Cartographers map out the lands, usually in broader strokes, taking pen to paper, typically with extremely precise measurements and surveying equipment. Cartographers are responsible for the macroscopic order of the world, forests and mountains, rivers and bays, making areas hospitable for humanity, usually by providing protection against natural disasters, clearing areas that aren't fit for human habitation, or preparing lands for cultivation. In times of war, cartographers are responsible for erecting "natural" defenses, as well as breaking those same defenses. Defense naturally trumps offense, since

Architects work somewhat differently, working in three dimensions rather than two. They make precise scale models of the building in question, the larger the better, the more connected the materials, the better, and once that's accomplished, they can make relatively small changes to the building by changing the model. Done properly, an architect can change the materials of the building, though subtle shifts are far easier than dramatic ones.

Sculptors typically work with the human form, though a few specialize in animals or plants instead. A sculptor makes a form of a person, as precise as possible, usually at the scale of real life in order to get extra impact. This sculpture is then altered in order to provide benefits to the subject, or in rare cases, to harm them. Only those at the upper echelon of society have a sculptor to their name, given that it's very labor-intensive, but there are many benefits that can be provided by a sculptor, including more muscle mass.

* How the World Looks
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
The world is divided into the planned and unplanned, with the planned areas being carefully crafted and managed. For the most part, you can tell when you're somewhere that's being actively groomed by cartographers or not, since you'll find much more in the way of both efficiency and aesthetics. All major buildings are crafted by architects, expanded and reinforced in ways that no merely mundane construction techniques would be capable of. With these techniques comes power, and it's a certainty that these professions would be tightly controlled, and mapping restricted to a guild or government branch.

The existence of sculpting means that clothing is conservative as a matter of basic security. Clothing that reveals your shape means that you are vulnerable to sculpting, though a sculpture that's created without willing consent or a sitting would need to be made by a master, and even then would be weak. The protection offered by conservative clothing would only really be necessary for the elites, who are the only ones that would have to worry much about being sculpted against their will, but fashion travels downward to those who seek to emulate their betters.

Sculpture for animals means that the most important animals can be made larger and stronger, though because sculpture doesn't have any impact on genetics (presumably), these alterations are recurring costs as new animals need to be modified each generation. The same is true when it comes to plants, but at least with plants you might have fruiting trees that don't have a definite lifespan to worry about, and don't need to be killed in order to produce a surplus.

The rules, such as they are, defy mass production ... expect that if you go through the work of sculpting/mapping/architecting multiple things so that they can be referred to by the same "map", then you might be able to leverage that. This seems like it would be most doable with architecture, where you're typically creating the base rather than adapting some pre-existing material. I think this probably creates a dynamic where duplicates are a sign of an organizationally powerful civilization, but for the people who are organized that way, a sign of being in the underclass, but I'm not quite sure about that.

I think there's probably more work to do on this, especially with some of the corner cases, logical extensions, implied branches of magic, and consequences, but I'm not currently planning to use it in a story, since the "story seams" don't seem all that deep to me.

What would be an example of a "subtle" building transmutation, and how long does it take? Because turning e.g. a steel building into a tungsten building seems very economically exploitable.

**** The idea of using the architectural magic (or for that matter, the other magics too) in order to duplication materials is something that I've been noodling, because if it's allowed, then it's probably the most important feature of the system, at least from a worldbuilding perspective. Architects would replace mines and forestry service, and ... that's not really that interesting to me.

I'm not sure what kind of patch is best (there are a few obvious ones), but it probably depends on the kind of story I'd want to be using the systems for.

** Worm fanfiction question. Should the green lantern emotion spectrum be treated similarly to the character Weld in respect to the Manton effect?

To further explain, some powers are limited in such a way as to only affect living things. Other powers only affect nonliving things. Hardly ever can someone do both.

In weld's case, he is a living man of metal. Things that affect the living don't affect him because his metal counts as nonliving. Things that affect the nonliving do not affect him because he counts as a living person. So he gets the best of both worlds.

How do you think hard light constructs made of will should interact with the Manton effect?

*** I'm a little confused about the question. Most non-worm superpowers can't affect humans internally. Telekinetics can't just create instability in the hear to cause someone to pass out, hydrokinetics can't affect the cerebrospinal fluid, portal creators can't create portals inside someone, and I don't off-hand remember any green lanterns that created stuff inside someone as their standard attack.

Maybe what you mean is whether green constructs counts as both living and dead? I think they mostly are energy taken physical form so I don't see why that would count as living.

This is the correct interpretation of my question. I would consider the emotion itself living.

*** You could split the diffrence. Just say that collagen fibers are yellow enough that green powers dont really work on them completely. It is probably more scientifically accurate to account for the mixing of waveforms of light. So white light has some resistance so you cant make say a photon thin blade and slice things unless they are in deep darkness.

So you can hit someone with a hard light hammer but you couldn't force choke them really.

** rationalist optimization of a magical artifact:

If you could have a knife that perfectly cuts only one type of material (only wood, only rock, only metals, only flesh etc etc) what would be the most rational pick, and how would you use it?

For the sake of the argument lets assume that the knife looks like a standard steak knife, and its edge disintegrates the chosen type of material allowing the blade to slice through with zero resistance.

*** In general, this is going to be most useful for materials that are otherwise difficult-to-impossible to cut through. Wood and flesh are not very difficult, but metal and stone would make for good candidates. It's also going to generally be more useful for materials that are more plentiful which makes stone likely to be the best choice for most cases.

From a combat perspective, metal might have a niche as the better choice since you can bypass metal armor and shields, and destroy any metal weapons that you parry. However, this requires being directly in hand-to-hand combat which is rarely a good idea. Sooner or later, someone is going to stab you to death.

Stone nonetheless offers an interesting potential role in combat. Instead of using it to attack people, you can use the knife to cut through stone defenses, like walls. For example, if you have an army assaulting a fortified city, you can build a portable defense platform to provide cover as you walk up to the wall and then use the knife to cut a hole and start letting soldiers through. As the attack moves through the city, you could use the knife to create unconventional entrances into fortified buildings to allow soldiers to bypass many of the defenses.

Aside from these, stone offers some substantial economic uses. You can use the knife to quickly make stone bricks for castle-building, or even hollow out stone pipe sections. You can also make various stone-crafts like mugs, bowls, plates, dice, candlesticks, jade rings, and even furniture like granite tables or countertops, and marble benches or statues.

One other advantage of stone is that, with the right gearing system, you could use the knife for tunnel boring. You could build a steam-powered machine which spins the knife to cut through the rock in front of it, and then spits it out the back with a conveyor belt so that workers can haul it away. A machine like this could be used to quickly tunnel under enemy defenses, or to build an escape tunnel to bypass an enemy siege. You could also use it to dig pilot holes to locate ore veins if you want to set up mines for coal, metal ores, and precious gems.

*** What counts as a material, and how granular can I get? Does it have to be some sort of concept, like stone or wood? Because chemically, not all stone is going to be the same. Can I go molecularly? Can I break atomic bonds? Can I split atoms? Can I split subatomic particles?

**** "the type of material" is conceptual, but must be common sense, and can only be decided once and for all. So for example, "wood" is ok, if you consider wood to be a type of material. "Carbon" could be conceptually a type of material, if you think that way. But "Love" or "nothingness" or "space time", or "quarks" are not really a type of material in most people's minds. So unless you are a very strange kind of physicist or a philosopher, you wont be able to code the knife for something ephemeral or non-obvious.

***** I like the idea that the limitations on "type of material that can be cut" are entirely decided by the wielder's mind/worldview. So if you could train your mind to think in a much more literal/physical sense about how matter works, then you could potentially do something really cool and physics-y with the knife. (This scenario reminds me of the partial transfiguration plot point in HPMOR.)

***** In that case, I think the best choice is a material that a regular knife cannot ordinarily cut through, so I'd go with either metal or stone (with wood as a distant third). But overall, I think the best choice would be metal.

Naturally, there are always going to be situations where one option is more useful than others. However, there are already available tools for cutting through wood (axes and saws) and shaping stone (chisels and hammers), but as far as I know, precise cutting or shaping of metal requires either a very high-pressure water jet or heating it in a forge and then hammering it. Thus, while tools for the former 2 substances can run off of elbow grease, tools for the latter typically require additional external resources and infrastructure.
