Hi folks,

Short version: if you would like to read The Two Year Emperor you have one week to download it from:

[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/two_year_emperor.tgz]]

This includes absolutely everything -- all the author's notes, all the reviews, the timeline, various snippets that didn't get used, everything. It goes away May 26 my time and I'm on the other side of the Date Line from most of you, so don't wait.

Long version:

As I've mentioned before, I am trying to monetize 2YE. This is a story that I wrote and put online for free for two years (which is rather apropos considering the name). A couple days ago I posted the first 8 chapters to Amazon under the "you can borrow this book for free and I get paid more money" option, which seemed like a win for everyone.

Now, Amazon has an exclusivity requirement, so I had to remove those 8 chapters from fanfiction.net. The simple thing would have been to remove the whole story, but I chose to instead replace those chapters with a pointer saying "you can still read this for free on Amazon, and the other chapters are still here." I thought I was doing the right thing and choosing the best option for everyone.

I've since been informed that this seems like an exploitative bait'n'switch -- that having the story up is bait, and then people come in to read it and whoops! they have to go to Amazon and have a Kindle Unlimited account. (Granted, I also gave a pointer to the free trial version of KU, but the person in question said that free trials are also bait'n'switch, because people will forget to cancel the trial before being charged.)

I don't agree with this assessment, but I see how some people might. I'd rather not have a reputation for being exploitative, so I'm going to give the complete story away for another week and then remove it. After this week it will be a purely commercial venture, although you can of course still get it for free through KU if you have an account.


** For what it's worth, I think you're doing the best you could with what you've got. It all seems fair to me, in any case, and this is definitely a good gesture :)

*** EDIT: I had a response with specific numbers and such, but it was complicated. Let me boil it down.

Monetizing this in any way other than the one I'm using would cost me money. Either due to publishing on sites with smaller audiences, publishing under options that have much smaller royalties, or paying the fees for print on demand. The way I've done it gives me the most money and gives you the option to read it for free while I still get paid. You just need to create a KU account using the free trial link that I've provided, read 2YE, and then remember to cancel the KU account within a month, which is pretty easy if you schedule a reminder on your Google Calendar.

That's it exactly. I rented out my San Francisco apartment to someone I know for more than I was paying and less than he was paying -- win! Revenue stream in place, I went to Malaysia-- George Town in Penang. If you try it, this is where I suggest going -- nice city, everyone speaks enough English that you can get by, and you can drink the water. I also recommend staying at the Reggae House Hostel in Love Lane. It's a capsule hostel -- for USD$11 / night you get a pod in a 4-person dorm. The pod is 8' deep by 4' high by 4' wide. The bottom is a mattress, there's a socket and a light, a cabinet to put your glasses etc, a space at the head for stuff, and a blackout curtain for privacy. Very comfortable. The entire hostel has A/C. The one downside is that they kick on the reggae music at about 6pm and it's the same 6 of 7 songs on loop. You can go upstairs to get away from it, though. The hostel has good food, but it's spendy at 15-18 ringgit per meal. (About $4.50 to $5.40). If you go to one of the bao vendors you can get a couple of bao -- large fluffy dumplings, two is an excellent meal -- for 3 ringgit total.

I haven't done anything touristy here in SEA. I sit in the hostel, I write or play harp, I go out for meals. That's it. As a result I can't recommend anything to do or see, sorry.

On advice of a friend, I relocated to Chiang Mai, Thailand about six weeks ago. More or less the same as Malaysia, although the hostel I'm staying in is $6/night (200 baht), but otherwise the prices are the same, roughly, you *cannot* drink the water., and most people do not speak English. I'm at the "PM Guest House", and I strongly recommend it as a place to stay if you come to CM. Pim (male, from Holland) and Miki (female, born in Bangkok but spent so much time in the USA that she identifies more that way) both speak English fluently and are extremely friendly. They have a minimal but tasty menu (eg large bowl of muesli w/yoghurt, dragon fruit, various other fruit) for 90 baht and I often do that for dinner -- it's about what it would cost to go out and it's easy, tasty, quick.

Water in Chiang Mai runs about 18 baht / 1.5 liter. (1 baht = $0.03) There are refill stations all over the place which dispense 1L of potable water for 1B. If you end up at PMGH the nearest is right out the door, right, walk about 100' to the washing machines.

*** I'm probably one of the only people who cares, so let me see if I can explain:

Originally, 2YE was put up on ff.net. We (generally) liked it, shared it, commented on it, reviewed it, and offered suggestions for it, many of which made their way into work itself. 2YE owes much of its success to the fact that it was free online for anyone to read. 2YE owes some fractional amount of its ideas to the readers who would comment on each chapter as it was posted. There wasn't any indication that the story would be taken down and locked into Amazon's service.

There were threads like [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mdy5l/spoilers_bst_crowdsourcing_plot_points_for_the/]["Crowdsourcing plot points for Book II"]] or [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2a2vrk/q_if_you_were_jake_in_the_two_year_emperor_what/]["If you were Jake, what would you do?"]] or [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2bj6ag/q_mk_what_would_you_ask_loki_two_year_emperor/]["What would you ask Loki?"]] It was in many ways a community thing. People contributed because it was open to everyone. And now, in a week's time it's going to be locked into Amazon's service, probably indefinitely. I already have the story downloaded using Calibre, which I did a long time ago. It's not a matter of me personally not being able to read it, it's that I see/saw 2YE as being this friendly community thing, and see this move as disregarding the community in order to make a buck.

I wouldn't have had a problem with it if 2YE had been pay-to-play from the get-go, or if the stated intention was always to shut down the story on ff.net and sell it, but if that had been the case I don't think it would be as successful a story as it is today, for a number of reasons.

And that's why I think it's a bait and switch.

In most cases I would not object, but this situation has pissed me off enough that I do not want it mirrored anywhere.

I burned 10-15 hours per week on this project for a year and a half; that's almost a part-time job. On multiple occasions I went through some contortions to make sure that it posted on time. I am now breaking Amazon's TOS in order to /once again/ give it away for free for an entire week, along with all of my author's notes and every other scrap of content ever generated around this project, *including the cover images that I paid money for*.

--------------

[[/u/mitdemwolftanzt]], a few things for you:

Writing a few Internet posts does not give you moral or legal ownership of something I created any more than being part of an over-coffee chat in the meatspace world does. Yes, I originally did not intend for 2YE to be a commercial work. That was when I was making six figures as a programmer and didn't have time to produce more than a single story. Now I'm trying to be a professional author where I can live on the proceeds of that work so that I can produce more stuff which I consistently /give away for free/ before publishing it.

When I look at your posts I think your goals were either: (a) to ensure that there was a publicly-available version of 2YE, (b) to hurt my feelings and elevate yourself in the process by getting people to agree with your position, or (c) both.

Your initial post was rude. I thought about it and, instead of saying "go to hell" I responded by doing the absolute best that I possibly could given that I wanted to actually make a living and had to deal with a situation that wasn't perfect. I went well above and beyond the call of what I was required to do by any reasonable standard and an acknowledgement of that would have gone a long way towards getting you what you wanted the next time you disagree with one of my decisions.

Your second post, the one in this thread, was not only rude but (assuming that your goal involved option A above) was also counterproductive. Fortunately for you, there are more polite and more reasonable people on here.

Amazon has an exclusivity requirement on its KU program and I am leaving money on the table if I don't use that program. Leaving money on the table is not something I can afford to do right now.

Amazon /does/, however, also have a non-exclusive option -- it just pays less. At some point (weeks or months, MAYBE a year) the sales/borrows of 2YE will trail off and I will have extracted the benefit of having it be temporarily not completely Richard-Stallman-perfect-world free.

Assuming your goal was to have 2YE be publicly available, you would have been much better served to have this conversation instead:

[[/u/mitdemwolftanzt]]: Hey Dave, thanks for creating something fun. Given how much work you did it's cool for you to want to choose the option that best helps you make a living. Once the sales/borrows trail off though, the KU option isn't going to give you a big marginal return. At that point, how about moving 2YE out of KU so that everyone can mirror it?

[[/u/eaglejarl]]: Ooh, I like that idea! Yes, absolutely, I'll do that. In the meantime, let me give away absolutely everything related to 2YE so that no one has to be deprived of access to it.

--------------

Final result of the above:

Dear Public: Oh noes! I cannot stop you from mirroring my work! Nor can I explicitly say in public that you should do so, since that could be seen by a large corporation as me violating their TOS and get me sued! I /can/, however, say that I have better things to do than tattle on anyone who mirrors it or write C&D letters to anyone who does so. Whatever you do, please do not allow your actions to be dictated by the well-reasoned opinions of Corey Doctorow with whom I agree.

--------------

EDIT: [[/u/traverseda]]. Just in case you think the above is inconsistent: I /do/ feel that I am the sole owner of 2YE, where "owner" means "person who is allowed to specify in what way it can be used." Saying that it's cool to mirror it or putting it out under a CC license doesn't change the fact that I am the creator and the owner, it just means that I'm cool with other people doing whatever they like with it. In point of fact, I /am/ cool with that; I don't think I can legally release it under a CC license while it's under Amazon's exclusivity rules, but that seems like a very sensible thing to do once the advantages of being in KU have run out in a few weeks or months.

#+end_quote

Ehh, everybody who read it owns it. Because it's an idea in our heads now, and anything else is claiming you own a part of us. Cultural artifacts belong to everyone, even if it's a relatively small subculture.

That's what putting your work into the public sphere means. It means giving up ownership. The most popular web serials try to give people a sense of ownership over the work. Look at homestuck as one of the bigger examples. Everything the characters do is framed as user input from a form. Or [[/u/wildbow]]'s work as another example. John Dies At The End started out that way as well.

That's not where copyright law is, but that's very much where I am, morally. You can't own an idea like you can own a sofa, and you can't dictate what other people are going to do with an idea. It's a bit different when all those idea's are shoved together into a Work, but the principle is the same.

It's culturally a different way to look at it, but as a software dev people think they own the idea's I work with every day, in the form of overly broad patents. We can't treat ownership IP like it's owning furniture.

Even considering you as the sole owner, the one who can specify how it's used, it doesn't really mesh that you can change how people can use it after they've already used it. If you sold a book, you can't change the rules after they've already purchased it. Similar concept. You did decide how it can be used, and now you're changing your mind.

I'm not convinced this is going to work long term. Not posting your stuff in public means it reaches a smaller-still audience, and it's niche as well. Also, some of it is probably infringing on the IP of wizards of the cost, which isn't a huge problem if you're not making money off it...

Even well respected authors like Peter Watts, Branden Sanderson, etc, have a large chunk of their work available for free online. More often then not novel length.

In addition, you're tacitly supporting a platform that's using anti-competitive practices to try to capture an entire market.

Again, self-evidently not true. I can release a book as copyrighted and then later put it under CC. In this case I can put a work up under no stated license (but still under my legal ownership because that's how copyright works) and later decide that I am temporarily going to try to make money from it. I've also stated above that I intend to CC it once the KU advantage wears off. Cope and deal with the fact that you don't get to play with it for a few months.

Like it or not, they /have/ captured the market to a large degree (about 50%) and if I want to make a living doing this then I need to go through them.

Even so, they /did/ [[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html?_r=0][decide to play once they had control of their pricing.]]

If my Patreon gets to a high enough level that I can live on it (which, given where I live, is about $5k / month allowing for taxes) then sure, I would /love/ to give away all my stuff for free. It would make my life /hella/ easier than having to deal with Amazon's crappy interface, lengthy publishing process, restrictive TOS, unclear requirements, and blah blah blah. It would also give me moral satisfaction.

Before the payout change, short stories were a GREAT way to make money on Amazon. You wanted to have as many KU titles as possible, since every title borrowed was $1.34 to the good. Plus, if you had three related stories out you could bundle them together and get another salable / borrowable work for nothing; this was good for everyone, since the readers could buy a collection for less than the cost of the individual stories and the author had something extra to make money on.

As to Patreon -- yes, it's well suited to releasing short stories, but it's quite hard to get people to pony up recurring revenue when a lot of folks aren't even willing to pay for content in the first place. Even after the payout change, I've made more money from Amazon this month than from Patreon.

To use your analogy, it's like this guy owns a parking lot, and invites us to come park in it. We decide to make a weekly thing of brunch at the place next door, because we like the parking lot. Some time passes, and we come in for our weekly brunch, but now a bunch of meters have been put up in the parking lot. I'm not saying that he doesn't have a right to do that, I'm saying that I think it's kind of crappy for the people who were parking there for free, because the free parking was used to create a demand, and now we either have to pay or find a new place to have brunch.

My sales pitch is not aimed at the current fans.

I would be very surprised if that happened.
