Not to be the Debbie Downer around here, but [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/6vq/on_the_unpopularity_of_cryonics_life_sucks_but_at/][we seriously need to solve life before we solve death]].

Which isn't to say, don't go and fight old-age. Fighting to make getting older less sucky is an important part of "solving life" (hahaha, as if you "solve" life, right?). It's just also to say, even if there was no such thing as old age or age-related illness, you'd still get a lot of people /choosing/ to die at a certain point. Life /wears on you/ as you get older. My parents described it to me once, and I've been experiencing it a lot these past... three to five years.

That's not actually physical aging, because (stochastically) I've been getting /healthier/ over this time. It's more the feeling of different possibilities closing down while actuality turns out a lot different than you worked for, and just reproducing ordinary life from day to day turns out to take a lot of energy.

Basically, to really make immortality worth it, we /still/ kinda need the low challenge of daily life (as contrasted with the "high challenge" of capital-L Life) significantly reduced.

Absolutely. Given physics and all that, actual immortality is out of the question, so I think that our victory condition here is not an actually death-less world, but a world where people choose the time and manner of their deaths, and do so for reasons that have nothing to do with health (physical or otherwise), economic distress, or the like.

****** I don't think there's any victory condition. I think your vision of an ideal world is... I don't know quite how to put it, story thinking, wishful thinking, sour grapes.

At day n, I don't want to die, at day n+1 I won't want to die either and my mindset won't have changed. I don't want to become a person who would want to die, and I don't want the universe to become something that would make me want / accept death. Same idea for my loved ones, and same idea with less intensity for all human beings.

I can't imagine that this story has a happy ending. The way I see it, the universe is like a closed box with a finite amount of food in it; we can limit our numbers so we don't overshoot, we can ration the food, we can imagine clever ways to reframe the situation so that starving is acceptable in certain situations, but the reality is that every single one of us is going to starve, and the only things we can change are when it happens, who starves first, and how painful the starving is.

I'm supposed to say "and this is why you enjoy life as much as you can" or something, but I feel like that's just another clever reframing. Enjoying things as much as possible is the optimal choice, but it's not, like, philosophically complete.

Now make more paperclips.

Also, look at Japan, who are literally losing population. For bad reasons, sure, but it certainly proves it's possible to limit population growth.

It seems kind of silly to jump the gun to "it's impossible to support the population a deathless society would produce" when there're plenty of intermediate steps. As we progress toward one, it will obviously necessitate social and cultural reforms, and to judge a future by current social and cultural norms strikes me as fallacious in the same regard as it is to judge medieval times by feminist terms, etc.

My point is, we can definitely do better than now. We can live to 200 years old, which will be better than what we have now; we can live to 1.000 years old, which will be even better, or 10.000 years, etc.

But in any case, whether I live 100 or 100.000 years, when I die, it will always be too soon. If I ever change my mind, it's because I've lowered my standards, and that's ugly too. In other words, I don't think the victory condition callmesalticidae referred to exist. In a fundamental way, all we can do is lose /less/, and not think about it too much.

****** I always kinda wanted to get regeneration like Time Lords have. One persona "ends", but really the "core" of you stays basically the same while your accumulated "incidentals" get thrown around and "re-randomized" into a new outer persona. It's like saying, "I'm willing to throw out some of my accumulated treasure and feats in order to re-roll some parts of my character sheet."

Like, one of the things that makes me feel "old" is just the weight of existing expectations. My wife came home the other night and found me eating "baby" carrots. She said, "Are you the same [[/u/eaturbrainz]]? You don't eat carrots!" I had to actually explain to her, complete with getting another item out of the fridge, that carrots were in fact my first "crunchy" solid food, possibly my second or third solid food /period/, and I'd been eating them that way since I had teeth.

But somehow I managed to have an expected persona, in the eyes of the person closest to me, as a non-carrot-eater.

What happens when that kind of expectation has accumulated about /everything/, in /every/ major aspect or relationship that defines my life? It feels trapping.

Besides which, to deal with age rising arbitrarily high into the positive reals, we're gonna have to rearrange our life-cycle. Currently we've got:

- Get born
- Infancy
- Early education
- Secondary education
- Early adulthood and/or higher education (if any)
- Actual adulthood
- Middle age
- Late adulthood
- Retirement (if any)
- Die.

The big defining trend is: the more adult you are, the greater the responsibility you take on for reproducing the world that produced you. If you're lucky, your society may support you in /advancing/ or helping to actually direct the world that produced you. Also if you're lucky, at some point you may be deemed to have made sufficient contributions that you can actually ramp down further contributions of reproductive effort (ie: retire).

The big problem is: even assuming we get rid of the need to do continuous economic /work/, then you're talking about an unbounded linear accumulation of other expectations, responsibilities, moral duties, authority over others, etc. For an unbounded lifespan, we need some way for retirement, or even an unsuccessful adulthood, to cycle back around to social "youth": a reset of expectations, responsibilities, and power. You need some way for the elder statesman to turn back into the young jackass, instead of ever-growing commitments turning into a noose that hangs the soul.

/Huh/. Funny thought. Maybe that's what it's all about when old gits take young lovers.

The only two stories I can think of that come close to exploring the idea are the webcomics El Goonish Shive and The Dragon Doctors. Both feature characters with access to magic that can alter their bodies and explore how that effects their identities, as well as backstories for some characters who effectively regenerated.

I've heard the anime Kaiba does some interesting stuff with uploads trading memories, but I haven't seen it yet. I would love to read a serious sci-fi story about people choosing to temporarily alter their personality and the world built around that idea.

******* Finding your existing relationships and social constraints burdensome is definitely a thing, but you can always just not do those things. You can quit your job and move and just not have those responsibilities and expectations.

There's definitely an aspect of 'wherever you go, there you are', but I've seen a lot of people more held back by the perception that these little burdens and rituals are more necessary and make life more meaningful than they do.

There's a long literary and philosophical history of wrestling with this dichotomy and Kundera's 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' as an example has a really nice treatment in the opening pages of the question of whether the weight of these accumulated expectations makes life ultimately more of less fulfilling.

***** I've had very close experiences with death (near death experience, or rather lack thereof. no tunnels and lights, no bliss and out-of-body, just a complete void in space and time). I also have a lot of beef with the monotony and crap aspects of life like the ones discussed in the above link.

Having truly 'seen' both things, I definitively can say that I completely prefer living to the alternative, and would choose to live forever even if the fundamental situation I face would never change. Do I wish it would change? Of course. But just because something isn't the best doesn't mean that the alternatives can't be much, much worse.

The most salient part of the article to me was this (combined for clairty).

#+begin_quote
  You were raised with a very limited repertoire of interests, ambitions, and capabilities. Most people have a very limited range of interests and possibilities for gratification. This problem cannot be fixed for most by giving them more money, or even more money and autonomy. Do that, and they will drown themselves in what they already have, or kill themselves with drugs. How many cars, planes, and pairs of shoes or houses can you really gain joy from?
#+end_quote

This was really meaningful to me because maybe this is a manner in which I differ from others. The above is completely untrue for me; I have a huge amount of interests and I keep finding new ones all the time. To me the main source of frustration is that all the monotony and junk keeps me from being able to come close to doing all the things I want, and that's why I don't like that stuff. I thought everyone else was the same, and that's why they didn't like the drudgery. Maybe that's not true, I don't know.

But on the other hand I think people would develop more interests if they were given the time and opportunity to do so.

But on the other hand, solving death means the world's smartest scientists and humanitarians would get potentially many times more productive time on this earth to fix all the other ways the world is shitty, before old age or illness incapacitates them.

In fact, having just one (lifetime-devoted-to-one-problem) scientist or humanitarian, working on your favourite problem, live just twice as long, is actually /more/ valuable than having two such people working on that problem. Because they both had to spend some of their lives just being children, and another part of their lives learning how to be scientists or humanitarians, and another part gaining the experience to tackle this particular problem. In the end, you only get ~20 productive years at most out of a (lifetime-devoted-to-one-problem) scientist/humanitarian currently. If they lived just twice as long (120 instead of 60) before suffering any age-related degeneration of capability, you might get ~80 such years.

What makes me personally very hesitant about developing medicine to stop aging is the possibility that it might actually make living worse. For example, if a company were to make a monopoly over this medicine, then they would essentially have the power that cancer medicine held over cancer patients over literally everyone. The economic incentive by inelastic demand could lead to raising the price just before working for it for extra life is untenable or just not worth it.

No. What I'm saying is that:

- The world doesn't revolve around the USA. Even if the US government was okay with evil corporations holding the population hostage through an immortality drug, at some point other countries would say "Fuck it", violate the patent, and start producing the immortality drug themselves.

- Lobbying and regulatory capture only go so far. Corporations get away with it when the effects concern a small population, or when the dynamics are complicated enough that it's hard to link the corpo's actions to its negative effects. If our evil corporation with the immortality serum monopoly that "working for it for extra life is untenable or just not worth it", and people started dying because of that, there would be enough popular outrage for the government to put its foot down and say "Screw future research, release the not-dying serum now".

But more generally, what I mean by "common sense reasons" is: Would there be corruption? Yes. Would the company sell the immortality juice higher than altruism would require? Probably. Would the world be transformed into a cyberpunk dystopia where everyone around the world is held hostage by Evil Corp and its corporate monopoly on the immortality juice? Probably not.

This is what I mean when I say that people are bad at imagining a transhumanist future. The idea that inventing an immortality drug would make people's lives /worse/ is ridiculous.

** One idea that the video mentions, and that I've seen elsewhere, is that people think ending death would be bad because of sour grapes. Like the truncheon analogy: people are hit over the head with a truncheon so they invent reasons why that's a good thing.

I think that's partially true (people accept death in a way they don't accept epidemics or war tyranny, because all of those feel avoidable), but there's another factor: people suck at visualizing transhumanist worlds.

I'm making a very general statement with not much evidence to back it up except my own experience, but every description of the world by futurist as felt off to me; whether it was "everyone merges into a single super-intelligence" or "people all virtualize themselves and live in VR Second Life" or others like that. The most sensible future prediction I've seen is Three Worlds Collide, and even then author said it was "the future of the past".

tl;dr: We're not very good at hard sci-fi.

  misery doesn't give happiness meaning
#+end_quote

But if someone is kept happy from the moment they are born, how will they know what happiness is? Isn't that how people become spoiled, because they redefine their happiness as a neutral baseline and keep looking for the "real" happiness?

Also, right now, death is a guarantee that no matter how despicable and powerful and therefore protected someone is, they will eventually be gone. Like, there is a chance once the latest Kim in North Korea dies, whoever replaces him will look for a peaceful solution to the crisis. I'm kind of concerned about what will happen if some asshole with a lot of power becomes deathless and makes people miserable from a nuclear bunker for all eternity.

** Death is absolutely necessary. Death is the Great Equalizer. A world without death is a world where the status quo reigns supreme. Where the powerful and wealthy are free to concentrate power and wealth without any check what so ever. Remember: the greatest horrors of the modern age have been wrought by man not nature.

Imagine if the monarchs of old never died. Imagine if the various dictators of the present and past never left. A world where universities are run by faculty so hidebound by tradition and what they WANT to believe that science stalls. Where capitalists are free to hoard money and influence without bound. What would society look like today if millions upon millions of confederates and kkk members were still alive?

Death is what makes societies and cultures flexible and dynamic. Death is what allows for progress, indeed, for peace. If societies cannot adapt organically they will be forced to change in violent ways as they approach stagnation or catastrophic failure. For without natural turnover the only avenue for mass change is mass violence.

Lastly. On deaths relationship with humanity in a broad sense: What makes us human isn't our individuality. It is our /society/. While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.

I can't say for others (though your posts' scores seem to indicate that others agree with me) that you don't appear to be defending your position very strongly.

Does my computer require suffering to satisfy my request to load a response from [[http://www.reddit.com][www.reddit.com]]? Chrome is still effectively "pursuing a goal" of fetching that data for me, but I don't imagine that it is even meaningful to attribute suffering of any sort to my browser.

As for the video posting... it definitely comes across as explicitly spammy, given that every one has been by the same person. Feels less like something to support your position, and more like you're making arguments solely to promote this person's videos, which is... weird?
