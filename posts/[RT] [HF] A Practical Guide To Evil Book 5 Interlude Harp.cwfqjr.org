** So that explains where these chapter names are coming from:

- Interlude: Iron
- Interlude: Rope
- Interlude: Candle
- Interlude: Harp

#+begin_quote
  “First, gifted:\\
  Iron to bind\\
  And rope to kill.”\\
  -First of the three so-called ‘Mavian Entreaties', found on raised stones across much of eastern and Procer

  “Second, beholden:\\
  Candle to blind\\
  And harp to still.”\\
  -- Second of the three so-called ‘Mavian Entreaties'
#+end_quote

...which means there are probably two more of these interludes to come before we switch back to Cat's perspective.

*** The first one is interesting in the context of the fact that it's supposed to be related to the fairies Mavii were bargaining with. Beyond the general vulnerability to iron, we've seen Kilian make bindings for the barrier in Marchford from iron spikes (and also holly and apple tree). The curious part is “and rope to kill”, since the only connection that comes to mind is the hanging of a seven princes and one, which also happens to be the number of royals in Arcadia at the start of a season (and probably is the reason why there is a need for eight abdications to start up a Court in a fresh domain).

However, candle and harp were beholden, not gifted, so the readier haven't seen those yet might be because they aren't the methods available to mortals, but rather something glimpsed in Arcadia back then. Maybe they're related to glamour stuff, who knows.

To not derail the thread, I'll make a guess that the if first entreaty is about the means of containment that were gifted to Mavii, and the second describes the powers of either the giver or the far in question, then the third may have an instruction about the offerings that can be exchanged for the benefits of those powers. Perhaps there are going to be currencies used in the actual bargain, or we'll find out where the Callowan custom to appease the fairies with bread and milk came from.

**** I think fairae stories do have a no spilling blood or some such.

So rope can kill without breaking that rule

"Beholden" doesn't mean "seen." It means "bound," or, more commonly, "indebted."

** Well, this is going to be a mess. Or not, depending on how Hanno's coin-flipping turns out.

Edit: Man, Scribe's doing a really good job at destroying the Principate.

*** I'm pretty sure Mercy doesn't want their prodigal sons fancy alliance to fall apart. I'm also fairly sure that the choirs in general don't want the Grand Alliance to fall apart on the eve of war with Keter. I guess we'll just have to see if the choir of justice is okay with all of that because they're more in favour of a bunch of corrupt ambitious people who are lying about demon summoning in order to burn down a portion of the city.

Playing into the hands of a villain to destroy the bulwark against Keter seems like an odd thing for Justice to do in general. I feel like Hanno is going to start executing a bunch of priests.

It might be that CoJ is concerned only with the justice aspect and don't give a shit about collateral damage.

***** CoJ cares deeply about collateral damage. That's a large part of the point of Hanno's inquisition by them, and what they showed him: to consider the ethics of an action you must consider every single consequence, not just the immediate ones.

Oh yes, for shame, that is just so unfortunate...ly convenient for the narrative arc. And you're blindsided by your personal hatred, Balthazar: this has to fit in a Story of some sort. Which means the Bard is likely pulling Scribe's strings here.

Yeah, it's *Bad*.

(Edit) Close enough, Bard was indeed involved, but she was trying to manipulate Cordelia through Agnes, and it backfired spectacularly :)
