** Or, at least, the first draft thereof.

I found [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/]] in my newsfeed today - and it covers a whole set of ideas I'm trying to wrestle into SI. (Edit: Tried to insert spoiler tag here of examples, didn't work.) If anyone reading S.I. sees any spots in what I've written so far where Moloch, Mammon, Ares, Azathoth, or Cthulhu can be shown off better, please, let me know.

*** Any idea when the whole thing is going to be in final/finished draft? Or is this an ongoing/serial type thing that won't have a firm end date?

**** I do have a certain end-point in mind. At present, I expect that I might reach it around the end of Book Five. Of course, early on, I expected I might get there at the end of Book Three; and when I had a different end-point in mind, Book One.

***** I'm hoping for about 10 books then a satisfying ending.

****** That's... not out of the realm of possibility. I can certainly do enough worldbuilding for Bunny to keep exploring around and interacting for that long; and I'm taking a couple of days off writing, to try to avoid the crash-and-burn of my previous attempt at long-form fiction.

I have some ideas about where the end of S.I. should be, after which any further adventures would be part of another story, but I can't guarantee satisfying. I'm not sure I've gotten the hang of Reddit's spoiler tags yet, so I'll try using both those and ROT13 in case anyone reading this cares to weigh in on whether it's a good demarcation point: [[/s][SI finale spoiler]]
