Hey everyone, January's almost done and the next Pokemon chapter is getting there too, but first I had some questions for you all.

First, I want some feedback about a decision I'm making about the next chapter. You here in the rational community get to be my Beta feedback group before I publish with the decision locked into place on Fanfiction. That said, I don't want to spoil it for anyone who wants to avoid that, so those of you who would rather just wait and see what happens, feel free to skip to the second part about my patreon.

The title I have in mind currently is [[#s][Chapter 28 -]] Nonsensical, I know. The thing is, the first quarter of the chapter is written with very disjointed and random imagery and wording. So also mostly nonsensical... but it builds up to a reveal, and if I've done my job right, a fairly cool one.

For example, the first of the many sections of the chapter reads thusly:

...confused...

...

...hopeful...

...awed...

...triumphant!

...

...awedwaryconfusedEXCITED!

...hopeful...

...

...afraid...

...confused...

...afraid...

afraidafraidafraid

...

...

...

Seems random, right? It goes on like that for a bit, developing more of a detailed prose and narrative and adding more context, until the (hopefully awesome) realization dawns on the reader. What realization? Well, I can spoil all that buildup, but also remove the confusion, by naming the chapter more directly:

[[#s][Chapter 28 -]]. Exciting, I know. Makes it much more clear where we are and what's happening, far quicker.

So what should I choose, the suspense/reveal, or the clarity? Let me know in the comments, and remember to use spoiler tags! Or just say "first option" or "second option."

Okay, second topic, [[https://www.patreon.com/daystareld][my Patreon]] is finally up and running, and I want some feedback in general on the page itself, and in specific on the rewards I listed. A lot of people made some great suggestions, but one of my major limitations is that I didn't want to offer anything specifically related to the Pokemon story, since that might tempt the eye of Nintendo's legal department.

A compromise I made is to just offer rewards of my work in general, on anything I'm working on, which of course includes Pokemon. So if you pay at least X dollars (currently 3), you can have access to an epub or PDF copy of any of my projects.

Any and all feedback welcome, and thanks in advance to anyone that decides to donate. I write the stories I write for me, but the hours of editing and research and fact checking to make sure I write the best quality I can, that's for all of you awesome guys and gals. Your patronage means a lot.

See you in February!


** Chapter 28 - The Northern Caves

** I'd go with the clarity option. Research has shown that readers actual enjoy stories MORE when given spoilers, and so given that the extra clarity your considering is somewhat spoiler-esque, I think it's the better route overall.

[[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/soc/2011_08spoilers.asp][Spoiler Study]]

There is probably a valid concern that your audience is far from a normal, regular audience here. That said, it seems the base rate for spoiled > not-spoiled is quite high. In the study, 8 out of 12 stories benefited in a statistically significant way, 3 benefitted but weren't statistically significant, and one was hindered but also not statistically significant.

It seems like given the audience, you'd have to have pretty compelling evidence that we're more anti-spoiler then average to bet on obfuscation as a strategy.

EDIT: Reading this again, I think I probably overstated how widely the research is actually applicable. They certainly found the result in some contexts, but while the question your asking is similar, there are certainly differences as well. So yea, I'm acknowledging that.

*** It's an interesting study that I've looked askance at in the past, probably because my own personal experience is that spoilers /heavily/ reduce my enjoyment of stories... or more accurately, having as little information as possible and going into a book or movie blind have incredibly enhanced the experience.

That said, I think this is case where the ambiguity and mystery might be legitimately frustrating to read without understanding what's going on, which may make a big difference in determining how useful the spoil is to the enjoyment.

**** Interesting, because it's totally different for me. With the volume of data I have to crawl through each day I've had to develop heuristics for quickly assessing the quality of the work and my predicition of how well I'm going to enjoy it, so it's better to give me more spoilers - hell the only reason I gave 'Blindsight' a second chance was because in some article there was a dialogue directly from the latter parts of the book where things get interesting and an analysis of why it's interesting.

For me I need some sort of anchor, something motivating me to move forward and keep reading - and spoilers definitely work for that.

***** I think that is something that will differ from person to person. I don't say this as a brag, it's more of a curse than anything, but I'm exceptionally good at inferring the patterns in stories. It's not through conscious expenditure of time or effort, the predictions just pop into my head as I watch/read, and it makes it very hard to ever be surprised by traditional media. It's gotten so bad that I stopped watching trailers or reading the backs of books, because even the slightest of hints makes it easier to predict things.

Part of the reason I've enjoyed fanfiction so much (or certain kinds anyway, HPMOR was my first and set a rather high bar) is that they are far less predictable, and thus far more enjoyable to me, since I can genuinely experience the "not knowing what will happen next" thing. So maybe I'm overvaluing how much a mysterious reveal would matter to other readers, and think I'll end up just naming it the full title.

****** I think that a study on fiction in general wouldn't necessarily apply equally to all forms of fiction. One of the hallmarks of rationalfic is that the reader is given enough data to sort of "follow along" with the protagonists and figure things out. If we know the answer ahead of time, we don't get to do that.

I'd say err on the side of mystery, and we'll let you know if you go too far. :D

** I suggest going with the first title as long as you use the second title somewhere in the chapter to make the meaning of the first title clear.

About your Patreon, have you considered offering epubs, pdfs, and/or mobis of everything you've written...which just so happens to include your fanfiction? /wink, wink/

** Tbh, the "get your questions answered" tier is a huge turn-off for me. Either authors have a relationship with and communicate with their audience or not, but it feels really skeevy in some hard-to-define way to /charge/ for that.

**** I recommend changing it to something of the "Feel good about supporting an author of whose work you'd like to see more," variant. It works well for Walesy.

A good high-level tier might be offering to thank supporters by name somewhere.

Others: relationship advice, a short monthly poem of time-limited exclusivity, a monthly personal post (like a diary-blog), monthly "lessons learned in practicing game design" post.

** If I went into the chapter blind and saw those strings of words, I would skip ahead until real text started up again. I'm sure I'm not alone in that. Therefore I vote on the second title because it would give me enough context to follow the beginning nonsensical parts.

*** Hmmm... That is an interesting question actually. How far will an average person go without context? The story in question I feel I would be above average, as I enjoyed the chapters leading up to it (mostly anyway, I'm halfheartedly reading and skipping leaf's reporter section) Is there a report/experiment somewhere that gives guidelines on how long the average person will read on something without a payout?

*** That's exactly right, but if possible I'd like to assure you that since I doubt there would ever be enough income from that system to be considered a significant part of my income, it wouldn't particularly incentivize me to write faster, since my current writing schedule is based off of my free time, and I would preaumably still be working my 50+ hours a week day/night job.

In addition, I'm also happy to avoid the chance for an incentive to sacrifice quality of writing for quantity. As much as my readers want to see what happens next in the story, believe me when I say that I want to write it. But unlike most projects I've worked on, this one takes an inordinate amount of research and thought, and I want to make sure it's as rational as I can make it.

So for now I publish monthly and set the Patreon to monthly, as that's the safest option legally and it fits the current pace of my forseeable writing schedule.
