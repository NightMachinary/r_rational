Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I'm going to recommend the manga [[https://mangadex.org/title/55476/child][Child]] .It's a manga about a nonverbal girl called Nao and her upbeat sister Yui. It's a manga about mental illness and coping strategies. And it's a story about the tragedies and successes of growing up.

... and it manages to do all that in the10 short chapters that have been translated.

The translation is a bit rough since the translator is using DeepL, but they're quite obviously taking what care they can to make sure their translations are accurate and readable. Also, art aside, this isn't a 'furry' manga, per se-- it's a [[https://www.lackadaisycats.com/][Lackadaisy Cats]] situation where, despite the art, all the characters are obviously human.

edit: and while I'm recommending furry manga anyways, I'll also recommend [[https://mangadex.org/title/35838/slayer-volte][Slayer Volte]]. Moral ambiguity, interesting worldbuilding, and cute characters getting horribly traumatized. Exactly my cup of tea.

** Im looking for a decent *Time-Loop Munchkin/ Groundhog Day Munchkin* story set in our world (no fantasy or sci-fi elements aside from the premise, and not a fanfic of another franchise preferably).

Or to put it more broadly: Im looking for munchkin stories set in the "real world" where the only divergence from reality is the power that makes the munchkin possible in the first place, but otherwise the story is realistic and rational-ish.

An example would be the original Groundhog Day, Limitless, Butterfly Effect or Replay, but possibly more rational and munchkinish, and less preachy.

*** "The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August" is about people who live their lives on loop, restarting from an early age whenever they die. It's set entirely in the real world other than this, and contains a highly rational character who munchkins using his powers to try to bootstrap the technology base of the world to a higher level by essentially importing knowledge from the future using the fact that people with this power born after him have access to the future and you can chain that to get information from the far future.

...unfortunately that character is the villain and a lot of the book is a morality tale about why That's Bad. üôÅ But on the whole I still enjoyed reading it.

*** Not sure about it being rational, but the movie "Happy Death Day" was a really fun take on blending that concept with a slasher horror plot. The protagonist gets murdered again and again by some random psycho and uses the loop to try and find out their identity and ultimately avert her fate. I hear the sequel takes it in a sci-fi direction, explaining the time loop phenomenon, and I'm curious about that, but haven't seen it yet.

** I don't usually go for fics about immersive MMORPGs as much as straight Isekai due to the lowered stakes / reality TV type artificiality, but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29139/spiteful-healer][Spiteful Healer]] has been pretty good so far, and does a decent job of anticipating the consequences of good VR simulation on society and real-world drama that balances and adds meaning to the gameplay drama. Includes things like using the same tech for surgery simulations and studying, and has real world motives (punishing his neglectful father and saving up for college) driving his in-game behavior. Overall pretty well balanced. And rather than being gifted with an OP cheat skill, he discovers a reasonably obscure skill that he can reach at a low level that needs a lot of grinding and sacrifice to achieve. The character is depicted as stubborn and grindy in real life (with the downsides that implies), so when he does this in a game it makes sense.

Another story (straight Isekai, not VRMMO) about a stubborn/grindy character that I like but don't strongly recommend is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33844/the-runesmith][The Runesmith]]. It's much more of a case where YMMV, as the main character's paranoia and single-mindedness seems to result in a refusal to form lasting teams/relationships and doing everything himself in a world where division of labor is obviously favorable. His inner monologue gets to be a bit tedious to follow at times, considering and reconsidering minor caveats repeatedly. Contains a fair number of writing mistakes and so on. I could see this being a derec for many.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run][The Perfect Run]] also features a grindy character, but has exuberance and humor, and most of the grinding is off-screen. It's more of a time loop story set in a post-apocalyptic superhero timeline and not an Isekai. It has the same author as Never Die Twice, so expect good worldbuilding and a pro-immortality stance, but does a better job at keeping dramatic tension than NDT since there are multiple ways he can die for real if he's not careful (and he's not exactly sane).

*** I got up to 40 chapters of runesmith and in conclusion it's a nice popcorn read but it's not for me. The characters just feel dead which is probably due to the authors writing style and there are some inconsistencies. The Gnome girl was getting massively power leveled in the ants lair but the author said that the system prevented this sort of thing. However, there wasn't a single written passage of her killing an ant. Also, during the assassination attempt a level 2 rogue did the cliche of stabbing a human shaped pillow while trying to kill the MC in his sleep. Wouldn't a level 2 rogue have skills that prevent this sort of idiocy? Such as night vision, blood sense, etc?

*** Thanks for the Spiteful Healer rec. It's a refreshing and engaging take on VRMMO. I have some problems with the worldbuilding and character actions, but the same applies to every litRPG I've come across, and this story is much better than most.

Specifically, he explicitly thinks about how crafting guilds make sense, and how making money from crafting is a balancing act between what is efficient to do yourself and what is efficient to outsource, ...and then just does the typical "solo MC" master of all trades thing of doing it all himself.

This should not work! Sure, he has a skill that gives him double the skill exp, but what this would amount to (in a realistic, optimised group setting) is halving the cost of training, which is, in business terms, essentially a fixed cost, and so is irrelevant long term.

This is also a major problem with the worldbuilding believability - people take this game extremely seriously, so why aren't there cartels who essentially corner the market on any useful good, disallowing new entrants by force? It's an unregulated world, there's no reason this wouldn't happen without a good reason it shouldn't. This happens even in today's games which don't have an explicit in-game-currency to real-world-currency exchange (as the story game does).

Other than those issues - relatively minor compared to most litRPGs - I would second the recommendation. :)

*** Revenger by Alastair Reynolds is a really cool far future postapocalyptic low tech swashbuckling setting. I enjoyed it immensly.

As I understand it, humanity at some point in the past converted all the planets to countless micro planet "baubles", and has risen and fallen many times in the ruins of this mega project.

Ships cobbled together with a mix of old and new tech travel the darkness on solar sails. The main characters join a ship seeking treasure on baubles.

For me it was a great adventure but also triggered the feeling of "yawning abyss of history filled with mysteries" that I /really/ like. I got the same feeling from Malazan Book of the Fallen and Lord of the Rings (and Silmarillion).

It's a hard scifi space opera with the typical 'valiant human republic fights a battle against a superior alien foe' plot at least on the surface, except that the bad guy aliens seem to actually be a transhumanist federation and the good guys seem to be suspiciously high levels of unlucky in the events that lead up to the war and suspiciously completely morally pure as they're presented. Seems like they've told him a lot of self-serving lies, at least that was my reading.

Also his setup is similar to the backstory of the God Emperor in 40k - again not sure if intentional or not

The Earth with numbered Conurbations is I think a reference to the alien occupied Earth in the Xeelee verse

The South American setting and excessive bureaucracy (hinted at by the Redeemer statue) is maybe a reference to the move Brazil - not sure about that one

Also references to precommitment abilities of superintelligent AI being used for blackmail, and possibly even Eliezer's Yudkowsky's weird movable housing idea with the reference to 'housecubes'

Overall its not really a plausible rationalist take on the actual future and I don't think it's meant to be, more like a rationalist take on a space opera alien invasion plot, a bit like Animorphs The Reckoning which you might like

** He who fights with monsters has been recommended here a bunch of times, for a long time. I finally got around to reading it and binged it over the past week or so. I figured I would share my thoughts.

Firstly, I just want to get out of the way and say that generally I enjoyed it and will continue to read it, and would recommend it for most people on this sub. That being said it has some flaws that may get on some people's nerves. I'll go over those, and then finish with the things that I liked about it.

Most glaringly, the main character is a pretty hardcore Marty Stue. he is some combination of phenomenally skilled or phenomenally lucky with the abilities that he has, to the point that he is consistently one of the most competent and powerful people around (for his power level) even without any special or unique skills, beyond the game overlay (which isn't all that helpful from a combat perspective) and his ability to loot monsters, which is rare, but not unique and pretty much just means he is richer than usual. We aren't really given any reason to expect that he should be more powerful than everybody else, he just sort of....is.

Additionally, all of his "flaws" are of the kind that "he's so dark and broody".

For some reason, attractive women are constantly falling all over him. Despite the fact that his philosophy on life is " I'm who I am, and there's no need to try and improve myself or change my personality at all. If I'm a dick, then I'm a dick and some people will like it and some people won''t (and he definitely is kind of a dick)".

Which sort of leads to another issue, that may be specific to me. The author can get pretty preachy about his personal views through the main character, and, at least to me, a lot of those views are almost childishly naive, yet expressed with the utmost confidence in the fact that they are obviously right and anyone who disagrees with them is clearly just a bad person. There are some /very/ weak attempts to show non evil people disagreeing/pushing back, but they are not done at all convincingly. The author seems to just not be able to imagine a smart, good person holding views different from his own. Someone who is more philosophically in line with the author probably won't have the same problem.

The final flaw that I want to go into is that, at least to me, the voice of almost all the main characters are very similar to each other. in the vast majority of cases, if you took away the "said character x" portion is the dialogue, I would have trouble guessing which character it was. With the only exception perhaps being the main character himself, and then it's only that the main character is amped up to 11, and every other character is just a slightly toned down version of that. mostly this boils down to everyone is super snarky and sarcastic all the time.

Okay, on to the things I liked.

it's honestly very well written. The quality of the prose, relative to a lot of online fictions, is really good. The grammar is good, typos and spelling mistakes are rare, sentence structure flows well and is easy to read. it's done well enough that the reading is able to just kind of fall into the background. It really is better quality writing than most things I see promoted here.

Additionally, so far I'm really liking the world building. it's interesting, and I'm always excited to find out some new aspect of the world that the story exists in.

I also read a critique in the past about the randomness of the magic system. The complaint was that the randomness of the powers led to lack of synergistic builds, and that people would just use a single ability because the rest of them weren't very good. I'm honestly confused as to how someone could come to that assessment of the magic system. Yes, powers are assigned sort of randomly, but almost everyone's manages to be a cohesive whole (earlier powers influence later unlocked powers so that they aren't totally random). And a big theme of the combat, especially recently, is the importance of every essence user (the name of the magic users in the world) to synergistically use their entire build, and not just focus on individual abilities.

I tend to gloss over the combat a little bit usually, since it's slightly more detailed than I like, but for those that like it the detail is there.

overall, I do think it's something that most people here would enjoy. So if you haven't read it, it's worth checking out. The first 130 chapters or so are going to be taken down from Royal road and put into an Amazon book pretty soon. So if you want to read for free, it's probably worth checking it out quickly. If, from my description, you're unsure of whether or not you'll like it, I think that you should be able to figure it out within the first 10 to 20 chapters probably. If you don't like it by then, I think it's unlikely that you will like the rest.

Apologies for any typos or formatting errors, power has been out since Friday due to an ice storm, and I wrote this whole thing with voice to text on my phone.

**** Sorry for the late reply, power is still out so I'm trying to ration my phone use.

The MC frequently goes on long rants about social issues (to the point of even being lamp shaded by the author), and in my opinion those rants are usually lacking any nuance or appreciation of complexity. They just come off, to me, as high horsed and self righteous. However, like I said, it's entirely possible that other people don't get that impression, and that's fine.

As for the women, he only ends up with two women (the noble daughter and the agency person, so far but a third was interested, the indentured servant, but he kept aloof for understandable power dynamic reasons), but it's clear that several other women find him attractive/interesting. Maybe it seemed worse from me binging it over the course of a week, but still, in the course of less than a year (I think that's how long it's been), with no real effort on the MCs part, he's had at least three women fall for him to one degree it another.

****** Except that in the setting, attractiveness is not rare. Everyone gets more attractive as they rank up (which, by the way, doesn't really make sense given the information we have about ranking up, it seems to be a rule of author fiat just to make the MC more attractive). So his attractiveness is not "more than usual", it's just the norm. He's only attractive relative to our non-magic having world (and still less attractive than most people ranked above him).

But even if he was actually more attractive than usual (which, again, doesn't seem to be the case), it just adds to the overall Marty-Stue-ness of the story. He's witty, smart, competent, /and/ attractive. I have no problem with attractive characters. But characters without realistic flaws are uninteresting and boring.

Valid complaints sure, real flaws ok, that's reasonable criticism. The MC being attractive isn't, it's just a fraction of the population that inherently dislike attractive people of their gender that gets bothered by it.

In setting, he is of average level physical attractiveness, so this argument doesn't really hold up. You seem to be arguing against a straw man version of my argument.

If you are now arguing that the reason is that he's a marty stue and is good at everything, and that's why women like him, then sure I guess. He's clearly written so that he's supposed to be good at lots of things. But he's also explicitly written to be kind of an asshole, which everyone, including women, just seems to kind of ignore.

Basically, as written in story, it does not seem believable to me that so many women would fall all over him. His characteristics, both physical and personality, do not seem to warrant the level of interest he garners. It therefore seems like a lazy contrivance of the author. You are free to disagree if you want.

But my argument has almost nothing to do with his level of attractiveness.

Based on my years as a human on this earth and observing romantic relationships (including my own and those of my friends), the character as written does not seem like one who would have an anomalously above average level of romantic success. This is because he is an asshole. He is explicitly an asshole and knows he is an asshole and has said he is an asshole. Some people like assholes. Most people do not like assholes.

I've made it very clear that my problem has absolutely nothing to do with the physical attractiveness of the MC (and have stated in several different ways what my problem is). You seem convinced that you know something about me beyond what I have stated here (and even in direct contradiction to what I've stated).

*** I'd been getting increasingly bored with it, then dropped it after the chapter where the slave girl repeatedly beats up the protag (because she's jealous about him talking to a hot princess) and it's played for laughs. That was annoying- it seemed like an anime trope imported into a non-anime-tone/more versimilstic story for no laughs in a way that I found grating.

Then, the chapter after that, the author put in a note giving a really weird explanation for why he put the scene in. Something about how it was acceptable for the Sophie(?) to act that way because she was in a weaker position than the MC, and the MC let her beat him up to establish that he wasn't going to exert his legal power over her, and that's why he had the scene.

I thought, okay, I can see how the MC might think that, and it's obvious the author thinks this way. But /most people wouldn't think that way/, and the discordant thing about the scene was the lack of reaction from any of the other characters.

So then in the next chapter, the author has an hamfisted, awkward scene where the other characters call Sophie(?) out, clearly meant as an olive branch to the segment of the readership that were annoyed by the last chapter.

It's weird to complain about the author turning around and trying to fix what people complained about, but the whole thing just seemed jarring. When I'm reading a story, I don't want to be reminded of the readership, or get the impression what's happening on the page is being influenced by which part of the fanbase is being the most vocal (unless that's explicitly part of the format, like in a quest). Obviously, the readers do influence the author both implicitly (you see more stories of the sort that people want to read) and with their comments, but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. The beat-up chapter had been annoying, but the author caving and adding a badly-written mea culpa was also annoying, not for any external social reason, but just because it was poorly written.

Anyway, I guess that little kerfuffle was the last straw. I'd already gotten annoyed at the main character's implausible super-popularity, so I dropped the story, but the event still sticks in my mind as an interesting example of author-reader dynamics in patreon-funded serial fiction, and an example of what not to do.

I'm, not sure what the right move would have been, as obviously you can't please everyone and diluting your story to appeal to RoyalRoad commenters seems like a good way to sap the life out of it. Maybe come back and rewrite the scene in a more versimilistic way later, once the fire had died down and I wouldn't seem I was bending to detractors.

** I've currently got a craving for stories about dungeons and adventurers. I don't care which perspective it's from, *I just want to read more stories about adventurers diving into creatively built deathtraps.*

Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/#post-44695393][I Woke Up As a Dungeon, Now What?]]*: I actually just read this last week, and it inspired this post. The main dungeon is allied to the locals, and is currently using them to practice (while perhaps inadvertently traumatizing some of them). However, the dungeon is located in a contested land between two evil empires, so the /intent/ behind the dungeon design is clear. Eventually one or both empires will invade, and the meat-grinding will begin.

Something I appreciated was that the dungeons in this setting have a lot of design space. Each floor of a given dungeon is specialized, giving discounts for using certain types of rooms/minions and maluses to using others. However, the minions of each floor can enter neighboring floors, and floor specialties bleed into the floors immediately neighboring them. For example, a shadow floor will cause unnatural darkness not only in itself, but also in the floors above and below it. It's a system with a lot of room to experiment, and the author has been using it well so far.

The designs of the main dungeon are also quite interesting, particularly what was revealed in the latest chapter. It involves using illusions to disorient invaders while stacking fear effects, in order to wage psychological warfare on high-level adventurers that would normally be unchallenged by the upper floors of a dungeon.

*[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]]*: The main dungeon that features in this is precisely the sort of thing I'm interested in. Each level of the dungeon is unique, and evolves thematically from the level above it. Different levels have different rules that must be followed, and require different strategies to be developed to safely complete them.

*[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/368012/001-woodland][Delve]]*: The dungeons in Delve are few and far between, but they also fit the bill for what I'm interested in. They're hellishly dangerous, unique, and require extreme care to be explored safely.

*[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078MPQVG6][The Divine Dungeon]]*: This had a lot of what I was looking for early on, but lost it as the series progressed. I think most of what I was interested in was in books 1 and 2? It's been a while since I read them. By the time in book thee when the town starts working with the dungeon explicitly and it literally takes off into the freaking sky, a lot of what I'm looking for right now disappeared. I was more interested when the dungeon was experimenting with level design and its risk/reward ratio.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21045/the-abyssal-dungeon][The Abyssal Dungeon]] which has lots of themed layer building it sounds like you're interested in.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33118/labyrinthias-maze][Labyrinthia's Maze]] also scratched some of that same itch, though if I recall correctly the writing was a little rough around the edges, both grammatically and plot-wise.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27263/the-infinite-labyrinth][The Infinite Labyrinth]]'s "Georgian Era Steampunk alternate history meets litRPG" premise seemed interesting, (and is from the perspective of some delvers rather than the dungeon) though I only read the first couple chapters and don't remember why I stopped, so I'm not sure how well it ultimately delivers.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26480/titan-of-steel][Titan of Steel]] is a bit of a subversion of the usual dungeon delving stuff, in that the dungeon decides to build itself a nuclear-powered mech, but I found it still scratched some of the same itch.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935/there-is-no-epic-loot-here-only-puns][There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.]] is, as the title might suggest, rather lighthearted and /definitely/ subverts the a lot of the "deathtrap" parts of the dungeon-building genre, but otherwise has the themed layer-cake stuff going on in spades.

Science-fiction where you follow a battleship AI that is returning to the fleet after retirement.. but as a crew member rather than as a ship again.

As for what I am looking for: I recently read [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper]] and while I enjoyed it (it is unfinished before it gets that far and on hiatus), I enjoyed the first chapter more before it diverges off into the actual plot. So any (very mild spoilers): Stories in your future world dystopia that do more with the tech (like the story has where your firmware might stop you from seeing things) than just your usual 'there is cameras everywhere'? Preferably following some form of rebel against that system.\\

*** You might enjoy /Earth: Final Conflict/, which has eg. genetically engineered organisms that both enhance brain function and enforce absolute loyalty (used by top agents of the Talons only though), or a device to relive memories which they recorded and used to blackmail people with, etc. Though I think the writing only becomes sharp around the middle of season 2 ("Payback").

I guess /Minority Report/ might count. Using clairvoyant human brains to predict the future for crime. Good film.

These are possibly not what you're looking for, but: Perhaps the magisterial noir [[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dark-city-1998][Dark City]], which uses injections for altering memories. There's sociopathic-overachiever film /Equilibrium/ which also uses injections, this time to regulate emotions.

I suppose its pointless to mention, but I'll do it anyways, that the obvious recommendation is /The Matrix/, and (maybe?) /Blade Runner/.

Both tend to get recommended here frequently. His books are set in a bleak future teetering on the brink of post-human. Technology has advanced to the point that people's bodies can be modified in many ways. One of the most fascinating and chilling modifications is given to soldiers to shut off the internal perception of consciousness, i.e. to put the body on 'autopilot' to do boring tasks like exercise while a person is 'sleeping' or to operate with machine-like precision in high-stress situations.

Some of Greg Egan's novels also explore the scary implications of body modification technology. [[https://www.gregegan.net/QUARANTINE/Quarantine.html][/Quarantine/]] especially springs to mind with the way the protagonist's brain mods directly alter not just his perception of reality, but also how he /feels/ about that reality. I enjoy Egan's deep portrayal of what living in that future might be like. For example:

#+begin_quote
  It takes me forever to get to sleep. Boss (Human Dignity, $999) may have rendered it a matter of conscious choice, but somehow I still manage to be an insomniac; I always have some reason to delay the decision, I always have some problem I want to think through -- as if every last nagging question which once might have kept me awake had to be dealt with in the old way, regardless.

  Or maybe I'm just developing what they call Zeno's Lethargy. Now that so many aspects of life are subject to nothing but choice, people's brains are seizing up. Now that there's so much to be had, literally merely by wanting it, people are building new layers into their thought processes, to protect them from all this power and freedom; near-endless regressions of wanting to decide to want to decide to want to decide what the fuck it is they really do want.

  What I want, right now, is to understand the Andrews case, but there's no mod in my head which can grant me that.

It's kinda a mix of both stories - the alien society is built on purging and rewriting history that disagrees with them, to the extent that the humans who survived the cataclysm that wiped out Earth have sided with them, not knowing they're working for the same people. There's a ton of propaganda shoved down people's throats about how they need to be good workers and earn their place in society.

My current Kirielle idea has the following setup:

QI pressures ZZ into helping him fight Oganj. Oganj has a teleport spell prepared and flees. QI now turns on ZZ. His evil villain dialogue explains that he underestimated them before but always ambushes anybody who can fight him on even ground (that's how he survived so long). He has Ibasan reinforcement and almost takes ZZ out. When Zach wants to teleport away, it fails and QI continues to explain that he put soul markers on ZZ during the fight to stop teleportation (inspired by the Sovereign Gate marker, similarily hard to remove). But Zorian has just retrieved the Ikosian staff, that kind of teleportation isn't blocked and they escape... to Blantyrre.

QI didn't expect that and looks for and alternative to neutralize ZZ. So that's how "Kirielle Kazinski and the Necromancer" begins, she's his hostage. As Kirielle isn't really a threat to QI, he again treats her reasonably, like he treated ZZ before.

Wouldn't mind somebody writing this ;)

Roguelite is a term created by TotalBiscuit to encompass games like The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon, games that take inspiration from Rogue/roguelikes, but don't strictly adhere to actually being like Rogue.

For roguelike recommendations however, in addition to many of the ones already recommended I remember playing a fair amount of of both Dungeons of Dredmor and Sword of the Stars: The Pit.

**** I own Caves of Qud and have actually never given it some serious effort. I probably should, sooner or later. Never tried Cataclysm, what is it?

***** Open source, open world, zombie survival roguelike. You're a survivor, there are zombie, find some way to make your way through the apocalyptic remains of New England. Instead of character classes you have different starting conditions (gear, skills, location, etc.) and in addition to DCSS-esque skills, you also advance via gear (including an extensive crafting system) and futuristic mutagens/cybernetics from the secret labs which caused the cataclysm. Notable for being the only roguelike I know of with a functional driving and Mad Max-esque car modification system. Like Caves of Qud, it doesn't really have a victory condition, so you mostly just set challenges for yourself or see how far you can take a character.

***** CDDA is not a fun game though. At least not for me. After taking 8h to find a car and craft some crappy gear with no other objective provided it got really boring.

‚Äã

It's not like a roguelike, there's no goal, no objective, nothing just survive and do cool stuff. It's like a story from a discovery writer without a clue on what to do or on how to escalate things interestingly. It's just, yeah I guess now you just survive until you don't and do busywork to keep alive. I didn't like it.

*** I think cataclysm: dark days ahead is all skills, and it's a classic roguelike. Dwarf fortress is all skill-based, as well- there are skills for each conceivable action (axe-wielding, dodging, milling, beekeeping).

I like to play Star Sector as a roguelike (there's a mode to disallow savescumming). Characters in that game exclusively improve via perks, which ends up being a skill-like system. This guy can explain the game better than I can: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqpulP1hLo]]

*** SILQ comes highly recommed from this longterm dcss player. Your character doesn't leve up, you can improve skills/buy abilites for the skills. Super great roguelike and easy compared to dcss.

***** Make sure to read the manual(s), they are very comprehensive! You can play online or local. I play local because online lag is bad from germany. I think its a much better roguelike than DCSS, though replayability is much lower.

**** Then I checked the content I see the problem: Protagonist first big adventure is Infernal Enclave. About 1000 pages later he still in Enclave. And form Prologue (another thing I dislike) he should have much more adventures like Infernal Enclave.

******** Lol I wrote a comment on the prologue itself explaining what I liked. I really thought it was a fantastic prologue, checked all my boxes, inspired me to delete my current prologue to my fic because it reminded me what a prologue should be and that my prologue was hella not effective. But some people really didn't like the prologue because...reasons, so to each their own.

** Just read through the transcript of [[http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/episode-252-understanding-moral-disagreements-jonathan-haidt.html][this podcast discussion]] which I found pretty interesting. It's a discussion about what are the "taste buds" of morals, how different people weigh them differently, and how this turns into political disagreement (also about rationalism, by the way). Means I'll probably keep an eye (ear? haha) on the podcast as a whole as well.

** I'm still enjoying the DC Fan Universe on reddit [[/r/DCFU]] as well as it's Marvel counterpart, Marvel's Non-Canon Universe [[/r/MarvelsNCU/]]. Both are basically stories written in the universe as if they are published like the comics, with their own plots and so on. You can see the "runs" currently going on in each, as well as one-shots, cancelled runs, and so on. It's very, very good.
