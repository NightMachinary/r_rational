As in "Uncle Scrooge". It'd explain how he managed to own half the planet, too.


** His secret is his wealth management via a holodeck with a full body haptic interface. By feeling the flows of money as virtual coinage, he can get a feel for the market unmatched by any normal analyst.

*** This reminds me of the old "Whose hoard would you rather steal from: a dragon's or Scrooge McDuck's?" threads on /tg/.

Even before his rationality force multiplier, nobody wants to steal from McDuck.

****** Or he's just very sentimental. Don't forget that this also includes any coinage and such of any particular rarity. If I extrapolated it correctly it must be pretty much anything that has either symbolic or actual value greater than the number printed on top of it.

** Heck, McDuck already /is/ very much a rationalist. The stories about his early life and his road to wealth are full of ambition, risk taking where opportunity arises, and serious critical thinking. (as opposed to race cars, lasers, aeroplanes). Highly recommended.
