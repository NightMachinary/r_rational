** I thought the demons couldn't lie? Though I suppose the Librarian is not technically a demon, which could explain how she can pose as different people.

Interesting that Nic is attempting to take a firm grasp of the direction he moves in rather than continuing the trend of being swept up in the plans of others. However, he seems to have failed immediately as it turns out him taking this active role was actually the plan of the Librarian the whole time.

*** I'm not sure we've had a proper hint to what the Librarian is yet. Sure, vaguely similar to demons. Maybe one of them post whatever change it is they seek? A time travelling Nic? Dizzy in a long coat sitting on Simole's shoulders?

**** The only hint we've gotten, I believe is from the Librarian herself in Book One Chapter 49

#+begin_quote
  “Because,” said the Librarian, “I am not a demon.”

  Dizzy seemed to buckle, the words causing her discomfort. “Then what are you?”

  To Davo, the Librarian seemed to shrink. “I am a failure. I failed to protect those in my charge. I lost everything to a world full of pettiness and greed, of small minds and narrow thought. And yet it was enough to defeat me.” Her sadness grew to fill the small dome they were in.

  “You work for them,” said Dizzy. “You are one of them.”

  “Yes, and no. I am nothing like them. This body is real. Once it is destroyed, so am I. I would appreciate if you didn't try to break it again. The repairs are exhausting. The only magic I can affect comes from these.” She held up the small box again. The gem glinted. “Without it, I am no more powerful than you.”
#+end_quote

So someone whose cause was defeated in the past, not a mage (or at least not a conventional one since non demon magic has already essentially been confirmed), and someone with a tenuous connection to the demons. This points to her ACTUALLY being Davo in a trenchcoat standing on Fanny's shoulders.

*** Demons don't like, but they are able to imply something that is not the truth and it becomes the truth.

My money is that it's not the librarian, but a different demon. Maybe even the demon that possessed Nic before (who became a dragon and got eaten etc.).

** So not only did Hewt (or whoever he really is) fool Nic, he also fooled Davo, Fanny, and even Brill into thinking he was Brill's younger brother? That's some weird magic.

*** I am assuming that it is meant to be that the Librarian was not only playing the role of Mr. Periwinkle but also the role of Hewt. I could be wrong and Hewt could be someone else too. We'll have to see next week when the reveal is further elaborated.

**** Sure, I get that he was playing the role of Hewt, but the thing is, Hewt is supposed to be Brill's younger brother. But Brill does not have a younger brother. So not only is he playing the role of Hewt, but he somehow made all of those people think that Hewt exists when he does not, even Brill!

***** Oh yeah, I got that. I thought you didn't connect the Librarian to Hewt since you said "whoever he really is" though, like I said, it might not be the Librarian after all. Either way, it was my misunderstanding about your comment.

****** By the way, I was thinking that this nonexistent little brother situation felt familiar. It has been a long time since I watched it, but I think there was a similar situation in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Buffy's little sister.

  Brill picked up his fork and began eating his pasta again, aggressively.

  “He seems upset,” said Fanny. “Abandonment issues due to being an only child, I expect. The pompous whining is a dead give away.”

  “I'm also an only child,” said Davo.

  “I know,” said Fanny.
