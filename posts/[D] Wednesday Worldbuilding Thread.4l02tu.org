Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** What plausible futures are the outcome that follow /War of the Worlds/ (the original)? If aliens come down to Earth in 1897 with immensely superior technology and are subsequently defeated by the common cold, what do you think 2016 looks like?

Edit: If you've never read it, you can read it online [[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36/36-h/36-h.htm][here]]. Also, I have dibs on the title /War of the Many-Worlds/.

*** It's been a very long time since I read War of the Worlds. I don't recall anything in particular that explicitly laid out why the Martians wouldn't try again in a couple of years (the ideal time to launch from Mars to Earth occurs roughly every couple years IIRC). Even if there was a good reason that the Martians would only attack once ever and never try again but this time with better antiviral defenses, I don't remember a way for the humans to know that... so expect a combination of huge defense spending / military buildup that would make the Cold War look like peanuts combined with some sort of setup to try to eventually counterinvade or bomb Mars.

**** I get the feeling the Martians did not intend to immediately invade. They crash-landed (hence the need for repairs) and come out of their spacecraft without wearing suits. They find something wrong with the air and retreat, perhaps assuming some sort of gas attack. At that point they finally attack, from what they might perceive as self defense.

Martians watching everything from afar, especially with the disease that ultimately crippled their forces, would have to think long and hard about a genuine invasion. They might put more effort into communicating this time around.

If we accept teh narrators claim that the Martians are the last of a dying civilisation, then Earth may vastly outnumber them in population terms and therefore economic capacity. Depending what remains of their industry they may have a finite suply of technological items they can't mass manufacture, meaning thy would have to be extremely cautious. And likewise with the lives of their species.

Its possible that, if the martian economic and technological advances are to a realistic degree beyond those of earth, that what earth treated as a full scale invasion represented only a microscopic effort on their part.

For an analogy, imagine if a group of individuals from the modern day, equipped with off the shelf guns and explosives, invaded somewhere equivalent to a bronze age civilisation. They could run around and cause immense havoc. For the locals it would feel like godlike powers were being unleashed in a deliberte intent to destroy them, for the originator civilisation it would be more like group of redneck hunters going off and getting drunk, shooting up the local wildlife, then dying because they forgot to disinfect their water.

The invasion force may just be a tiny subsection of martian civilisation

  A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter. At present the planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I, for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we should be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack.

  [...]

  At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of the human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.

Also a frantic effort to reverse engineer teh martian technology, it is probably sufficiently far from the victorian base that they couldn't directly replicate it, but I could see them getting huge advances in electronics just from seeing the general shape of what can be done.

They also might be able to get some technology to work as a black box, e.g. the heat beam weapons, and use that. Which would vastly change human-human conflicts, or could have useful industrial applications. Depending on how much their economic base was harmed by the invasion I could see a resurgent british empire having a ig impact on the world stage (though I'm not sure if they were attacked more than other nations or it was just the location of the narrator)

The same risk that killed the aliens could very well kill us in ways our immune system might be ill-prepared to fight, and medical epidemiology in 1895 is only just starting to stretch its legs.

**** The book doesn't go into too much detail on these matters, and I think you'd have to retcon a lot of it because it /was/ written in 1897. However, if we know that they were at the very least capable of launching from Mars and landing on Earth, we can assume that their minimum tech level almost certainly includes computers of some kind. Given their capabilities, there's also an upper bound on what they can do, as a lot of their actions would be rendered trivial by something like e.g. nanobots.

I think 1897 scientists /might/ be able to figure out something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer][the Apollo Guidance Computer]], but I'm really doubtful of their ability to reverse-engineer something like a modern day desktop computer, especially since so many components are made with really complicated processes that can't be easily discovered without having the base research. In addition to that, it would all be in a wildly different language and probably produced by a mindset that's far away from human.

So for the sake of argument, let's say that there's some technological gain, and some proof of concept, but that technology is only going to be a decade or two ahead (and in some uneven ways).

***** Technically, it's possible that the Martians themselves may just be computationally capable enough on a biological level to serve as their own guidance. I remember reading somewhere (I think it was some kind of sequel or something) that the Martians were in fact some sort of bio-engineered meat-computer species developed by a more ancient (and also originally earthly, hence why they are even vulnerable to extant strains at all) race. Flexible canon, though, and it may be worthwhile to ignore that idea.

Aside from computers (and math, since even if it's in a different language, the rocket equation is the rocket equation, and so on), other aspects of rocketry will probably be boosted a bit, possibly enough to push them into the early stages of weaponization. Are heat-rays and black smoke replicable by humans? Also, are heat-rays actually high-powered lasers or something similar, or are they something more exotic?

Metallurgy from the tripods will be hard to replicate, but the machinery itself maybe easier, and may add marginally towards things like cars or tanks.

Given how fast it reproduces, red creepers may be able to survive and adapt to the earthly ecosystem despite their lack of immunity, especially in cold climates and at high altitudes. Cracking down on it when it manages to get out of those areas and starts choking out crops may be an issue.

I suppose, looking beyond technology, the entire world is basically going be shoved in a war state of mind. Even if the Martians in the book were the last refugees of a water-less planet (which personally seems unlikely to me), there is no way for anyone on Earth to know that, which means that any country with the economy and resources starts preparing for a second wave.

Actually, in the book the ships are launched via some sophisticated cannon rather than any sort of rocketry, since this was believed to be the way that space travel would happen. I'm not sure how a cannon like that could be made to work though, not if it's going interplanetary and expected to carry biological organisms. It would be easy to retcon that the narrator is wrong about that though.

No, but knowing what the evenual result looks like allows you to cut out a lot of dead ends in research.

**** Yes. A highly skilled Osteomancer (not all Necromancers are Osteomancers, and not all Osteomancers are Necromancers) can animate a living body's skeleton and allow both the host and the skeleton's possessing spirit to live in the same body indefinitely.

(A moderately-skilled Osteomancer can animate a living skeleton and have both host and spirit live in the same body until the host dies from anemia due to not having any bone marrow.)

Aside from the expected difficulties in complex ritual magic, Skelemen pose several unique challenges:

- Two minds, one body: The host and spirit can have conflicting goals and desires. This can be intentional (in the case of high-value prisoners, corrupt officials, and other rebellious people) or else inadvertent (in the case of misunderstood instructions, conflicting priorities, and insufficient information). Most hosts can overpower their skeletons for short periods of time with moderate effort, but it difficult, awkward, and tiring.
- Senses: Skeletons inside a body lose access to many of their senses. Their life-sense is overwhelmed by their host body and therefore useless. Their tremorsense is similarly dampened, as the host body does not transmit vibrations as well as stone or bone. They are also blind, having their eye sockets blocked off by the host's eyes. They have greatly improved hearing (compared to bare skeletons, who have no ears), and their proprioception and sense of touch is good enough to tell the difference between a muscle moving a limb and an outside force doing the same.\\
- Breathing and sleep: The host will often have trouble breathing and sleeping with an unskilled or uncooperative skeleton. Having your ribcage move (or fail to move) out of rhythm with your respiration can be very distressing. Similarly, moving unexpectedly when you are trying to fall asleep can wake up most people.

All that being said, there are several advantages to Skelemen:

- Strength and Endurance: The strength from the muscles and the strength from the spirit animating the skeleton can be added together (when the two minds coordinate efforts), resulting in new Skelemen being about 2/3 stronger than they previously were. The skeletal strength can also be used to keep the muscles completely fresh and rested on long marches, even to the point of many veteran Skelemen being able to sleep and eat on their feet to maintain a near-24 hour march rate.
- Sleep and awareness: Two minds are better than one, they say. Skelemen get two chances to notice anything going wrong, and the skeleton never gets bored or tired.
- Intelligence: The animated skeleton benefits from having a (normal) human intelligence guide it, allowing much better use of its abilities.
- Magic Resistance: the skeleton's spirit benefits from the protective effects of being surrounded by a living human, which blocks all but the most powerful magics. (/Fireball/ is easy, /Explode Liver/ is hard. /Dispel Skeleton/ is easy, /Dispel Skeleton In A Person/ is hard.)

For us death is either hyper medicalised, long drawn out death full of tubes and drugs and pain, or sudden and sharp, violent accidents, murder, suicide. Make something that taps into those fears.

** So I've got this idea that I think is excellent, but have continuously failed to make a worthy story with. Mentioned it in last week's thread, but not as a top level comment.

So there are these portals that, upon activation, split the universe in two (like a quantum event), and the portal in universe A connects with the portal in universe B. Using multiple portals would allow for the creation of infinite computers that span infinite universes.

There'd also be a variation that's activated twice (well, half the time): the first activation splits the universe and does nothing in universe A, and the second activation in universe A causes the portal in universe A to link with the portal in universe B at the moment of the first activation.

Finally, there'd be some kind of ability that causes someone to immediately evaporate in any newly-formed universe B - from everyone else's perspective they evaporate rapidly with very high probability, but from their perspective they can use the portals to copy the universe without copying themselves, giving them as much of any limited resource as they want.

*** I think a possible problem with this is that the premise starts on such a massive scale as copying universes. Perhaps if you created smaller abilities/scifi stuff that could be scaled into the universe splitting? It's difficult to keep a story insteresting if you immediately start your character off with this level of power.

For example, for my wishing story or the mana burning, I would focus on an individual character's interaction with the world and discovery, and then scale them into the full power.

*** I'm going to second the "scale too big" reply. It /would/ make a good story, but the level of skill and effort required would make it /extremely/ difficult to do so. I remember seeing a webcomic sort of similar (a device is created that splits the universe every 2 weeks, but one person can experience the same things as their alternate selves) and it just exploded in complexity by the 40 strip mark.

** Let's say that you have two substances, both some interesting properties, which become much more interesting in combination.

Wodzite is stone-like substance (most abundant in comets, and regions dense in ice), as well as occasionally in the coronae and coronal ejecta of red dwarfs, translucent and colorless. It has thermal and phase characteristics nearly identical to pure corundum, and behaves similarly on a chemical level, but is starkly non-reactive with respect redox reactions, is a strong electric insulator, and is highly transparent. It also appears to be intangible with respect to water molecules, which permeate and flow through its volume as though it were a vacuum (aside from the pressure of other water molecules also present inside the wodzite). Additionally, when water flows through wodzite, the wodzite emits a toroidal 'virtual water' field, which has virtual pressure and temperature proportionate to that of the water within the generating wodzite, with a scaling factor determined by the flow of the water through the wodzite and the volume of the emitted field (which is in turn determined by the size and shape of the wodzite itself).

Meanwhile, an island-isotope of Livermorium (generally as a small admixture to a highly corrosion and temperature resistant alloy), can contain the field emitted by wodzite, and is itself largely unaffected by that field.

Anything immediately jump out for this system, or similar systems, subbing water out for another simple chemical?

*** Can Livermorium channel the field in a particular direction? Like, if I have a Livermorium sheathe around my piece of water-pressurized wodzite, and there's a gap in it, what happens?

This would be very useful for contain antimatter and other highly-dangerous substances. High enough water pressure would create a vacuum around the material without any solid barrier around it, might make certain chemistry easier.

I assume this follows conservation of energy? There's a lot of "proportional to"-s in there, but you said that water flows as if in a vacuum, which suggests there's no resistance.

**** Livermorium doesn't reduce the overall volume of the wodzite field unless it completely encloses it (specifically, as long as it doesn't have any holes large enough for water molecules to get through), the remaining volume sort of 'extends' the whatever portion is unblocked, ballooning it out and distorting it from its original shape into a sort of hemisphere-cone shape.

I suppose flow rate is not exactly the right phrasing, but my point was to say that energy is conserved, IE that the energy you put into moving the water through the wodzite is equal to the energy the virtual water field is able to effect its contents with. Does that work? Maybe not. It might work better if we say that wodzite saps half the kinetic energy from water flowing through it, and that kinetic energy goes into the field, which I guess would mean there is some resistance.

** I've got a couple of thoughts in my head today, and a thought from last week's that didn't get much traction, so I'll be making two top level posts.

The first thought:

I've had a couple of thoughts and decisions about my world. I've been working on a mana/rune system of my own, and I've decided on a couple of things. First of all, runes were too prevalent and complex - I was going to have a basic system where 3d shapes, when mana passed through would have various magical effects.

I've decided that system was too complex and instead have opted to decide what I want mana to do and then work out what people can use for it.

I want mana to be a fuel type. In the Bible, manna was a hebrew term which translated roughly to 'what is it' as in, this food was falling from the sky and no one had any clue what it was, and I kinda want to keep that mystery there with my mana in modern times. At the start anyway, so that's what the 'scientists' who discover mana are going to call it, because mana would have a number of curious properties.

The first principle of mana is that it burns, in a similar way that gas burns. I haven't worked out what the catalyst for a mana burn is, but i'll get there.

Then, I want mana to have different effects based on the types of burns which are initiated with mana. For every 'burn' in mana, there is an inverse effect which can be initiated.

For example:

#+begin_example
  Hot burn - Puts out heat
  Cold burn - Cools an area (cold fire basically)
  Positive burn - pulling negative charges of electricity to itself, also can act as a ground.
  Negative burn - puts out a negative charge of electricity - can be regulated to put out power
  Light/Dark Burn - One puts light out, the other sucks it in
#+end_example

Any thoughts on how these burn effects could be used?

** The second thought I had (i'm sure other people have had these ideas before) was what if you had a wishing machine, or God-level computer, where if you learned how to use it, you could literally control aspects of reality? This one was pretty OP, and it's hard to come up with limits while keeping it interesting, so that led me to a thought.

What about a worldwide wish granting phenomena? Let's say that for one hour one day, everyone on the planet's wishes were granted, not in the way they were expecting, but in a way which would get the results they wanted. For example, someone wishes "I wish I could bang such-and-such hot actress" - that wish doesn't magically force the actress to have sex with the person against their will, but makes the person physically attractive enough to where if they had the personality, they could start dating, and the fulfillment of the rest of the wish was on the part of the person who made that wish to make it happen.

Continuing with that, for one hour, any and all wishes could be granted, with limits. For example, any wish directly affecting someone ("I wish they would to die in a fire" or "I wish James wouldn't be sick any more") would have to be accepted by the other person. How they would accept that, or whether or not they would know the contents of said wish, without asking about it is anybody's guess.

Another restriction could be that any wish which directly affects any other person but yourself is automatically set upon them, however the effects of said wish are completely reversed after some time as the magic leaves.

*** I don't see the reason to ask "what kind of event caused this". Adding some external entity that decided to grant humanity wishes for its own reasons just complicates the story. It could just be Magic.

--------------

I'm not sure where you'd go with this. A world where wishes come true is a utopia, a metaphor for what you'd want the world to be if you didn't have to put in the hard work to actually make it real. It's the world after a Friendly Singularity, the world inside /Equestria Online/, or whatever our utopia /du jour/ is.

This bit:

#+begin_quote
  that wish doesn't magically force the actress to have sex with the person against their will, but makes the person physically attractive enough to where if they had the personality, they could start dating, and the fulfillment of the rest of the wish was on the part of the person who made that wish to make it happen.
#+end_quote

suggests you're specifically /not/ writing a story about good intentions that go horribly wrong, which is the usual place that stories about wishes go to. Your version of Magic isn't so much granting wishes as granting coherent extrapolated volitions. (I've been re-reading HPMoR, can you tell?)

The only setting I know of that might have ideas close to what you want is the tabletop RPG /Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine/. It's delightfully whimsical and definitely far from rational, but it's also the only other story I know of that has wishes be relatively commonplace without the "wishing for big poorly-specified things has horrible consequences" limitation.

**** I think that if I develop the story I want the characters to explore why a 'wishing hour' would even happen, at the very least, because a wishing hour like that would certainly call into question many people's views on the world and there being a higher power. Science would be turned upside down, and many human rights would be violated by those who figure it out in the time limit.

I guess I didn't go into enough detail of the mechanics of the wishing, so hopefully I can clear up the basic idea. The wishes take the positive spin, but they would still introduce significant chaos. All that happens is that the wishes are auto-interpreted to be accurate to the wish of the wisher without directly affecting another person. In this "wishing hour" one rule would be that no one can be directly affected by any wish but their own, and such wishes that cannot be accurately interpreted differently would not take effect.

Wishing that Amy from HR would just die wouldn't work, but wishing that her house would incidentally catch fire and completely burn down at 2 am when she was in it would be valid, so you can use the materials around the person to affect them.

I still haven't decided about the idea of a wish imbuing a magic power to an item, like "I wish every person that puts on this ring can move twice as fast as they normally do" and whether or not that can affect another person, because there are more nefarious things a person could wish for.

***** Perhaps instead of assuming wishes can do anything except a specific blacklist (no wishing for more wishes, no bringing back the dead, no time travel, etc.), you should start from the idea that there is a whitelist of things that wishes can specifically do, and then see where your characters can take it from there.

Because if we start from the assumption that /anything/ is possible unless explicitly prohibited, and everyone in the world can access this power without limit, then you'll have a billion idiots poking at the edges looking for loopholes; and as the author, it would take you a lifetime to close all the loopholes a billion idiots can find in an hour. Can't wish for ongoing magical effects? Fine, I wish for a superintelligent AI and a fusion reactor. Can't make any wish that affects another person directly? OK, I wish for a gun and I wish to teleport to Amy's current location. Wishing only works for one hour? I wish for super-speed so that hour will subjectively be ten thousand years!

There are island of survivability in this plane, but otherwise the technological detritus shapes the landscape, some of which are extremely hazardous and some of which are not.

Weather can range from frequent rain of communicator, phones, omnitool, etc to 'oh my god we're oing to die' car sized object or just normal weather such as snow and rain.

On occasion, massive objects are deposited directly on the surface.

There are also wildlife, which are mostly evolved lifeform made from the remnant of technological devices. Less frequent are organic lifeforms.
