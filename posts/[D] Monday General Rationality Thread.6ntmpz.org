Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I find it really annoying how the end of almost every video has a reminder to "like, subscribe, comment, and share". However, the reason so many people pursue this strategy is that it works, right? It kicks at least /some/ people out of their passive reception mode and into an action mode where they're more inclined to do something instead of clicking on the next link that seems interesting.

Yet most people also think that it's annoying, and reddit has (non-policed) rules prohibiting asking for upvotes, presumably because it increases the noise and would result in almost every post on the frontpage saying "please upvote".

I'm wondering whether this is a problem with a solution, or just a problem that has many different solutions that all have their own trade-offs wrt user engagement and annoyance.

*** As I understand it, likes and subscriptions are a lot of how youtubers make money. So they each want to maximize those likes and subscriptions, while beggingless videos would be more pleasant for all.

Could you model it as a kind of prisoner's dilemma, where the defect option is begging for likes?

Secondly youtube doesn't care directly about how much you like what you watch it just has an algorithm that shows you videos based on what it predicts will end up getting you to maximize watch time. As a result it is somewhat less likely to recommend shorter videos regardless of how much you might like them because it's goal is watch time and that's it.

That may be the case idk but the end result is that it tends to favor longer videos and as a result videos on the whole have tended to become longer with vastly more ~30 minute videos than you used to see on the site.

Not sure specifically what you mean since i'm not sure there's such a thing as "hot" videos in terms of being part of the youtube system in the current iteration of the site. However if you mean trending videos or just those you might see on the homepage then I can tell you from having a rating preview extension that a significant number of those videos have pretty terrible like-dislike ratios.

As for my sources, any information is slightly circumstantial since people are sort of forced to try to reverse engineer the algorithm which has undergone significant changes over the years and isn't publically transparent.\\
However the fact that you will absolutely see plenty of poorly rated videos on the homepage and if you're in incognito you'll get suggested videos for videos like whatever you are watching which are sometimes poorly rated. As well as the documented shift in video length (which people started doing because it was affecting their performance) should be enough to at least establish what I'm saying about likes not mattering and them optimizing for watch time (whether ads or video length the result has been the same overall).

******* I don't think so. Powerful magical artifacts include:

- The Philosopher's Stone, which was created over 900 years ago and can only be created by one person. Nobody ever changed how it worked except by destroying it.

- The Sword of Griffindor. Its functionality did change, but only as a result of the enchantments on it functioning as intended. The Goblins might know how to make more, but we never hear of a weapon with similar properties.

- The Elder Wand. It was never changed, it only passed hands as it gained new masters.

- The Resurrection Stone. Voldemort didn't know what it was, but it's implied you can make a horcrux out of anything. He certainly added enchantments to it, but it continued to function exactly the same /even after being sliced in twain by the Basilisk venom infused Sword of Griffindor./

- The Diadem of Ravenclaw. Nobody ever tries to wear it on screen, so we don't know if it was changed. Then it got eaten by Fiendfyre.

- The Goblet of Fire. We don't know exactly what it is for or what it would have done if Harry had refused to participate in the Tournament, but everyone just agrees that the consequences would be bad. A powerful Confundus was apparently sufficient to make it allow a fourth school. Which either implies that I was wrong or that the goblet is in some sense sapient, and therefore susceptible to spells that directly attack sapience. Inconclusive.

- The Cloak of Invisibility. It never changes and it resists practically every spell cast upon it. Moody's eye can see through it, but that isn't a spell being cast on the Cloak as much as it is an artifact apparently designed to do just that. We can know, to a certain degree, that the eye is an artifact because it was apparently easy to remove and operated independently of anyone wearing it.

- Moody's Eye. A bit player that never changes. Apparently, putting it in a telescope allows someone to use it without installing it in their face, but that doesn't appear to be a magical alteration.

- The Sorting Hat. Apparently taken off Griffindor's head and then never altered. It is as much a part of Hogwarts as anything else, so its capability to give people Griffindor's Sword when they really need it isn't too surprising.

- Hogwarts. Its wards are so ancient and powerful that nobody has ever been able to travel quickly into the grounds via any means. Voldemort managed to get in multiple times, but that just implies that the wards don't have an evil detector, or that such things just don't exist.

I don't think we ever see someone directly change or corrupt what one of these artifacts does. Some were made into Horcruxes, with deleterious effects on those who attempted to use them afterwards, but that appears to be a function of being a Horcrux. They still seemed to work exactly the same.

***** I meant shitty in comparison to the life portrayed in the mirror. My point still stands that not all things it shows people are necessarily going to make it work as a torture device. Some people would probably even be comforted by seeing dead loved ones (like people sometimes say they are when they hallucinate dead loved one's) though I can't understand how.\\
Similarly many people like myself could see anything they desperately wish for and it's not going to make us devalue our current life because we already thought about those things a great deal. For instance I would most certainly see some post singularity utopia server living in which would be staggeringly fun, but the fantasticness of the whole thing makes it less likely to devalue my own life since I'm not going to think anything I could have done would have ensured I would be there instead of here.

Also given the existence of vastly more effective methods of torture it being made for that purpose seems unlikely. It seems rather more probable and thematically appropriate that its origin is probably more of a downer. With some desperate mage creating it hoping to see their dead family again and becoming obsessed with the facsimile that the mirror displays (like many later mages said to have become obsessed with the mirror) or something else similarly depressing.

If inadvertent torture devices count then a hell of a lot of things count. Also Dumbledore says /most/ desperate desire which implies it doesn't need to be particularly desperate (such as how it's said a totally content person sees the mirror working like a normal mirror), also cannon examples demonstrate that what counts as most desperate may not be that desperate, but it's unclear exactly how heart's desire works. So going by what people see in canon (such as Ron) it's effects are not necessarily desperation inducing.

The great thing about the shortcomings of machine learning is that we know what they are, which means we can use them appropriately. Working around the shortcomings of human cognition is a lot harder; it relies on the thing that's experiencing the problem also coming up with the solution.

***** Those aren't really the same; they're certainly failures but they happen for a few high level, excusable reasons. They're generalisable errors. The adversarial errors in ML highlighted in the article are because of an overwhelming cascade of /imperceptibly small/ errors, the most astounding examples being such that humans can't even tell there's a difference in the images, but the model has a high certainty of a /very/ wrong result. The closest I've seen are visual optical illusions (eg. spots between areas), but those examples only go so far.

  Why does this surprise you?
#+end_quote

I've seen a lot of deep learning papers hyping themselves up, and a whole lot of people claiming (quite wrongly, IMNSHO) that deep learning will lead to AGI.

#+begin_quote
  It's true we don't observe these weird behaviours against adversarial examples in humans... except of course those edge-cases when we do.
#+end_quote

We /really/ need to differentiate between "This design takes one tradeoff versus the other to get around No Free Lunch" and "This design leaves 'money on the table' by sacrificing accuracy on one dataset in exchange for no equivalent increase in accuracy on any other dataset."

#+begin_quote
  Can we really be sure there wouldn't be similar error cases had we an equally observable brain state?
#+end_quote

Phrased another way: can we prove a smoothness condition on human categorical assignments with respect to the space of sensory signals?

That is the nature of advertising.

I don't really see a need to be concerned. No serious researcher to my knowledge thinks neural networks can do full AGI on their own; most interesting things that come out of the field require more. For instance, AlphaGo was built largely on a couple of neural networks, but it only became a Go playing program when augmented with a search strategy. Yet the impressive thing about neural networks is that they work so well with so little; post training, AlphaGo Master's top level neural network supposedly makes a darn strong player all on its own.

We're in the exploratory phase of AI, and we'll be here for a while yet. We've just found a well that keeps on giving. so it's not a surprise that people are excited about it. It all seems like a good thing to me.^{until we get enslaved}

Good luck proving squat about a human brain. ;)
