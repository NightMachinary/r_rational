Had an idle thought about how powerful the Lethe was in the original series and decided it would be fun to write a short story about it. I hammered this out in about a day so it might be a little rough, but I had a lot of fun writing it! I hope you enjoy :)

It's not perfectly rational by any means, but I included some fun munchkinry and mostly reasonable protagonists, so I hope I'm not off-topic. The gods are notoriously anti-rational so I left them as they were.

I will say, though, that the story won't make any sense if you haven't already read the series.


** I just read this all in one sitting; didn't hate it.

Just a few things, off the top of my head:

1) In canon, as I recall, it was a struggle of willpower for Percy to control the magical Underworld River Lethe, even after he had a few years of experience. In that part of your narrative, the feat seems just a little... passé, for 12-y.o. Percy? But I admit, much smaller quantities of Lethe-water were involved in your scenario.

2) Given the nature of the Riordan universe as one where All Mythologies Are Real, a reader might wonder if, or how, the other Pantheons might react to such an upset in the order of the world. Potential sequel hook.

3) I concur, a little roughness is noticeable here and there. But nothing that a round or two of polishing couldn't address.

4) This could also be really interesting as a longer, serialized piece.

5) I heartily applaud your correction of "popular mythology" by naming Charon as boatman of the River Acheron rather than the River Styx.

6) In "The Son of Magic" short-story, it was revealed that the ability of monsters to home in on demigods was given to them by Lamia, rather than any direct will of the Olympians. But then, the argument can still be made that the Olympians never tried to undo this, or better protect demigod children from it.

7) That's about it for now. Cheers, and thanks for the story!

*** Hey, thanks for the response!

1: You're correct, though the water splashing him was meant to show that he didn't even really have control over such a small amount, unless you meant controlling the single drop. Honestly from a canon standpoint I have a harder time justifying the Styx dip than the lethe control, so it's not perfectly canon compliant.

2: Interesting, didn't really think about that. Kane Chronicles was the only other series I read outside the Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus, could be fun. I doubt I'll do that though.

3: Yeah... Dunno if I care about this enough to go fix it, but the perfectionist in me is considering it...

4: Why do you think this? Genuinely curious. I mean besides the obvious better character development etc., don't know what all I could tell by extending it out. I mean, probably could have some fun with the combat and whatnot. What more would you expect if I serialized this?

5: I know. It grates me. After a PJO reread I kinda forgot again until I started researching what Percy could do with the other rivers and read up on the Acheron. Didn't end up using the other rivers but still learned some cool stuff.

6: Huh, never read it. I figured the monsters could just in general smell demigods. It's the gods' "fault" because they don't intervene before their kids are slaughtered, they just let the monsters roam free. They were willing to destroy the Ophiotaurus in book 3 because it threatened them, but aren't willing to destroy the minotaur or cyclopes to protect their children. Shameful.

7: Thanks for your input!

**** 2: The other series aren't too bad. I enjoyed the first two books of Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard. The ending of the third power was a bit weak, though. Sort of amusing, but it ran off of the Power of Friendship involving characters that, save for a few, weren't really around enough to care about. And so far, the Trials of Apollo have been enjoyable as well, and sort of interesting how they go into the apotheosis of the Roman Emperors.

4: Mostly because of the events mentioned in passing during Chapter Two (IIRC). They might not make an HPMOR or Pokémon: OoS looong serial, but they could be fleshed out into discrete narrative episodes (and or training montages) unto themselves.

5: Another thing that bothers me about "pop myth", which you may already know... is that in the oldest Greek legends, Achilles was never invulnerable, he was just that good. The earliest myth about his semi-immortality attributes it to a ritual involving anointment with ambrosia by day and burning in a fire by night, before it was interrupted by his father Peleus. That attribution of his invulnerability to the River Styx was done by a Roman poet (Statius). Which is fine... but then in the Son of Neptune, the curse of Achilles is referred to as a 'Greek blessing' to be washed away by the (New) River Tiber. I still find that ironic enough for days.

6: Fair enough. But suppose from the Olympian's point of view, they know full well that the Underworld, Elysium, and the Isle of the Blest exist (in addition to several other afterlives). Thus, they know that their children aren't annihilated, and could possibly see afterlife in Elysium as a step up from life on Earth. (Elysium / Isles are described as a virtue-based reward system, but most heroes in Greek myth end up there). Too much intervention to directly protect their children might even count as a violation of the 'Ancient Laws' (too bad those haven't been really explored in canon....). Meanwhile, the gods are willing to protect themselves because they are directly tied to the natural order / Western civilization; anything that directly threatens them could open the way for the Titans or Gigantes, which is the worst option for everyone.

***** 5: I didn't know that. I remember being irritated at Percy losing the curse though, I thought it was kinda cheap narratively lol. I'm not sure which I prefer, but I think near-invulnerability is more interesting for munchkinry. It also explains why an arrow in the heel was actually fatal, unless there's another part of the myth i'm missing

6: Good point. Even then it's still messed up bc the gods are in charge of where their children go, though, which is why Zeus turned Thalia into a tree. He didn't want Hades to unfairly punish her. Furthermore, the gods could hardly expect their children to be loyal to them if they show 0 loyalty to their children.

****** 5) As far as myths go, there are several versions of the death of Achilles, but they typically revolve around attributing it to either Paris, Apollo, or both of them. But one late account, The Fall of Troy by Quintus Smyrnaeus (4th c. AD), has Apollo (god of archery /and/ plagues) killing Achilles with a "god-envenomed" arrow to the heel after Achilles mouthed off to him (one too many times). Apollo then gets harshly scolded by Hera.

An earlier source, a 6th c. BC vase painting, depicted Achilles' body with arrows in his back and Achilles tendon, shot by Paris. A later vase painting (4th c. BC) shows Apollo guiding Paris' arrow towards Achilles' heel.

** First chapter was good, second chapter is okay, third is not good. Went full anime on the third chapter.

Would have been better without all the powers Annabeth and Percy display at the end IMO

*** Interesting, thanks for your input. Mostly I just wanted to have some fun :)

I did heavily consider they just Lethe everyone as that's what I would do, or some other subtle victory. Maybe I'll do a second version with that instead, maybe not.

*** Actually, I'm curious, is there some kind of battle at the end that you would have appreciated? Or would you say any fighting is just less enjoyable overall?

I was concerned that the gods wouldn't come across as having godlike might but it's something I'd like to keep in mind in the future

**** The fights involving gods in PJO are, generally, lame. Exception: Artemis fighting Atlas, but both were limited in that fight; Gods vs Typhon, but again, Gods were seen from a distance in that fight and it took few pages.

Displaying god-like might is hard.

Also, having anything be able to bypass Achilles invincibility is lame. it's treated like a nearly absolute defense-- instead have a God tie Percy down, try to find it, try to bypass, not overpower it. Rock paper Scissors fighting>power level fighting.
