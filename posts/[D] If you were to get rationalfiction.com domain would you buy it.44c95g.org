** I'd buy it if it was remotely feasible for me to do so, reach out to fimfiction for infrastructure and design guidance, and do my best to keep rational fic as far away as possible from fanfiction.net from there out.

I actually have a group of people working with me on making a standardized fanfiction mobile app already.

**** You should definitely reach out to the FimFiction people! It's the best site layout /ever/, and they're talking about making it a generic fic framework.
