Come on, out with it. Make your mortifying literary confessions for all of /rational to see..

From a rationalist/DC point of view, what are the glaring issues about them that you can see off the top of your head?


** I've been reading a few of the Star Wars expanded universe books. Star Wars just makes /no/ sense whatsoever. Forget for a moment the whole concept of the Force and the Light Side and Dark Side or whatever. The technological stagnation that lasts for thousands of years is /so dumb/. They have a demonstrated capability of making intelligent droids, and it's just routine practice around the entire galaxy to wipe their memories.

I can maybe handle a world where some technologies just never come to fruition because of the economic considerations, or due to some rules in place within the fictional world, but there are so many "missing" technologies that are implied by what's in the books and movies that I want to start banging my head against the wall if I think about it for too long. Reading is just a matter of suppressing that part of my brain that hates the conceits of space opera.

Nothing about giant robots makes sense in any way whatsoever, but my visual artist loves watching them move around. They just look ridiculously cool.

** My big guilty pleasure is in superhero stories. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless][Reed Richards Is Useless]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod][Status Quo is God]], but dammit do I like seeing people fly through the air and punch each other to death. I've been rereading Invincible lately, and there's something that's just so satisfying about superpowers.

But yes, from a rationalist standpoint I do wonder why the world hasn't been revolutionized a dozen times over with all the super geniuses running around that have demonstrably solved a wide variety of problems. Some of my favorite stories are the alternate universe ones, where the writers are free to say "fuck continuity" and actually change the world as it should be changed. (And of course I've read Worm, but Worm - which tries to justify a lot of the tropes - isn't as wholly successful as I might have hoped.)

*** Personally, I really like how Worm handled RRIU.

Firstly, powers awaken in times of great stress, and are tangentially related to the cause of the event. Trigger events are traumatic, and while they might "solve" the problem, they often do so in a violent way. As such, a majority of capes are villains.

Secondly, the "tinkers" of the world, who have the power to create supertech, don't actually /know/ how their technology works. Any tech they can make is several technological steps ahead of the curve. Reverse engineering is essentially impossible, a tinker can't teach another how their tech works, and anything a tinker makes needs regular maintenance by the maker to continue working. No mass production.

Then there's the Endbringers, a trio of nigh-invincible kaiju who regularly attack the highest value targets of the world. The worst of which is the most powerful precognitive, and has set up conceptual rube golberg paths which cause people who actually have a chance of defying RRIU to die, or worse become villains.

*** If you haven't read Inviolate yet I recommend it. It's basically Lex Luthor with his crazy switch flipped to off, loads of fun. He subverts the RRIU trope heavily.

** [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/mlp-time-loops][This]]. On the one hand it was recomended by Eliezer. On the other hand it's a massive time sink that doesn't really teach me anything new or expose me to any new ideas.

** You are sooooo not getting the mortifying stuff out of me.

Non-rationalist pleasures:

- I enjoy basically everything listed on [[/r/trigger]]. None of it makes any goddamn sense, but it's all /completely fucking awesome/.

- Actually, since when has anime in general made any goddamn sense?

- One of my pleasures is not remotely guilty, but /very/ embarrassing for someone who's normally as much of a blustering, blunt, loud, not-even-that-wannabe-anymore shounen hero-type as me ^{pinkie} ^{is} ^{best} ^{pony} . But seriously, that show has terrible wallbanger-quality writing sometimes but I still quite like it.

- I'm subscribed to David Brin on Facebook and find it kinda cute the way he gets so /outraged/ at the mess of American politics and the ultra-right, since the rest of us who don't feel any need to pretend to conservatism have been pointing out the same damn issues for /years/.

- Actually, David Brin and other ignorantly conventional futurists are a fine guilty pleasure. And [[/r/Futurology]]. Seriously: have you /seen/ those guys? And they call /us/ ridiculous.

** The manga Peach Girl. It's my dreadful secret. It's high school drama with misunderstandings and lies and gossip and main characters pining away over the perfect boy and crying because he kissed another girl first etc etc etc. Because half the problems stem from people not understanding themselves and the rest from not understanding each other... It's not very rationalist.
