Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

So if you have something hidden in your stomach the effect applies to that, and stops once it's taken out.

Regarding muscle mass/strength/etc, I'll say that it doesn't increase, ie it stays as it was when the effect is not being used.

Define "out".

Let's say I implant something in my hand. I then use my mass changing power. Then I chop off my hand. What happens to the mass of the implant? Does it revert? Does the hand still count as part of my "body"?

What if, instead of chopping off my hand, I just leave it dangling by a long string of skin? Or perhaps an intestine for longer range...

Or better yet, what if I get lots of skin grafts? I mean, LOTS of extra skin. I could say, wrap a rocket in my skin, thus making the rocket "inside" my "body", and then decrease its mass so I can launch it into space for much much less fuel.

******* The problem with trying to munchkin is that if your methods are too normal, someone would have already thought of it. So this really only leaves you with two ways to munchkin:

(1) Design methods that exploit esoteric scientific facts, so people who don't know these facts can't think of these methods.

(2) Design methods that involve such cruelty or self-mutilation that normal people's brains would censor them before they can even think of it.

I'm not a very smart person, so I usually rely on (2). My first thought whenever I'm asked to munchkin a superpower is: Can I chop off my hand to use it better? Surprisingly often, the answer is yes.

The gut bacteria from a cow to allow you to digest grasses.

The brain of another human to absorb the memories/knowledge.

You would not be able to eat steal and add it your skin or anything like that. If you happen to eat a bug with a heavy iron carapace then you could add that to yourself but it would limit the movement of your own body/disfigure yourself.

You can eat flesh to heal yourself. If you were to loose a limb you could eat enough meat/bones whatever to regrow another limb.

I think the best way to use this power would be to work in a cremation building and eat the brains of the deceased. Maybe this would have the side effect of changing your own personality but I don't know enough about Neurology to understand if that could be a real fear with this ability.

Can you eat a unicellular organism and gain the ability to reproduce via mitosis, thus allowing you to create countless clones of yourself?

Also, since you can copy bacterial abilities, the best way to use this power is to actually get a lab for growing bacteria. Bacteria mutate really fast and get all kinds of amazing abilities, including resistances to all kinds of poisons and temperatures and pressures and starvation conditions. Gain enough bacteria abilities and you'll become nigh indestructible.

Like I said to the starfish dude, these powers probably only work due to their simplicity. Otherwise we would probably have developed regenerative powers ourselves over the years.

The spider part would work with growing exoskeleton limbs out your back but not giving you another pair of human arms. If you were to eat birds to gain wings it would grow on your first set of arms.

Now if you were to eat flying ants and grow an exoskeleton set of wings would you be able to grow them big/strong enough to hold yourself?

same with spider limbs. Could these be strong enough to support your weight? or would they break under pressure?

I could see it being possible to add the spiders eyes inside of your own puples. maybe eat a bullet shrimp to get those really cool eyes.... also maybe eat a bullet shrimp to deck out your pinky finger?

*** I like "cleaning" superpowers, they are super exploitable.

The reason is because "dirt" isn't well-defined. How do you determine what's "dirt and grime" and what's actually supposed to be there? How does it determine that say, a coin or a cushion on the ground isn't dirt, but an empty paper bag or a bread crumb is? How does it determine that a stone on a wooden floor is dirt, while a stone on a stone floor is the floor itself and shouldn't be destroyed? How does it determine that the uranium in your nuclear power plant isn't dirt, but the depleted uranium is?

Now, if your cleaning ability did something like summoning a broom and sweeping the floor, it wouldn't *destroy* /ALL/* dirt and grime. So clearly, you must have some ability to specify what is considered dirt, and what isn't. Perhaps, the ability reads your mind to guess your intentions and acts to fulfill them.

So, take an elevator to the top of a tall building in a crowded city. Look out the window. See the sea of people on the streets, crowding around like /garbage/. /Trash, every one of them./ You can now clean this /human filth/.

With enough mental sophistry, your cleaning ability effectively becomes an extremely precise banishing ability, erasing all parts of the world you dislike while keeping everything you do.

Eh, what is considered "more reasonable" is fairly subjective though.

Or, perhaps the power is limited in range (only things within the same room, or say, 30 ft) and/or power (it can only clean X grams of material per hour), which would prevent such extreme abuse - in which case you could still, say, "clean" a target's heart from the other side of a room, which might make you an effective assassin.

Yes, that would be the reasonable thing to do, but this interpretation wouldn't match the description we are given. This device has to /destroy/ *ALL* dirt and grime. ALL. Dirt is context-specific, and thus impossible to pre-program. New contexts and situations arise all the time, with the definition of dirt changing dynamically. If you drop some exotic previously unknown material on the ground, and it becomes dirt, the device has to somehow recognize it as dirt and *destroy* it, while not destroying any exotic previously unknown material that isn't dirt.

Otherwise the device wouldn't be destroying *all* dirt, it would just be destroying *some* common variants of dirt.

Yep, we're told that it takes a few seconds to "clean" a room. So no instant cleaning a planet or a universe.

******** I think the main issue here is that we don't have enough technical details on the scope of this power from [[/u/mixbany]].

- What defines dirt/grime? Is it user-defined? Does it carry its own broad pre-defined definition (in which case, in the scenario you described where an exotic new material is spilled, it would /not/ be able to clean that up)?
- We're only given 1-2 /examples/ of its use, but nothing about the /limits/ of its use. How much dirt can it clean per second? What's the range? How often can it be used, and does it need to be recharged?
- When black holes consume matter, the matter doesn't disappear - I'm not a physicist, but from my understanding, a lot is converted to energy, some is released as Hawking radiation, etc. When he says "the material is whisked out of our world", does he mean it's simply teleported away from our planet, to another location within our universe? Or is it completely removed from our universe? Both have heavy connotations for the use of the power.

Because the power is so vaguely defined, we can't really munchkin without making broad assumptions (like, the user can define "dirt/grime", or the range & power are infinite, etc), which make breaking the power extremely easy...

*** Well nobody's said it yet so I'll state the obvious world domination/optimization answer. I believe I saw something like this online before but that version was much more exploitable because it didn't just get rid of material but could change things in a much less limited way in order to make them "clean".\\
Nonetheless even if you can only remove material doesn't mean you can't still achieve world optimization.

The way you go about it is to rely on the fact the power can clearly use information you don't have access to. So if you have enough of a transhumanist streak then one can likely take a bunch of randomly generated bits and find a way to make yourself view all the bits that wouldn't make up the source code for your perfect FAI as unclean. So just represent your bits as ridges of varying size and the power will delete all the one's that wouldn't be belong in that part of the sequential sequence of the aforementioned seed AI source code.\\
Anyway with enough time using a system like this you should be able to inscribe an entire source code for your seed AI that also happens to be a botnet virus thus allowing it to spread as soon as you get it onto your computer and instantiate itself.

TLDR: With the right setup you can use this ability to generate arbitrary information.

Ah but whether something is new information in that sense is far more ambiguous than you would think. For one the power presumably has omniscience since there's no talk of lightspeed limits or any of the other limits you need in order to obtain information without violating thermodynamics. Meaning if one or more varieties of multiverse exist (whether many worlds or eternal inflation or any number of others, which aren't mutually exclusive) then there will most certainly be a universe wherein the source code you're looking for exists.\\
Hell it doesn't stop there either. Since we aren't limited to future light cone limits it could pick a reference frame in which any future event has already happened. Meaning that any information can be drawn upon since boltzmann brains will inevitably come into existence possessing that information.

Plus even besides all the ways in which the information you're looking for could exist in another universe or the far future, there's other questions as to whether the information isn't just implicit. After all erasing the grime from a city is changing the state of it's physical system to create information that hadn't previously existed. More generally any physical change creates information which hadn't previously existed just based on the formal definitions of information. So in a formal framework the difference between deleting physical structures that count as dirt in a way that happens to generate the source code of a GAI and any other application is not that clear.

Also even if you /could/ only revert objects to their previous state it would still be pretty trivial to arrange a setup practically indistinguishable from my original setup in order to extract the previously mentioned AI source code, simply by separating the information medium into a great may individual "pieces". That doesn't really solve the greater problem you seem to have with "information creation", and getting a rigorous definition of what counts as new information (that doesn't rule out many applications you would want to work) here would be quite difficult.

That still doesn't work because it's relatively easy to come up with examples wherein the parts of something were never clean. For instance an object that ended up covered in soot as part of it's manufacturing process and was never cleaned before being used as part of the infrastructure in the aforementioned perpetually filthy city.\\
More importantly however the power working this way would conflict with cannon. Since the OP said it worked like a very selective black hole, meaning it can only delete material. However this means that cleaning an object that had heavily rusted would make it smaller according to cannon whereas if you were merely reverting it the mass of iron would remain the same. So certain types of cleaning are going to be impossible because they require moving material around or creating it.\\
Importantly here cleaning an object will /never/ be the same as reverting it's temporal state. Because a few atoms of the material will always have escaped due to processes ranging from sublimation to quantum tunneling.

It's pretty simple all you have to do is start with say a bunch of 0's then turn them into 1's. Then selectively have the 1's that aren't part of the AI's source code declared unclean and reverted. Actually I think that plan may be somewhat simpler than the original one I devised. The medium you use for the bits isn't super important it just needs to be such that the default state is all 0's before you inscribe anything onto it and the bits need to be represented as physical states (as opposed to magnetic fields).\\
Only being able to revert things to their previous state still doesn't change the fact the power needs to possess knowledge you lack, and in fact given the sheer complexity of nearly any object (assuming the cleaning is truly perfect at the atomic level) it will have more information than you could even fit inside your mind. So coming up with a consistent ruling on the information it has is as I said before difficult.

Given total violation of thermodynamics is a given I'm not sure to what extent trying to assume other laws apply really simplifies things here and given the ability to extract information out of thin air with no expenditure of energy or interaction with the relevant system is a given. So making further assumptions that it just so happens to be limited to only one ill-defined "type" of information doesn't simplify things.\\
Importantly exploiting the thermodynamics violations seems pretty likely to let you somehow extract negative energy via creating areas of lower than vacuum energy. Which if you could make it work would allow FTL and potentially causality violations as well.

This only works if the power is somehow omniscient; that is, the power somehow knows how the AI works.

In general, cleaning does not require omniscience. Even if the cleaning is perfect on the atomic level. Sure, it needs to handle a /massive/ amount of information, but it's all on a very simple basis - it simply needs to decide, for each atom, whether or not that atom needs to vanish. That is, it needs a rule for deciding what is or is not dirt.

What you're proposing is, in effect, a rule of "it's dirt if it's not part of a suitable AI". And then let the rule - somehow - have to decide what a suitable AI is. So... it's a question that you cannot answer. With ordinary dirt, you could, in principle, with perfect knowledge of the atomic structure of everything, decide which parts are and are not dirt - so the only information that the power really needs, to clean the object, is the atomic structure of the object (which is present right there to be queried) and the state of your brain (to decide what is and is not dirt). But, under your proposed rule, there is nothing in your brainstate which says which bits are or are not to be considered dirt; the power, for the first time, requires external omniscience.

That actually does basically allow omniscience if you remember what I said about drawing on information from boltzmann brains in the far future. If you can do time travel then you can draw on any information that will ever exist in the future, which eventually includes anything of finite complexity. Also FTL means in many models of the universe (such as eternal inflation) you can draw upon other universes for information even without time travel.\\
Better yet with time travel you can set up a code phrase, then come up with some elaborate meaning for the power to read into it in the future, so as soon as you get the power all you have to do is say the code phrase. Of course as is always the issue with time travel everything ought to have already been overtaken by a singularity AI retroactively since a short time after the big bang.

#+end_quote

I mean given it only fails by what is effectively author fiat I think that sort of thing ought to work. Still verification is an issue since value alignment requires hitting a small target in mind space.

However it's not an insurmountable issue. For instance you could have the power look for places in the future where instead of boltzmann brains you got a boltzmann universe nearly identical to our own that will develop on its own without relying on random chance. Then you extracted information by viewing the future of these universe, basically ripping off their AI tech, and you can determine friendliness by seeing how the GAI acts once out of containment.\\
In addition you might well look for a universe where the AI researchers created neuromorphic AI first and due to pure random chance (cosmic radiation flipping bits or whatever) the created AI happened to be an exact copy of you, except for its knowledge of the power (don't want it trying to manipulate you into instantiating it). Then just look at it after it escapes containment to make sure it acts in a way that indicates it has improved itself without changing its values.

There's also something of a question of whether verification isn't already implicit in the power. After all when it looks for the code for an AI that meets your friendliness standards it may just look at all possible outcomes of codes it could give you and check for the ones that don't lead to unclean outcomes. Or at least if it doesn't automatically do that I think you could get it to with the right conditional statements.

Anyway assuming the power can't affect the period before you received it (otherwise this scenario could never arise to begin with) then you'll probably find yourself in a world controlled by GAI the instant you get the power due to the actions of some other timeline's version of you.

*********** Still in the spirit of considering the least convenient possible world I will consider a scenario where the power's knowledge and thus cleaning is imperfect and involves interacting with it's future light cone using some form of previously unknown radiation that travels at c. Also assuming the power is dumb enough that you can't use it to generate novel information which would require significant cognitive work for a human to devise. Again this interpretation of canon already has some avenues of exploit I don't know how to patch, and may not be actually be totally consistent with canon but I digress.

In this scenario then I would go the world domination route more directly. Simply deleting much of the world's weaponry and a great many individuals who would only get in my way latter in my plan (as well as people who had committed crimes that would be considered worthy of the death penalty, since I have a perfect method of determining guilt). Also I would remove all the world's pollution returning the atmosphere and oceans to a preindustrial state.\\
At that point I would begin communicating using a variety of means that couldn't be traced back to me carving my messages in the sides of mountains, or any number of other places that ensure they'll be seen. I would force the world to start changing its laws in accordance with my instructions, lest non-cooperative leaders be deleted. Resistance is pretty damned futile when I can have a power that routinely deletes anyone with intentions to rebel. Of course at some point I would put myself in a position of power from the shadows with only a few people knowing I was responsible for all this. However keeping secrecy is pretty easy when you can remove memories (by deleting the handful of neurons holding the memory in someone's brain and any records) or just make people who intend to screw you over not exist.\\
Basically it would be pretty easy to make a utopia by wielding this power. I would say dystopia except it would actually violate less rights than current governments. After all there's no need to do government surveillance when anyone who intends to commit a crime is either destroyed or their information carved into a wall at the police station. Effectively there would be no militaries and the only police force would be a minimal one to pick up criminals. The ability to force total compliance with the law with unlimited force solves a pretty big number of coordination problems as well.\\
Once I've cemented power I can also do more than just restructure society my power has a great many other applications such as:\\
* All pathogens simply cease to exist among humans or domesticated animals, invasive species disappear.

- Cancer is no longer an issue and by killing senescent cells the effects of aging can also likely be diminished (based on some studies that did that).

- People can voluntarily have memories removed if they are causing significant psychological harm.

- Civilization can get unlimited easy power by building power plants and having my power automatically delete electrons within certain structures inside them. The structures don't need to be power plants either I could have pretty much any large machine have a box inside which my power would delete a certain number of electrons in order to get current.

- I could mass produce many chemicals by deleting components of existing chemicals. Better yet I could produce rare elements by deleting protons and neutrons from heavier more common heavier elements, so suddenly lead, radon and a great many other heavy elements spike in value since they can be turned into any lighter element. The applications of having pretty much every element and isotope become as cheap as any element heavier than it will probably have an insane number of applications that I couldn't even imagine.

- I stop any genetic diseases from continuing be deleting sperm/eggs/zygotes that have a particular genetic sequence (though some genes do seem to have an advantage for people with only one copy so I might only delete sperm if the egg already has a copy). Of course just deleting part of a genetic sequence for all of someone's DNA would probably kill the cell, so existing people would have to rely on gene editing which I would dump massive research into.\\
  Plus I can do better than eliminating genetic diseases, for instance my power can be set up so that it selectively deletes sperm/eggs in order to maximize the intelligence, health, etc of resulting offspring. As well as just preventing unwanted pregnancies. Of course all of this is just a stopgap measure until I can implement genetic engineering on a wide scale.

- While I posited the power couldn't generate novel information that doesn't mean it couldn't be used to generate significant amounts of knowledge. Just answering questions using its observational power would be enough to make massive breakthroughs in a wide variety of topics from physics to genetics.

Anyway you get my point, I would be able to create a post scarcity utopia relatively quickly. From there I have the ability to put massive resources into research and my power would be able to alleviate a significant number of concerns with regards to AI and other techs. As well as ensured I had monopoly on all tech and didn't have to worry about competition.

While at pre singularity tech levels we would have /some/ limits that seems besides the point that this still meets the criterion for a post scarcity civilization even if it's not post singularity.\\
Of course once we had GAI then you could avert heat death by deleting one particle from pairs of virtual particles to create as much matter/energy as needed. Actually to avoid any slight annoyances due to charge imbalances I might as well just have the power generators work that way, having them delete either positrons or electrons from virtual particle pairs inside the box. Plus I could use that method to create unlimited amounts of hydrogen, though anything heavier would need too many resources to be worth it at our tech level.\\

And you may well be right. But... I don't know enough neurobiology to know for sure. What if you end up deleting (for example) all the neurons that habitually hold a memory that is fifteen hours old?

*** I think a lot of munchkining can be avoided if you just assume some kind of coherent extrapolated volition for concepts; something counts as "dirty" or "clean" if a typical human with sufficient knowledge would consider it to be dirty or clean. There are going to be fuzzy areas even then, but there aren't infinite fuzzy areas, and nobody is going to think "area with dirt removed in patterns corresponding to source code" or even "area with nuclear missiles removed" counts as clean.

This is especially so when the effect is based on magic, since perhaps the main difference between science and magic is that magic assumes that high-level human concepts are fundamental descriptions of the universe. (That's why it's a trope to have spells that can't create food or valuables, for instance.)
