**** If you're okay with a classic, read the short story [[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/n.aspx][Nyarlathotep]] (Lovecraft). It's not very long either and definitely fits this theme.

  One hobbit would have been enough to carry the ring to Mordor. We brought four.

**** Unfortunately, they don't write much fic, and most of the fic they do write doesn't pique my interest. This one's the great and shining exception.

But nonfic-wise, they have [[http://thingofthings.wordpress.com/][a blog which]] - both when I agree with their posts and when I don't - is pretty much always thought-provoking.

** Is it me or is the ending a little abrupt? Like there's no transition between "aragorn is sticking to his precommitment" to "argorn is suddenly planning to turn on the others (for their own good)".
