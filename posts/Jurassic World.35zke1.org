** Great story, if with a somewhat misleading title (especially considering current events).

*** Hey hey, just to chime in: this is part of a set of 10 stories called "Tomorrowland," each of which is named after a different movie coming out this year. Here is [[http://www.miraclejones.com/stories/the-avengers-age-of-ultron.html]["Avengers: Age of Ultron,"]] for instance, a story from this collection in a similar vein.

Edit: All the stories so far in the collection, in addition to many other stories, can be found at [[http://www.miraclejones.com]]

**** That... sort of makes it ridiculously misleading. The first time that I read a Tomorrowland story I might not think that it was a text version of the film to which it referred, but it would be reasonable to think that Jurassic World, for example, would at least have to do with /genetic engineering/ if not dinosaurs or time travel or something.

After finding otherwise I will know better, but the titles will now be useless to me. They tell me nothing. You could name them Story #1, Story #2, Story #3, and so on, and I would know just as much as these titles tell me, and this... kind of annoys me, much to my surprise.

***** Yes, you are of course right! But it is fun to write a story called Jurassic World and every time I see a poster for, or hear an otherwise intelligent person express an opinion about, such a film I think of my own story and not the hellish world we live in and the utter vacuity of creative ideas in a landscape where the artistic impulse to gleefully make art that disturbs is subsumed in the profit motive of multinational corporations.

****** Try giving them subtitles. You get your satisfaction, everyone else gets a hint at what's in the story.

****** Well... alrighty then.

A bit of an odd impulse but I'm not one to throw stones. I enjoyed your writing, so keep on keeping on :)

***** Perhaps [[http://www.miraclejones.com/stories/fifty-shades-of-grey.html]["Fifty Shades of Grey"]] or [[http://www.miraclejones.com/stories/hot-tub-time-machine-2.html]["Hot Tub Time Machine 2"]] hold the answers you are looking for? I still have six stories to go in this collection; I still have a lot of work to do.

*** Current events?

And yeah, the title could be more descriptive.

**** The movie "Jurassic World" is about to come out. There's no date on the story, so maybe it wasn't recent.

Edit:

Scratch that, apparently it was done intentionally.

** Huh. An alright story. Worth the read. I might recommend it to a certain type of person, but not to most people.

The title should definitely be changed.

It has a Luddist feel to it (mostly because of the main character) which is vaguely disappointing. I suppose... I am not sure what I am supposed to take away from the story. On the one hand, the protagonist swallows at least some of his Luddism and makes use of an AI. On the other hand, the ending would not be out of place in a story whose message was about the dehumanizing effect of AI or technology in general.
