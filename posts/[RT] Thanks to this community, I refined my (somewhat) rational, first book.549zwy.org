And now my first book is published! [[https://www.amazon.com/Delvers-LLC-Welcome-Blaise-Corvin-ebook/dp/B01M0U4B3S/]]

Is it perfect? No. But I got some great feedback from this community way back here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o2a4a/rt_delvers_llc_litrpg_that_attempts_to_make/]]

I want to thank some of the folks at [[/r/rational]] for reading my story and giving great input.

Thank you!


** Wouldn't it be fair to give back to the community by providing free copies to those who helped you?

Because this post feels a lot like advertising your paid content and nothing more...

*** If he were to give out free copies to people who helped, then it should only go to those who provided feedback (namely the people who commented in the above linked thread), not to everyone here.

Also why shouldn't he advertise his story here? This is a subreddit explicitly for linking to rational fiction. There is no requirement for the linked fiction to be free.

Finally, in the linked thread, there is a link to a free online [[http://blaise-corvin.com/delvers-llc/][copy]]. It's probably just an unedited draft though.

**** Could not have said it better myself! :)

Fun fact, there is no such thing as a "free" kindle copy. To give someone a copy, I have to basically buy a copy myself and gift it to someone. It's heavily discounted since I get my own royalty, but it's one of those weird Amazon things everyone just deals with... lol

***** Is it in Kindle Unlimited? If so, people can read it for free. Also, I make about half my writing money from KU, so you should strongly consider it.

****** I'm considering putting it on Unlimited today. If I do, I have to take down my story from the rest of the internet, though. Amazon is very strict.

******* You're not kidding. My advice: take it down, put it in KU for 3 months or until the page counts drop, put it up on the Internet again. If you notify readers of the plan in advance they shouldn't object. The ones that do, just tell them that everyone needs to eat and you're happy to keep it free if they'll make up the difference. I guarantee none of them will take you up on it -- most will be of the "why should I pay for content?" school of thought.

*** It did not feel that way to me. Principle of generosity: assume he is being sincere about saying thank you.

**** My book is legitimately better for some of the advice I got. And today I'm going to probably break #1000 on Kindle and #20 in Science Fiction. Delvers LLC hasn't even been out a week yet. :)

***** This may sound rude, but $6 is kind of a lot for a kindle book, especially from an unknown author. You might sell more at $3.

****** I'm #25 right now in Science Fiction Action and Adventure and I almost broke #1000 on Kindle today.

The book is selling just fine. :) Thank you for your opinion, but I will not be selling this book for $3 at 133k words.
