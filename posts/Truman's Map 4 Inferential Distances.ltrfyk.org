"21-year-old Truman is sick of the chaos. But does that justify a life of crime?"

I really appreciated the feedback from the last chapter. It helped me figure out what needed clarification. I really appreciate [[/u/thecommexokid][u/thecommexokid]] who dug into history to find my last chapter post and leave some encouragement there.

This is the first chapter where your interpretations will probably influence Truman's fate, since there's a big question in the last chapters that I'm not yet sure of

Thanks for keeping my spirits up. Now I'll imagine someone is searching for my story every time I don't feel like writing

This is... not a good plan. Granted, good for him in spotting the problem with only bringing one rack down, but Truman knows (or should know) that they have a whole town's worth of people in on the conspiracy. His plan should take into account that they have sufficient manpower to look under the racks *and* chase after him, and assume that the latter will happen.

A good plan has redundancy, has contingencies for what should happen if everything does not go according to Plan A. so far as I can tell, Truman hasn't planned for "They're not convinced by me faking my death."

And it feels a lot like he burned more time coming up with his "fake my death" plan than that plan is going to buy him. At this point, he should be seriously considering the sunk-cost fallacy.

  God, I hoped Linda was right. Because that was the only way I could save her.

That's an interesting dilemma he's posing for the showrunners. Either they let Truman win, in which case, there's someone there who is both indebted to him and willing to break character, or they don't let Truman win, in which case, they have to find some way of letting him out of prison despite his protests of guilt.

My prediction is: Truman is let off, but Linda ends up going over a cliff of her own, and Truman is left to solve her "murder." Tie everything up in a neat little bow. Which, of course, will raise suspicions of its own.

I love this running gag.

*** Thank you for this detailed critique. It really helps me see what I'm doing well, what I need to put more emphasis on, and what Truman may have missed.

I'll clear this up for now: Truman is definitely getting out of jail and he can leave that up to his mother and the lawyer. The question he's really facing there is how he's going to understand the extent of his power and use it against the mayor to save Linda Groupon's career. However he does that will be the focus of Their dilemma.

No comment on your prediction :)

**** Ah, I misunderstood the "If it was true, I should anticipate that Mom's lawyer would get me off the hook." line.

I thought that was referring to positioning himself in the worst possible place to make Linda look better/justified, saving her job that way, and counting on the privilege that Linda perceived to get himself through it.

** Wow, this is great.

The discussion of privilege worked real great. Felt like the way a real person would approach the discussion while straddling the line between not breaking Kayfabe and getting across the enormity of the privilege he has in being able to get away with a theft spree via three weeks of community service.

*** Kayfabe is a new word for me. Thanks!

I'm glad you found it realistic.

That reminds me, I forgot to add an authors note that the privilege discussion involved a real life line that I like. Fran√ßois Clemmons, who played the police officer on Mr Roger's Neighborhood, originally said "I grew up in the ghetto. I did not have a positive opinion of police officers". Linda's reason for joining the show is basically his.

I'll have to update the posts to add that note

** Just found the fic and read all the way through. I'm really enjoying it!

Truman is going to find that even as Mayor he's going to have a lot of power in some directions, and almost completely helpless in others. Which, by itself, shouldn't be that surprising, a politician must satisfy those that maintain their power, whether they're a dictator of a country or a small town mayor. Can't wait to see how that interacts with Their work to maintain the facade.
