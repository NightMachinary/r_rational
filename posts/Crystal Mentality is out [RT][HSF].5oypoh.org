** For anyone who is wondering about the website, only the first book is free to read. Guy needs to make money somehow!

Just to let people know, Amazon only provides a mobi format for $9.99, while for a one cent higher price on Gumroad ($10) you can get [[https://gumroad.com/l/CrystalMentality][Crystal Mentality]] in the following formats: epub, html, mobi, pdf, and txt.

Also I /think/ Max gets a higher cut of profits on Gumroad, but I'm not too sure about that so don't hold me to it.

PS WOOOOOOO-HOOOOO!!!!! I'm not going to sleep tonight with such a good book ready for reading!

EDIT: Amusing piece of information I had to share. In the book, Max says the book will be released into the public domain on January 1, 2039 which makes sense since that's the year the story starts in the book.

**** What do you mean? The first book's free on the website, so it's not on Gumroad at all. There's only the [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][website]] itself and [[https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Society-Trilogy-Book-ebook/dp/B01AYT6A3C][Amazon]].

EDIT: [[/u/Terkala]], I made a mistake before. [[https://gumroad.com/raelifin][Crystal Society]] /is/ available on Gumroad. But it's the same thing as on the website. Free with a name your price to buy it in all five formats.

** You guys probably remember the [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][first novel]], Crystal Society, about a group of AIs with different goals sharing a body, which EY [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/42o6x5/rthsf_crystal_society_rationalfic_web_novel_from/czbvylr/][said]] was one of the most realistic depictions of an AI in fiction. Well the sequel's out!

** Finished.

I enjoyed this more than Crystal Society. It felt shorter, though I haven't compared to see if that's true (I read the first online and the second on my Kindle app, so can't simply compare). It was more abstract and inhuman, with some delightfully creepy bits. I appreciated that the author took pains to make this feel different from Crystal Society, though I expect that will cause some negative reactions as well.

Given the state of things near the end, I have no idea what Crystal Eternity will be like, and that makes me happy.

I didn't dislike those parts as much as TK17 did, but I agree the shift is there and it's not great.

*** I don't actually know the answer, so read on if you wish to know what my guess is.

................

I'm guessing that the numbers themselves aren't important. I believe the numbers are a location/coordinates in the memory space. This would make sense because according to some quick googling, a qubit can be represented by a real number (which indicates an angle in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere][Bloch sphere]]?) and two complex numbers which correspond to a column in the matrix. Please note that I know very little about quantum computing and could be completely wrong about qubit representations. Of course, I have no clue what the poem has to do with anything.

**** It's not a memory address.

Growth is testing Face's intelligence and lateral thinking. The numbers, as with the poem, are a way of obliquely talking about the situation without revealing information and potentially helping Face. I'll leave it to additional speculation to decode the meaning.
