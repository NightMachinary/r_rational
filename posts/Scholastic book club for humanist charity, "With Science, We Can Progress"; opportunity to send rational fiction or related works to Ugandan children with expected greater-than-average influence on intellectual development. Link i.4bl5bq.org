**** I've met some smart 10 year olds in my time. That being said, they should at least be of an age where they've learned to read, so probably 8 years and older at the very least.

**** Not that I've seen the site, but for older children there are the outliers like Augie and the Green knight. And perhaps the fantasy or sci-fi series we'd enjoyed as kids to bring them to the genre.
