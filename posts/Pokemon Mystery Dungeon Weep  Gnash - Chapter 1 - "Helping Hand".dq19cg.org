** Some guy turns blue. He doesn't want to be blue, so he goes and tries to be some other color. Even with the help of a new friend, he discovers that becoming not-blue is actually very difficult.

This fanfiction is meant to be rational. "Rational" is a loaded term that different people interpret differently, but most of what I mean by that is that this story will try to prioritize certain conventions that some other rational stories also use, and that I hope that people who like those stories will like it too.

Basic familiarity with the universe of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games is suggested but not required for reader enjoyment.

I hope to update on a weekly basis.

This story is dedicated to Eiffel 65.

Good friend, might I introduce you to a wonderful new product we call the planning fallacy?

In all seriousness, if you managed to pull that off, that would be awesome in and of itself.

** Seems interesting so far. I would be inclined to read more, if more were posted.

** I like it and I'll continue to follow the story as it's updated. The mystery dungeon series is, in my opinion, the best Pokemon side series. Still I have to wonder why this group of Pokemon mentioned aren't calling themselves a rescue team. I guess we'll find out later.

*** If you enjoyed PMD then you'd probably also enjoy the "mainline" mystery dungeon series, Shiren the Wanderer. The DS version has an english release and is quite nice as an entry to the series (if you already know about Shiren disregard my comment)

**** I've never heard of shiren wanderer. What's the big difference between those games and pmd? (I'll look into trying them. Which one do you recommend I start with?)

***** The main difference is, Shiren is more challenging in general, harsher death penalties, and I think the story is looser (haven't played much PMD to compare it). You should start with "Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer" for the DS, it's a remake of the SNES original which was the second game of the Mystery Dungeon series (and the first one featuring Shiren, the main character). The other one I've played is Shiren the Wanderer: The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate, which only got localized to english in it's PSVita version, but I think it's not as good an introduction because of the day/night cycle mechanics introduced in it.

**** Literally never knew that Mystery Dungeon was a setting outside of Pokemon. Then again, I've never played any PMD, so my exposure is limited.
