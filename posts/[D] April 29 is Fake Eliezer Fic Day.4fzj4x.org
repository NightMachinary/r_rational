Friday, April 29th, is the one-year anniversary of the [[https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153281263934228][post]] in which EY expressed a desire, and established a protocol, to publish pseudonymous fic. To summarize:

1. If asked whether you are Eliezer Yudkowsky, reply "No comment."
2. The real Eliezer Yudkowsky will do likewise.
3. Eliezer might be willing to edit a few paragraphs of your fic to sound more like him.

If you've been considering writing a camouflage fic, consider the anniversary your Schelling point to do so.


** [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]] - Are you Eliezer Yudkowsky? Or has the whole thing been an elaborate misdirection by David Monroe?
