It's that time again folks, I'm writing/illustrating original fiction again.

Had a lot of practice with some fan fiction to get better at writing characters and characterization.

This is a very slice-of-life story but with an episodic serial format planned. And individual 'episodes' or 'arcs' will have their own focus in tone/genre outside of the framing device.

Updated every two days.

Critique and praise appreciated, it helps feed my writing.
