Crossover between Avatar the last Airbender and Stargate 1. Moderate campy fun, some power shenanigans, enemy that seem to learn new techniques, okay writing and slight rational deductions. Story is completed.

*** Level of such and such from 1 to 10. Using it for a comparison with other works. Like hpmor would be RT-8 and MK-7, or even in absolute terms of a given concept, in which case it would be RT-1 for story mode, and RT-10 would be a whole world built on consequences of a given premise. In this case it's the first version. But so far I have read 5 chapters out of 12, and the science parts weren't interesting for me to double check.

**** No offense, but that is a terrible idea, because everyone else has already decided what the like and don't like about rational fiction so introducing a rating scale is not only unnecessary but will lead to a mess of people arguing over relative ratings.

For example, video game reviews.

***** Yeah when you mentioned that, I remember having proposed same idea before and someone giving a similar response, so I amended it to approximate levels.

Yep here it is
