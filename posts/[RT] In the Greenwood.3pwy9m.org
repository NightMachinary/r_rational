** I found this very enjoyable, but I confess I was hoping for more of something. More exploration of what the greenwood is, and what it means for Robin to be the spirit of the trees. More of the political side; the drama between Prince John and King Richard would have been interesting from this perspective.

** How is this rational? Because Robin Hood murders people?

*** Not sure what you mean. It's a retelling of the classic tale while following all the marks of a rational story:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

It's certainly not rational/ist/, but it's quite a nice rational short story.

**** Were these points not true in the original Robin Hood?

Also it doesn't develop the bandits motivation at all. I guess it is assumed that they are for redistribution of wealth but since they steal from poor too they are just bandits which is hardly interesting conflict.

The magic forest is not explained either.
