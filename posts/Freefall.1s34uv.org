** Characters are human-like enough to be simpathetic, but alien enough to give an interesting perspective on how different sorts of minds interact. As a rationalist bonus, does a good job of tearing apart the idea of human-safe AI. And it's consistently funny.

*** Minds that are smart enough to be dangerous but not smart enough to self-improve are a totally viable possibility, even if one LW doesn't usually care about. And thinking about them lets you start to understand what a nonhuman mind could be like. Still fairly human-like, but that helps in understanding.
