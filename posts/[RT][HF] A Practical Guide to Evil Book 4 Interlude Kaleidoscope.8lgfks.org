** That oath to the Pilgrim is going to be spent on something for Cat, either at keeping to some terms or the Liesse accords.

Also: greater evil emerging, *either the dead king or the tower*? I was skeptical at first but this seems like further evidence that Triumphant is returning.

** Damn. It seemed to be going well after the last chapter too. As pissed off as I am against the Pilgrim for doing that, I can't bring myself to actually dislike him. He seems to be a genuinely good person who isn't blinded by the Good and Evil labels like the other heroes we've seen.

*** The titles always have multiple meanings, but what struck me most was that the two sides did the same thing (power gambit killing tons of people, a full seventh of cat's host was killed by the wall play) but that everyone in the interlude including juniper sees cats actions as the monstrous and scary ones. The proceran fences were just good tactics, apparently.

It appears to be some named/weight thing, in that the walls were made by lots of npcs and the portal by two named, but the juxtaposition felt very "through the looking glass" to me.

Edit: to add a bit more, it has got me rethinking the setting a fair bit. It explains why Amadeus is so successful, since his whole schtick is making best use of non-named and avoiding weight and backlash. Also explains why the gnomes hate technological advancement, which would disrupt the status quo that keeps the whole continent down, by making named less relevant. Effectively they don't need to police Calernia because the stories enforce stagnation.

I know these thoughts are nothing new, but this chapter has given me a bunch to think about.

** Disappointed that Cat is still winning by maiming herself and her allies.

Prince's Folly is likely Amadis insisting that the Procerans attack while Kat is incapacitated despite the Pilgrim arguing for caution. Trudging through an icy swamp filled with corpses will be a very bad situation when Kat awakens from her coma with a new name. I'm curious to see what dilemma Katâ€˜s inner devil and angel argue about during this name dream.

**** I actually think there's a chance one of the Woe is gong to bite it. The only characters we know for sure survive the story are Juniper and Aisha (from chapter header quotes) so anyone else is fair game. honestly, one of my few beefs with the story is the lack of real consequences or failures until now. only three important characters have died, one of which turned out to be a traitor. my money is on robber or Archer

** So camp Evil is down its 2 heroes, and the good army plans to attack once they find that out.

They still need to wade through the march to attack, which is like begging Juniper to crush it, so they will have to rely on hero support.

So what is going to happen? Cat makes a timely recovery? Juniper pulls a genius victory out of her ass. Alternatively, we can get Story shenanigans, but story generally favors good over evil. Like, evil can't get a pattern of 3 (Arguably, the opening move was good's victory, then we call the gate a draw)

or we Oath shenanigans. I'm pretty sure that if the side of good violates the agreement between the pilgrim and Cat, that cat gets to collect her due and bring more of he power into creation. (Like the duke of violent squalls being able to do so if he won the duel.) Now the oaths involve sacking cities, not calling for angels, demons or devils, the treatment of prisoners and the genuine surrender. I can see some of the princes getting antsy after the lake, and violating one of the latter two.
