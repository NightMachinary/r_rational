** I've been following Delve for a while. Fairly RT; MC spends a lot of time playing with his skill tree to optimize his capabilities, but doesn't go on to stomp the setting. Decisions make sense in context (sometimes people make mistakes or are irrational, but never just to advance the plot.)

Admission: the beginnings of isekai/xianxia ("oh I have awoken in a fantasy world... NAKED? Oh jeez what to do MAGIC IS A THING HERE? Wow I want to live here, good thing I have no friends or family and do nothing but play video games") annoy the /piss/ out of me even though I enjoy a bunch of other things about the genre(s?).

Delve was /not/ super annoying to me on that front. It got my hackles up at the beginning because I guess all portal fantasy has to hit the stations of +canon+ portals or something. But it's developed nicely, good characters, good worldbuilding, and it's on my shortlist of patreon-supported tales. Recommend.

Yeah, the only isekai I can read now are the ones that find some interesting way to rush through the introduction.

WtC has the PUBG intro which does a lot to both introduce you to the world (the army guy uses a lot of fantasy idioms and there's clearly magic, but the prisoners are also being dropped from a military plane) and immediately raise the stakes. "How did I get teleported to a world with magics? WHO CARES, THERE ARE ZOMBIES ABOUT TO EAT ME".

Everworld had a similar setup, where after the first chapter which introduces the characters, they all kinda wake up chained to a wall, then a god gives them the broad strokes ("You're in Everworld. Magic and stuff is real here"), sets up the McGuffin ("Where is your shady friend who happens to be a witch? I need her."), then raises the stakes ("You don't know anything useful. I'm going to have you executed now") in a pretty fast chapter.

What I'd be super interested in, would be a world where Isekai protagonists are really common and kind of a part of society. WtC flirts with the idea, but the main character is still very blatantly the Chosen One.

/Voyage extraordinaire au royaume des 7 Tours/ (Incredible journey to the realm of the 7 Towers) has a nice twist on the concept, where the Narnia-equivalent becomes a colonial-ish tourist attraction, with people paying top dollar for what is essentially a safari in fantasy-land (the book itself kinda sucked and the protagonist was really unlikeable, but the concept was interesting).

Worm has a band of characters who get pulled from our Earth to the Parahuman Earth, manage to get superpowers, and become criminal mercenaries while trying to find a way back home, among other things. They're pretty close to anti-isekai, in that they are absolutely not special: they're not the only ones to have power, they're not the strongest superheroes around, their choices are shaped by a society that's much bigger than them, and a few of them meet a violent and undignified end.

So I think my ideal isekai story would be something like that. Not necessarily cynical and violent, but a world where isekai characters are a part of society; there's an economy developed around them (which would probably have its exploitative side), social expectations for how they behave, and a greater design that the protagonists can't necessarily affect.

Of course, in this kind of story it's a lot harder for the protagonists to have agency. Stories are easier to write when the main character is the most important person in the world and all their decisions are inherently Important and Meaningful.

I've been enjoying The Gilded Hero. While the writing style may not be for everyone, it's a somewhat different take then most portal fantasies. In it, 'heros' are summoned en-mass by the king, and then used as a sort of disposable mercenary chattel.

Funny you should mention that. Just this morning I posted the first chapter of /The Patchwork Realms: Arrival/, which is exactly that. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-patchwork-realms-arrival.63045/#post-14500524]]

The blurb:

"Athos is a good dog. He likes frisbee, bacon, and his family (SmolFriend, Mom, and Dad). He's not so keen on falling through an interdimensional portal to a fantasy world where floating boxes tell you that you've just been given status as the 'Supreme Exemplar' of your species, a powerful package of abilities that includes human-level intelligence. Sure, being smart is nice but less so when it comes with the need to survive in a land made from bits of different dimensions stitched together like patches in a quilt. A thousand species, a thousand lands, sorcery and super science rubbing elbows, wars and intrigue everywhere...it's exhausting for a good dog who just wants to go home!"

**** There are a lot of really, really common tropes that don't typically serve the story all that well, and are mostly there because not having them would be sufficiently unrealistic that people would balk at it.

- Going about normal boring life or whatever
- Get pushed through a portal or whatever
- Where am I?
- This must be a dream or delusion!
- How did I get here?
- How do I get back home?
- Oh, I have a power or something
- Oh, there is a plot

And it's only at that point that you actually start getting on with whatever the plot is. All that other stuff is just setup, and /usually/ it doesn't have much impact on what comes after, it's just there so that you can have someone from Earth as an audience insert and fish out of water. (Sometimes the time from coming through the portal to actively being part of a real plot takes a super long time too, though that's a bit more variable.)

Yes, there are ways to go through these in ways that are more engaging and/or revealing of character, but it's a really well-mapped space, and a lot of authors don't put in any effort, which means that by the time you're reading your 20th "trapped in another world" story you feel like you're reading the same first chapters over and over again. (The "dream or delusion" and questioning of the nature of reality stuff in particular gets super tedious, especially since it's not falsifiable, and usually there's not a lot of depth.)

Munchkining in original stories in particular seem like a really pointless exercise for me (though for some people it's a big part of the fun). Since you're the author, you can make up any rules or combination of rules you want, so munchkining usually feels at least a little masturbatory.

It's more interesting in a tabletop context, since it's a collaborative exercise where you're trying to adapt to someone else's rules (unless the DM is doing it, in which case we go back to masturbatory), or in a fanfic that explores the consequences of another story's magic system; even then, I personally think it works best in small doses (like "set up, reminder, payoff", where each is a 30-seconds scene in a 2 hours movie).

***** My feeling is that if someone /doesn't/ have an interesting take on these tropes - that is, these things that are a fundamental part of, like, actually transitioning from one world to another - why write a portal fantasy in the first place? Why not... just write a normal fantasy set in this alternate world, from the perspective of a native?

I guess the answer is something like, "it's easier to write a person from my own demographic from Earth and have the reader relate to them" which just reeks of laziness to me.

****** There are three big points in favor of doing it the way that it's done:

1. It's easier to write, since it's easier to write people close to yourself
2. It's easier for the reader to identify with
3. It allows for the main character to naturally encounter a lot of exposition

... and I do think that in some sense, these boil down to laziness, since you can do all the same things without an MC from Earth, it just takes more effort. And for the most part, I think that stories are better when the author takes the time to not just dump a normal Earth person into their world. I don't want to fault authors for using cheap/lazy methods, but the problem is that a lot of the opening chapters suffer from being really rote and not having a lot to do with the plot.

(The plot also sucks most of the time, but that's a bit of a different issue.)

I mean, if you're going to have an MC who is basically an audience surrogate, it seems like you could build up a framework that didn't require all the usual bullshit. Like, pick an alt-Earth where magic was discovered or brought in from an alternate universe in 2018 and allows easy one-time portals to lands of adventure. MC can still be /basically/ from Earth, but they don't need to spend time wondering whether everything is real, they don't need to be super concerned about getting back, they go in not knowing where they're going or what the details are, but more or less knowing the score.

(Even then, I find the idea of an Earth where that's possible more interesting than people actually going to other places using it. Governments worry about brain drain from all their best and brightest isekaiing themselves, universe travel is clearly possible and Earth Prime knows that if it's not already in an arms race, it's going to need to be soon, etc.)

One thought that comes to mind regarding Isekai is, there's actually historic precedent you can draw from.

The colonization of America by Europeans is the most obvious period, but others come to mind.

Basically, any time people were invaded by a more advanced society whose technologies and inner politics were beyond the natives' understanding.

Both from the point of view of the people being colonized, and the people doing the colonizing, these situations were /wild/. They were meeting virtual aliens, from a society so different it might as well be another planet.

Most Isekai doesn't really capture that cultural shock; and it especially especially doesn't capture the societal chaos of having thousands of people have that cultural shock at the same time.

**** I apologize for not being more on top of my portal tropes-- considering how many of them I've read/am reading, I should probably be more familiar.

But if I had to order them from most to least annoying, I think it's --

1. Uninteresting opening scene where MC flounders for a bit, followed by an exposition dump followed by MC musing that his (it's always a guy, huh) social situation at home makes him uniquely suited to be a portal fic protag (which is why there won't be a bunch of homesickness or any mention of MC's previous life thereafter) (Largely subverted/deconstructed in /Worth The Candle/, see discussion above. Totally subverted in /Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lillijoy/.)

2. MC /immediately/ determines that his existing skillset from being a gamer lets him exploit the dickens out of the game system, whether because he unlocks some special ability or has extra powers by virtue of being the protagonist (kinda played straight in /Delve/, deconstructed in WtC, lampshaded in /Nanocultivation/, and pretty neatly sidestepped in /He Who Fights With Monsters/ and /Wandering Inn./)

3. Using level ups as a replacement for character development. I think LitRPGs can exploit a kind of lootbox/Skinner box psychological angle, using Numbers Go Up to draw in an audience and keep them hanging on the loot that'll accompany the next big level drop. /Homestuck/ was guilty of this at points. /Wandering Inn/ uses the level mechanism heavily, but not to the detriment of character development at all so I give it a pass. /Delve/ does it, /He Who Fights With Monsters/ does it, /Nanocultivation/ deconstructs it, /Worth The Candle/ deconstructs this at a molecular level.

4. Derivative/boring interfaces/magic systems. I mean. It's /really/ too much to ask to go beyond HP/MP/XP/Skills but it's appreciated when it happens. WtC, Wandering Inn, He Who Fights With Monsters, Delve and Nanocultivation all deconstruct to varying degrees.

There's probably a longer, more insightful list somewhere. But if all four of those happen in the first five chapters of a work I'm pretty likely to drop it.

Edit: oo, what AW said. aM i dReAmInG oR cRaZy!? gets SO old, SO fast. Which is why "I'm in.. Another world? --oh fuck, zombies. RUNNING" was pretty damn refreshing.

I'd love to see an example where the MC says "as a gamer I know exactly what to do here", then closes his interface and doesn't touch anything until he finds the equivalent of the wiki of optimised builds.

Gamer knowledge being superior to natives of the system doesn't make any sense. Now if there's no natives at all (or our band of adventurers are barred from their collective knowledge) then the gamer being better at the system than a non-gamer can make sense with good writing.

** I wonder when we'll start to have discussions about Delve's plot instead of discussions about how rational it is.

As far as the chapter goes, I really like how the characters aren't cardboard cutouts. Lord Rill has a bit more depth to him than a mustache twirling Quisling, and some other recent characters (the healer and the guild master) have shown to be more three dimensional than I thought. I like the way it's revealed, with Rain making biased judgements of them and confirming those opinions until presented with evidence otherwise.

I like the touch with the weapon shop. Now we're able to see exactly what the state of other crafters is compared to Tallheart.

--------------

Together, seeing the crafting with Rill's discussion it really paints a picture of the world and help explain why Rain's build isn't seen more often.

Modern people would expect hyper-specialized classes, maybe with strong groups/corporations/nobles to awaken people with specific jobs they'd expect them to do. But that's not the case here. People just don't take support builds. Amelia is an outlier with her healing build. Wallace is one of the only healers, despite there being tons of adventurers. And there aren't any crafters or buff supporters like Rain.

Everyone seems to take passed down builds that are optimized for survival. Their entire family line is built on this, so any risky actions can just extinguish your whole legacy. People don't want to try and push for maximum extreme power; they want to take the safe route that'll keep them alive. That's why not many copy Rain's build. We'd heard it before, but Rill's noble family help hammer it home.

Really excited to see what the Empire's got, since they do seem to go for hyper-specialized builds.

BUT it doesn't really feel like other rationalist stories. The MC isn't kicking but because he is the smartest guy around. The story also has a rather narrow focus on the MC and his immediate friends. Many rationalist fantasy stories end up with a much larger scope, like saving the world, ending death, etc.

So people in the subreddit are probably more likely to enjoy the story than any other random story. But its not gonna be a universal hit around here.

****** I've done the math and after level 25 all of his specializations are going to turn him into a monster. Raising the skill level to 15 means more skill levels for Aura Synergy, which ends up making the damages go up a lot, and the range goes up a lot too, then the more effective Aura Compression turns that into a lot more damage.

Right now a full "nova" pulse compressed to 20 meters (I chose that because it's a decent distance, and the specific benchmark the Watch mentioned when he was being appraised) does just under 5k damage. At level 25 bronze rank (15 level 10 auras boosting aura synergy) that increases to just under 9k damage.

At level 25 silver rank (no class bonuses, since we don't know those, just the "everything is rank 15 now") that damage changes to just under 220k damage...

I'm actually wondering if the recent Goldplate fight mentioned "damage limits" in passing just to lay the groundwork for some explanation for why Rain won't be able to kill every hostile in a city block in a single second, even though he'll have the damage to.

(Technically both of those lvl 25 numbers should be slightly higher, because they don't include the small Focus boost that 7 more levels of Clarity will give him through Magical Synergy or whatever, but that's a pretty small effect.

Are you saying that Worm, or any other superhero setting, can't be rational? Worm superpowers run the gamut, but someone coming in with some unknown power doesn't mean that the story isn't rational, so long as that power is still playing by the rules the setting has established, and so long as the characters deal with new powers according to what they believe the probability distribution of powers would be. Even then, outside context problems seem like they're completely fine to me, so long as they're actually outside context, rather than things that /shouldn't be/ but are treated as though they are.

If I understand [[/u/eaglejarl]] correctly, a lot of their complaint is not what the entad /did/, it's that Juniper didn't treat it in the way that it should have been treated given everything that's been shown in the text thus far (specifically narrative, the Dungeon Master, and threats scaling to meet or match powers). That's the opposite of what I would expect if it were /just/ a matter of fiat, because if it were /just/ fiat, you wouldn't expect the character to act any differently.

(I've already said my piece in the comments of that chapter [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/egl22m/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_177183/fcpgt1d/?context=3][here]], and think this is a pretty poor place to rehash any of it, not that I would want to.

The part of eaglejarl's comment in this thread that resonates with me is that a "whatever the author needs" and a "you lose button" can appear out of nowhere. I understand that part of WTC is that there is literally an omnipotent God and/or narrative, but I don't think that is rational.

That is to say, just because there's a "warning: deus ex machines hard hat zone" sign doesn't actually excuse deus ex machinas falling from the sky. It works for the sake of the story because that's what the story is about, but it still dings the rational score.

Rain's choice was entirely logical. Linear fighter quadratic wizard says to always play a wizard. Size of manabar and speed of regeneration is the biggest factor in power of wizard; he had enough mana to start off, so optimising regen made sense when distributing his very first points. When he discovered that he got XP for mana spent, the optimal move was to be able to regen mana as fast as possible so he could keep spending it. There is a good class due each of the "monofocus on one ability" builds, so of course he got the one for Clarity.

As to playing a support class instead of DPS, there's multiple ways to validate that choice:

1. Personal preference. He enjoys team play more than solo.
2. He's in a world where he doesn't know what's out there. As a support class he's going to be a desirable teammate and therefore it shouldn't be hard to find a party to watch his back. (This works.)
3. Support usually has a ton of non-combat utility, meaning he can probably make a living /without/ having to risk his life.

As to his build, he spent a lot of time optimising it to match his goals. Most people have to be careful about looking around too widely in the skill trees, because they can't afford the XP costs. XP is mostly free for Rain so he spent a lot of time reviewing all the options that are available and deciding how best to use them.

********* That doesn't sound like the winning move when the setting has people who have survived for longer and thus have trained more.

********** ... you think regularly picking stupid fights in a setting that definitely has stronger people than you is the winning long term strategy?

*********** If by winning, we mean staying alive? Sure.

If we mean getting strong? That's not gonna do it when other people in the setting live to old age and have trained all their lives. Just avoiding fights does not get you strong.

Somehow you are going to have to train better or luck yourself into some power or something to beat people who have cultivated for decades. Dodging fights does not address the how to get strong problem.

Not that any MC has ever had problems with the staying alive department. Power of shounen.
