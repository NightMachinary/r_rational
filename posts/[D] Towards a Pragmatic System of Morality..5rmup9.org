** It seems you did not follow the instructions of the mod comment on your last removed thread. PLEASE READ THE SIDEBAR. You're in the wrong subreddit for this sort of discussion.

(At best you can post this in the weekly open thread. Though you have no reason to do that unless you have reasons to care about this fanfic community's opinions.)

*** I care about this fanfic community's opinions. If this community is as I think a community of people who cultivate in the martial art of rationality.

**** You could, but then it'll be discussed primarily as a story, so a lot of effort will be wasted by all parties.

I have already told you the right thing to do if you want this community's opinions on your ideas.

Only if you want to post on this subreddit, since this is the rational /fiction/ subreddit. Otherwise, please be a special snowflake on a board that is appropriate for the topic.

This is a subreddit for fiction writing. Go discuss philosophy on [[/r/philosophy]], if they can stand it.

***** I've posted the threads on general rationality thread.

I want to discuss philosophical ideas from a rational/logical point of view, and not necessarily for their philosophical merit.
