I've been binge watching a lot of videos of reviews Empress Theresa and the utter insanity of Norman Boutin's attempt to defend his what it comes down to "Don't Disrespect my OC Joan of Arc or get blocked".

For More Context:

Here is an in depth investigation on both the book and the author: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TedsiCaV2B4]]

And here is an actual review of the book: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JopR-biL0I4]]

â€‹

I'm just asking to all the people who share my sentiment with this book, has there been anyone attempted or made a complete rewrite of Empress Theresa? Like remaking it into something more readable and good?


** So much of the plot depends on the general public worshipping Theresa, it would need a /major/ rewrite.\\
From reviews I first thought that Theresa was brainwashing everyone, but reading the first page made it very clear Norman was just writing a self-insert power-wank fantasy.\\
Perhaps the brainwashing route, with Theresa being the antagonist and an unreliable narrator, could work.

*** My fanfic fluff is that a rag team of anti-Theresa agents infiltrate the inner circle and try to kill Theresa in a direct or indirect way. They'll learn that Theresa quite literally lives inside an echo chamber. Where everything she sees is manipulated or covered so she can live in delusion because of either Blare and or HAL.

** Sounds a bit like the Youjo Senki fanfic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Girls Political Record]], about a reincarnation from our world unwittingly(and competently) politically dominating a weimar Germany analogue.

First half is an excellent farce type story, but the second half stretches the protagonist's central conceit of "unwitting competency" too far and the story loses a lot of its charm, IMO. Still pretty good.

*** I'd completely dissagree; I don't actually think that its "unwitting competency" later on, she is very purposeful in what she does, the unwitting part is more from the perspective not the actual policies put forward. My main example is her reaction to the first cheep car export of not-Germany: She is all for and pushes for investment into a cheep car. She thinks the car that comes out of it is fugly and "who the hell would want to buy this?" but its still her policy of investing into the endeavor that made it successful.

** He reminds me of Henry Darger.

It's depressing that people spent so much time baiting a man who is clearly mentally ill.

*** Its not so much baiting, its more so that people are pissed that the Author is incapable of recieving any criticism for his supposed "magnum opus".

** I think you would like "A Better Place". It has a practically omnipotent main character that works to make the world a better place. It's a rather dark deconstruction of a lot of assumptions present in that sort of story and this forum and simply a good read.

** rofl that investigation video was amazing. I don't know if I can handle an hour an forty minutes of review, but now I have to try.

edit: and OMFG he made a part 2 which means there are 3 hours and 20 minutes of review... XD

edit2: there are more parts. The reviews are over 6hours. Dude should be given a literature PhD for that amount of work.

** Down the Rabbit Hole had some seriously weird stories, like the Final Fantasy House. That one was legit scary and I don't want to admit that it might be real.
