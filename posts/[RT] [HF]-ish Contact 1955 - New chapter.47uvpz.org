** Short chapter, but progress is progress. Posted the text post an hour ago with link, but it didn't show up on the sub, so I had to repost as a direct link, something's probably screwy with reddit.

Short description: Magic field has returned to our part of universe, now a Master Trade and his apprentice visit USA in the 50's. Both sides act rationaly on first contact and rest is spoilers.
