[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g108/biweekly_challenge_first_contact/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "First Contact". [[/u/kishoto]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g108/biweekly_challenge_first_contact/d0d2met][Um...hi?]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/kishoto]]! This makes you the first to five wins, which is not only an accomplishment that puts you at the top of the leaderboard, but earns you special champion's flair.

This time, the challenge will be "Mere Reality". In other words, fiction that takes place in the real world, or something very close to it. No magic, no fancy super tech, just people in the real world doing realistic things. We're looking for something that's exceptionally grounded. (My personal advice would be to look for real life examples and work from there, but YMMV.)

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, March 23rd.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time

   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Wait, I'm getting a premonition ... */gasp/* it's the biweekly challenge! The vision is fuzzy, but it seems as though the prompt for next time is going to be "Precognition". I'm not sure exactly what that means, but [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers?from=Main.Precognition][I did find this TVTropes page]] that might help shed some light on the matter.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/23.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread for recommendations and discussion [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/49qxc4/challenge_companion_mere_reality/][is located here]].

(Something that I thought of about two months ago, but only remembered very belatedly. Though after this challenge ended, wrote and posting anyway for fun.)

**** Modern reality! The narrator (reliability judgement left as an exercise to the reader) believes himself to be the victim of rudeness in each month (the 'months' stylistic rather than literal). A typical person would claim the reverse. What do you think?

(Out of curiosity (and a desire to broaden my theory of mind), what are some of the different settings(/possible conclusions) you imagined?)

***** Abusive mother inculcates in the child a desire to avoid interpersonal strife above all things; may or may not have high-functioning Asperger's; doesn't understand certain social cues, so he doesn't notice them and interprets it as being ignored; surrounds himself with those who first accept him, not wanting there to be strife and conflict; all his friends have different culture than him, and some (the belligerent man and his girlfriend) are racist; his girlfriend/wife cannot fathom why he does some things, leading to gross miscommunication for which their daughter suffers.

That's the primary scenario I had in mind. Another may be that he has trouble with empathy because of his upbringing, meaning he doesn't understand interactions that don't have an obvious logic to them, or interactions that require he intuit an underlying context. It could also be that he's racist, and assumes everyone that looks different speaks a different language; even if that person speaks his language, he'll think it was another one and his brain won't process the information.

****** Ahh. (Thank you!)

Word of God: The belligerent man was indeed speaking a different language from the one being used.

Secret Narrator-Bypassing Word of God: The narrator and the belligerent man were both visibly Caucasian. The others in that location were not, and (not including the belligerent man) were aware that the narrator had sworn a solemn oath not to use his native language while in that country for the purpose of language improvement through complete immersion. After the language being used was rejected by the belligerent man, the narrator requested third-party explanation to the man due to understanding what was being said, but {feeling bound to not}/{being unwilling to} use the same language to reply.

******* Definitely an interesting theory of mind exercise, thank you. Did the facebook kerfuffle happen for similar reasons?

******** Maybe, but probably not--you can think of those three as being native speakers of neither language (from a third or different countries). The focus there is more on the reaction to the language unfamiliarity and the stubbornness of not making the first move twice (as with the drinks-seller).
