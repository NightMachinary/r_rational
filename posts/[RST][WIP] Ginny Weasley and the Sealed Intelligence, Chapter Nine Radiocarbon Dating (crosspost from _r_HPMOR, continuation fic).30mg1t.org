** Well, there's the sealed intelligence.

Is it just me or is the writing in this chapter especially... stilted? Raw? Especially around conversations, there is very little description beyond the words.

It reads like a script. It's hard to get a sense of characterization like that.

*** I think that's been a thing since the beginning. This chapter doesn't seem any different, honestly.

** punny chapter title :D

  The world around Ginny looked exactly like a godless world would

Not really. Magic, phoenixes, ghosts, hints of afterlife (the magic burst at death), the lack of parsimonious explanations for anything... if there is indeed an afterlife and no death is truly permanent, a benevolent human-valued God might easily have designed this world. The Harry Potter universe bears all the signs of having been created, and a lot of the really good atheist arguments aren't valid within it.

With respect to the philosophy, what Ginny /hasn't/ really thought about is why it matters, which is the first thing a Slytherin would think. In a world clearly governed by lots of powers and hidden mechanisms, what difference does it make to her, right now, if there is a higher power or not? That's just one more secret in a larger big bundle of secrets that is the magical world. Instrumentally, it only really matters with respect to ending Death, and Ginny hasn't been faced with that yet.

Draco isn't the type to kill Ginny on purpose, I think. But he also doesn't give artifacts without motive. I suppose the diary might manipulate him into handing it off if it's Riddle. I guess Draco and Luna are related, via Luna's mother... I notice there are many prematurely dead people who have owned that box. Sinister. If the box is a metaphor for AI, I think we can assume its been directing it's own passage from hand to hand.

** How come this belongs in the rational subreddit?

What makes this a rational story?
