** Hahahahaha it's gonna be /really/ hard to disentangle Quirrel's character from Lex because of his new voice. They are admittedly fairly similar, the biggest difference being the number of shits they give about the human race. I'll probably get used to it though.

Sound effects and background noise are absolutely top notch though.
