** Btw, do you have plans for adding transcripts to your podcasts?

*** No, it's too much work. I actually tried transcribing our first episode as a test (and because it's one that I think is useful whenever the topic of "What is rational fiction" comes up). It took me about half an hour to transcribe the first six minutes. My efficiency would probably go up over time, but some of the episodes are long enough that it would take me four to five hours to complete the transcript even if I were proficient. The ROI is pretty terrible.

Maybe if auto-transcription technology improves enough that it wouldn't be a nightmare of picking through the errors it leaves behind? But that's a ways off yet, and my initial tests did not have great results, especially given how often we talk about things that aren't in the dictionary.

*** I've been thinking about sending a call out to the audience at some point asking people interested in contributing to each pick one episode to transcribe, maybe for some audio credit or a promotion of their work or something they're interested in. The professional pace of audio transcription is something like 1 hour of work for 15 minutes of audio, so [[/u/alexanderwales]] wasn't actually doing too bad, but assuming a similar level of inexperience it would take people about 3-5 hours of work to do each episode.

Paying people is also an option, but financially the podcast isn't a money maker, and anything we'd be able to afford would be such a pittance for the time investment that I'd worry it would feel more insulting than anything. Maybe someday.

***** Thanks for pointing that out :) $1 a minute gets pretty pricey for a project with such little income, but it's good to know what a professional rate is.

Some quick and rough math says it would cost about $1,500 to get all the current episodes done, but it might be a good investment for a few of the most popular ones, to help draw interest in.

****** The "What is Rational Fiction" is the one that I most want a transcript for, because the topic comes up /a lot/. I might finish my transcription of it if I'm in the right mindset some night.
