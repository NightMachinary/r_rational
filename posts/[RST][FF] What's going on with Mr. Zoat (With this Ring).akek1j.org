Here's the lowdown. I was hanging out in the Polyhistor Academy thread on Questionable Questing, and to my surprise I saw a banner message about Mr. Zoat moving to QQ. Upon further investigation, it seems he received an indefinite suspension from the Sufficient Velocity message board.

I'm pretty sure there's a modest following of With this Ring readers on this subreddit, so I thought I'd ask here. It's been a while since I read the story, but I usually leave it alone for long periods of time before catching up. From what I remember it was a fairly rationalist story. The main character, Paul, is known for being extremely self-aware about what he wants, and he makes meticulous plans to achieve his goals.

From what I can tell, Mr. Zoat got in trouble with the SV mods for misusing LGBT terminology, or something about "Apache Attack Helicopter" sexuality? I'm not entirely sure.

Anyone have a good idea about what exactly happened?


** There's a section of Sufficient Velocity rules (Rule 2) which prohibits misgendering. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-rules-and-procedures-of-sufficient-velocity.40100/#post-8912695][Here:]]

#+begin_quote
  We expect, for example, that you will gender everyone appropriately. We expect that you will not refer to anyone by what might reasonably be considered a slur: don't use “retard”, “japs”, or “traps”, for example.
#+end_quote

Zoat fell afoul of that (and claims that he didn't know it existed). As part of /With this Ring/, a character was turned from a man into a woman by some kind of magic, and was misgendered in the narration ... which might have been fine, but Zoat then said (non-story) that he defined people by what genitals and secondary sex characteristics they had. He also used the "sexually identify as an attack helicopter" meme. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11965536/][You can read the staff response here.]] Especially:

#+begin_quote
  So how does this relate to 'attack helicopters' or 'trap'?

  Put at its most bald, they're both deeply insulting ways to refer to transgender people.

  The attack helicopter phrasing casts something very real and important as both trivial and absurd; the best case is that it is a mindless 'joke', a repetition of malicious mockery by someone who didn't realize that was what it is.

  But even in that best case, it serves to drive out people who have done nothing wrong and who should expect and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. And we don't want people being driven out, so it's covered by Rule 2.
#+end_quote

Zoat wasn't banned for this, he was suspended for a day. When he came back, he proceeded to do the exact same thing that got him suspended in the first place, which got him indefinitely suspended and the thread locked.

*I would appreciate if people don't attempt to relitigate this here.*

************ I think the proper analogy would be:

A person who does not post/leave home won't get banned/mugged.

The more often you're outside/you post, the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark/offend a mod.

The more often you go to dark alleys/SB and SV, there more you risk, as the muggers/mods are more vicious there.

One can give the mugger his valuables when confronted/ be civil, follow the rules, and take his lumps when he and the mods don't agree, and then he probably wont be beaten up/banned.

​

See? I too can make up loaded analogies.

​

I insist that "Zoat asshole, Zoat hissy fit" is a childishly simplistic view of the situation.

To me it looks like:

1. Zoat is more active, so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal;
2. Zoat is a bit abrasive, so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur;
3. SV and SB mods are power tripping, SB mods more than SV ones;

You seem to think Zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly, completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly.

​

Also, at which odds are you ready to take a bet that Zoat will receive next ban before Eaglejarl does? 10:1? 100:1?

The point to my original comment, way back when, is that if you remove “Zoat is abrasive” (If that's what you want to call it) then the other two factors don't stand on their own. That is, Zoat's own personality contributed to this affair, just as it did on SB, and, if it is possible to be suspended for anything

10:1, up to $100:$10, on the conditions that (1) the money is donated to the Against Malaria Foundation or another Giving What We Can-supported nonprofit and (2) EagleJarl doesn't mind, because it feels skeevy to make a bet on somebody who I respect, without getting that person's approval.

I've never been banned from any site, and I don't think of myself as particularly virtuous. The rules of SV essentially boil down to "be respectful to each other". It's not hard, and it's your obligation to know what the rules of the site are if you get an account there, just like it's your obligation to know the rules of the road if you want to drive.

And the more active you are, the more likely your activity to attract attention, including negative attention.

As a general rule, lurkers hardly ever get banned.

I also think your perception of SV rules is too optimistic. Or, at least, the way the rules are enforced in practice.

SV has a long history of questionable, to put it mildly, decisions by their moderators. In particular, SV's rule enforcement is not even-handed or consistent in the slightest.

The likelihood of getting banned is highly correlated with user activity.

- Lurkers are almost never banned, because they are not posting anything.
- People like me, who are moderately active, have higher likelihood of getting a ban than lurkers.
- People like eaglejarl, who is much more active online than I am, are even more likely to get a ban.
- Zoat is completely in league of his own, because he is ridiculously active online, which also means he has the highest probability of getting banned out of all of us, all else being equal.

Eaglejarl was never banned. Zoat was banned twice. I think the difference in online activity level alone is sufficient to explain that.

Usually all is fine, but sometimes moderators get into a strange mood and ban people with little or no provocation. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen, and fanfiction communities, such as SV and SB, are more prone to such drama than other online communities.

I got 25 points for being a little snotty n that same thread; it wasn't unfair, although I think it would have been just as reasonable to make it a warning instead. Aside from that, I've seen plenty of warnings that did not carry consequences and all of the cases I've seen that did have consequences were entirely reasonable.

- asserting that it may have been a mistake to concede the "obvious common sense" exceptions to free speech like exhortations to violence

** In one of the latest chapters, a character gets put in a female body. Another character goes through a whole thought process and decides 'Now he's in a female body, I'm gonna start calling him /she/'.

This isn't by itself a problem - there's a lot of ways that kind of misgendering could be played, opportunities for realisation and character growth down the road. Even if it's never addressed, it's still 'a character' thinking it.

The problem was that Zoat immediately doubled down in the thread itself, growing increasingly anti-trans, increasingly defensive about it and, yes, pulling out the old 'I sexually identify as an attack helicopter' chestnut as a defence [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/page-508#post-11963172][in this final comment]].

When it's the /author/ saying this kind of thing in threads rather than a character they're writing, it becomes a problem for the forum, and they get treated as any other person would for making comments like that in a thread. Zoat then threw a hissy fit over the temporary suspension, upped sticks to Questionable Questing, and claimed he was being oppressed for writing a story where a character misgenders someone.

This isn't the first time he's pulled the martyrdom schtick. On SpaceBattles he accrued a whole bunch of infraction points for not covering his spoilers in a Star Wars thread. He then receives a final infraction point for posting risque art of a succubus in a place he shouldn't have, putting him over the total to receive a one-day suspension. Cue hissy fit and claims that he was being 'banned' by SB because the admins were a bunch of prudes. That's how WTR ended up on SV in the first place.

*** What is so offensive about the "attack helicopter" meme?

The way I interpret it, it's like this. Look, if I could be in a different body, I'd choose to have the cloned body of an 18 year old female beauty pageant winner. Because I know I would receive the best treatment possible by society, and also I know I'd enjoy just looking at my own reflection.

​

But reality is not that way. I can't have that, the laws of nature don't allow this without vastly more advanced technology than our civilization currently has.

​

Similarly, I can see the appeal of having a fully armed and armored attack helicopter as a body.

​

So I can't reasonably demand that society treat me, both in gender pronouns and what they put on my driver's license and what they say behind my back, as the 18 year old beauty queen. Or treat me as if I'm actually an attack helicopter.

​

Since we can't actually turn men into women or vice versa with anything like a reasonable or reliable success, that's kind of how it is today. Most transgender people are sort of asking for special favors to be treated as something they are not.

** Yeah. After the first time ever there wasn't a new chapter waiting for me in the morning, I looked into it. Basically, the current plot threat involved a MacGuffin of gender-bending. Paul and Zoat are apparently gender essentialists, or something, it's strange. The character was a man changed into a woman, and Paul uses female pronouns while calling the character "Mr. LastName". There was discussion in the thread about it, and Zoat basically said "If you're full of woman parts, you are currently a woman, even if you'd like to be a man, even if you used to be a man, even if you'd like to be an attack helicopter". He was a bit confrontational, but things had gotten nowhere near flame war, or hateful attacks, etc. But apparently this was enough for the SV mods to drop the banhammer, in what struck me as rather overreacting.

So now the story has moved to QQ.

I think that SV's rules on transphobic speech clearly prioritize sticking to a given ideology over free speech (you're essentially not allowed to say that you have conservative opinions on identity issues), which, y'know, is fair, not every place needs to be SlateStarCodex.

But Mr Zoat was clearly in the wrong here. The "I identify as a attack helicopter" meme is /not okay/. It's not innocent, it's an-injoke that clearly sends a message of contempt and mockery. It's a way to code "I don't care about transgender issues and I think their beliefs are ridiculous and childish" in a short sentence. Using it in the middle of a discussion about gender identity is equivalent to posting Barack Obama's face photoshopped on a monkey in the middle of an US politics discussion.

Personally I think it's a dumb and petty thing not to call a transgendered person what they want to be called, so long as it's not something so ridiculous that it's clear they're just messing with you (ex: if someone actually did request for you to call them attack helicopter... yeah that'd be ridiculous).

But there's a huge difference between telling a woman "You're a man" than telling them "You don't deserve to exist".

The whole concept of gender being different than sex is a relatively new thing (in the public consciousness) and I at least understand the desire to keep things simple and define gender by physical attributes rather than a person's self-image. It's a natural thing to want everything to be easily categorized.

And honestly if it wasn't for the fact that people feel so strongly about it, I too would like to categorize people simply based on their physical features. It would just be easier and make dealing with people less confusing overall.

But I think realistically, the downside of having more complexity in dealing with pronouns with people you don't know yet are outweighed by the upside of the people who self-identify as a gender different than their sex feeling comfortable. If it's a choice between simplicity and someone's self-esteem, I think the right choice is generally to help that person's self-esteem. Especially when we're merely talking about semantics.

Also... I think I kinda got off topic. The main thing I was trying to explain is that it's possible to hold the views that Mr. Zoat seems to hold without necessarily being transphobic or even disliking trans people. You just have to have values that prefer linguistic simplicity over a group of individuals' comfort... which I think, all things considered, is dumb and petty as I said before.

That's just a difference in definition. It's not denying the person's personal experience, it's just denying that that personal experience should inform the definition of that person's gender.

It's really an argument of semantics, not an argument about anything intrisinc to the person's character. The definition of the person themselves stays the same regardless of what you call them.

I'm not saying that definitions are unimportant, but the words themselves do not have intrinsic value.

So if I called you an "Snoopite" but I defined the word snoopite as "anyone who uses reddit", I don't think you can say that I'm misrepresenting you, nor can you necessarily claim that I hate or fear all people from reddit.

I don't think these two statements are much different from each other. That wasn't my point. My point was simply that "not thinking you're a man" doesn't mean that they're necessarily discriminating against that person or group of people, which is generally what a phrase such as "transphobic" describes.

Bigotry is probably a better word than transphobic for this interaction. Bigotry implies an unwillingness to change your views. Transphobia implies discomfort or outright hostility to trans people which is not what we're seeing. But honestly, even bigotry has some extra connotations that don't really fit what's happening here.

As I said before, I do think you're right that these views are ultimately not good. And they definitely can be harmful to people's mental image of themselves.

But if you look at this objectively, no one is being oppressed by this. No one is having rights taken away from them. No one is being assaulted or (IMO) even verbally abused.

It's harmful because using language like this has the potential to hurt someone's feelings. But not having your feelings hurt isn't an inalienable right. It's just inconsiderate and unnecessary to call someone a gender other than what they would like to be called.

I agree there's nothing wrong with pointing this behavior out and calling people out for it. I just disagree that you can conclude that anyone who does this is transphobic without further context.

I disagree. When Zoat expressed those opinions, he wasn't expressing them in a vacuum. Trans people are actively discriminated against in employment, housing, etc; they're disproportionately likely to be homeless because of the above-mentioned discrimination in combination with parental rejection; and their rights are constantly under threat (e.g. the bathroom debacle, the military thing). People who intentionally misgender trans folks because they "disagree" normalize the idea that they're deluded/lying, and in so doing, help to foster a climate where more serious forms of discrimination are viewed as acceptable. Little things add up.

I would also argue that intentionally misgendering someone /is/ verbal abuse; it's hurtful speech, that's what verbal abuse is. And I think that reducing the direct harm it does to "hurt feelings" trivializes gender dysphoria, but that's territory I'll leave to trans folks to speak on.

********** I agree that some people (maybe even the majority of people for all I know) who use language like that do engage in discriminatory practices.

But you can't conclude that any single person doing this is also practicing discrimination.

As I've said, I agree this type of language isn't helping anyone. It's ultimately a bad thing. But it's not discrimination in and of itself.

As for this being verbal abuse here's wikipedia's definition:

#+begin_quote
  Verbal abuse (verbal attack or verbal assault) is when a person forcefully criticizes, insults, or denounces someone else.[1] Characterized by underlying anger and hostility, it is a destructive form of communication intended to harm the self-concept of the other person and produce negative emotions.
#+end_quote

I think you can at best make a weak case for it being verbal abuse based on the fact that it can harm a person's self-concept. But the fact that it's not necessarily intended to do so makes me think it doesn't fit the definition.

I imagine many people who call a person only by the gender which matches their sex feel as if they're simply stating a fact. "They have a penis, so they're a man". They're not saying it to hurt the person. They're just saying it because to them it's the truth, and they refuse to lie in order to spare someone's feeling.

I've honestly thought this way myself in the past (though I was never bad enough to say this to a trans person's face). There was no ill intent with these thoughts, just the idea that a person can't change the truth of what they physically are.

I've since come to realize that it really is just an argument of semantics. And since the semantics mean absolutely nothing to me, but are very important to some people, there is no harm in changing the definition of man to be "A person who identifies as a male" for non-medical purposes.

My point being simply that, it's completely possible to think the way Mr. Zoat thinks without any ill intent towards anyone. And the harm caused by calling someone a gender they don't identify with can be entirely unintended and non-malicious.

That doesn't erase the harm itself. But that also doesn't mean the person who is causing the harm is doing so because they're transphobic or have any intent to hurt anyone.

It wasn't my intention to say that being treated this way can't be deeply hurtful to a transperson. But you can't control other people's word choices and actions so long as they are not illegal. People say hurtful things to each other all time, whether intentionally or not. Sometimes people are affected by them much more deeply than others. I don't think this situation is particularly different, other than the fact that it deals with a sensitive topic.

*************** (disclaimer: the downvote wasn't from me)

I don't think it's really that inconvenient to call people by their preferred pronouns based on how they introduce themselves and (less importantly) other external signals of their gender, like style of dress, hair, etc, as opposed to based on biological characteristics. I mean...I might see where you were coming from if it were standard practice to figure out people's pronouns by pulling their pants down to check out their junk. In that case, there'd have to be a whole societal shift away from that method of identification. But in practice, it's the norm to address people according to how they present themselves, and transphobes add this weird invasive extra step of wanting to know what kind of chromosomes or genitalia you have.

It's true that calling trans people by their pronouns isn't universally accepted yet. Respecting interracial or gay partnerships also wasn't always universally accepted, yet we now recognize that it was shitty to denigrate those relationships even when that was the norm. It's the same for respecting trans identities. Hurting and dehumanizing people is wrong, always. Humans just happen to be really good at rationalizing why it's totally okay /this/ time.

As for the fundamentalist christian comparison, it's not the same thing. Teaching evolution is in a way an attack on their faith, but it's not an attack on their /identities./ I would teach evolution in a classroom, but I would not teach that fundamentalist christians are lying or deluded about their subjective experience of faith. I wouldn't say "you're not really a believer." In the same vein, if I met a Christian who had converted to Judaism, I would not insist on continuing to call them a Christian.

#+begin_quote
  You're not claiming you have different biology
#+end_quote

I see this misconception a lot. Trans people in no way claim to have different biology than they have. They are /agonizingly/ aware of the particulars of their biology. What trans people are saying is that their gender identity doesn't align with their physical sex characteristics. This mismatch causes psychological distress which can be alleviated by social, and sometimes medical, transition.

I'll add that there's nothing implausible about that misalignment. We already know that there are intersex people with "mismatching" sex characteristics, because the process of sex differentiation involves a lot of complex branching mechanisms that can individually go awry. If someone can have XY chromosomes and a vulva, why can't someone else have a vulva and a male brain?

There is no /one way/ trangender people dress. Even if you go with the most obvious dresses on men thing, crossdressers are a thing.

Gender identity almost certainly has a neurological basis. It's a mental characteristic, so there has to be some circuitry in there somewhere that represents whether you feel like a man or a woman. /That circuitry,/ whatever it is, is not biologically required to be accompanied by a penis, even though there are biological mechanisms in place that typically yield a male gender identity to go along with a penis.

  No, I really don't think the penis is a part of the thought process for most people. "Masculine body type," sure. But there are cis woman with more masculine-looking bodies and cis men with more feminine-looking bodies, and people typically understand that and go by how you introduce yourself...unless they're mad about trans people, at which point suddenly they must know your genital configuration.

I said earlier that if I thought someone had a penis, I'd treat them that way. If someone looks like a woman and says to call her a man, that's when the arguments start.

*********************** Briefly coming back to this after giving my hand time to recover, to point out one quick thing: Misgendering trans people is /not/ treating them the same way as everyone else. We don't misgender everyone else. We show everyone else the basic, minimal respect of addressing them by the names and pronouns with which they identify.

I get that your argument here is "if we call everyone by pronouns corresponding to their genitals, then we're treating everyone the same." When I was an awful child trying to impress my conservative parents, I used the same argument in opposition to gay marriage: "We're not denying gay people any rights, because they have the same right that straight people do: to marry someone of the opposite sex!" Which obviously completely misses the point, in exactly the same way that your argument does. That's all.

  True, but it's a cultural matter of whether biology or self-concept is what determines whether you're called a man or woman. Currently the predominant deciding factor is biology, and while that may change in the future I doubt it due to the sheer inconvenience associated with it.
#+end_quote

First, there are [[https://www.the-scientist.com/features/are-the-brains-of-transgender-people-different-from-those-of-cisgender-people-30027][documented biological differences]] between cis men and pre-conversion trans women. They may be neurological, rather than the visible sexually dimorphic traits (i.e. genitalia) you seem to be referring to, but the fact that the traits are less immediately visible doesn't mean that they're less rooted in biology.

Second, even if I accept the narrow definition of "biology" that you're presenting (spoiler: I don't), the culture of the place in which Mr Zoat was posting is /explicitly/ one where gender is not determined by genitalia, so even by your own rationale, his behaviour was unacceptable.

That's the predominant usage because, for the overwhelming majority of people, all three things line up: male brain/penis/XY chromosome, or female brain/vagina/XX chromosome.

The problem with reducing people to a simple dichotomy like that is that those things /don't/ always line up. Not only does the brain not match the genitalia or the chromosomes, but sometimes the genitalia and the chromosomes don't match each other, or don't even fall into one of those two categories!

A proper society should not be okay with mistreating the few because they are outnumbered by the many. Especially not when the solution is as simple as addressing someone according to their brain's biology rather than something you generally can't even see if they're wearing clothes.

Trans people have made it clear that misgendering /hurts/ them. While there's certainly a difference between slipping up by using the wrong gender and deliberately doing so, I don't see a moral distinction between whether you deliberately continue to do it because you hate and/or fear them, or because you just don't care enough to put in the effort to not hurt them.

This might be hurtful to that person (which is why I think you might as well call them whatever they want) but to say it's transphobic just because you're of a different opinion of what the word "gender" means is a bit much.

**** There's no indication that Zoat fears or hates trans people. Insisting on using referents based on physical characteristics rather than self-identification is /kinda dickish/, but I suspect the vehement backlash that stance generates is precisely /because/ that stance has no good answer to the "attack helicopter" meme. Let's discuss it with a subject that isn't so heated.

There's a guy I saw on some television show like 60 Minutes, years and years ago, who considered himself to be a cat. This man had gotten a bunch of plastic surgery done, cat-like facial tattoos, whiskers installed in his cheeks. The end result looked absolutely freakish, but that's besides the point. Obviously pointing and laughing and calling him mean names would be atrocious behavior, but would you consider referring to him as "human" to be hateful bigotry? I called him a "man" instead of a "tom", would you accept that I should be subject to negative consequences? Do you think that person was mentally ill? Do you think /any discussion/ of his mental health is beyond the pale?

Zoat's stance seemed to be that the tom was a human male with some plastic surgery and facial tattoos. Zoat would fully support his efforts to magically or technologically turn into a cat, but would not consent to considering him a cat while he was still physically a bipedal ape. Would this instance be sufficient for you to consider Zoat a transphobe? Would that be "saying his existence is invalid"?

I /don't/ think Zoat's stance is beyond the pale of acceptable behavior. Frankly, getting that angry at people who are supportive of the desire to transition, but won't change their terminology until a change is actually made, seems like throwing away support. I suspect that the extremely strong negative reactions that stance generates are largely because some people who feel strongly about trans rights know, on some level, that their epistemological grounds are rather shaky.

For the record, I consider all of this /sad/, and would make reasonable efforts to be accommodating in the event I ever encounter a trans person in my actual life. But the mod behavior there seems to be on the same tier as a rule against saying a fetus isn't a person. "Or, y'know, you can just not support murder" would be a kind of an ill-tempered response, if that were the topic of discussion, no?

***** The attitude of "I won't accept/acknowledge your gender until you've medically transitioned" is directly harmful to:

1. Trans people who aren't in a position to medically transition because of their age, finances, location, or unrelated health issues;

2. Trans people who, for personal reasons, only wish to transition socially and not medically.

It also perpetuates a societal preoccupation with genitals over personhood that's broadly harmful to trans people regardless of their state of medical transition.

I'm not trans, so it's not my place to reject the "support" of folks who claim to be okay with trans people as long as they jump through the right set of hoops. But my perception is that said "support" is just harm with a veil of plausible deniability draped over it. A good ally would listen to the people they're theoretically supporting and acknowledge their descriptions of their internal experiences, instead of trying to force their own preconceptions on them.

I don't think the cat thing is a reasonable comparison. Gender identity is a mental characteristic, and a human brain can be a man's brain or a woman's brain, but there's no such thing as a human brain that's a cat's brain.

And honestly, if someone actually really did come up to and claim that they identified as a helicopter or hell, even your example of the man who thinks is his a cat then I'll do my best. I'll try to accommodate him in that way when and if I meet him, and if that means to refer to him as a cat because that is how he wants to be known I can do that for him.

And yes we can have a discussion of his mental health, that discussion is "How can we help him feel comfortable in his own skin?" Going through life feeling trapped that way must be terrible, and I think a big part of transhumanism, a topic we write and share a lot of fiction about here, is about ways we can help people like him down the road. Sure we don't have that technology now but there are other simple things we can do, like /acknowledging that this person is different/ and treating them with respect anyway. Because if a sentient attack helicopter actually existed I think it would be deserving of respect.

No, really, I have a problem with this, because a bunch of jerks used /my/ identity to troll trans people, resulting in a bunch of activists declaring that I do not exist. That coming from allies is painful.

(Paul outright said he hates <mygroup> early on. Outside of a couple comments, it hasn't really come up, and in practice, he hasn't actually acted like this is as true as being his inner monologue would suggest. Also I'm kinda use to people who express such hate (their wordchoice) being easier to get along with. Among those who seem more accepting is where the drama lies (weirdly gendered drama, now that I think of it). So, in practice, I tolerate Zoat in spite of this, and the pronoun thing (which bothers me more just because it's not a blink-and-you'll-miss-it comment). Somehow, it seems like what side one claims is not very well correlated with what side one most helps/harms. Humans are weird.)

We can draw all sorts of lines about which claims we take how seriously, but if we're going to be honest, we have to admit that any line is going to be at least somewhat arbitrary.

But I really have seen many people (cis, of course) that live with the gender role society assigned them without it actually mattering in a significant way, and feel like they would be completely ambivalent to a magical sex change (if not disrupting current relationships, or adding other hardships).

But at some point a weak enough gender identity is effectively the same thing as none. Some of these really do seem to go that far.

Instead it really is gender not mattering to their identity. These people go "eh, whatever" for any gender assignment. They know the gender role that society assigns them, obviously, and might be bemused if someone uses another, but it's not important to them, and wouldn't feels like an attack (or maybe feels like an irrelevant, failed attack).

********** I don't "feel like a gender".

My experience of gender is that it's a socially constructed fact, similar to citizenship, or eye-color-bucket

The social construction might typically draw boundaries based on brute facts (eg. biology, gps coordinates of my birth place, wavelengths reflected by by eyes), but the social category isn't the brute fact.

We notice the distinction between social-category and brute fact because we could trivially redraw the boundaries of these social clusters by agreement. If everyone agrees, it's perfectly possible to say stuff like, "men are people who self-describe as men, plus anyone who hasn't stated a preference and has with XYZ biological traits," or "American citizens are people who are born in the continental US, except Steve, because fuck Steve."

I can talk about the consequences of being categorized as male. Just like I can talk about the consequences of having a US passport, or the treatment I get based on eye color.

I can imagine having a preference for US vs Canadian citizenship, or liking the social role of a woman more of less than the social role of a man.

But it's not clear what it would mean to have an intrinsically "American" or "male" feeling outside of this social categorization. Even if I felt something distinguishable from "being me" how would I know that Donald Trump feels identically, but that Theresa May does not? I don't have access to their minds.

Other people could have other ways of knowing that I'm not privy to. And that's fine. But there's something alienating about being informed that an experience is universal.

Maybe "practically universal" wasn't the right phrasing, but I hope you understand what I'm saying. Gender identity is a thing, even if it's not universal.

************ Why shouldn't I believe people who say they have a machine fetish? That's a thing. And it's a thing that's not super-surprising when I learn that other people have tastes unlike mine.

Next, how are you not misgendering me?

Coming into this conversation, my view is that gender is a socially-created cluster that's often -- but not always -- correlated with brute facts. We can experience brute facts. We can experience treatment that depends on social categorization. But we can't directly experience social category, as that's a mental process outside our heads.

This definition means that I identify as male, even though I don't feel any experience that's intrinsically "male." People can be wrong about my gender just like they're mistaken if they say I'm French.

You're proposing a definition where people's gender is defined based on an inner experience. People who feel X are male, people who feel Y are female, and people who feel neither are agender.

While you're entitled to that definition, the obvious consequence (even if you're kind enough to not rub my nose in it) is that I'm "really" agender, even though I identify as male.

That's not necessarily wrong; I've heard stories of gay people who thought they were straight. But it's certainly a surprising thing to be informed.

And the follow up question is: What mental traits, specifically, are core to the experience of masculinity that I seem to be lacking? What are core feminine mental traits?

If gender is intrinsic (and not dependent on social categorization) then these can't depend on the society around us. And if it's body independent then they're not physical sensations, or dismorphia.

I can think of some traits that are correlated with gender, but I can't fathom how someone would populate a list of Definitively Male inner experiences without sounding like a sexist.

See, it's not dickish, it's cruel. I'm cis, so I can't speak to the experience personally, but everything I know (and also common sense) says that transitioning is a difficult process that takes a lot of time, money, and effort and has a lot of social pressure against it that will bring you a lifetime of insults. Making an explicit choice to not use the person's chosen pronouns is saying that their choice is not important, that they're just being ridiculous, that all of the things that made them transition in the first place don't matter.

It's like going out of your way to tell a devout Christian that their god almost certainly doesn't exist and that's a good thing because the Bible portrays Her as a slavery-endorsing, genocidal monster. That Christianity has contributed a little value to the world (beautiful buildings and artwork) but on the whole it's been a blight on humanity (pedophilia, Crusades, anti-science, wars caused by political schism, etc) and it's a really good thing that as people get more educated religion is falling away.

Do you think there's no situation where this is the case? Plenty of mockery falls into this category, and the (obvious and reasonable) refusal to honor such pronouns means that we're clearly not working off some universally applicable principle here. So again, how do we justify condemning people whose standards for using another persons chosen pronouns are a /little bit higher/ than your own?

Maybe this is a function of the particulars of my own beliefs, but I see this issue in general as one of /marginal differences/ rather than /immutable categories/, and I don't feel justified in condemnation for even moderate differences in the margins.

The current politically correct stance is "the problem is with the body", but I don't see it as /obvious/ that "the problem is with the mind" is /wrong/. The former aligns better with my views of mental versus bodily identity, but mental illness is always going to strain that. Would it be morally wrong to cure a schizophrenic? You'd be forcibly changing their mental state, functionally killing the person who was there before. "Would it be better for trans people to take a magic potion that removed the dysphoria, but left the body intact" strikes me as the same /general category/ of moral/philosophical question. Is it customary to address schizophrenics as "Your Imperial Majesty"?

  There. See? I was a complete jerk for no good reason. I went out of my way to be offensive. Do you wish that I wouldn't say such things? Do you wish that I would be removed from this conversation until such time as I could learn to express basic respect towards others? That's how, from what I understand, trans people feel about deliberate misgendering backed up with attack helicopter memes.
#+end_quote

No, I'm an atheist, and I'm fine with you expressing your view with no negative consequences. I'd also be fine with you expressing "atheism is a religion too". And more to the point, I see that sort of commentary /all the fucking time/ in the sort of communities that care a great deal about kindness towards trans people. Which is exactly why I find the "how dare you invalidate my beliefs and claimed experience" stuff to be hypocritical. It's certainly not /beyond question/ that the religious person's claimed, internal spiritual experiences are meaningfully real, why should other people's be so privileged? "This is my experience, believe me or not, I stand by my convictions" is one thing. "This is my experience, failing to validate it in any way makes you a /vile monster/" is rather different.

Gender dysphoria is a mental illness in the sense that people suffer depression and distress because of it. That doesn't mean you should go out of your way to make life harder for them.

You are describing a false dichotomy. If I print out a picture at a particular size and buy a picture frame but the picture frame but the picture doesn't fit in the picture frame then the problem is that they are mismatched. The issue isn't that the frame is wrong and the picture is fine. The issue isn't that the picture is fine but the frame is correct. The problem is that they don't match. I could change either the frame or picture to match the other and it wouldn't matter unless there was a specific preference for a particular size.

In the case of transgender individuals changing their body and/or social role can be done but we don't have a magic pill for making them happy with their natural body. The question isn't whether you accept their presentation or change their minds. The question is whether you accept their presentation or push them towards depression and eventual suicide.

​

You shouldn't compare transgender people to schizophrenics. Being transgender does not mean being delusional. Transgender individuals do not believe they have genitalia they do not. Also because psychotic individuals are not qualified to make their own medical decisions.

​

Your mental state is forcibly changed all the time by experiences. The person "you" were 5 years ago is gone. The person that is reading this right now will also be gone in time.

​

If there was a magic mind altering pill for transgender individuals then I would expect some would take it for practical reasons and others would abstain for personal or ideological reasons. If there was a magic mind pill that made people straight then I would also expect similar results for gay and lesbian people. Note: Practical reasons can also include to avoid getting lynched.

**** The ban had nothing to do with what was in the story. SV is very clear about understanding that the attitude of characters does not necessarily reflect that of the author. Yes, there are content types that will get you banned, but this wasn't it.

Zoat got banned for things he said in the thread, where he went out of his way to engage with the discussion in offensive, thoughtless, demeaning ways. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11961586/][This]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11963172/][this]] being particular examples. tl;dr, the essence of what he said was "Transsexuals are just being ridiculous. Your genitals determine your gender and trying to call yourself by other pronouns is a delusion that I am not going to bother caring about."

SV has an explicit [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8912695/][policy against misgendering]]. ("We expect, for example, that you will gender everyone appropriately.") This was an absolutely clear violation of it, so he was given 50 infraction points, which is the minimum that you can get for actually clearly violating a rule.[1] That comes with a 24-hour tempban. Mr. Zoat then flipped out about how unfair it was to be held to the clearly-stated standard that he'd never bothered to read and how he wasn't going to tolerate anything that would make him break his streak of posting every day -- which a 24 hour ban would not do -- so he took his ball and went home...after posting one last [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/page-520]["f* you" to the moderators]], which earned him a permanent ban.

My advice to all authors who publish their stories somewhere they don't control: have your story's original source at your home.

Never, ever should you publish a story online without keeping backups.

Literally insane moderators are more common than you think, and your content may be removed (and you banned) at any moment and with no warning.

Keep backups of your content. Don't expect people on the Internet (site moderators included) to behave reasonably.
