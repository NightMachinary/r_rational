** "Never did a mythology invent such a huge Universe. And this Cosmos is infinitely more beautiful, more terrifying, infinitely deeper and more exciting than any divinity."

It's about a fifteen-minute read. I promise you that you have time.

** They say the sky is Terra Incognito. Terra means earth though. Can someone with latin knowledge help out here? Caelum Incognito?

*** I actually used "Caelum Incognito" in another project :) Yes, Terra means Earth (we say "Terre" for "Earth", in french)

But in this context, I would have said it means "Land". The expression "Terra Incognita" is mostly used for "unexplored territory".

I already met the expression refering symbolically to knowledge, fields of research, and even refering to "a new love story" :)

*** The direct latin translation would be something like "unknown land". The phrase was used on maps in Ye Olden Times, to refer to the western continents beyond the oceans; because of the mystique North America held to the people of Europe in those days, the phrase itself became heavily romanticized. So the usage in the story isn't calling from a direct Latin translation; it's tapping into that romanticized connotation.
