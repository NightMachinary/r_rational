What a lot of people don't know is that /Star Wars/ is a reflection (and refinement) of the cheesy space serials that George Lucas grew up on, as was /Indiana Jones/. The movies introduced a new generation to a lot of tropes and science fictional aesthetics that had been done before in /Lensman/, /Buck Rogers/, the /Barsoom/ series, and others. Lucas was doing genre reconstruction before it was cool.

As far as rational takes on /Star Wars/, see [[http://www.rogermwilcox.com/force_skeptics.html][the Force Skeptics page]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740793/1/A-Voice-Across-the-Void][A Voice Across the Void]] by [[/u/ZoltanBerrigomo]], [[https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153845777444228][The Truth of the Sith]] by [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]] (and the [[/u/ScottAlexander]]'s [[http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/137859922776/sort-of-inspired-by-this-story-master][(sort of) riff on that]]), and my own [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction][Instruments of Destruction]]. (There are almost certainly others, but those are the ones that I remember.)

If you have other stories to recommend, or points of order to discuss (like how bullshit the Force is or how little sense lightsabers make), have at it in the comments below. *If you are going to be discussing The Force Awakens please use spoiler tags.* For anything else, use your discretion. If you somehow haven't seen the original or prequel trilogies and for some reason don't want to be spoiled, this is your cue to leave.


** Just want to toss my hat in the ring to say that Instruments Of Destruction is one of my fave fanfics I've read on [[/r/rational]]! I also love Yudkowsky and SA's fics.

** Midichlorians get a bad rap among most of the fanbase, and I'm curious to know what [[/r/rational]] readers' perspective on it is. Do you think it grounds Star Wars into being ever-so-slightly more realistic/rational, or is it just a stupid idea that clashes with the rest of the story's thematic feel?

(Note: Though they first showed up in the prequels, Lucas had originally thought them up as far back as 1977, and referenced them by name when laying out the guidelines for the Expanded Universe books. I've often wondered if they would be hated so much if they were part of the original trilogy, or if it's mostly just incidental hate due to the general awfulness of the prequels).

*** I was going to criticize the implementation of midichlorian counts on the basis that Anakin does not seem powerful enough. The fact that he lost the fight with Obi Wan suggests that Anakin's spectacularly high midichlorian count is actually kind of useless. I was surprised to find that the math kind of supports Lucas' portrayal.

It looks like there are about 1,000 systems represented in the Republic senate (rough estimate based on the number of 'seats'), and based on Naboo, Coruscant, Tatooine, etc. we can estimate that the average population of those systems is probably around 5 billion people. There are maybe 500 Jedi alive during the time of the prequels, making them about one in 10 billion.

If midichlorian count follows a bell curve, then we can expect that a typical Jedi would be about 12.5 standard deviations from the mean, in order to end up with about 500 Jedi in a republic with a population of about 5 trillion. If the Jedi council has been around for about 1,000 years, and if Jedi live an average of 100 years, and if the republic has been approximately at an equilibrium population level over the last 1,000 years, then we're looking at maybe 5,000 Jedi having existed. And Anakin has a significantly higher midichlorian count than all of them. This places his midichlorian count at somewhere around the top 1 in 500 trillion, meaning his midichlorian count would be at least 14 standard deviations from the mean.

This suggests that while Anakin would have an advantage over other Jedi, it would not necessarily be a huge advantage. His midichlorian count would only need to be about 12% farther from the mean than a typical Jedi, so it seems reasonable that Obi Wan could have still defeated him on Mustafar through advantages in training and experience.

*** I like midichlorians on a literal level, but I dislike the thematic implications - particularly the idea that force sensitivity is a strictly hereditary trait. I really hope the sequel makes clear that force->midichlorians rather than midichlorians->force. Midichlorians don't even need to come up by name to do this (since the fandom hates them so much). All that needs to happen is a clear distinction between force usage and heredity. Rey not fucking being Luke's daughter ought to go a long way towards it.

One of my hopes as well. Though isn't force sensitivity kind of implied to be hereditary from the original movies? Even if it can still surface in random people by skipping a bunch of generations, the odds of both of Anakin Skywalker's children being force sensitive in a world where genetics isn't a factor seems fairly improbable, since force sensitivity is apparently such a massively rare thing.

***** Sure, but I guess I see force sensitivity, ideally, as roughly equivalent to "importance". Not in the literal sense that all important people are force sensitive and vice versa. But in the sense that, though the children of someone important are more likely to be important, it wouldn't even be an accurate model to view "importance" as a multifactorial trait - it's more than that, not just a combination of genes and environment, but a combination of genes, environment, and /incorporeal personal woo willpower/, in that order from least to most important.

I actually have one pet idea kinda batting around the corner of my head that force sensitivity isn't passed on genetically at all, but rather through emotions - children don't receive force sensitivity from their parents because of genetic reasons, but because their parents feel very strongly about them.

****** That's a pretty interesting idea, though it has one minor problem canonically: in Empire Strikes Back, Vader seems genuinely confused about the fact that he has living children. You could say it was granted at conception or while they were in the womb, but that raises questions about unknown children from other potential couplings.

** Not a story, but I absolutely love [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/208580/][Knights of the Old Republic 2]], a game released by Obsidian over a decade ago. I wrote a little bit about why this game is so unique [[https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/comments/40w79x/recommendation_request_what_are_star_wars_stories/][here]]. Besides the usual quests that must be fulfilled, much of the game consists of conversations that advance the plot. To get a flavor of it, you can take a peek at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5w9LBcYu5g][this video]], which describes a conversation you can have (if you make a number of dark-side choices throughout the game) about a captured wookie companion.

** Although the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones are fun, high-budget movies set in traditional serial settings, I'd hesitate to call either a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction]["reconstruction"]] (tvtropes warning). Both play their silly tropes completely straight, and neither puts effort into justifying them.

Star Wars had the special effects budget to make Star Destroyers and space dogfights /look/ believable, but gravity and life support and faster-than-light travel (along with artificial intelligence, space swords and sorcery, and single-biome planets) all serve at the behest of the plot and the visuals rather than the other way around. There's no science in this fiction.

A perfect example of the appearance of believability is the aliens. They speak (and indeed some are only /capable/ of speaking) their own languages, and other characters do or do not understand those languages. Sometimes we get subtitles. At the same time all but a few breathe the same atmosphere, have the same gravitational needs, and look like humans in (sometimes elaborate) makeup and costumes. All of the major characters except Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Yoda are essentially english-speaking humans. Even C-3PO.

The extended universe has made some awkward attempts at reconstructing all of this stuff into a logical and consistent whole, but the films themselves do not. It's a genre grab bag.

I think the confusion comes from the fact that where Indiana Jones revels gleefully in its genre source material's absurdities, Star Wars tends to take itself pretty seriously... and that may be Spielberg's influence, and it may be Harrison Ford's (His is certainly the only character in Star Wars whose genre saavy strays anywhere near the fourth wall.) Everything looks realistic enough, and the characters behave realistically enough, that there's not a lot of room to pull back and see how ridiculous the fundamental conceits are.

At any rate: Where deconstruction says "no", reconstruction says how. And I would be thrilled to see a Star Wars-type universe reconstructed. I'd love to figure out how a bunch of genuinely alien intelligent beings function together politically, or how interstellar travel and access to other planets affects those politics, or how a government that spans not merely languages and cultures but /worlds/ arranges its justice system...

...and how all of this somehow involves psychic wizards.

Star Wars certainly isn't answering those questions on its own.
