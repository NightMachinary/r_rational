For ages, I've wanted to write a story about the liminal stage of the modern world discovering "magic" or "superpowers" or whatever you want to call it, that represents a massive departure from our understanding of the universe that's also almost immediately useful. Something that the entire world could potentially make use of, but at least for now, only a single person or small group of people know of.

The problem is, I'm an inexperienced writer. And more importantly, I couldn't reasonably predict how such a discovery could change humanity on the societal level. (If I could, I'd be in some highfaluting think tank.)

As such, I've determined that my best bet for writing a novel length work about this topic would be to limit the plot to a fairly limited geographic area and smaller cast of charachters, effectively reducing the number of moving parts so there's less that could break.

HPMOR limits its own scope with the statute of secrecy, but in the real world, any testable supernatural phenomena provides the immediate temptation to run straight to the Randi Foundation, or equivalent, and claim the Randi Prize before someone else can*, because if the supernatural could be discovered once, it could be discovered again. And of course, there are plenty of other ways to capitalize immediately or very quickly, whether by making an instructional website, a well-produced youtube video, a tutorial app, writing a book, whatever.

The obvious answer is the generic shady government agency/NGO route, but that's been done over and over and over again, and regardless, the idea is that the person mentioned in the story would be the very first to discover the new phenomena.

On the plus side, if I can find a good scope limiter, the plot would basically fall into place.

I don't have any specific magic system in mind yet, but it would have to be either something that wouldn't be possible to use until the modern age, or something that could plausibly be discovered, lost, and rediscovered continuously.

**** It was my immediate first thought as well; if I stumbled upon some massive secret of the universe, completely by accident, I would /not/ take for granted that I was the first to do so.

I don't know that I would go so far as to directly assume "government conspiracy," myself. It's just that if a such simple but far-reaching truth exists, but is not widely known, there may be any number of reasons it remains a secret which are less immediately obvious than the direct ramifications of the power itself.

Additionally, if I /am/ the only current holder of the secret, I'm in no rush to claim any Randi-esque prizes, and should focus on R&D until I know what advantages I could get by keeping it secret, if any. If I'm /not/ actually the sole user, claiming the prize carries risks of unknown magnitude, and I would be better off focusing on R&D until I know what advantages I could maintain in the event it /does/ go public.

Finally, if there isn't really a conspiracy of any kind in place to limit /my/ knowledge and use of the secret, then there's a narrative void I might as well fill, right? Maybe get some friends together, start my own agency, hopefully have fun with it!

***** I'd think about it like this.

Assuming I discovered magic, while I'd like to believe I'm above average, I'm nowhere near exceptional enough that I could reasonably believe I'm the only person who could have discovered it. But given that the magic would be something axiomatically only possible in the modern age (that is, I'd construct the magic system so that would be an obvious conclusion) it would be reasonable to expect that either I got to the discovery first by luck, or that other people got the discovery but where then silenced.

In the second case, I'm basically guaranteed to be boned regardless, so I might as well make it public and try to profit. In the first case, however, I have a strong incentive to go to the media, because someone else will probably discover the magic eventually, thus removing my advantage, so I might as well try to capitalize early. Of course, the "cooperate" option would be for any individual who got magic to stay silent, and thus get an advantage before the rest of the world at large catches on, but you only need one person to say "screw it, I'm going to be famous" and everyone else is thrown under a bus. It's like the prisoner's dilemma, but with no chance for coordination.

Though writing this has given me an idea, actually. Maybe I could make a magic system where all magicians become immediately aware of new magicians, and are aware that they become aware. Then there's an obvious reason to keep silent (don't get sensory overload from new magicians) and an easy way to coordinate. This bears further investigation.

***** And then what? The government, or the freemasons, or the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants just hides this incredibly useful magic without using it themselves? Either magic is useful enough to, you know, get used, in which case it's going to get out one way or another anyways (it only takes one defector) or it's useless and thus there's no need to suppress it.

Of course, I can see an /irrational/ agency or group trying to keep stuff secret just because, but writing dumb villains isn't appealing.

It's like the moon landings. The knowledge that the moon landings are fake would be so compelling that it would be impossible to keep hidden, because each and every person could stand to gain something from revealing it, even if they're not outright antagonistic to the US.

****** If the shadowy government conspiracy holds a monopoly on current tech, AND magic is superior, AND one defector is sufficient to promulgate a full magitech revolution, then there is /still/ a motivation to collude. Since one defector is sufficient to break the monopoly then we may conclude that the new method (magic) lacks the barriers to entry of the old (tech). Thus no defector can hold on to the advantage of defecting long enough to make defection profitable before perfect competition kicks in.

This equilibrium becomes more sustainable as probability of detection of new users goes up.

It's not hard to make an immediate, short-term profit, however. If you become known as "they guy who revealed magic" you're basically guaranteed book deals, talk show appearances, and, as I said, money from prizes like the Randi Foundation seeking to disprove the supernatural. If it took a long time to make a profit, colluding would of course be beneficial, since the cabal could easily punish defectors, but as it stands, it doesn't. Indeed, the sheer number of ways to convert magic into cash kind of implies that there is no secret organization trying to block the propagation of magic. And of course, you're likely to get the kind of people who have strong personal beliefs regarding the freedom of information as a matter of statistics, of people who already are part of large organizations that would likely defend them.

******** Not if the conspiracy is playing an immediate and maximal punishment. Say revealing magic to the public nets an instantaneous 5 billion dollars. If the conspiracy captures you within the business week, then that gives you a billion dollars to spend each day. Maybe you can spend that much, but I doubt I'd be able to. And I certainly wouldn't be able to put together an adequate (active) defense against a shadowy conspiracy within 5 days, for any amount of money.

As long as the conspiracy plays a sufficiently odious punishment with high probability of detection, I'm inclined to think that arbitrarily high amounts of money don't translate into positive net utility.

You seem to have a very particular idea of what magic exists, what incentives exist for the surrounding world, and so on. Why not just write the discovery scene (for your main character) and see what consequences feel most natural?

As far as incentives, I'm just taking into account the things that exist to reward someone of revealing /any/ kind of magic, even without taking account the benefit they'd get for the whole "hey guys, magic is real" part. As far as an idea of what magic exists, that basically only goes as far as assuming that magic wouldn't incentivize cabal forming, unless I specifically design it that way, because I know people smarter than me will likely figure out how to munchkin it hard in a short timeframe, and the existence of a cabal begs the question of why someone in the cabal wouldn't have already done so (seeing as there are evidently enough people to make a shadowy cabal that know magic). If I keep a limited scope of non-collaborators, it's believable that they just wouldn't figure it out in the duration of the story.

Though I will admit that I do immediately think of magic as mostly an egalitarian mental exercise, where no amount of "training" will raise your powerlevel, and everyone has the same potential capabilities. If I make it into something that needs to be practiced, and thus forces people to spend time before they can effectively use it... hmm.

The more money you have, however, the better you can defend yourself. Private contractors, exotic weaponry, etc. Putting together an adequate defense plan might be difficult, but the simple solution is to just constantly take flights on large airliners where any action taken against you would lead to serious backlash against any cabal until you have something figured out. Or heck, just hang out in DC near the white house. Of course, there would probably be magical solutions from the POV of the cabal, but that falls into "constructing the magic system" and isn't something I could just assume beforehand.

This is simply not true in the very short term. A billionaire today might have access to those services, but a lottery winner often flails around and wastes hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars before ever coming close to a competent lawyer or contractor. Acquisition of security services is unlikely to scale quickly with money to the degree it would need in order to survive the cabal. If an otherwise completely unknown person approached Haliburton there is a high chance of being turned away at the door. (Averting this might be an interesting narrative!)

****** Having you die in a /completely normal/ accident wouldn't necessarily convince people that there was something to hide.

Even if you'd presented as paranoid and told friends and authorities over the past week that you were being hunted by a shadowy government agency and thought you were going to be killed, that doesn't necessarily mean anyone would necessarily follow up if you fell into traffic the next day. And even if they did, what if they found nothing?

And what if the shadowy government agency didn't kill you, but instead gave you a stack of memory-fuzzing and hallucinogenic drugs, staged a local gas leak with an actual hallucinogenic gas, and had everyone 'affected' advised to spend some time in hospital, with some people having to stay longer than others (but eventually being given a clean bill of health)? If you showed up at the hospital and followed doctors' orders, you'd have a 'really bad reaction' to the 'gas leak' and slowly descend into brain-crippling madness for a few years before dying in an unrelated incident. If you didn't do what the doctors said, then obviously you were affected badly by the gas and were paranoid and seeing things, becoming more and more erratic before you disappeared, with a trail indicating you'd caught a bus to the nearest ocean and walked into it.

Better make sure you can evade the agency until you can prove that magic/superpowers/whatever exist in a non-refutable way on mass media, preferably live and coast to coast during a prime timeslot.

1. Before blowing the secret wide open. Reflect on the absence of known magic - either it's new, or there's some filter you don't know about. What's the appropriate level of paranoia to defeat a thus-far-perfect conspiracy? (story ends at go-time, unclear if it worked)

** If magic depends on secrecy/mystery to work properly then it makes sense to hide it in order to preserve its power. To this end there are multiple different magic rules/systems that may make this work. Here are some examples:

The more people know/use a spell, the weaker it is, its power is divided among people. (See Nasuverse, the setting Fate/Stay Night for an example of this in the backstory)

Magi is limited by belief (Like in the Old World of Darkness setting). Using magic in public forces the user to disguise it as something mundane or not use it at all.

Magic is easily/automatically disrupted by people observing it/examining it (Like the mad science in Genius the Transgression fan expansion for New World of Darkness)

Magic fundamentally tries to hide itself and karmically punishes people who expose it (See Wildbow's Pact for an example of this)

Mix and match these types of limitations as fits with your magic system. You can have the main characters accept magic's limits as a given after minimal experimentation, or make it a running plot point where they try to find a way around these limitations to make magic known to the world and/or accomplish whatever other goals they have driving the plot arc.

Magic requires a minimal level of /sleeping/ human minds within a certain proximity, meaning its results vary with the time of day, day of the week, geographic distribution of humanity, and can be disrupted to a degree by things like cultural holidays/events.

Magic in the Earth-Moon system operates significantly better when something has a direct line of sight to the magical field/systems on the Moon - perhaps one or more fixed geographic points, or a certain number of people, or a sufficient number of whales. It may or may not be also affected by the Sun's position to the Moon for any number of reasons.

My suggestion: Have the discoverers be researchers in an outpost in Antarctica, or villagers of an Alaskan, Greenlander, Siberian town with limited contact with the outside world. Limit your timeframe to changes to the town over a predefined span of time, perhaps the time between supply missions, or during a month-long night (the vampire movie /30 Days of Night/ did this). Have the town cut off internet access, and you have your sandbox.

You don't need to be a world-class expert. Your audience isn't going to know anything about the A-S Station, so as long as what you write sounds plausible you'll be fine. (You still need to do the research, though, or you won't sound plausible.)

When I wrote Baby Blues I did an insane amount of research -- tide tables and current maps for the East River, crime statistics / demographics / income levels in the Bronx and Queens, etc. For everything I've written set in "the real world" (including Baby Blues) I've spent a ton of time on Google Street Maps and Google Earth looking at what's in the location I'm writing about.

For Induction, I needed a location that would have certain elements, one of which was a marina with boats large enough for several dozen people. A lot of digging on GSV and GE led me to Vermillion, Ohio.

The good news is that the research is fun all unto itself, so give it a chance.

One more thing: Don't ever say "I'm not the sort of author who could write that" -- that's just a lazy copout. You can write anything you can dream up, you simply need to do the work to develop the necessary skills and knowledge.

**** Ah. Then make your character selfish, perhaps even a dialed-down version of the protagonist from Emerald Ashes' "Seventh Horcrux". He won't care about the societal implications or economic effects, so we won't see them. However, there are strong arguments to be made for societal collapse of institutions too prominent to go unnoticed by even the most unobservant or uncaring rational character.

I don't quite understand just what aspect the discovery you wish to explore. Any suggestions on scope limitation will also limit your choice of plot; tell us what interests you about the premise, the specific concept you want to write about, the story you want to tell, so we can more precisely define your story's scope.

** There would not be a reason to tell Randi, if you could make money easily without.

Magic could be given by demons or some intelligent party, who would take it away if revealed. This is why you can't demonstrate magic.

Maybe magic actually would not work around sceptics? It would depend on intent, and trying to prove it works just is not a good mindset of casting a spell?

** I think there is not going to be much immediate effect, actually. If we take a look at a person with no access to magic, they observe 'magic-like' things frequently, but this is ignored by the cultural belief that 'magic does not exist'. If we see someone on TV performing 'healing', it doesn't matter if we cannot explain the healing, we know it to be fake. So there is little reason to believe that the average person is going to believe in magic immediately if it does exist.

Some people on the fringes might organise information about magic, but they are also not going to be able to distinguish between true magic and false magic, because they believe false magic is true magic in the first place. Unreliable information about magic and the general lack of credibility on the fringes is going to further the delay of any realisation that magic is real.

Those are the considerations for people with no access to magic. What about the people with access to magic? This depends on what exactly your magic is. If your magic does things like bring back the dead, then maybe it'll take a year or two for the majority to believe in magic. If your magic is to create a lighter fire from your finger, or requires development and expertise to use well, that is not immediately advantageous, then it might be two decades before the majority agrees.

Gradually, more and more people are going to believe magic exists as more and more evidence appears. But it's not going to immediate, and that is the key. 'Is it real?' allows the thinking sort to hypothesise structures and organisation, possibilities and danger. 'Is it real?' also prevents the government from acting, or it'll look stupid if it isn't. So it's never going to be a complete surprise with all the overreaction and coverups that suggests.

Sorry that this doesn't really directly answer your question. I would like to see a story about a society that gradually learns the truth from multiple different limited perspectives though, sort of like World War Z the book.

** Have a number of limitations that minimize the risk.

1. Randi prize is a supernatural body chop shot. Lots of supernatural beings do go to it, and get cut up and sold on the magic black market or sold into slavery to the military and businesses.

2. Magic gives off electromagnetic fields which tends to make electronic cameras fail around it. This can be dealt with, but makes observing magic trickier.

3. There are open (not secret) government schemes to stamp out belief in magic [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17006924]] ostensibly to stop child abuse.

4. [[http://www.gallup.com/poll/19558/paranormal-beliefs-come-supernaturally-some.aspx]] Around 10-20% of the populace believes in magic, perhaps due to a personal encounter.

5. [[http://www.spellsofmagic.com/tips.html]] There are, online, a number of accurate and detailed guides as to how to do magic, as well as a number of tv shows devoted to showing off magic.

6. In places where the government isn't working as hard to stamp out belief in witchcraft, like Africa [[http://www.livescience.com/8515-belief-witchcraft-widespread-africa.html]] belief in magic is widespread.

7. [[http://www.safechildafrica.org/]] There are a number of charities designed to protect witches from abuse in africa and stamp out belief in magic.

8. [[http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/witches-guinea-pigs-dilemma-censorship/management/article/1289813]] there are active attempts to censor media involving magic, heavily led by the churches. This prevents too many obvious magic things getting onto youtube. Magic organizations likewise use their pull with the media, governments to minimize mass media exposure.

** I was thinking an inherent property of the magic system itself that makes it either unwise or sub-optimal to share it.

One version of a system unwise to share is where any adept can very quickly learn to kill people undetectably, but it takes high levels of skill and/or power to defend from such attacks. Popularizing it would be catastrophic for society, and anyone sane would avoid it at all costs, making it plausible that people discovered it in the past, but it was never popularized then, either.

Nasu-verse has an example of a system where it's sub-optimal to share it - the more people know the mysteries, the less powerful the mysteries are. Assume there's a spell that creates one kilogram of gold for one unit of mana spent. If you teach this spell to another person, suddenly it starts creating only half a kilogram for one unit of mana (is my rough understanding, I'm sure it's more nuanced). Obviously if you want to get anything done with such a system, you don't let everyone know about it, or how to use it.

** Profit motive might help you here. The discoverer of this power might want to keep the existence of the power secret until they had a patent on a profitable application of it. That also introduces some nice patent/competition drama. An instructive historical example would be the invention of the telephone, which happened nearly simultaneously among around six different people, but Alexander Graham Bell managed to get the US Patent before anyone else and consequently made boatloads of money and is remembered as "The inventor of the Telephone".

** Played with this for an abandoned rpg campaign, so feel free to steal: Magic is limited by mana. Not by talent, because the ability to use magic reached 100% saturation in the human population over 100000 years ago. The problem is, that mana is only generated by nuclear reactions, and for various reasons only an absurdly small fragment of what the sun generates ever hits the surface of the earth, so as population grew, magic weakened because it got shared by ever more people, until it effectively vanished all together. Until the atomic age. A single large reactor - by itself - leaks more mana into the world than ever reached the planet from the sun. Noone noticed this for quite a long time because with billions of people, every drop of mana got absorbed and promptly spent on, oh, teenagers mysteriously having clear skin or winning dice games ever so slightly more often. Until, that is, the nuclear dash the french carried out during the oil crisis. Because enough reactors to power a nation is also enough reactors to power the ley lines back up. At which point history took a sharp turn to the weird.

I mostly liked this idea because imagine the cognitive dissonance of a seventies flower child who is having astounding levels of success enchanting crystals, painstakingly building a set of instruments for dowsing and then trying to locate the leylines.. and then noticing they are all pointing at power plants. Atomic power plants.

** Strauss' Laundry series had a sort of answer to why one would want to keep it secret. Magic is caused by certain classes of computations, which open gateways into other universes containing entities which would like to eat or possess. . . everything (though not all of them to force the point if you take sufficient precautions), and some are willing to take orders in return for food/bodies. Failure to take sufficient precautions results in everyone everywhere dying, and also possibly all the energy being sucked out of our universe.

Good luck making your setting last very long, though. The rational choice would be to use magic to try to eliminate all computers and the urge or ability to ever build one from the planet.
