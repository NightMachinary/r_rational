** Vidre has an excellent point about how now every civilian at a fight between illustrati is going to try to backstab the villain.

I think the solution is to spread it around that Dominic Lightscour wasn't just a random nobody at the time; he was already a fledgling hero. Earned his domain as a runner, got powerful enough with it that attacking Zerstor wasn't suicide, and was just waiting for an opportunity to get out of the criminal life and use his powers for good. It's even true, mostly.

Then only people who already have some power are going to try to imitate him. Still a problem, but much less so. And as a bonus, spreading the story will increase Dominic's power that much more.

** Something I'm interested in is how closely the stories have to be related to a person to grant them power.

Obviously it's quite abstract but there are plenty of examples in our own history of multiple real people merging into some single person in tales.

Curiously since infamy is more compelling to real humans there's a real incentive to commit evil acts in this, and also an incentive from any governing bodies to silence criminals and the such without saying a word, certainly leads to dystopia.

There's also mention of democracy in this chapter, you wot? A bunch of merchants would have far less fame than a single figurehead unless you get all the fame of your family name or something (see: Rockefellers)

In terms of slaves, why would you allow any of them to have a tongue? If I was a slave owner I would brand them with my name as that surely counts as recognition/fame, if you're the owner of slave ships or plantations that's 200 people who're going to know recognize you. Again it incentives being the biggest dick possible since if you're just like any other slave driver when the slaves move they won't talk about you.

Edit: Alternatively sell being nice to slaves for money, so a illustria or whatever comes in and gives them all chocolate and then they won't stop talking about how great they were.

Alternatively you want to raise people to not be able to communicate about anyone except yourself that would be the best, so have your name be sign language or something unique like a brand as I said so the only thing they could communicate in would be regarding to you.

*** "Being a dick to everyone" is a level 1 strategy. Since /everyone/ can get powers through fame, you're in competition with all of them, and a lot of them are /also/ going to try the BADTE strategy, trying to outcompete each other along those lines, until eventually the market is saturated with dicks, and they're no longer really distinct. You're no longer "the dick", you're "one of those dicks". Like how a vampire novel makes it big, and then there are a ton of replaceable vampire novels that come out the year after to try to capitalize on the trend but find no success because there's a glut in the market.

More than trying to be a dick, what you'd want to find is an area of the fame market that you can exploit. /Maybe/ that's by being a dick to people. But maybe it's by being a big shining beacon of hope and goodness. Or by being a low-brow comedian. Or by being a stoic. You carve out your own section of the market, try to be original and probably fail, since there have been hundreds of years of people trying to be original. The BADTE strategy is one of the competing strategies in the fame market, alongside "be really fucking nice to everyone you meet" and "be a snide asshole with a heart of gold" and "be innocent and virginal" and "rebel against the status quo" and "be a fount of wisdom".

The optimal strategy depends on what strategy everyone else is following.

**** I agree with that, however it's the case that bad things have a larger impact on the human psyche and so on fame, you can see this from the news we have at the moment and from evo-pysch. People tend to remember the worst times way more than the best.

So of all things being particularly evil or authoritarian/conquering is much more likely to generate fame than being the best person ever. Of course there will be an optimal solution where you're not killing off more of your fame generating commoners than the fame gets you.

*** Many of these are good questions, and "read and find out" type of things.

A total glossectomy carries a lot of risks with it - severe swelling that leads to an inability to breathe, a permanent difficulty in eating and swallowing, bleeding, etc. The state of medicine is a little schizophrenic (due to people like Gaelwyn having advantages as physicians) but slaves are pretty expensive - more than a hundred thousand of today's dollars in the real-world equivalent of the historical period this fantasy world is aping. (There are also different forms of slavery - it's not always as pure "property", and quite a few slaves have some recognized rights.) Which is basically a short way of saying that there are some incentives in place such that removing the tongues of slaves isn't always the optimal thing, even leaving aside the moral aspects of it.

Edit: [[http://www.measuringworth.com/slavery.php][See here for the value of a slave,]] though it's an analysis of a later period than /Shadows/ is a fantasy equivalent of. You can assume that a healthy slave in this world would cost around that though, by author fiat.

Certainly, one of the reasons I'm closely watching (and very disappointed that you posted this one late by a whole hour!!!!! /s) lots of things to think about and wonder.

Sure enough if slaves are quite expensive probably a lot better to go the sell slave fame to them instead. Another question that brings up though is if a slave costs the same as a new house, wouldn't it be better to stick up posters of yourself everywhere and then get double your strength? Really depends how it scales and all that.

***** Being stronger is nice, but someone's got to be treated horribly inhumanely as they labour on the plantations. The "fame gives you power" thing is far from the only driving force in the economy.

I was saying instead of slavery you could just spend the cash being famous and then do the slaves work (obviously as I said this implies a kind of scaling system)

******** Certainly I agree but my suggestion was that if it's cheaper to become famous and gain more power than the number of slaves you could purchase for the same cost (plus the cost of having slaves: looking after them and expected revolt risk) and that fame power could translate to equivalent or better than work that your slave would do then you might expect there to be less slaves in this world than in any other one.

As I said, only if those things hold which don't seem too likely from what we've seen, seems like you need a lot of "fame" (time spent thinking about someone else perhaps?) to get fairly little "power".

  Dominic didn't wait for the count this time, and moved towards her. *For a moment thought* that he might be able to land a solid hit, one she wasn't prepared for, even if it was sloppy.

I think there's a missing 'he' there.

/Fantastic/ story so far! I don't read that much, just some stuff on and off, but I am so glad I found this. Each chapter has done an excellent job of getting my blood pumping. Keep up the solid work [[/u/alexanderwales]]! I look forward to following this for a long time :)

People would be more motivated to donate if you included things such as a cameo (like the sailor, Michael, in this chapter), a beautifully formatted pdf with all of the current chapters, a short story for the highest tiers, a chapter about a myth or legend set in the world based on a prompt chosen by your backers, and more!

*** I probably will. I write in Scrivener, which has a compile function, and can "Compile to PDF" with some settings. I want to be able to do something like the HPMOR PDF, which I was a fan of. I've done a few test compiles, and there are some kinks that need to be worked out before I can consider it good enough. There's also the question of distribution, but I think it might be enough to just have it as a Patreon-sub-only link. Hopefully I'll have that figured out by next chapter, if it doesn't cut into writing/editing time.

The other stuff I'll think about. I did some of the cameo stuff for /Metropolitan Man/, which I think had generally positive results - cameos are best when you need a throwaway name and can just grab from a list of people who helped you out by pointing out typos (or in this case, donated), rather than having a scene for themselves.

*** Maybe? It probably wouldn't exist in exactly this form. If you want what I would consider the primary influencers:

- /Avatar: The Last Airbender/, where people have control over a specific element.
- /The Paper Magician/ by Charlie Holmberg, where people bond to a specific man-made material and get access to certain types of magic - including flesh, since man makes man. Not something that I really recommend, since it didn't end up being the book that I wanted.
- /The Baroque Cycle/ by Neal Stephenson, which has no magic at all and mostly introduced me to the wonders of the time period.
- My [[http://maguseuropa.wikidot.com/][/Magus Europa/]] campaign setting, which had Isaac Newton as a gnomish wizards, dragons that had fled to the New World because of the advent of firearms, necromancers in the catacombs beneath Paris, etc.
- /Europa Universalis/ which taught me a fair amount of the variety in world geography, global politics, balance of power, etc. (supplemented with Wikipedia).
- /Worm/. Though ... I don't know. I'm not actually consciously borrowing or integrating anything from there in the way that I'm picking and choosing cool stuff from the others. It would probably be disingenuous to say that it didn't influence me at all, but there's nothing that I'm consciously trying to do "like Worm".

And then there's a lot owed to Brandon Sanderson as well, mostly in how he constructs his magic systems and the way that they influence the world. And I don't consider it a straight riff on any of these, nor is it a straight synthesis.
