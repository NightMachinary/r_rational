*** Clearly step 2 is to use this model of GPT-2 with the penultimate chapters as a prompt to guess at the contents of the final chapters.

** I just gave it the two word prompt 'Eliezer Yudkowski' and that worked out pretty well ðŸ˜†

#+begin_quote
  "Eliezer Yudkowski has just released a new blog post entitled " The Power of Being Unreasonable ". Yudkowski argues that the power of reason is not unlimited. He asserts that it is a good to use it only in moderation. The blog post follows his recent appearance on Skeptoid . It is a powerful statement of the limits to reason. Yudkowski asserts that we have an obligation to limit the use of reason to the bounds of human reason. I am not quite sure I believe Yudkowski. I don't think reason is unlimited. I do think reason is not a means to some kind of utopia. I don't think reason is always good. There are some things that reason can't or shouldn't do. I think we need a good balance between reason and other things. I don't think Yudkowski has given us an excellent balance."

Who is "I"? The GPT2 itself? Yikes!

(I know it's a Chinese Room, but it's hilarious to imagine a chatbot becoming sapient while talking about EY! Of course, if the next paragraph asks for a lawyer, it's [[/r/controlproblem][r/controlproblem]] time.)

*** I think the last two models go out of memory. I haven't heard of anybody successfully fine-tuning them, at least.
