Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 5: Brass*

Ok, week five of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is brass, the first of the mental metals. As always I'm interested in what a brass twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Brass allomancers are known as soothers. An allomancer burning brass can focus on a person or a group of people to reduce the intensity of (soothe) the emotions those people are feeling. Soothers can soothe away all emotions (in which case the target feels nothing but an oppressive numbness clouding their mind) or pick one or more individual emotions to soothe away.

What counts as an emotion for Allomancy is fairly broad, it includes things like fear, anger and happiness, but also hunger, pride, feelings of loyalty and even someone's sense of fatigue. Note that soothing the sensation of hunger or fatigue is purely a mental effect, it doesn't make the physical effects of exhaustion/starvation go away, it just makes it easier for the target to ignore those effects for a while.

This ability is not mind control, brass allomancers have to be subtle if they want to use their abilities to influence unwilling targets. Emotions can be dampened, but not fully taken away and once someone catches on that you are playing with their emotions it is fairly easy for them to resist it (you can numb their anger/indignation at being messed with, but a person can summon more anger than you can soothe away).

While brass does not allow you to increase the intensity of emotions, skilful allomancers can achieve a similar effect by soothing away all emotions except the one they want their target to focus on. If you want someone to be scared, for instance, you could soothe away whatever other emotions are currently vying for their attention to make the fear they are naturally feeling stand out more.

One other thing that perhaps goes without saying, but while the effects of allomancy are temporary, you can still use it to influence what people are thinking in the long run. For instance, if you want someone to not freak out about some new piece of information, you can soothe away their fear and anger while you tell them about it. Then once they remember the conversation after the allomantic effects have worn off, they will remember being pretty blasé about it and (depending on the person in question) the brain's desire for consistency might kick in and justify their reaction by make up some kind of reason why it wasn't that big of a deal.

The maximum number of people you can influence at a time is dependent on your skill as an allomancer, but a rough upper bound might be a large room full of people. You do not strictly need line of sight to your targets, but it does make it easier.

Any aluminium placed between your center of mass and the targets head prevents you from targeting their emotions and extremely strong emotions in the target can interfere with (though not outright block) your abilities. Non-humans are susceptible to soothing to an extent directly proportional to their level of sapience (so you're not going to soothe an ant, but you might be able to soothe a gorilla or a dolphin or even a particularly smart dog).

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic brass allows you to store heat. When storing heat, the feruchemists body cools down and when tapping heat the feruchemists body warms up. This ability allows the feruchemist to exists comfortably across a wide range of temperatures, a feruchemist with enough heat stored can walk naked through a blizzard without freezing to death and (with enough unfilled brass) run through a desert in thick clothing without breaking a sweat.

In both of those examples the feruchemist maintains a body temperature of 37 °C and simply siphons of the excess heat/cold, but brass also allows a feruchemist to raise or lower their body temperature to beyond what a human body can normally function under. There are limits to this though, a feruchemist storing heat can drop their body temperature to roughly 0 °C before the effects of hypothermia set in and when tapping heat they can reach temperatures of around 200 °C before they start burning themselves.

Note that these numbers are the upper limits before physical damage starts to happen, the feruchemist is going to feel pretty miserable long before that.

While feruchemy does not make one immune to heat and cold in excess of your body temperature, heating up your body to above the ambient temperature does, by virtue of thermodynamics, mean that you are not getting any warmer (and vice versa for cold).

A brass feruchemist thus has two ways of dealing with extreme heat: either raising their body temperature above the ambient temperature or storing away the incoming heat to keep their body at a reasonable temperature. The latter tactic is much more comfortable for the feruchemist, but only really works when dealing with moderate, ambient heat because feruchemy always works on the entire body at once. In order to not burn your hands when putting them in boiling water you'd have to store about 50 °C, which means the temperature in the rest of your body also drops by 50 °C (which kills you).

*** Like with tin, I had to fill in some of the gaps on how feruchemic brass actually works in order to make it specific enough for this thread. Like before, I don't think anything up here contradicts canon/WoB, but due to time constraints I didn't dig in as deep as I did with tin, so apologies if I missed anything.

There are a bunch of IRL obligations coming up so I suspect I will be skipping the next week or two and come back in the second week of the new year with the next metal: zinc.

**** One thing before munchkinnery; the third paragraph says you are interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, which I think is a typo.

Anyway, the allomancy can be used in a strange way to generate negentropy if used in the far future. If you stored a single consciousness inside a massive structure like a Matrioshka brain, and deliberately made it inefficient by making it take a lot of energy to simulate, say, anger, then by soothing that anger you can create a massive energy gap that will mean more heat flows to the point where the anger is simulated. That's a really awkward way of doing things, but it works, since it's one mind. Theoretically, if sapience allows the allomancer to increase the dampening if the target is more intelligent than a human, then the process could be even better.

As for less far flung things, (for a definition of that) the fact that 'feelings' are so vague might mean that you could dampen really esoteric things to communicate silently. As an example, I might discuss with my companion that dampening their feeling of heat in their left big toe means 'Danger!', while dampening in their right big toe means 'I'm bluffing'. You could do this with less esoteric things, but this would be the way to do it with the least amount of knock-on effects, I believe.

There is the obvious benefit with allomancy that you essentially have an objective test of sapience, if you can detect the ease of numbing a mind's emotions. This would be useful for AI, and also making sure that we haven't accidently been committing murder of sapient minds in animal testing.

A feruchemist could use lemon juice or urine based invisible ink without having to have access to a portable heater. This could have an (admittedly niche) use during covert operations. They can use it by raising their body temperature until it starts to show.

A feruchemist could temperature sensors fixed on their body to wordlessly and motionlessly trigger various weapons and devices, which could be useful if they are caught in a 'Do anything and I shoot you' situation.

I'm starting to think that a bronze feruchemist could be really good at stealth operations, as another use of the ability is making their heat signiture without fancy gadgets, rendering them near immune to IR detection.

That's all I have for now - at first I thought bronze feruchemy wouldn't be very useful, but this exercise had given me something to think about. Also, the idea of a spy in bronze plate seems hilarious to me, even if they probably wouldn't wear exactly that if it turned out to be useful.

I think your example here is a little too esoteric, but soothing away hunger -> 'Danger', soothing away fatigue -> 'I'm bluffing' should work. With practice you can probably distinguish a pretty wide scala of emotions, especially if the soother is deliberately trying to not be subtle about it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I thought about this too, but the trick is figuring out a way to objectively test to what extent emotions are being soothed. Sapience is gradient, not an on/off switch (at least it is in the cosmere universe apparently), so you'd have to be able to quantify to what extent two differently designed brains are experiencing an emotion. Seems like that would be tricky.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Remember that you can't heat up specific parts of your body, so all you'd be able to send to the sensors is a single number (and even then you'd be limited by the precision with which you can tap and store heat). You could still do things like "Raise temp to 40°C then drop temp to 30 °C -> detonate explosives", so it isn't that big of a deal, but it will reduce the speed at which you can send triggers.

***** reworking your silent communications thing instead of making "your big toe going numb means im bluffing" you could make someone you want to know your bluffing feel like your bluffing -is there precedent for controlling more specific emotions like that?- tell them if they have a hunch or feeling for something your doing then theyre right.

with the 'zombies' a benefit of emotional control over them instead of the ?real? method is that they could still do complex tasks. and if you dampen all of there feelings beside the ones for the task your doing and theyll do it whole heartedly, maybe making them even better than when they were normal. and for a compounder they shouldnt be hard to make - if burning brass with stored heat in it makes your allomancy power stronger then you could dampen any aversion they have to you brass them, and bronze them harder (not that heat storage and emotional dampening would compound like that, im presuming its the rules of compounding in general).

edit- noticed the zombie army thing is from another commenter, not you.

edit 2- changed bronze to brass thx

with the fighting entropy thing all of the powers have had good ability there, and instead of hooking someone up to a neg entropy engine you could store and release heat/cold in place A-place B and you have an easy displacement going on. with the benefit that your not limited by how much brass to burn or how much heat(or whatever your converting to emotion) there is in the universe.

You could soothe away suspicion, which would make the target more likely to believe you are not bluffing. Maybe soothe away nervousness and fear to make them believe you are bluffing (depending on what exactly you're bluffing about)?

#+end_quote

Unfortunately you can't use compounding to enhance your allomancy, all compounding does is give you a limitless supply of feruchemically stored attributes.

In fact, burning a feruchemically charged bit of metal does not even give you its allomantic effect at all. Burning a piece of brass with heat stored gives you (more) heat back, it doesn't let you soothe emotions.

Also, minor nitpick: brass is the metal that lets you store heat/dampen emotions, bronze does something else.

Yup, brass is definitely one of the more straightforward negentropy generating powers in feruchemy's arsenal, but keep in mind that you can only heat yourself to around 200°C. I suspect you'd have to do some pretty clever tricks to counteract significant amounts of entropy that way.

***** A brass feruchemist can counter negentropy on their own by consistently charging in one place and discharging in another. They wouldn't be able to produce much negentropy on their own, but sufficient advances in biological engineering should make it possible to make massive implants which count as parts of their body, massively increasing the amount of energy they can move.

If you have one full Feruchemist you could use them and an orbiting loop of brass baubles to do this without moving the Feruchemist. Aluminum lets you store identity, and if a Feruchemist stores all of their identity while storing another attribute, the resulting metalmind will be usable by anyone. So, put the heavily modified Feruchemist with a huge body on one side of the last black hole, put a bunch of people on the other, an orbiting ring of countless brass beads between them, and you will create a radiative wind accross the black hole, which could be harvested the same way you would harvest any other black hole.

*** Why, make a zombie army of course. Having one person Sooth away people's feeling of volition while another does more intensive emotional editting would get rid of the downside of "be able to be fought against". As any major depressive or schizophrenic person could tell you, it's /really hard/ to care that you're currently e.g. literally starving if you're in the throws of avolition.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Serpent_and_the_Rainbow_(book][Hoodoo zombi]]) are maybe-real, but were very intensive to make due to having to induce ego death and delirium chemically and killing people due to high variance in toxicity of datura root. If you can just tamp down someone's willpower, self of self, feeling of resistance, self regard, etcetera etcetera for a week and feed them propaganda through it, you can probably make an army.

I'd just test limits and see what you can do, tbh. "Emotions" is a really broad category. It sounds like it's be something like "external force changing your mind", but "loyalty" is a more passive state of mind. I'd try more esoteric things, like "self-possession" or "comprehension" and see if those work - if you feel less self-possessed then you'd be off balance and vicious circle down to feeling completely out of control, hopefully having a panic attack, while if you lose the feeling of comprehension of what's going on you might start self-doubting and vicious circle down, even if you intellectually understand things still.

Something like soothing "self-doubt" sounds like it'd be pretty dangerous, since you could run around and get people to make bad decisions they would usually hedge against, with the same kind of self-rationalization for once you stop. Depending on the range of soothing, you could influence heads of state, or else just sweep people in poker.

You could become the best mental hospital orderly ever seen, or provide suppression for drug cravings at a rehab. Sooth away mania, depression, psychosis, etc.

Alternatively, if you're on Earth, influence elections - politicians having bad emotional reactions or not being able to build up enthusiasm for a talking point on live TV would kill support very quickly, and debates or rallys are done in front of large audiences.

** Incredibly mild mechanical spoilers for /The Return of the Obra Dinn/ follow.

--------------

You have come into possession of the *Momento Mortem*, a magical object that looks like a wind-up pocket watch. This magic item has several properties:

- If you point it at a corpse, the hands of the pocket-watch will spin around to show the time of death.
- If you press the button on the top of the pocket-watch while it's pointed at a corpse, two effects happen:

  - You will hear five seconds of audio from the time and location where the person or animal died.
  - Following that, you will be transported to a sphere of frozen space-time roughly 10 meters wide, depicting the exact moment of death, centered on the corpse. You can move freely around this bubble of frozen space-time, though solid objects are still solid to you, and nothing can be moved. When you leave (requiring an act of will), two seconds will have passed, no matter how much time you spend looking around. If you find a corpse in this chunk of frozen time, you can recursively use the Momento Mortem to investigate it, resulting in being 'transported' to a new chunk of frozen time and hearing five seconds of audio.

- For the purposes of this prompt, 'time of death' will be assigned according to either destruction of the brain or cessation of brain activity.
- For the purposes of this prompt, 'corpse' is defined as any distinct piece of a dead member of a species of the animal kingdom larger than 50 cubic centimeters and relatively intact (e.g. the item won't work on a slurry made of different people, as they're not distinct, and won't work on a deer that's eaten a corpse, as it's not intact).
- You can bring in up to 25 kilograms of equipment and clothing into the slice of frozen time with you, but no changes to you or them will carry over to the real world when you exit, and interaction with the objects is in terms of light only, as they repel all touch.

Given the above, answer at least one of the below:

1. How do you use this item to satisfy your values?
2. How do you use this item to most effectively solve the most crimes?
3. If this item is in someone else's possession, what's your standard operating procedure to not get caught when you commit your murders?
4. If you live in a society which can produce more of this item on demand, what different laws would you make regarding it?

*** (1) Learning! Work or live somewhere with easy access to dead animals (if frozen counts as "relatively intact" I'd just have a freezer with a frozen 50cm^{2} piece of an animal killed in a suitable place to study), and spend 2 seconds reading, re-reading and reflecting on any amount of text you can reasonably bring with you using the 25kg limit. Might have a special set of pants with soft cushioning around the buttocks to sit comfortably on the time-frozen furniture.

It is unclear from your description if the pages in a book you brought with you could be turned, but its seems reasonable - presumable worn clothes deform to allow you to move around in the sphere, or you'd have to use the Memento Mortem naked.

(3) Always kill people from more than 10 meters to avoid visual identification is a good first step.

Also, pick a method of killing that prevents the victim from speaking, making signs or writing, and that at the same time takes as long as possible (at least over 5 seconds) before the brain activity shuts down, so that the details of the crime like direction of attack etc are not readily apparent.

**** I'd expect the same techniques from your (1) to work for sleeping too. It'd be really weird if whatever chemical changes to your brain created by learning are preserved but not the ones from sleep. (Then again it's magic, it can work however it wants, but that's not an excuse not to check.) Bring a sleeping bag if time-frozen furniture is uncomfortable. There's an extra 8 hours a day, plus the ability to rest up and collect your thoughts whenever you want.

There's also physical science to be examined using time stops. Anything someone currently studies with a high speed camera can be studied in more depth by killing some mice at the right moment. You can't do fundamental physics research in the bubble because it's clearly futzing with the rules for at least light propagation (I mean, that'd still be interesting science to do, but you'd be learning about magic-physics instead of regular-physics), but I expect there's something in engineering, medical, or biomechanical research that would save enough lives to be worth killing mice for. Structural engineers looking at the exact way a stress fracture propagates?

Finally, because you can use the Memento Mortem recursively, if you have any of these uses that require cleverly chosen corpses and moments of death, you can preserve all of them into an index by getting a bunch of corpses in one spot and sacrificing an animal (which you preserve traditionally until it's getting musty, then chain in a new animal). You can make an index of indices. In fact, for (2) an the local morgue can sacrifice a mouse every so often and later add them all to a huge index of every death that's passed through there.

*** The time-freeze aspect of this pocket watch kind of overwhelms everything else. Sure you could use the watch to find murderers, but that's a really mundane use of having an object that FREEZES TIME. I would spend all my time constantly entering such frozen time spaces so I can do all the thinking I need in there.

The fact that you can bring in items with you makes things even better, you can bring in video games for entertainment whenever you get bored, or a computer to help you calculate things and store all your thoughts. The fact that these objects are effectively memory wiped when you leave is a problem, but that just means you need to improve your memory. Or just make multiple trips, memorize one chunk of a story or proof you wrote at a time.

The only real problem is that you need constant access to corpses in order to abuse this frozen space-time. Can you just buy a whole duck (from a restaurant) and keep it frozen in your fridge forever? That's probably the easiest method if it works.

*** how do mirrors work? if mirrors from the sphere reflect stuff outside then something that would help detectives is if every one went around wearing stupid amounts of reflective clothing.

or if it worked within the rules (which this is a stretch) then detectives could bring mirrors in to see outside the allotted range (though if your eyes cant see out of it then i dont see why a mirror could).

something murderers could do is make there crime scenes incredibly dangerous to investigate. spider webs are harmless but if you accidentally walked through a time frozen one you would probably be cut in half before you realized what happened, though you would just leave before you would die. murderers shooting off confetti canons will stop investigators from walking around. or you could try to be deviouse and use something hard to see like hairs or whatever the smallest piece of dust would have to be for you to not be able to move it. another way to attack people investigating would be powerful fuck off lazers. not that you need to harm the detectives, allot of bright lights could blind detectives and stop them from seeing in the crime scene bubble (though some goggles to dampen light would fix that).

just spit balling a few more ideas here but if you spray painted the air would it stick to dust particles and such to show you where vacuums are (that someone has recently been). or if you could use a corpse to disappear for a few seconds (away from authority's or murderer's?), - not sure what good 2 seconds is though.

easiest and most obviouse way id use this is kill a chicken within range of a chicken corpse, bring a weeks worth of food and a laptop with a terabyte of learning material, maybe some instruments and spend my free decade inside learning, using up only 2 seconds of my life span. or forget being a robot bring a few terrabytes filled with shows/books/comics and do it again. if someone said i could spend a decade doing either of those things and it wouldnt effect anything else you'd have to wait 2 seconds for my answer.

*** 1:

Set up mass production of X, where X is a small, docile, easy to transport animal. Then any good citizen can kill a X to record a moment in time (plus 5 seconds audio). Use tiny writings on the tapestry to copy books this way. We'll call this a leaf. Collect the leaves in one place, put labels and descriptions on them, murder another X. Collect those Xs as well and so on and so on, forming a giant graph, which is directed and cycle-free. To create a simple reference to the content of a node, simply murder a new X next to them. This should allow you to send information across long distances as well (by murdering a new X whenever the last corpse rots), and to make backups.

Demonstrate your ability to use the Memento Mortem, and write some sci-fi books on how to revive people from minimal information. Who knows what potential future Memento Mortems will be able to do... Sell the idea to rich people and let them sponsor your X-farms.

Make sure the Memento Mortem is protected by the state in a secure place. Optimally you'll still have access to it, but perhaps there are people more skilled at using it. Don't let anyone who might break it near the device. Maximize its lifetime, even if it means sacrificing its usefulness at the moment.

Also, try to figure out where the Memento Mortem comes from. Constantly let someone murder Xs in its proximity to record any subtle changes. If possible (not sure if any living animal can be used as equipment/clothing), murder them inside a space-time-sphere for even more documentation.

Before delving into the graph, record and add your current goal. It might take some time to figure out the mystery you are looking for, and this ought to help with that.

I've considered how to get infinite computational power, but without actually interacting with the frozen objects you only got your own memory, your current position in the frozen sphere, and the path you have taken inside the graph. Latter two are an neglectible amount of data, and the first one isn't enough to do the work of a computer / someone with pen and paper. So the Memento Mortem should only be useful for thinking about "relatively simple" tasks using infinite time.

2:

If a murder occurs let them kill a X at the scene and send it to you with the next update of your local graph-node. I believe that dead X can travel faster than a human, and that requiring a Memento Mortem is good enough encryption as not to violate privacy. This might not be the case for point 4.

** Vim is the force of creation and can be used to conjure objects or heat them. Nix is the force of uncreation and can be used to vanish objects or cool them. Both can be used to telekinetically move objects around or to infuse matter.

Infusion: - Transfers vim or nix into matter for storage. - Stored vim or nix has a one hour half life, except for crystals which have a one year half life. - Matter infused with vim can't be directly affected by nix and vice-versa. - Vim-infused matter can be de-infused by spending 10x the vim in nix and vice versa.

Limitations:

/Specificity:/ You can only conjure or vanish one compound at a time. For example, you could conjure salt (NaCl) but not a bag of french fries to go with it.

/Comprehension:/ You have to know the bonds in the conjured molecule as well as the molecule's shape. Magicians study a lot of chemistry.

/Conservation:/ Mass and energy are both conserved. Conjuring objects gathers atoms from nearby. Vanishing them disperses the atoms over the same area. Heating draws energy from nearby. Cooling disperses that heat.

/Displacement:/ Conjured objects displace the matter around them. Vanished objects leave a vacuum.

/Elements:/ Conjuring or vanishing compounds with more elements takes exponentially longer.

/Pathing:/ You have to specify a path from the vim/nix source to the target point. Paths for nix can't go through matter infused with vim. Paths for vim can't go through matter infused with nix. Spells with longer paths cost more to cast. Five meters is a normal casting range. Shorter paths cost much, much less, up to 1/100th at a few centimeters.

/Targeting:/ You can increase the precision of targeting conjuration, vanishing, etc, but as the precision goes below 1cm the cost approaches infinity rapidly. A precision of 1mm costs 10x, 0.1mm is 1000x.

/Whole:/ You can only conjure or vanish entire objects. An "object" is a group of identical bonded molecules. For example, a layer of oil between two sheets of steel could be vanished, but two separate pockets of oil inside a steel block couldn't (though you could vanish them separately).

The average magician can channel 6000 units of vim or nix per second, enough to let them: - Conjure or vanish 0.5kg of matter, assuming the atoms are plentiful. The cost increases if they aren't. - Apply 30kN of force. - Transfer 12kJ of energy from two objects that start at equal temperature. The cost increases if you're trying to cool a cold object or heat a hot one.

These rates are mutually exclusive. If you're conjuring half a kg of matter, you can't also push stuff around. Note also that these are the base rates. Spending all 6k units on force targeting a person a hundred meters away will result in less force than a light breeze because the path is so long.

Conjuration and vanishing doesn't happen all at once. You get the effects as you pay, growing outward from the targeted point. So, for example, if you conjured a large metal ball you would first see a small marble that swelled and grew until it was as big as you wanted. Or if you wanted to break into a padlocked room, you could start a vanishing on the hasp and wait until a cross-section had been vanished before stopping the spell.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I've gone over this a couple times but there's probably something I'm missing. I've already got the obvious weaponized use of conjuration by putting a bullet in someone's head, but I'm more interested in techniques that would work against a fellow caster. I think it's inevitable that in any hard magic system the non-mages will just flat out lose to mages.

Edit: Oh, and the strain of channelling vim or nix gradually causes permanent insanity over decades of use.

#+end_quote

Vanished objects get spread over a sphere centered on the cache several meters in radius and the compounds are broken into their elements. The salt trick won't work because the Na and Cl will mostly bond back with each other. If any Cl2 is formed, it'll react with Na to form NaCl again. Unfortunately, I don't know enough chemistry to say whether this is generally true or if it might be possible to weaponize with some other molecule.

Edit: Actually, you could just bring the bag of salt and conjure your Cl2 normally, so this is definitely a viable tactic.

The telekinesis is the part I've paid the least attention to, mostly because it didn't seem quite so overpowered as the conjuration/vanishing aspect. Apparently that was a mistake. What's the difference between limiting by force vs limiting by energy output? I know you could drive a machine with vim/nix, but how would you get infinite energy from it, since the machine would halt as soon as the magician stopped channeling magic into it.

As for conservation, yes, but cooling wouldn't be very effective unless you wanted to affect a large area since nix could do it to a much higher degree of precision.

*** If you can control which matter you use to conjure objects with vim, then you can do things like using a person's body to create a block of ice, killing them via dehydration. If you knew the right target element, like say carbon, you could summon it from somebody's flesh to effectively disintegrate them. It's basically using nix without the whole object restriction.

Even if you can't do this at any time and still need to set up specific conditions for it to work, it's still kinda powerful. Basically, if you can do this at all then the system breaks a bit.

You could solve this by saying, "using vim to conjure something draws from all matter on earth/in the universe at an equal spread, with an equal likelihood", which pretty much lets you do what you want about that exploit in a somewhat believable way.

** You can create matter out of nothing from this list: rock, stone, wood, clay, iron, and glass. The matter disappears after an hour. You can create batches between 1-5 kg at a time and the batch must be connected. You can't create matter inside a solid object though if you create it within an empty area it doesn't fit(such as between your palm and the wall) it will assert pressure onto the surrounding area to try to create such space. You can only create very simple shapes. After you have created the matter it will follow the natural rules of physics and you have no more control. Matter are created with a velocity of 0 with respect to your current position and at a temperature that matches the surrounding temperature.

Setting is medieval.

I haven't really found any utility uses for this power. Offensive uses basicly boils down to creating something in front of someone when they are running, creating an iron lump over their head or inside their mouth/nose. Ideas?

If that doesn't happen you can use it to get unlimited fuel basically.

Also you can transport stuff by creating things near it so the pressure pushes them.

And cut stuff, assuming you can make thin sheets of iron or glass. (you could cut and process trees whith this for example)

Also a few questions :

How far can you make the batches appear?

How fast?

How much pressure can the object assert ?

*** Alright, the task is to find an optimal character build for the following product of r/ nsfwcyoa, [[https://imgur.com/a/Aio07IG][Divine Trials]].

Basically, you're thrown into some another world along with whatever penalties, boons, magic powers, physical powers, special items, and companions you purchase with your points, and you've got to "kill or capture all threats" against a goddess who also gets to select a wide range of nasty things to throw at you.

Notable details: It's heavily implied that the only reason you have a chance at winning is due to the expansive "take a penalty for extra points" section, which wasn't present on any previous iteration, and the baseline 750 points you get at the start results in "no victors in living memory, which for a god, is quite a long time". So it can be safely assumed that you're up against some pretty nasty competition, and apparently completing the trial in the span of 100 years is considered quite fast, almost time-attack mode.

There's one specific exploit for (finitely many) free points, namely combining the "Sleepy" penalty for +40 points in exchange for spending 2 extra hours asleep per day, and the "Relentless" boon for -35 points, which cuts your sleep time (as well as all other physical needs) in half. Making the worst-case assumption that "Relentless" applies first before "Sleepy", that's 50 free points from applying Relentless twice, and Sleepy 3 times.

I think there's a few further tricks to be found, but I don't want to anchor readers /too/ heavily on my current plan, there's probably plenty of exploits I missed. I suspect that taking a broad macro-level view of where the points are going will lead sufficiently smart character-builders to a convergent general strategy, but I'll have to see if anyone else picks it up.

Note that a green crystal denotes something you can buy multiple times, and a blue crystal denotes boons which apply to any team members you want, instead of just yourself.

In 48 hours, I'll post my build.

**** Like most CYOA's there's enough egregious exploits here that the rest of your build doesn't matter much, though given how easy it is to get points in this CYOA (lots of manageable drawbacks) you can certainly take all of these:

- /Grand Theft Waifu/ and /Waifu/ like most powers of this sort are broken because even if the powers/superintelligence of anybody you summon with this may be nerfed you can still summon people with truly staggering amounts of exploitable knowledge including tech knowledge. If you're in a world which already has moderate tech this means by summoning some loyal entity who previously had near omniscience you can have them kick off a singularity potentially within the week (by messing with biotech in all likelihood, since that lets you piggyback on life in order to create your first generation of self replicating nanites). The actual celebrity waifu option has the same exploit since you can alter their mind (and thus add knowledge).

- /Technomancy/ is probably OP as well if you can make magitek AI or do brain augmenting cybernetics though it's hard to say exactly how exploitable it is given the scarce details given. Depending on specifics enchanting, verbal magic, ritual magic and many others may also have certain similar exploits but it's hard to say given the details available.

- /Biomancy/ should be super exploitable since it even lets you make changes no biologically possible. So it should be a simple matter to design microbes which assemble self replicating nanites or alternatively just start a biological based singularity if tech doesn't work right in your world.

- /Divination/ can be exploited in really obvious ways even given its inaccuracy over long timescales. Really the main hazard with using it is looking into the future to retrieve tech knowledge without going far enough to risk being manipulated by UFAI.

Of course those are just the exploits I was able to pick out that were egregious and obvious just skimming the text, I didn't look at companions but some of those may be brokenly OP as well.

***** Agreed on Waifu, even besides the "summon someone with specific knowledge" exploit, there's a lot of other shenanigans you can get up to with it, such as /Buy In Bulk/+Giant character+Eye of Leviathan (to summon food, because even /Relentless x2/ doesn't cut down food needs that much. Now you have a team to gang up on big scary monsters). Idk about /Technomancy/ being quite that OP, /Golemancy/ seems quite a bit more relevant towards AI-making, and it seems implied that you've gotta build up the tech tree yourself. Regarding AI, you can probably also have one of the AI companions send you their own source code to have a baseline to start with of "AI that's human-level and not that inclined to take over the world".

Putting /Biomancy/ and /Divination/ to one side for now, there's something I wanted to talk about that'll probably put a damper on your plans.

I don't think the gods are able to create a waifu that knows stuff that /they/ don't know, and the fact that Schierke has "start the singularity" as a quest for you (as well as the ridiculously human robots running around) seems to strongly imply that neither Schierke (nor any of the gods) know what to code to get a strongly superhuman AI, because if they wanted a singularity and they knew that information, they could just go to a computer and type in the code. Therefore, detailed information about starting a singularity, how to assemble self-replicating nanites, and such, will probably not be available and you'll have to figure out how to do it safely from scratch. There's also the issue where you really don't want to be doing this research around spectators, as the gods that are helping you out on this don't exactly seem reliable enough to entrust such knowledge to. It also seems to imply that there's this weird barrier around human-level in AI in this story.

You should still be able to do some trick like "my waifu is 300 years old from a long-lived race and has had [how to build the entire tech tree of my civilization from scratch] as a special interest this whole time", though, that knowledge doesn't seem intrinsically off-limits, and the same sort of trick also means you don't have to buy a bunch of volumes of /Magic For Dummies/.

So I think you're going to have to clean up the trial /without/ strong AI or nano-stuff (although there's still a lot of exploits with /Biomancy/, like creating a gene-drive version of [evil monster race you want to wipe out]), and do the research for those things on your own time after the trial is cleaned up and you're a deity.

Similarly, since they said that the maximum reliable lookahead on /Divination/ is about a month, and actually probably closer to a few days, the "look a few weeks ahead, copy down what future-you is writing on the paper" trick seems like it'd just be unreliable if you look too far ahead. Also the unreliability of far-lookahead might put a damper on getting future-tech-knowledge. It can still basically be used as an NP-oracle for small-ish spaces, though. If the failure probability for a 1-day divination is, say, 1/100, then if you want to check less than 100 things for property X, and it takes less than a day to check a thing for the property, then with high probability you'll divine the proper thing, check it, and it will indeed have property X. (this assumes it's a promise problem where you know just that something has the property, not which thing it is.)

There's a fair number of builds which can manage world domination here (dependant on the world you choose though), but I was just going for the ones which very obviously let you start a technological singularity and get nigh godlike power (or at least have access to it).

Technomancy seems pretty OP because if you have tech to start with it seems nearly inevitable that you could take a lot of existing tech like computers and massively improve them with magic, given magical construction techniques and components it seems like you can just do many relevant tech like say brain augmentation, genetic engineering or AI vastly easier. Plus if the technomancy literally lets you control computers magically then you might be able to develop AGI through brute force approaches and just mind control the resulting superintelligence into having your values long enough for it to rewrite itself into FAI.\\
As for using AI companions they all seem to be some variation on an exact copy of a human mind and like one might expect from that none of them seem to understand enough about how their mind actually works to improve upon it. Given what're basically ems that can't even seem to necessarily run much faster than a human mind and which I don't exactly trust, I'm not sure how helpful they would be. With regards to golems I wouldn't really count on that being so useful with regards to AI. Since being magic it seems entirely likely that making golem minds may be one of those fairly opaque magical processes which doesn't really teach you anything about how minds actually work. So whether you even /can/ just figure out how to make superhumanly intelligent golems (or even just sapient ones) through that magic is unclear.

This potentially eliminates the 3D waifu option, however the other waifu option and /definitely/ grand theft waifu seem based on summoning entities from "fictional" universes and not the god's own knowledge/intelligence. I also suspect avoiding the gods figuring out AGI design from you is probably trivially easy since there's no suggestion they are scanning your mind or the state of magitek hard drives.

Divination's unreliability seems very specifically not an issue with regards to tech. Chaining messages back may not give totally consistent results, but certain things like tech is still going to be relatively the same given long enough. So precommit to writing lots of tech knowledge down and you may not get exactly what you expected but you should still get tech, and you can always change the timeline to get new predictions. Still the usefulness of divination here really depends on what "murky" means: if it means your predictions are extremely vague that is bad, but if the predictions merely aren't very reliable (likely due to uncertainty in the future) then that still allows tech to be very useful (after all it shouldn't predict tech which literally isn't possible).

got a few ideas right now,undead lich's are always super powerful magicaly and they naturally sortof work like 'draft of death' (except maybe the ability to rebuild there body? idk). letting you choose something besides that which i thought was the best option next to elixir of life and rebirth by death. getting 'cursed with awesome' should let you get both of those. im hoping you can choose to self destruct your soul if you get captured activating the rebirth by death.

mary sue lets you choose another race and get rid of the negatives of one of them, being vulnerable to holy magic is to bad to keep but not sure what to choose out of; a spirit Djinn which are usually pretty bloody powerful, an undead lich (the downsides of both a lich and a djinn might make them not worth playing together) and a monster girl Gorgon- omnipotent stone stares are awesome but are usually there downfall.

being a giant is useless when you can just choose your size to be 100ft tall. which im doing, the bonus to strength is too insane coupled with 'synergy' it'd be an insane boost to magic to. and being a djinn/lich would add there magical prowess onto your strength again.\\
breeding program and maybe evolving flora will be a cool boon to gratz (the video game leveling up one), plus the give you more points to work with. a hundred foot tall gorgon could just stare a a monster infested kingdom in level up instantly. a hundred foot tall gorgons tail and snake hair is also gonna be pretty dangerous.

the undead race should probably let you choose a skeleton dragon which might be able to shapeshift like a normal dragon (though why not be a normal dragon?)

ive got nothing really. some obvious things like if you choose infertile then choose fertile aswell, get some extra points, but being able to make kids is to valuable a resource of super-powered minions. cold blooded is a free 30 points if you dont care about being cold (like if you dont have a physical body). and alota the bonus points are about sex, so from a sorta min-maxish point of view you could take most of them. if you choose a mind flayer penis and i think there were other things for controlling people you "hang with", plus some allot of the other sex boons and playing a sex fight game could probably be 100% workable. with the pick a fetish boon that normalizes and makes everyone sorta into a fetish of your choice you could choose make being mindcontrolled by me during sex be a fetish which would be exploiting that.

theres allot to work with and hard to see what does what with a setting so vague.

**** Alright, here was my first-draft build (I didn't think of the /Divination/ or /Biomancy/ exploit, so it needs to be updated for that)

First consideration is what immortality method to go for. Obviously, /Cursed With Awesome/ would be taken, so we actually get two of them.

The ones to rule out: /Draft of Death/ is decent, but with a big “death of spirit” weak point. /Elixer of Life/ has the big flaw of massively boosting sensation, so it's a terrible choice against an enemy who's willing to torture you. /Cherub/, /Succubus/, /Ethereal/, /Blood and Bone/, and /Servant/ just make you hard to kill, not immortal. /Bound to the Pit/ is just a stupid one to select, and /Guardian/ means you've gotta enforce “balance” in order to be immortal, which is incompatible with long-range “good wins” plans.

/Shards of Mortality/ is the best one, it's basically a rate-limited horcrux. It leads to victory as long as you don't get killed more often than some limiting rate, because your soul can be repaired over time, and if you craft backup bodies, you won't have a problem. /Rebirth by Death/ is another extremely good one, and synergizes very well with /Shards of Mortality/ and a suicide method, except that it has a “captured for one year” failure condition. However, if you're captured for one year, the enemy can probably figure out some way of capturing your soul and destroying it, so it actually isn't doubling up on failure conditions as much as it looks like. Also, it's notable that the same benefits can be gained by just giving /one of your companions/ the /Rebirth by Death/ feat and instructing them to suicide when it looks like the situation is really bad and loss is imminent, freeing up one extra slot. I decided to make my second immortality method be /Cast off Humanity/ because the multi-purchase /Custom Robot/ in the item section gives me a bunch of backup bodies to start with if I get killed before I figure out how to make backup bodies, it grants free access to /HUD/ and /Technomancy/ which are both pretty useful, and the “any substance you wish from your former world” option opens the door to having a body made of extremely durable materials such as diamondoid, iridium, and various carbides, which should be able to take some pretty serious hits, as well as being flame and acid resistant. Obviously this forces Automaton as a race.

***** Drawbacks With Explanations (Taken): Assuming a massive benefit to winning the trial (I'd become a god), taking drawbacks that make the surrounding world kinda suck to live in in exchange for a small increase in probability of winning makes sense, so that means a lot of the sex-based ones are selected. Namely /Cruel and Unusual/, /In the Hole/, /Breeding Program/, /Evolving Flora/, /Girl Power/, /Furries Suck/, /Communal Property/, /Cultic Conversion/, /Game Over/, /World of Whorecraft/, and /Sex Sells/. Also, regarding the “new enemy” drawbacks, based on the fact that Valeria says that she's got a very long list of dangerous foes to pick from, adding /Public Menace/, /Soulmate/, /The Spirit/, /The Broker/, /Wrong Genre Buddy/ and /The Bitch/ to the mix doesn't really make my job that much harder on the margin. /Yandere Generator/ is actually a pretty good pick, a 1/100,000 chance of yandere is actually surprisingly low and is unlikely to fire during the trial if I'm not interacting with really large crowds. /Pre-Determined Event/ is worth a lot of points and can be cheesed by intentionally suiciding at 100 years and reincarnating in a new body. /Oh Look It's Hitler/ can be overcome if you've got the ability to change your appearance, which I do. /Chessmaster/ seems like a bad one to pick, but I'm already going for an extremely teammate-heavy build, so it seems like a natural one to pick up if I'm going that way. /Gated/ is cheesable with the /Lover's Rings/, you just need one person to stay back with a ring, and everyone near me to wear a ring, and when we go missing at one year's time, the person staying back shatters a ring to instantly negate the gating. Also, if I can get teleportation for me and everyone around me, it no longer requires a ring sacrifice and is immediately fixable. /Cold Blooded/ is completely redundant if I'm an automaton, robots don't need to worry about having their core body temperature get too cold. Controversially, I took 2 of /Retard/, for -20 IQ points. The basic reasoning behind this was that, because Automatons have +intelligence, and I'll also be taking /Intelligence/ as a power, and starting from my current state, I'd be smart enough afterwards that I could lose 20 IQ without critically compromising the mission.

Taken Drawbacks Without Explanations: These just look straightforwardly sensible. /Infertile/, /No Way Home/, /Involuntary Lolicon/, /Envy/ /Sleepy/ (already explained why this works), /Senseless/ (give up sense of smell), /Tulpa/, /Dwarf Fever/, /Gender Bender/, /Karma Farmer/, /Weaboo x4/, /Clingy/, /Tally Ho/, /Mental Break/, /Same Shit/, /Drowning In Bliss/,

Untaken Drawbacks Without Explanations: These just look straight-up bad. /Fertile/, /Use Protection/, /Deviously Cursed Loot/, /Money Maker/, /Real Casual/, /Just a Dweam/, /Fugly/, /All Business/, /Exhibitionism/, /Alcoholism/, /Fetish Bait/, /Congratulations!/, /Armless/, /Just Die/, /Loner/, /Missionary/, /Easily Bound/, /Wuss/, /Heal Slut/ (actually, I just realized that since I can't fight directly due to taking Chessmaster, this one might make sense to pick), /Come Home Moon Man/, /Shivers/, /On My Own/ (might actually be viable due to taking Chessmaster and not fighting directly), /Mixed Signals/, /Quick Fire Round/, /LAAAAAAW/, /Limiter/, /Narcolepsy/, /Better to have Loved/ (might be cheesable with Shards of Mortality and reincarnation), /Lightning Rod/, /Spaz/, /Eye Catcher/

Untaken Drawbacks With Explanations: /Demon Queen/ seems a bit risky, and /The Ringer/ is damn-near suicidal to pick, 90 anima is not enough to run the risk of drawing someone near-or-exceeding my level of munchkining. /Heartless/ seems like a terrible drawback to take if I want to be a god, along with /Deadly as Sin/. /Consistent Fuckup/, /Wolverine/, and /Hothead/ are all just terrible choices to have, good decision-making is a superpower. /Parasite Pal/ also seems to fall under this, although it seems more surmountable there. I'm also unsure of how it'd play out if you're playing an automaton. /True Name/ means you've got a huge information leak problem if you've got a simple first name. /Insubordination/ is another terrible one to pick if you're playing a very teammate-heavy build. /Mana Transfer/ is iffy but was rejected because it means I don't get mana if I'm alone, and shortly-after-reincarnating-in-hidden-location is a time when I'm alone and I /really/ need the mana. /Challenge Run/ is a bad choice if you're going for a magic-heavy “crack the secrets of the universe” approach to the trial. /Slow Start/ looks good, but the sex-based drawbacks are a lot more brutal on a mere mortal than someone with a bunch of powers, so that's not going to be a fun first year. /Alternate Start/ is just a bad choice because I don't think all “small groups of companions” are capable of avoiding death until they figure out where on the entire planet the base is, especially since we'll be pretty paranoid about preventing information leaks. The start of the trial is the most vulnerable part. /Magic Overhaul/ is something I don't want to take but I don't know why, and I get a mysterious sense of doom from /Free for All/.

****** Taken Boons with Explanations: /Stockholm Syndrome/ is pricey but sensible to pick up in case some good capture method is developed. /Presence/ is good to stick on team leaders, to help team cohesion, since I'm going for a teammate-heavy build. /Sex God/ is something I'd normally opt out of, if it wasn't for the implication that the trial will be sex-heavy. /Privacy/ is surprisingly awesome for the cost, it effectively prevents information leaks. /Waifu x16/ is a core part of my build, I'll explain the rationale behind this later. /Harem/ and /Hearts and Minds/ both pair well with teammate-heavy builds. /Buying in Bulk/ pairs well with one waifu in particular. /Better Together/ is just an incredibly obvious one to pick, now they have to take down two of me in order to win, which is a lot harder to do. Getting a clone for only 40 anima is an absolute steal. /Fluffsville/ is another ultra-useful one to get, to prevent fates worse than death. /Home Sick/ might be worthwhile, because 500 bucks worth of stuff from the character's homeworld, times 40 or so team members, /every month/, for however many years the trial lasts, means we'll be swimming in miscellaneous useful trinkets. /French Maid x5/ seems sensible to get, because with 40 or so teammates, somebody's going to need to be doing homemaking. /Cursed With Awesome/, /Always Be Prepared/, and /You are not Alone/ are ultra-ultra-essential choices.

Taken Boons without Explanations: (they just look straightforwardly good) /Relentless x2/, /Lazy Body-Building/, /No Bully/ (very flexible and cheap), /Mana Factory/, /Place of Power/, /Soul Gem Oven/, /Mana Tanks/ (yay mana), /Priorities/ (anti-akrasia power), /Chameleon/, /Synergy/, /Infiltrator/, /HUD/ (utility, also its free), /Gratz/, /Soulbound/, /AI Friend/

Untaken Boons without Explanations: (not worth cost) /Total Recall/, /Ready to Roll/, /Grand Theft Waifu/, /Domestication/, /Beautiful World/, /Leadership/, /Aura/, /Victim/, /Seduction/, /Morphologist/, /Poison-Proof/, /3d Piggu/, /Teacher's Pet/, /Erotic Norm/, /You Suck/, /Ebay/ (I don't really know what to get), /Prison of Love/, /Trapification/, /Hostile Takeover/, /Prep Time/, /Sidekick/, /Meta Human/, /Faith/, /Submission/, /Jocasta Complex/, /Xray Specs/, /King of Kong/, /100% Match/, /Chikan/, /Natural High/, /Foreplay/, /It's just Business/, /Vacation/, /One Waifu One Laifu/, /Like You Never Even Left/, /Toby/, /Tomboy Bonanza/, /Girl Next Door/, /Cupid's Arrow/, /Bad Girls/, /Christmas Come Early/, /Dynamic/, /Demographic Shift/, /A World of my own Design/, /Mary Sue/, /Dicked Over/, /Tastes Like Snozzberries/,

Untaken Boons with Explanations: /Pawn/ seems like it'd blow up in my face, I want to preserve the ability for teammates to disobey me if the advised action is just a really bad one. /Sod Cancer/ is a redundant one to have if everyone has Shards of Mortality immortality via /Cursed With Awesome/. /Soul Refraction/ is just dumb, don't have the key to your immortality projected outside of your body. /Indulgence/ makes you weak to sex-based foes, of which there will be a lot, bad choice. /Mummy will make it all Better/ and /Mental Landscape/ are both fine choices, just a bit overpriced and I had to drop something. /A Fucking Tank/ is just useless, because another tank is available in the items section, at lower cost, even before the half-off discount from /Be Prepared/ is applied.

A side note on Waifus: We can ask the question “what's the cost per power?”. For standard companions, the cost is 5 anima per power, dropping to 2.5 anima per power after the bonus from /You are not Alone/ is applied. This is /20x/ cheaper than acquiring the power yourself. Therefore, it makes sense to direct as many spare points as you can into acquiring companions, and waifus to have a massive team where, for any given power, /someone/ has it. If you just want to get as many powers as possible, the optimal strategy is an /extremely/ team-based build. Now, for waifus, assuming all the purchased powers are 50 anima, it comes out to about 16 anima per power, which is 3x more expensive than getting the power via a companion (pre-discount). Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the half-off discount from /You are not Alone/ applies to waifus as well (they're pretty clearly companions, and even after the discount, you're still paying 3x extra for a power instead of 6x). So this is why I bought 16 waifus. If you're trying to get as much magical firepower as possible, the optimal strategy is to distribute it among companions instead of trying to hoard it all yourself, because you can get 6 powers distributed amongst waifus for the price of having one for yourself. Also, /Buy in Bulk/ synergizes really well with having one of the sixteen be a giant character. You now have 12 hive-mind-linked giant characters, good for beating up large enemies, even taking into account the fact that they're only as strong as an average mortal (who is also a giant, so very strong indeed). So I'll refrain from giving a build for all of them individually, and just list stuff that /somebody/ on the waifu team knows. Also, of course I'm bringing over Harry from HPMOR, that's just a given.

Powers (personally): /Ferromancy/ (I'm a robot, of course I need metal-manipulation abilities), /Arcanomancy/ (metamagic is a force-multiplier), /Chronomancy/ (teleportation is already high-value, and time-magic is even higher value, this lets you pull off stuff like the hyperbolic time chamber, ultra-rapid movement, time-freezing enemies you don't want to deal with a.t.m.... It's unbelievably exploitable and high-value), /Technomancy/ (see other discussion, also it was free), /Destiny Magic/ (probability-manipulation is also stupidly useful), /Charisma/ (I've got a charisma penalty due to being an automaton, and am already not that good at it, might as well buff that), /Intelligence/ (duh), /Tactician/ (they literally have “Be a Munchkin” as a selectable choice), /Technophile/ (needed to pair with technomancy), /Magic Resistance/ (very helpful)

Items Selected With Explanation: /Custom Robot x4/ (I need backup bodies) /Mystery Box Rolls x17/ (the mystery box is +EV, the deck isn't. I got a pretty good haul including the Portable Black Hole, Subtle Knife, Seven League Boots, and Lodestone Network. Just by the description, it should be clear why these are really good to draw, it's basically a god-stalling WMD, ability for any teammate to go to any world, fast travel, and teleportation network.) /Crown of Great Adversary/ is one of the few known god-killing weapons, seems good to have around in a very secure location. /Staff of Defilement/ is something to whip out when you know you're going to lose to screw over the enemy, especially because there's another copy of me out there ready to exploit the spell of bad luck it induces. /Draklor Laboratory/ seems like one of the few places that'll easily serve as a base for 40 people that isn't a fixer-upper. /Tear of the Moon/ is hella useful for the whole horcrux reincarnation thing. /Throne of Want/ is good for the appropriate waifu, and /Eye of Leviathan/ is repurposed to summoning fish for the 12x giant waifu team to eat, their total food needs are pretty high even after Relentless x2.

Items Selected Without Explanation: /Iron Chef, Tough Love, World History Vol 1, Bestiary, Magic for Dummies x10, Usidore's Tome, Cerulean Guardian, Multiversal Laptop, Tricky Ricky, Sanitation Distributor, Lover's Rings, Dragon's Hoard, Babylon's Bane, Emelia's Reprive, Axe of the Gigas, Lordly Robes, Second Skin, Homonculus, Doll Making Kit, Crystal Ball, Starting Kit, Herb Garden, Personal Symphony, Ward of Sacrifice/

Items not Selected Without Explanation: /Ultimate Attire, Hardlight Projector, Blood Diamond, Soylent Green, Sacrificial Lamb, Another Fucking Tank, Alethiometer/ (I'm genuinely unsure about this one) /Cloranthy Ring, Midnight Lost Child, Chalice of Yunnx/ (although this one might be exploitable to get poison, or have blood donations from a pure child), /Dragon's Egg, Homonculus's Aria, Swan Song, The Good Shephard, Spear of the False Martyr/, All armor except /Lordly Robes, Second Skin/, /Fountain of Youth, Lot 2195, Student Chambers, King's App, Hemlock and Nightshade, Telescope of Dreamer, Obelisk MK2, ATV, Creator's Tablet, Go Home Brush, Prosthetic Limbs/
