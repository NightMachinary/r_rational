Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Every time you go to sleep, you wake up in the body of the next person to wake up. When your new body goes to sleep, you wake up in your original body. You don't get memories of the person whose body you borrow. The person whose body you borrow will not remember anything from while you were using it.

*** Well realistically the best you can hope to do with this is likely just to steal money from people that won't meaningfully affect their QOL, and also make slight attempts to improve people's lives quantum leap style. Maybe leave notes for the person when they get their body back about how to improve their life and give different explanations about what happened to them based on what their beliefs seem to be (so could be angelic possession, alternate personality, or something else).

Though in many cases the best plan to avoid affecting people's lives too much would be by avoiding much changes unless their life couldn't really get worse by thinking they had a fugue state. Then just getting really good at faking illness to avoid having to go to work for these people's jobs.

Presumably you don't die if the body you're temporarily inhabiting dies otherwise you would probably not last a decade before you end up in a body that dies while you're in it.

*** If you monitored when you went to sleep and figured out what your brainwaves look like when the switch is about to happen, you could use this power to impersonate specific people. Monitor yourself in a sleep study style environment and set a device so that when you are about to fall asleep it triggers a specific person to wake up. You could hijack their alarm clock, or if you're evil and don't worry about the person catching you, just kidnap them and give them adrenaline right as you fall asleep. You have to get it just right though since there will be so many people waking up at any given time. For hijacking specific people it would be best to jump at whatever time the least people are waking up but it would still be hard.

You could also tranquilize and awaken yourself multiple times to get extra tries.

I would consider storing tranquilizers in safety deposit boxes/drop sites near all major population centers where you can easily hide them. That way if you wake up somewhere or as someone you don't want to be you can exit. If you use the power to make lots of money, build a global satellite network for phones and itnernet with access to everyone and you'll almost never be stuck.

The biggest problem I see if you aren't going for specific people is the language barrier. You can mitigate this by going to sleep at a time when people in countries speaking your language are likely to be waking up, but there is a good chance someone wakes up at an odd time and you end up somewhere you don't speak the language.

Also if you had a spacecraft built and you volunteered to fly it you could use this for faster than light communication/shore leave.

** You are a leader of a secret organization, with contacts all around the world, funds counting in billions, and enough influence to match Illuminati.

Believing current rate of technological progress to be a danger to humanity in general (especially AI research), but not against science itself, what would you do to postpone the inevitable, without collapsing modern society in general?

*** Presumably if this sort of secret world government managed to arise in the first place then you have some pretty incredible means of controlling information and keeping secrets, which may imply mind control tech or something, but since I can't be sure what specific futuristic techs you might have I'll ignore that.

So if you want to focus on AI X-risk prevention you'll want to do some of the following: Realistically though the best plan will require that you stir up enough public fear that you can justify putting into place sweeping legislation that would mandate improvements to computer security (to prevent massive botnets from being an issue) as well as heavily controlling access to any supercomputers advanced enough to implement AGI.\\
This might be achieved by deliberately staging a false flag attack wherein you cause massive infrastructure damage using narrow AI and blame it on a primitive AGI. This will create the necessary fear to not draw undo public suspicion when you implement surveillance measures (though they wouldn't really need to be more invasive than current one's already are) to keep track of electricity and information bandwidth usage so you can sniff out any unauthorized work on AGI.

Of course the biggest component to this plan would be forcing all AGI research to be as part of an international organization as part of a secretive program like the manhattan project which employs basically everyone competent.

Anyway all this is hard to predict because the thing is if an organization competent enough to control the world and hide its existence really existed the world would look nothing like it does today, unless just for the evulz the world government is trying to make it look exactly like what you would expect from a world run by a bunch of national governments filled with morons and plagued by coordination problems.

*** Low billions or hundreds of billions? With low billions making an impact likely requires being rather underhanded; with high billions one can take nicer approaches like systematically buying out top AI researchers to work on something else.

**** If you run a secret world government how much money you have seems rather trivial, since you can just give yourself as much money as needed to accomplish a given goal. However it's doubtful you would need to spend any money at all anyway, since you are in cahoots with nearly every extremely powerful person and can have the national governments do whatever you want.

***** I'll admit that I don't have a very clear idea of how much influence the Illuminati would have, but my intuition was more on the scale of a few dozen members in high places, total membership in the low hundreds. Not quite at the level where you can thieve money limitlessly.

****** I mean I would think that the defining quality of the illuminati is supposed to be that they control all world governments and possess a near ubiquitous control over most everything.\\
After all the whole point of it as a conspiracy theory is to let people believe the problems in the world are the result of malevolence rather than being really complicated and hard to explain (well that and letting them feel superior).

Let's maybe go with high funds but no qualms about underhanded tactics?\\
Though, let's maybe add- "collapsing modern society" includes any effort to lobotomize the masses. Point is to avert apocalypse (through villainous means, but still), not cause it.

*** Assuming that its new or novel technologies that are the risk I would tr and get funding channeled into better implementation of current technologies. Try and build up a belief in academia and the general public that we've focused on abstraction too much (How many minds were wasted for decades on string theory who could have been amazing engineers and brought cheap electricity and clean water to the world?). This allows me to maximise general human happiness while avoiding existential risks.

If there are specific technologies I'm worried about I'd lobby behind the scenes to have them treated like chemical, nuclear and biological weapons. Putting in place something like the oversight organisations at the UN that exist for those, and have them limit it. The advantage of something like that is its self sustaining, once the major powers buy into it they have an incentive to keep it going to keep eachother from doing it

** You gain the ability to store mental copies down to atomic level of people you touch. You may swap any feature on yourself or any human you are touching for any correlating feature you have memorized, in whatever combination you wish, meaning you can perfectly copy anyone you have touched. The part you want to replace need to be more or less intact, ie. you could swap an injured arm out with a stored copy but you couldn't regrow a lost arm. Changes takes between 1-10 minutes depending on the scope of the change.

Some interesting uses of this power includes: the ability to create copies of any single person by overwriting another person, limited immortality by overwritting your body with a younger version of yourself, possibly accessing memories of people you have touched at the risk of overwriting yourself(do we know where memories are stored?). What's some other interesting uses?

Are skills, such as martial art, stored in one particular region of the brain that you can temporarily swap out?

***** Get Panacea to make an arm that cures cancer or something (whatever you can convince her to do) and copy that. Go around giving that to people with cancer.

Store backups of allies periodically and before big fights. If one dies, restore them via a body blank produced by some bio-tinker. This would be a game-changer for Endbringer fights, especially Behemoth.

Copying someone's Corona Pollentia/Gemma might let you give someone else their power, or remove their power. At the very least, it'd be better than [[/s][spoiler]].

******* If she can make a virus that cures a plague she's never seen before on the spot (and spread it via yuri), she can probably make one that cures cancer and spreads via arms. Her power has basically no limits on what she can do with biology, she's just too scared to go through with doing anything.

It works on mobile for me. Try hovering over it and look at the URL?

***** Not super familiar with Worm, but if it is part of your brain you should be able to copy the power to other people, correct? If so, mass producing immortality might be on the table.

You are a near perfect healer of anything that doesn't outright kill someone or removes parts of their body, provided you have a backup of this person stored. So find someone you trust not to go crazy with this power (you do /not/ want to put this power in the hands of random people), then give it to them and start making copies of this person by overwriting terminally ill, comatose or severely brain damaged people.

There is something like 250 work days in a year so, assuming a regular 40 hour work week and one rejuvenation/medical intervention needed every ten years, one copy should be able to maintain 120.000 people. At current word population that means we have to find about 60.000 people willing to become a donor body.

I don't know if we currently have enough valid candidates on the planet, especially since a large number of people that would now be considered terminally ill can be healed with this power even without having a backup in place, so you might initially have to resort some deal-with-the-devil type arrangements ("we can heal your child, but only if one of you is willing to give up their life"). Morally that's kind off a dark shade of gray, but ultimately, the benefits do dramatically outweigh the costs.

*** Depends on their values, as the other person said.

Generically, I'd say toss enough in a sufficiently diversified index fund that they could live indefinitely on the interest at their preferred level of comfort and then do direct work on areas that best satisfy their preferences. ~3 million USD will get you high-5 figures/low 6-figures safe withdrawal rate less capital gains tax, which could set you up anywhere from comfy to lavish depending on where in the world you live.

If they don't believe themselves capable of doing direct work, they could still live off investments but otherwise earn to give, or just donate the lot to their preferred charities if especially altruistic.
