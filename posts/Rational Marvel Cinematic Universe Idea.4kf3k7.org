** Quicksilver and/or Iron Man.

Remember how Tony has a fleet of autonomous iron suits? And imagine how much better they'd be if there was no need for life support for a weak human in it? And just imagine how much stuff Tony could get done if he didn't have to spend all his time wrestling monsters?

And Quicksilver... Dont even get me started on movie quicksilver.

*** Rational versions of those characters would be very powerful, but I'm not sure they'd be the most interesting. Spiderman would work well, I think, since he is an engineer type without a lot of resources, and is a late entrant to a game with a bunch of very powerful players.

**** A rational (more or less) speedster character had been (is being) done in [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][/Fall of Doc Future/]] web-trilogy; and it wasn't as conflict-crippling as you'd expect. The focus just generally moved from [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][sub-optimal stuff]] like fighting [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek][monsters of the week]] to things like preventing the world from careening into any of the parallel-universe lines in which human civilisation ends or changes too drastically (not much of a spoiler, since it pretty much gets highlighted in the Prologue).

I actually kept comparing Quicksilver to Flicker (the above mentioned speedster) in his (in)actions during my watch of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_Apocalypse][X-Men: Apocalypse,]]/ and Quicksilver --- the cinematic version, at least --- never came out as the advantageous. Even on his crowning scene of awesome the portrayal of his actions was a bit underwhelming. Which is a bit frustrating because they likely had a whole group of people working on the film's scenario, while the web-novels are written by a single person.

**** I like your idea for Spiderman, especially as he is portrayed in Civil War, where he developed his webbing himself. Why stop there? A good portion of the story could be filled by Peter Parker trying to acquire resources to build even more gadgets and devices, really playing up on the 'tinker/scientist' aspect of his character in a way I haven't seen anywhere else :).

** Give creative thinking to the characters who already have the most raw power and you aren't left with much of a story. Iron Man's idiot ball carries the entire franchise ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless][and setting]]).

(Iron Man also has the "tinker" rationalfic problem in that we have no idea about his limits. Whatever the obstacle, the first question becomes "could Tony build a device that neutralizes it?" and the answer is pure author fiat.)

Same problem if you give rationality to a leader or close friend of those individuals; that just passes the bucket.

I'd rather give rationality to a second-fiddle character. Ant-Man could be interesting (though you'd have to rewrite his entire origin story...). Maybe the Hulk, just because I have no idea how to best leverage the ability to turn into an uncontrollable unstoppable monster and I would like to find out. Most of the mutants/X-Men are also valid choices, if we get to cross the streams.

And rational!Kilgrave as an antagonist, for the nightmares.

*** Kilgrave already seems relatively rational, its just that his goals are very low Tier.

** OP removed his question, for some reason. I'm not sure what the netiquette is on this, but here's the essential part, at least:

#+begin_quote
  [..] I couldn't help but notice that marvel has no actual rational thinkers, and yet is such a good setting for them. [..] which character [..] do you think would make the most interesting protagonist for a rational Marvel fic?
