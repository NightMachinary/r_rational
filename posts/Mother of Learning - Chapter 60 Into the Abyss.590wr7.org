** Really good chapter. Worth the wait. I particularly enjoyed how well Xvim did against every attack thrown at him. And the shield breaker spell he used seems really useful if it isn't extremely hard to do.

More generally: what do you think Zorian should do next to improve his magic? Personally, I think he should learn the Force Lance spell well enough that it becomes nearly invisible like he did with the force bolt. He doesn't have much mana, so making a spell designed to destroy shields seems important. Another thing is he could try to make that hexagonal sectioned shield Zach taught him to spin. The spell he was taught remains static when one of the panels goes down, meaning it's relatively simple to aim for that hole. Making it spin could mean that any holes would be incredibly hard to hit. The spell is less useful against omnidirectional attacks, but judging by this chapter those are rare to be used on individual people.

*** I mean, hunting down the cultists, Veyers and the keys to the Sovereign Gate strikes me as more of a priority for now.

As for cool magic though, I think most of Alanic's spells would require too much training and mana (fire bird, fire bullets) or soul sight. The big exception, of course, are those golden orbs that can actually affect the lich. But if they scare Quatach Ichl, there's probably some soul magic component to them, requiring soul sight.

Xvim's spells on the other hand, seem really useful. Those shield-breaking blue bullets? The dark green 'sticky' shield? The dispel-resistant explosive orb? The way he slapped away the lich's spell? The dimensional gate? The dispelling barrier? They're probably all very specialised spells and not easy to learn, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to have them in a fight. (Also, did anyone else notice Xvim didn't use any gestures when he created the gate? He cast the 'pinnacle of dimensional magic' either reflexively or with an unstructured spell.)

*** I definitely think he needs to look into becoming a shifter/transformation mage for physical abilities, he's just so immobile. He also needs to learn how to make that coin that Kael made.

As for pure magic, it has to be learning dimensional spells. Even though they are expensive to cast he is really good at spell formula which can offset the costs dramatically by creating a hasting item beforehand.

Being able to properly defend himself also looks like a priority, and unstructured magic too as he could use that while transformed.

**** I believe the coin has been discussed before. The thing about spell formula is that you can't make an object to do something you can't do yourself. The coin involves soul magic, and Zorian only knows soul perception and defense. IIRC, the only way to gain soul sight, the prerequisite to learning soul magic fully, is to either be born with the ability or take that one potion with the ingredient that only occurs every other decade.

I agree about getting better mobility. He can't really gain muscle mass while in the time loop, so a mobile transformation form would be very useful. Even a potion would be decent.

I don't think we've really seen the type of spells dimensional magic gives, aside from variations of teleportation and the one redirection thing Xvim did.

Better defenses if definitely important, and he can ask Xvim about it, but it's a little non-specific. He doesn't seem to have any glaring weaknesses in the defense category, and I'm not sure of any low hanging fruit he could grab to make himself even better.

Ooh, just had a thought: sound seems to travel normally through most barriers right? Or at least around them? Maybe he could weaponize sound waves for a method of making people deaf.

***** I'd say as long as he could get the design for the coin from Kael, Zorian could mass-produce them most of the way and have Alanic or Kael put the finishing touches on it.

This chapter has highlighted that while Zorian isn't bad at anything in particular, there's still a lot he can learn from the likes of Alanic, Zach, and Xvim. But I think he'd still be best off focusing on his mind magic, outside of certain opponents with immunity/high resistance, it stills gives him the best result for its cost. And his experience with the Aranea shows that he still has room for advancement.

****** I'm not sure about continuing to focus on mind magic. Yes, it has innumerable uses, but I think he's getting to a point of diminishing returns. Right now, he's a better mind mage than any human he's ever heard of. He can take down people who have invested their lives in defensive magic in a few minutes, and he broke through the shields of the most heavily defended non-psychic he's ever seen in what, 30 seconds? At this point, in term of combat, I'm not sure what else he has to gain beside taking down shields quicker. While the non-combat uses could still use honing, for combat I think he's about as good as he's going to get, and time spent for combat magic should focus on other things.

Also, spending more time on combat magic means he can make spell formula to cast those spells. Easier to make an elaborate offensive or defensive spell into an item rather than spend time to cast it in combat.

But for Zorian, mind magic /is/ combat magic. It's his strength, and most enemies' weakness.

Yes, he can break through anyone's shields - if they're a sitting duck. 30 seconds is unacceptable in combat, though. And after breaking through, there's the matter of efficiently utilising the puppet, doing as much damage as possible before they get taken out. Or multiple puppets; surely he can handle more and more of them as he continues to practise?

Then there's his mind sense. It was indispensable, this time around, in detecting invisible/underground foes. Does its range increase with practice?

If Zorian does fall back on Xvim's notebooks, he'll want to be able to read people's minds efficiently and as non-destructively as possible.

And what about Zach's mind? /If/ Zach ever lets him in, he'll need as much skill as possible in handling memories. And if RR left any mental booby traps...

Mind magic still has a fantastic ROI, in my opinion.

***** But a bullet can.

There was a time when Zorian toyed with the idea of enchanting the projectile and came to conclusion that it was too hard at the time. It may be from hard to impossible to make truly potent explosive ammo due to size limitations, but the soul coin is a low-energy project. It could be fit in a high caliber ammunition. The gun itself could be enhanced since it is not constrained by size, namely the barrel could be reinforced and gunpowder alchemically boosted.

The benefit of a gun is that it is /really/ fast. You can dodge arrows and magical projectiles. Firearms can't be dodged, not without preemptive temporal acceleration. That moment when he spotted the lich in the beginning of this chapter, he really could use a sniper gun.

Worth a shot, at least.

Magical animals have a much stronger mind than a normal animal so the instincts would carry over more strongly. There's a reason shifters choose normal animals. Grey hunters are ridiculously aggressive and territorial by default. Do you really want to turn Zorian into a hermit when this is all over?

Close. I think, more specifically, he made Sudomir flinch and lose control, then took control himself and /piloted/ the dragon into the ground.

Eventually Sudomir recovered enough to regain control (because he had more equipment), which is when the dragon started struggling against the living metal cords.

Taking control of the dragon might indeed be feasible, and would be quite awesome, but it would first require getting past whatever security is on the thing. Zorian's previous expeditions didn't even reveal its presence.

Additionally, this may be the case in groups that aren't available for recruitment by Alanic and Xvim. I can see this with some top level black ops type group, perhaps with Black Room access.

Far more affordable and reliable to teach it in schools and recruit, or closely watch, those who have the dedication for it.

Peers of Xvim also aren't going to have the time or interest, already being highly skilled themselves.

Or maybe the extremely potent defensive spells require shaping skills so good that battle mages never bother reaching that point. It's no secret Xvim is ungodly good at shaping. Battle mages seem to prioritize shaping large amounts of mana very quickly, not shaping skill in general. So if the upper tiers of defensive magic are gated by the extreme amounts of shaping skill required, a battle mage would never get to them, or those that do would be obscenely rare.

This.

Consider how Xvim talks about the state of magical education. Sure, some of that is just his drill-sergeant approach to the first few months of mentorship, but I'm sure that it's partly sincere. There aren't many mages with the dedication to reach Xvim-like skills.

To make matters worse, we know that large mana pools make shaping harder - and battlemages are likely to have high mana pools, on average, because it's generally a big advantage.

So, your typical battlemage is going to have a fair bit of mana, enjoys blowing things up, and focuses on quick casting and group efforts. Perfectionism, precision and subtlety are not in the job description.

******** From what we saw of Xvim in combat I find it hard to believe that a dedicated defensive battle mage would not be beneficial for the vast majority of battle groups and armies.

With that in mind a full time battle mage should have vastly more time than Xvim (who has to spend time with who knows how many students) and be more than capable of surpassing someone who is doing exactly the same as they do except they also have a burden of teaching.

Unless we're missing some special R&D that means that Xvim supremely benefits from educating children I don't see how it's a better scenario.

I said else where that I could reasonably expect that a Professor of X, where X is a non-combat field, could understandably be on the cutting edge of magic and surpass any other mage. Basically cases where it's economically disadvantageous to be fully up to date and without any state pressure in doing it anyway (as with military tech) I would expect those teaching to be ahead.

********* I agree that large groups should have dedicated defensive people, I'm just postulating Xvim is on another level to the point where it really makes a difference. Alanic specializes in fire magic, and while other people may be really good at fire magic, he is so good with it that he can make gigantic birds of flame that act of their own accord, or make bullets that burst into intense fireballs.

I'm not sure that a defensive mage who spends their time in a combat role would be better than a professor of the same specialization. During the assault on Iasku manor fight, that special wall that was made of gel or something came up. It could block every attack to at least some extent, which for someone tasked with defending a group is better than narrower spells that block only certain types of attacks. So a defensive battle mage would focus on shields that work against lots of attacks, can form quickly, and are hard to dispel. Xvim, on the other hand, can spend time to learn shields that are extremely effective at blocking a narrow range of spells. In a large fight, he focuses on negating the especially powerful spells, while the regular battle mages soak up most of the damage with shields that can work against basically anything.

He can also spend time casting the more specialized shields, because he doesnt need to maintain the larger ones. In an army, it's better to pour all your effort into making sure the main shield stays up rather than trying to block every single attack in the most efficient way.

********* Well, if I look at some of the teachers I had at university. They teach 8 hours a week and spend the rest of time researching, so they have a lot of time to work on research.

I'd imagine that any full time battle mage would also spend a lot of time working as a battle mage (more than 8 hours a week) and while they get experience when working, they don't necessarily get the time to be more creative. There's also the question of talent, someone who rises to be a teacher at the most prestigious university is usually an extremely talented researcher. In the case of Xvim, they clearly didn't chose him because he was a great teacher but because he was very good at what he does.

It's entirely possible that there's a huge variation in individual skills between mages and that Xvim is far ahead of the bell curve. In that case, someone with his talent is more likely to do some prestigious work than be a battle mage. So there may be a very few battle mages with his talent but they'd be in demand and not necessarily available

Xvim does not lack coordination, coherence or communication, or anything that you would expect from not working with battle mages day in day out.

Xvim happening to not only be incredibly specifically useful for Zorian but also fantastic in combat even though he hasn't fought in battle in 50 years or whatever but it doesn't matter because he's just naturally talented.

***** I read through the conversation and I have to say that you made me reexamine the battle again. This time looking for inconsistencies in power levels.

And while I agree that Xvim is basically described as equal to Zach/QI(each in their respective field), to me it seems entirely plausible.

This answer got to long... and probably not very coherent as it's already late... but I might as well finish it:)

--------------

Lets talk about IRL army first. You seem to assume the a random soldier has more time than a random teacher. This is simply not true. During my time in the army intelligence forces I can without a doubt say that 99%of the combat forces, have less free time than the a random teacher. And rarely is there any individual training as most combat will be done in large groups. Nonetheless, in the few times there is free time or individual training it is usually used for lazying around. Only in the movies is the regular G.I soldier actually motivated or focused on getting better/stronger/faster.

The only soldiers who focus on individual training are the 1% of specialized forces,the so called elite forces, who are rarely combat oriented.

The few times I experienced combat I had to focus on my specialization while the rest fought around me. And I was always supersized how unsupervised I was the moment gun fire started, leaving me to do what I do best.

So going back into the story, lets assume that while the battlemages gathered were not elite soldiers, they were still better than the average battalmage. I asume that because elite forces rarely work in numbers as large as a 100 or more. Usually teams b/w 6-12. This would mean the battleages gathered are strong as a group and not individualy. Which is clearly demonstrated in the initial assault on the Hole before QI joined the battle, where they show themselves to be very well equipped at handling anything thrown at them.

However being army trained... they shouldn't be expected to be able to deal with exotic magic like the one QI uses. As army training focuses on the most efficient and effective way to fight, everything other then the norm and you call in the special forces for the task. So while real life has anti-air forces, anti-tank, sniper units and etc. QI being the litch that he is, is the equivalent of Iron-Man suddenly dropping down and wrecking havoc. No army trained personnel is trained or equipped to handle something like that.

Xvim on the other hand... being the Defensive/Unstructured magic expert/Archmage... is the perfect counter to QI. So while fighting against a large group, Xvim didn't really shine... when there was only one opponent for him to focus on, his specialization let him outperform any above average battlemage.

Now about the end fight where he died... I think it was because he wasn't afraid of dying(he does know about the loop after all) allowed him to take risks any other battlemage wouldn't and this let him be matched against the opposing mages. Or at least help enough until Zach recovered.

--------------

Another thing about Xvim being so much stronger than the rest, as has been mentioned by many before me, it is the result of the unstructured magic he is so good at controlling.

An army trained battlemage would have only a set amount of prelearned spells that are supposed to serve him in as many situations as possible. An army trained defense specialist would be the same. The army can't afford, money or time, to make each individual mage their own personal training program. You either fit in the mold or you are kicked out. Personal styles have little to do in an army setting.

This also means that compared to Xvim who works to master his craft an army defense mage would have to master working in formation. That means most of his time would be dedicated to team maneuvers and group exercises instead of individual polishing of his spells.

So Xvims prowess lies in his focus on unstructured magic. Something the army simply doesn't care about as all they care about is... structured magic that they can train as many as possible in.

Look how much stronger did Zorian become because of learning unstructured magic. If we assume that due to the loop he is as old as your average battlemage, he is clearly much stronger that a whole squad of them. Why? Mind magic obviously... but even w/o it Zorian has enough weird spells/formulas/tricks to take out large numbers of opponents time and time again.

So from what I've read so far during MoL fights, unstructured magic & thinking out of the box is stronger than structured magic. and good teamwork. This however, is something not suitable for the army. As forcing the army to focus on maximizing individual strengths is not something it likes doing and is the least of the problem.

So its not that Xvim is suddenly so much better then everyone else. It's that when it comes to defending against exotic opponents he always was the best and this was just his first opportunity to shine.

--------------

Also, I think that this is supposed to be a very sudden and unexpected fight for the reader. And while for us who wait three weeks b/w chapters it doesn't seem so, for someone who is binge reading the whole book from scratch this fight will have popped out of nowhere. The first mention of it was at the end of the last chapter I think and then suddenly this chapter happens. Talk about a climex:)

The cubes are likely very expensive, and on such short notice, Zorian wasn't able to make that many. I expect next time, they'll be able to equip their force with more specialized gear.

Also, it's worth noting that if QI hadn't been present, these types of battlemages would have done a fine job.

Lastly, even Zach points out that Xvim doesn't do much in the way of delivering damage; he mostly soaks up damage. So, I don't think he'd necessarily outclass those battlemages in damage output over an extended period of time. I bet you most of them have large mana reserves and less fine control.

******* I think the key distinction here is /group/ vs /individual/ tactics. The army focuses on group tactics - and this chapter has evidence that they're good at it. QI and Xvim, on the other hand, are exceptional individuals, one because he's a thousand years old and the other because he's a perfectionist with a killer work ethic (and a fair bit of experience).

Remember how Zorian gave Kirielle a mana absorption cube for training? Apparently the academy doesn't use them - because instead they mass-produce the glass spheres, which are more economical.

I remember, back when I played Baldur's Gate, one of the unimportant books around the place mentioned the existence of a mercenary army in the region - wearing studded leather armor. Now, why would they do that, when full plate - or even regular plate - is much more effective? Well, it's probably because studded leather is much more economical /en masse/.

What makes sense for one is different to what makes sense for many.

Also, he might train, or might have trained, special forces for all we know, and it might be an aspect of his career kept mum.

In other words, I'm thinking of Xvim as a sword duelist and the soldiers as . . . solders. The duelist is likely to be better in certain ways. Whose better? A guy who views his job as being a soldier, or a guy who obsessively researches and practices combat magics, focusing on what makes combat magic work at a fundamental level so that he can hack offensive spells, rendering them useless? That's what a defensive specialist does, yeah?

Also, if the soldiers in MoL are anything like soldiers IRL, they work eight hours per day, and only some of that time is spent on combat training.

A few friends of mine are veterans, and they said that often times, they work eight hours a day or so, and there's a lot of time spent on cleaning, loading, transporting, guarding, etc., and only some time spent training and conditioning. They said basic training is like a bootcamp, whereas being a soldier was like having a 9-to-5 job, at least when on base.

***** I agree that Alanic, Xvim, Zach, and Zorian are seem to be doing surprisingly well compared to all the rest of the battle mages.

Plenty of comments here arguing plausible because Xvim is awesome. I don't disagree with that. But there are other possibilities why the rest of the battle mages seem less capable:

- There is an invasion going on elsewhere. Maybe the Army's heroic tier battle mages are elsewhere fighting the rest of the invasion force.

- Maybe they chose mid tier battle mages for this mission. If there was some other heroic mage who didn't know about the time loop or understand the mission, and he started taking charge that could be a disaster.

- There is still an army of enemy mages in the battle as well as QI. The rest of the Cyorians were probably under orders to continue fighting them, while our 4 heros took on QI.

- The narrative focused on those 4. It didn't really show the others being particularly effective or ineffective. No one in the group was taking much damage until QI entered the battle. Maybe our four characters just seemed better because the none of the other battle mages cool stuff was highlighted.

  #+begin_quote
    the battle group didn't lose a single person
  #+end_quote

- Maybe the Army does have a defensive specialist mage for important missions, and maybe his name is Xvim. Maybe if he wasn't already involved they would have called him up to fight a lich. Quite plausible they decided he wouldn't be needed for Sudomir earlier because he is a necromancer.

And to make the capability gap plausible from a different approach (making it smaller); Xvim died. There would have been plenty of Cyorian Army mages still alive and fighting.

Well I'm glad there's someone else who at least shares some what of my perspective, I was beginning to believe I read stories in a unique to everyone else here.

Your other comments are more of what I was looking for in terms of rationale. I will try to make it clear that it's not that I think that none of those aren't true, it's just that to me it was not conveyed in that manner.

In particular the importance of the push to the ritual I was believed (and of course I could read this wrongly) to be the primary purpose of their goal. It makes complete sense even if people don't believe about time travel to attempt to focus on the primordial ritual.

Previous chapter puts Alanic clearly in command, and Xvim maybe second. That doesn't necessarily correspond to skill, but I wouldn't be surprised if more capable mages had equal/higher ranks relative to Alanic/Xvim and wouldn't likely be placed under their command.

More impact if he wasn't alone with Z&Z - and Zach resting for half of it - and Zorian gathering intel half the time, yeah - certainly. But he still died. At least he died doing what he loved, defending against magic :)

******* I think I'm starting to understand where you're coming from.

The best in universe explanation I can come up with is that the army is not at full potential.

Their military forces have been crippled by the Splinter Wars and the Weeping that followed. Zach and Veyers both came from strong military families and they weren't the only ones that were mostly wiped out.

The politics are much different too. It's only very recently -thanks to the mage academy - that the central government has as much power as it does. So they don't have full control over the military like our governments do.

This was the first opportunity for many first generation mages to be trained properly, and the majority that go through the academy will side with the government rather than the interests of a Noble house they don't belong too.

Noble houses had a lot of influence, and while they each contributed to the military, they would not have shared their house secrets or abilities for general use by other military members.

Alanic was a warrior priest so even the church has it's own independent military force.

Mages don't share knowledge very well. I'm sure there were quite a few specialist houses that are now lost. The black room training facilities are probably the only reason their military is as strong as it is now.

Edit: Again, to reinforce my earlier point. Xvim was awesome but he isn't a powerhouse that outperforms the Cyorian army.

"You know, you and Xvim are pretty much no use in this fight, except as damage magnets," Zach said. ..."And I reckon Alanic and his men could hold their ground without me."

I hope these kinds of questions will come up in the next chapter, so I'm very glad you're bringing up this topic.

I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of backlash, though, is because there are a lot of potential reasons to justify the chapter. I just wish these reasons were made a little more explicit, but in the context of an action-heavy chapter, I don't think it would have been appropriate to slow down the plot by explaining everything.

Nothing is, of course, but I've been re-reading (to proofread), and I think the author actually /did/ address all these issues pretty well in chapter 2.

Ilsa talks about how unstructured magic is the ideal, maximally flexible, but much slower and harder to learn, so they teach structured spells. Then Kyron talks about how he isn't even going to teach combat invocations, because they're too slow; for him, combat magic is all about channeling lots of mana quickly through a spell formula.

Xvim is what happens when someone is dedicated enough to actually learn unstructured magic properly. Instead of chasing low-hanging fruit, he has pursued skills like raw mana sensing, which, he explained to Zorian, will gradually improve every kind of spellcasting. His shaping skills are pretty much unrivalled as far as we know. All of his spells appear to be cast with an ease that is normally associated with reflexive magic.

But that kind of standard is so demanding that practically all of his students hate him.

Oh, it certainly wasn't wasted effort. They've learned a lot:

- The location of the ritual platform. Maybe they can come sooner next time, and with more numbers.
- The value of a robust anti-teleportation ward for fighting QI. Booby-trapping it with soul magic is a great idea, [[/u/Cheese_Ninja]]. Also lots of general tactical information about what worked against him (absorption cubes, Xvim's drill) and what didn't (they need to find a counter for his temporal acceleration).
- The names and addresses of two of the shifter children. The more of them ZZ can protect during the month, the harder it will be to make the ritual work, and the more likely that the cult will overextend itself.

Plus, of course, next time Zach will have better soul defences, Zorian will have a better idea of how to quickly break into the summoner's mind, etc.

Zorian's actions:

3. Mentalist attacks against enemy mages.
4. Telepathically tracking flank attacks and QI's movements.
5. Anti-teleportation field that both succeeded in preventing QI from teleporting (which shouldn't be easy, and which was done thanks to Xvim's dimensional training), and succeeded in withstanding QI's initial dispel (again, thanks to Xvim's training).
6. Mind-controlling the giant lizards.

- he can't communicate with the ritual squad because of the hole's interference and if he left in pursuit he would leave his elite mage squad for dead.

Zorian makes sure every mage has a teleportation ward. This time, the wards don't have to be made hastily and so might be able to resist the information feedback property of QI's special dispel and be less easily destructible.

In addition, ZZX(A) can carry several well-made anti-teleportation wards, each with slightly different properties. During the main battle, Zorian can experiment with activating different ones and see which wards QI cannot punch through.

Next, they teleport to the ritual site and QI can't follow.

They teleport in, drop the invisible grenades as a timer, offer token distance to the RRs, teleport out like they're retreating. They reengage QI, meanwhile the grenades blow up. It's a two-fer.

It's also possible that the ritual site had powerful anti-teleportation fields too. That may be why QI didn't follow.

I suppose, if it came down to "soulkill the lich or you won't get the keys in time to escape", then they'd have to do it, but that would mean that they'll really struggle in the real world.

It is still a great idea. If they ever manage to master the soul eject button, they should use it whenever they don't feel like wasting time while getting the keys. If the dragon Zach killed in the first arc (and wasted ton of restarts) has a key in his treasury, instead of fighting it again just soul eject it and get whatever you need. Same with Q-I, as well. Suppose they get good enough to fight the lich, but he keeps fleeing whenever things don't go his way, and therefore the crown remains unattainable. At that point it is very sensible to use the eject switch.

** Many here are feeling that mind magic had reach a plateau in term of offensive power. I feel that mind magic have the potential to be the single most OP power in the story.

Previously we learnt that many aranean settlement's matriarch had focus their mind magic abilities inwards to make better decision making and finer control over their memories. Shouldn't zorian be highly focusing on this? If he increase his own memories and critical thinking to a higher level on par with a supercomputer, he could have easily learn and /master/ powerful spells in mere days, having finer control of his mana.

Furthermore, in the previous chapters mentioned that using ambient mana as an alternative source of power will corrupt host mind to be insane while the soul and body will be relatively safe from corrupt. If zorian could tune his mind to be like a transformer for power stations. he could be the single most powerful mage in the story. Throwing unlimited artillery spells with a single flick of finger as long as there are high ambients.

This is just a theory of the potential of mind magic

Curiously, i like to know whether mana shaping allows you to feel, contain and concentrate ambient mana with your own personal mana. The higher the concentration, the faster one could regenerate mana. If zorian could create a layer of ultra high density of mana around him,solving his mana reserves problem. This might need insanely good mana shaping and perception skills of the likes of xvim or even better.

In short, how does ambient mana be converted to one's own mana naturally? Is sitting down and wait really just a natural way of increasing ambient mana concentration in the surrounding of the host?

Lastly, do you age inside a black room? its seems to slow down time and not slow down biological age. Wouldn't the drawbacks of multiple uses be huge and taxing on the host body? And could a pure soul be anchored inside the black room for necromancy training?

TL; DR mind magic could use to turn the brain into super computers and transformers for unlimited firepower. shape mana like a container a gas can for better recovery rate.

Mana reserve regeneration according to nobody103:

#+begin_quote
  It takes anywhere between 30 minutes and 3 hours for a mage to regenerate their mana reserves from total zero to full if ambient mana levels are sufficiently plentiful, depending on their personal skill and willingness to risk mana poisoning. This is unaffected by the size of one's mana reserves - those will higher reserves will simply regenerate more mana per minute.
#+end_quote

Anything above a rank 2 or 3? mana well allows for max recovery speed for a human mage. Above that, higher ranked wells just allow for more mages and more devices/wards powered by ambient mana. There's a chapter where they mention that Cyoria's major appeal is that it allows for any number of mages and magic research institutions since it's a rank 9? mana well.

Inside the black room they should perceive time as passing normally. So if they're in there for a month they'll age for a month, not sure what you mean by "host body" in this case.

  - It seems likely the inner circle mages have some sort of soul magic anyway, which may require special consideration

- The ritual may be to contain the Primordial. Alternatively, disrupting it while it is half-complete could create a disastrous backlash (i.e. they need to stop the invasion way sooner)

**** The story demands that the mentor dies. The chapter has been climactic enough to give him a proper send-off, and with such focus on Xvim as in recent chapters it would be strange to keep repeating that for the next iterations.

Ultimately the story comes first, there surely will be some way of handwaving "the ability used by QI interferes with the reset mechanism", in line with QI's ability to affect loop mechanics in the first place (including Zorian).

Story demands nothing. Dying mentor is just one cliche plot revolution that a lot of stories use. It's not /necessary/ for the story to progress.

I disagree. The story is all about resetting the consequences of the Controllers' actions each month. Zorian himself has died horribly on a number of occasions. Xvim wasn't really sacrificing himself, in the usual sense; he was aware that he would be reset, and he simply did his best to help the Controllers learn more before that happened.

#+end_quote

Seriously? Repetition is /never/ strange in this story.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if this assault gets retried several times, like Zorian's infiltration of Iasku Mansion, learning more and progressing further each time.

It wasn't even QI who killed Xvim. And there were no signs of soul magic. And the random cultist who cast the spell surely wasn't a Controller. So we can be quite confident that the Gate will make a fresh copy of Xvim without any trouble.

Actually, I assumed that it was something primordial-related. The ritual was interrupted and the red sphere was behaving oddly. Either exploding, or tripping one of the conditions for the loop reset, seems like a logical outcome.

Why not transmog his body to be better permanently, alll drawbacks of simply physical modification dissapear after the end of the month. Unless I have forgotten something it should be possible.

Yes, the loop would fix it, so it would be possible for Zorian to experiment, but I really think that worthwhile results would take much longer than he has available.
