For those of you who don't know what [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter][it]] is. Assume for the sake of this conversation there is some sort of great filter. What kind of events, if any, do you think they're likely to be? The discovery of nuclear war, rampant pollution, hostile AI, or something else entirely?


** This unnamed story by Scott Siskind proposes a possibility: [[http://www.raikoth.net/Stuff/story1.html]]

I recall reading somewhere that properly-constructed Dyson Spheres could be detected only by the gravitational effects. In fact, with only the instruments currently at our disposal there would be no way for us to distinguish a galaxy with a lot of Dyson Spheres from a galaxy with a lot of dark matter.

(In which case there's really not so much of a Filter as we think)

I can't remember where I read this, though, and don't know enough to say whether it's total BS (I would be happy to hear one way or another).

I'm also not yet sure if, once you get to the point of crossing interstellar distances, it isn't easier to just /create/ your own habitats rather than terraform big hunks of rock. In which case there may be any number of civilizations out there but they're leaving the star systems clear for potential future life.

(I can't remember where, but there's a scifi story where the alien civilizations have developed a sort of Prime Directive that doesn't allow any kind of interference in a system that has the potential to bear life on its own).

** Snarky answer: Anti-Spiral invasions.

Real answer: I think that if one does exist and we're not just missing something huge, we probably passed it already. There are too many coincidences in our evolutionary history that created just the right kind of creatures to form a cooperating, advancing civilization.

** A solar system's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment][Late Heavy Bombardment-equivilent]] event(s) go wrong -- too late, too long, or too severe.

Also, there's the issue of not getting enough large gas giants in the correct orbits to both use up material (ours are about 99% of planetary material between them) and sweep the growing star system (relatively) clean of early rogue debris.

Ironically, our gas giants are also thought to have caused those bombardment events I mentioned earlier. And just after they stopped, life started on Earth.

But not having large gas giants at all could result in many, many more ongoing life-ending global disasters from huge loose rocks nuking potential life bearing "Goldilocks zone" rocky planets -- potentially even blowing off their developing atmospheres. Complex life never even stands a chance between extinction events before the star goes "foom".

These relate mostly to "delicate, rare" life origin scenarios, but agree with observed facts.

** I think it's probably behind us: The evolution of "intelligent" life.

The kind of sapience you need to start poking at the laws of physics is something that you either have or you don't. Evolution is all about incremental improvements. So there's really not much reason for intelligence to evolve. It was a series of coincidences that our ancestors got into circumstances where their brains could grow unimpeded.

I mean, take insects. They've been around for hundreds of millions of years, and they currently outmass mammals by an order of magnitude. Yet individually they're dumber than a sack of hammers. Even actions that seem clever in-context are driven by instinct have no real thought behind them - insects can't adapt to new situations.

I think if we ever discover life in other star systems, we'll see a lot of things as dumb as insects.

** If AGI is possible within a few centuries of technological revolution, this together with fairly conservative estimates via the Drake equation would suggest there should have been a plethora of civilizations out there (at least billions) who would have done it by now. Which we don't see.

So either AGI is extremely unlikely, we are in some sort of nature preserve, there are harder limits on intelligence than we currently believe, civilizations always go extinct before then, (intelligent) life is far rarer than we thought in the first place, or my favorite: we're just seeing a very strong anthropic selection effect; we're the only ones here because you just don't expect to find yourself in a universe with most flavors of recursively self-improving superintelligence. Not that I actually give this strong credence, but it's pretty interesting at least.

*** I think your premise is a bit off. "A few centuries of technological progress" ignores the fact that modern education was invented in the 800s and algebra not long after. The first time higher math was really applied to reality was when the Muslims started using algebra to figure out how to build their larger mosques, and the concept of zero, without which there is no computer programming, existed at least 1300 years ago. Really, progress has been happening at an increasing pace since about 8000 years ago when settled agrarian societies started to show up.

**** I was rather referring to the sharp spike in progress ("revolution") following automated industry, and later, computing. No contention that there was steady progress before that point, except perhaps that it almost certainly was not a monotonic increase. It is a question of when and how often a civilization makes that jump to automated labor, and what follows from that.

** Evolution isn't a goal-oriented process that leads to intelligent life and it usually gets stuck on some local maximum (or, a slowly oscillating Red Queen's Race near a local maximum). It's pure luck that the Earth isn't still covered in trilobites.

** Robin Hanson over on overcomingbias.com has an interesting argument:

Basically simulating different colonisation waves of expansionist civs, refracting and reflecting on themselves. And it turns out that you get sometimes giant wastes of pristine stellar estate- we might just life in on of those.

** Universal kill-filter: Physics is booby-trapped. Some experiment which a technological civilization inevitably conducts has an outcome involving entirely unreasonable energy output, and that is that. Boom. Doesn't matter what your species psychology is like, because the result is not deducible in advance.

More hopeful:

Expansionism into interstellar space makes no sense at the tech level where it is possible to do it - The inevitable time delays in interstellar travel mean that economic activity around other stars completely decouple from the launching star system.

There is no, and can be no return on investment from settler colonies. Any civilization rich and prosperous enough to send one can - and does - write up the economic / mathematical / moral proof why they shouldn't do it, because that level of understanding is a necessary precondition for being that rich in the first place, so instead all surviving civilizations are single-star system affairs with vast infrastructure in a compact space to minimize time delays and maximize the number of available trading and cultural exchange partners within their social/economic/cultural network.

** To me the only thing that makes sense is the physical limits to computation across distance. It is not that life does not exist, but that it has no reason to expand.

Efficiency of communication at computronium speeds falls off rapidly with distance. For example, if you can live at a subjective million times faster than current human experience, then even conversing over a distance of a few metres is going to feel like a delay of seconds in dialogue (kinda the Her problem, but for distance rather than substrate).

As such, even with hypothetical advances in distributed computing, there is an optimal size for a civilisation before it will begin to operate as two civilisations.

And two civilisations in proximity are competing for the same resources, with the same technological level. Growing larger would generate existential risk.

It is also possible that acausal trade could torpedo this solution to the great filter, if there was a significant enough problem to work on that one civilisation was unlikely to solve on its own but having more varied civilisations increased the likelihood of a solution.

Solving heat death/the big rip is the most obvious candidate.

Then it might be worth seeding the entire universe with other civilisations and just trusting them to operate in their own interests, therefore not create competition.

Still the only really plausible answer I can see for the filter though. Without a hard limit like this, life should be varied, and therefore not all of it should be in stealth mode.
