** So far as I know that's just someone holding on to what they perceive as a special skill or authority. Petty, but I don't think it's a fallacy.

*** You just did it!

You just gave an answer to what was clearly a made-up example trying to illustrate a larger question (what is this called), when I obviously only wanted the answer to the larger question.

I'm starting to think the entire world is trolling me on this particular thing.

**** Ah, I think I understand what you're getting at now: missing the forest for the trees? Or, more accurately, missing the argument for the analogy?

In a way, it's almost a self-inflicted Red Herring, or perhaps a subconscious form of Strawman? As I think about it, I am more convinced that Strawman most accurately describes this scenario, as someone intentionally (or subconsciously) misunderstands you and focuses on your individual statements, rather than your overall arguement.

***** I honestly believe that in most cases the people are genuinely trying to be helpful. And sometimes examples can be confusing but I have noticed that it doesn't even seem to matter if you point it out directly ahead of time, people still seem to fall into this trap. (See, unintentionally, above)

Also, you seem to understand what I am getting at now. All of the things you suggest seem to circle just outside of exactly describing this thing. I feel like "Forest for the Trees" is closest.

***** I don't understand the question. I'm the OP of this post, and I certainly didn't remove anything of mine.

Edit: Oh! Where did your other post go? I didn't do that. I wouldn't even know how.

******* Huh. I thought I posted it right. I used the [Q] tag and everything. At least I got my answer before it went dark. :P

** There is actually a fallacy called [[https://books.google.ie/books?id=zGvOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT112&dq=%22refuting+the+example%22&source=bl&ots=oIbvkopTk_][Refuting the example]], but that applies to the unjustified rejection of an argument, just because a supporting example was shown to be false.
