I listened to The Unnoticeables, by Robert Brockway, and it's sublime horror-comedy, like a somewhat more serious John Dies at the End.

Why am I plugging it here? Mainly because the antagonists of the novel can best be described as a Strong-AI-type mentality on an eldritch form substrate. The titular unnoticeables of the series are one of the results of the Angels' optimizing, converting a person from a complete human into a hollow, immutable husk which acts out the archetype that person was occupying at the time.


** It was an enjoyable read. I'm not sure how rational it was though.
