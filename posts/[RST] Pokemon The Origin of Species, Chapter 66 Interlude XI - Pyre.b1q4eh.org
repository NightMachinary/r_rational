** Was that a massive psychic induced feelings block? It would be a likely way out from Red. I'm glad Sabre was able to break that (which would mean that red was flooded with greaf for Aiko AND his parents. That's horrible) I hope this causes a growth in the direction of "I'll be the best trainer to protect people"

Wait a sec

Silent edgy Red. That concept created by the avatat's muteness.

** I felt this way after the last chapter. I didn't read many of the comments that time, but I kind of wish I had.

Last time, I thought her death was assured. If she ends up surviving with an Abra I will be very surprised.

Fear is an important part of human cognition. You don't get a chance to learn from mistakes that lead to your demise, so your ability to avoid overwhelmingly fatal threats hinges upon that emotion.

Also.

The most tragic thing about Red, is that he knew they would run into danger and die if there were people inside--and he told them the truth about it anyway. He is going to blame himself for that. The heuristic "always tell the truth," like the heuristic "help others even when it is dangerous," is capable of hurting you a great deal. It isn't like choosing the correct behavior for the correct reasons will always save you.

These are powerful chapters.

*** I was shocked at the death, till I read the last chapter again, and Aiko makes a comment along the lines of "she was tired of making hard choices for the greater good" and i realized that that was a sign of, well, bad thinking. The greater good is the right way to survive most times, but wont feel good - It was just told from the perspective of someone who didnt know that, so it seemsd triumphant. Your comment really hit that concept, helped me make that connection.

** First off, when I saw this in my morning Reddit browse, I gasped out loud and thought it was some sort of early April Fools, but overall I was SUPER excited for an early update. And now I'm just sad. :(

I refuse to fucking believe it. Someone in there had an Abra and they all got away. I'm REELING at the consequences of this; of course, Aiko being dead is the worst part, but...they're going to have to tell her father, he's going to be utterly crushed, Red's gonna have to tell Blue and Leaf, and *Red...*I can't see any possible way he's going to bounce back from this night. If Aiko lived, MAYBE. But this radically changes the rest of the story and the characters. With Aiko's death I fail to see how anything could continue as it did before. Red is so god damn mentally screwed. At least someone gave him a hug.

As always...I await the next chapter. Just with a lot more trepidation this time.

** I've been getting the sense that a timeskip was going to happen after this arc for a while, seeing how Blue was probably going to be in Vermilion for some time and that'd maybe give Red an opportunity to train under Sabrina without missing out on his journey with Blue and Leaf. Well, now Leaf's temporarily incapacitated and Aiko's permanently incapacitated, and we're in the denouement process of an in-universe calamity. Whether or not a timeskip ends up happening, it certainly feels like an event this intense is fit to close off an "Act 1" of the story.

Aiko...like others have said, her death is depressing but not too surprising. I'm not sure when and how I started thinking she'd be the most likely to die - I think it was around the same time I started thinking a timeskip was incoming, taken together with her presentation as a mix between the three mains? (I.e. Having a mix of Red's rationality, Blue's battle-mania, Leaf's caring.) I'm not really looking forward to how they'd break the news to her father either - it was, after all, the trio's combined efforts that made Aiko go against her father's wishes - but I'm also not looking forward to how Red'll have to break the news to his friends. Leaf would probably take it bad at first; I'd guess she'd regret insisting Red go with Aiko and potentially have lost both of them, not just one. But Blue...seeing how Blue seems to look at Red as an equal, but holds everyone including himself to a high standard - I wonder if he'd blame Red for not doing better.

Also, something I noticed last chapter - this was exactly what Tori was talking about in the chapter before that, wasn't it. That part about how even when the Pressure's departed, it still primes people for the way it made them feel for a while afterwards. For the entire length of the last chapter, Aiko's been trying to overcompensate for her weakness during the Pressure and was having a hard time feeling afraid. The first part of it clearly factored into her decision to rush headlong after Jack. The second part probably did too, and she only risked her life because her usual warning signals that'd prompt her to re-assess how likely she was to lose just wasn't there.

** What I find really tragic about Aiko's death is how easily it could have been avoided. There were so many moments when she could have decided she had done enough and called it a day. And she wouldn't have been wrong to do so. Instead, she always felt she can and needs to do more, even when the odds were against her surviving. If only she was a lesser person, she may still be alive.

And, yet again, poor Red. How is he going to come back from this? I don't even want to imagine what must going through his head right now. Hopefully, he doesn't blame himself too much for what happened, even though I have a feeling that he does.

Poor Aiko's father... The scene when he finds out what happened is not one I'm looking forward to. Red will probably have to tell him (after all, he was the last one to talk with Aiko). Blue may come as well. Too bad Leaf most likely won't be able to go (being in the hospital and all that). She could have helped to soften the blow.

** Im still going to hold out a fools hope that Red is simply wrong, not good enough or experienced enough - only because right now, the narrative structure of Aiko dying on an interlude seems like it *cant* be the whole story, the way we as readers experience her death - its too "dying off page". Of course we are going to get later chapters, so that can be addressed (one last Aiko chapter, or a Red-thinking-back section), but given that we don't have that yet I still will wait for that 100% confirmation.

But this is still 99% confirmation, lets be real. I said in the comments of the last chapter that Red was probably right to oppose her - I did NOT need this level of proof, I could have used a *much lower level of proof*, thank you very much!!

Also, side comment: If I recall the correctly, when I first read the last chapter it ended with Aiko kissing Red on the cheek, and her thinking something along the lines of "well everyone else is doing it." Now that line is gone, its more straightforward. I felt that was a nice little moment of humourous personality, a good little Aiko moment, and I am sad to see it retconned way particularly if we get no more of those. But maybe I imagined that? Not sure after all!

*** You didn't imagine it, I deleted it the next day because on reread I Just thought it felt a bit off, given that only Elaine actually did it and the gravity of the situation? Could be wrong on that, if lots of readers felt like you did.

**** Oh, glad I didnt imagine it! And obv your story, go with what you want - i think it was the gravity of the situation that made it work, it had a vibe of "this act could go incredibly wrong, but eh fuck it lets part on a mental quip". Worked with her quiet-but-rebellious vibe she sometimes had, and people joke even in the darkest settings - and it matches her confidence going on vis a vis her decision. Still of course if that wasnt the vibe you wanted from her emotionally, then thats the call you want.

** I feel this chapter had less of an impact than it could have had. Hopefully it's not too spoilery, but I'd be interested to understand your decision to withhold Red's internal reactions after Leaf's injury and Aiko's disappearance.

In the last four chapters we've seen Red go through a lot. His manner of thinking has been tested. His desires and goals have been pitted against odds he has fought to calculate. While he did succeed occasionally, his losses were severe. During this time we've only seen Red from an outside perspective.

I wanted to see his decisions during conflict with his available information. I wanted to understand his decision to go fight the nidoqueen, His decision (or lack of) to stay with leaf after. His decision to return to the field with Aiko. I wanted to see his reactions when his choices had bad outcomes. His reactions to how his quick decisions led to Leaf's Injury. His reactions and turmoil after he failed to convince Aiko and Jack from entering the building. How all this made him feel about himself.

I feel that these moments are inciting some of the biggest changes in red that we've seen, and we're missing out on those scenes of struggle, discovery, and change by witnessing all this instead from an observers perspective after the events have occurred.

I'm intrigued about how you will proceed! Good luck on your next chapter!

Also, now that we know the results, I really enjoy how you portrayed Aiko's decision at the end of chapter 65. I've been having a strong feelings of dread these past couple chapters.

*** Thanks for the perspective, and glad you enjoyed the chapters! Keeping us out of Red's head was partly a decision based on pacing logistics (I wanted each character to get a full chapter once the Zapdos arc started) and partly because based on building expectations.

I've spent so much time building up Red's perspective and values that I wanted to go an extended time outside of his head (after kicking off the arc with his thoughts/feelings) to let the readers feel as separated and uncertain as the characters in the story do, and to let the readers practice guessing/predicting what would happen next without having as much information about his internal state as they would if I did dip back into his thoughts after Leaf's chapter or during Aiko's.

Hope that makes sense, and you continue to enjoy the upcoming ones!

** Aiko had an Abra. If they encountered a dark type red might never have had a chance to sense what actually happened in there. They disappeared from his senses but maybe not because they all died.

Then again it's not the first human near-mc death of the story
