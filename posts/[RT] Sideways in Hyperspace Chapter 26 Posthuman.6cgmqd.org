** You know what? That's a great question to close on. What the hell are they using all that mass for?

The first and obvious answer is expansion. Exponential expansion.

But I'm having trouble thinking of other answers.

**** That... that would be awesome. The scale of this novel is already impressive but that would take it to a new level.

** So what level is mankind on the kardeshev scale? I'm guessing between type 1 and 2? Its interesting that civilization in this is so advanced in some ways (androids, artificial intelligence) and so primative (their ftl, the lack of unification of the sol cluster) at the same time compared to other fictional earths.

*** Yes, its an interesting mix. It reminds me of William Gibbson's comment that "The future has arrived, it's just unevenly distributed" (or something similar). This story is more believable because the uneven distribution of resources/knowledge/power mirrors that of our earth.

Based on the tech described, pretty much by definition. An entire galaxy filled with an inhabited planet per star (on average) would just about barely reach level 2 - the equivalent of one Dyson sphere. It's a logarithmic scale.
