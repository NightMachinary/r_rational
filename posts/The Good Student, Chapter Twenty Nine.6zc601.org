**** We're fairly deep into the story and there has yet to be a clear antagonist. We don't really know what the protagonist is striving for; we don't know what challenges he needs to overcome. We don't really even know what events are good and what are bad for him. In short, the fundamental conflict and goals of the story is still very unclear.

Don't get me wrong, it's interesting that we're still guessing what's happening. This could be a useful approach that accurately reflects the sense of confusion and being lost in a big world that the main character must be feeling. But... I'm increasingly worried that the story will never start coalesce. It's gone on for quite a while now.

I may be in error but to me the demons are the big antagonists (there are also lesser things to overcome like the prejudice of the upper class etc.), the goal is to save Simone and the world and there is lots to be discovered about the world, the school, arcanum, society etc.

In the sense that it does not conform to the roles and steps of "the hero's journey" 100% I guess it is unclear, but I (disclaimer: personal taste) don't think that is a requirement for a good story.

Is it fair to ask for clarity in these things in an [[/r/rational]] story? There are at least two aspects here.

One is that rational readers generally enjoy more subtle hints as to the true nature of the world - multiple readings are practically mandatory so that there are significant hypotheses to strike down as part of discovering the world.

Another is that by and large reality presents itself without such clarity, and a big part of rationality is recognizing how often we impose structures and definitions - sometimes helpfully, sometimes not.

I'm interested in people's thoughts since in my own writing I actively try to present scenes that have multiple readings.

Well, I could reasonably argue that the rational genre doesn't obviate the rules of good story-telling, but the honest truth is that I won't judge this story till it's done. These confusing narratives and unclear antagonist may resolve in a really interesting way that brings together everything to a fitting whole. Or, they may not. We'll have to see.

**** Ah, well not meaning to complain, more wanted an answer of, it's good and you should continue, or keep waiting. I have not given up and still maintain my intent to read it, but for me I started gettig the feeling that after each chapter my mind was going aaaaaand?

***** Perhaps partly a symptom of a web serial? In a conventional novel you would just keep reading to get the next piece of the puzzle, now you have to wait for next chapter to be released.

****** Yes, webserials will be my undoing, truly. Rational webserials are the pringles of the literary universe, and truly should be treated like a controlled substance to the uninitiated.

*** For the moment, but probably not for much longer. It seems to have lost its spark.

A few more words of clarification, in case the author watches these threads. The storyline about the demons and the other place bores me. It bores me because it doesn't directly threaten the protagonist or his goals. Also, his goals seem to have become nonexistent. As have his study habits. I was kind of looking forward to a good study-fantasy. I wish it could have stayed that way.

***** Ah, then I thank you. Certainly How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis is a favorite, which I binged. Your charecter building is excellebt, and it somewhat reminds me of the anime The Hosts Club, which is contrived, but pleasurable.\\
Feom my amateur mind I feel foe this story you made a more in depth plan then normal, which limited your voice. I feel your voice is novel, and superb, and anything which could interrupt should be eliminated. I truly apoligize for my earlier criticism because you have done something I could not...write a compelling, original work with complex charecters and a novel setting. Thank you.

*** I am still reading it and enjoying the hell out of every word. This is exactly the magical slice of life I need. If you want challenge after challenge go read How To Avoid Death On A Daily Basis. I love Moody's books. And I love that he has three stories each with different flavour.

**** I did enjoy How To Avoid Death On A Daily Basis, which is why I started The Good Student. My other comments explain more, but I had to put this story on pause. Is it unfair I compare [[/u/mooderino][u/mooderino]] to Robin Hobb and other notables? Not in my mind, Mooderino put his art on public display, and I have made comment. Either I am not his audience and he is better off without me, or I am, and he deserves the chance to know my mind, and re-entice me as a reader. Regardless, he has talent, and is better then 80% of published fantasy authors.

** A thousand years is a long time. What does it say about the pace of cultural/linguistic change in Ranvar that Winnum Roke speaks the same language in the same dialect/accent as Simole?

Alternatively, since the Other Place makes everything sort of like you expect it to be, perhaps Simole is just expecting everyone to talk the same way she does and everything follows from there.
