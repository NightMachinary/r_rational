*** I kind of mentioned this in passing in another comment, but in canon Kabuto is one of those characters where the reader is /told/ that they're some smart, cunning mastermind, but when you actually look at the character as a whole and the actions they've taken, they seem really, /really/ stupid.

I've seen people try to explain in other fics that Kabuto's info cards are a method he uses to get close and gain the trust of certain participants in the Chunin Exams, Team 7 and Sasuke by extension in particular. In the original, Kabuto /does/ approach Team 7, not the other way around like here. But besides the fact that there's a million other ways to gain the trust of the impressionable 12 year olds Team 7 are in canon /without/ looking like a suspicious security leak, it's clearly an example of authors taking somthing that didn't make much sense in the original and trying to come up with a rational reason for it in their story. I don't actually think there ever is a real explanation in canon for what the heck Kabuto was trying to accomplish with those cards except for the weak "he's a spy for Orochimaru," where we have to assume every weird, unexplained action he took was on some strange order that the reasoning behind will never be explained.

His "cunning" plan also serves as helpful exposition for the audience to understand some weird things about the exam, like why there are comparatively so few ninja participating from other countries (something Naruto in this fic did not notice or did not point out). He also foreshadowed interesting stuff about Lee's abilities (something Naruto in this fic already knows because he is not a moron).

He obviously got this information by spying, but I wonder who was he spying for at the time? It seems like Kabuto spends time as a spy for pretty much every "bad" faction at some point in canon, and I'm interested in seeing how him being a spy for Root/Orochimaru/Akatsuki/whoever he feels like that week will go down in this story.

**** It's not above Kabuto's clearance to know about Naruto's chakra control.

Remember in the first chapter, Naruto says the Kyubei is famous for its intelligence and chakra control, so if Kabuto knows Naruto has the Kyubei inside him (and Naruto himself said it was a very poorly kept secret) then he knows about the chakra control.

I think Naruto was worried more about Kabuto showing that card to ninjas from other villages and wouldn't have minded if Kabuto had kept that knowledge to himself.

EDIT: Just noticed now that Kabuto knows Naruto is competent at ninjutsu. That should probably worry Naruto more.

**** Yeah, which is one of the reasons why I'm so curious with the direction Kabuto is going to be taken in this story. Velorien hasn't made any /glaring/ errors like this yet (and I'm not saying this story hasn't had smaller problems), where they keep something in the story just because it's always in the story (and Kabuto with his info cards are /always/ in Chunin Exam fics).

The problem is that there is an infinite sea of hypotheses for every phenomenon, and our brain has not evolved to find out every one, nor even the majority nor a high probability subset of them. In other words, you, like every other human, are blind to the causes of things that happen, unless they are really common and obvious.

Just sayin'

EDIT: It has been drawn to my attention that people infer from what I wrote things that aren't there. What I meant to say is that to understand the motives behind one single action of a smart, rational character is a trickier endeavour than most, because in the case of particularly smart, rational characters the motives behind their actions are seldom common or obvious, as opposed to the actions of everyday people.

I wrote phenomenons because, at the same time, laws of physics and natural events are very common, but not so obvious, and in fact for example it took many years and a vast number of experiments to arrive to the theory of... pretty much any theory, because that would narrow dawn the sea of possible hypotheses. It also helps that in nature the simplest explanation is usually the right one, while this is not always the case for smart people and characters.

***** Nnnnnno. What I'm saying is that people can predict characters' future actions, to some degree of accuracy, once they know their motivations, but to understand a character's motivation is a whole other matter.

What I'm saying is that if you met a person on a street, and this person was throwing dice on the sidewalk, you could have a simple explanation, maybe five if you're full of inventiveness, but you can't possibly predict that those dice are a construct produced by a multidimensional being in a contest among multidimensional beings to see which blue is bluer on a series of planets originated with an algorithm including twelve prime numbers, and that the guy who is currently kneeling on the sidewalk is a former KGB agent under cover, who casually found himself in this situation to try and bring back to life his lost love.

What I'm saying is that we can come up with *some* /motives/ for why people do what they do, provided they are common and obvious, and we are usually right because they are the most common for a reason, but we couldn't get the motives of above average smart or subtle or rational characters because we won't ever be able to have a sufficient model of their reasons, who can be many and strange, just like we won't understand the reasons behind particularly unusual events or behaviours.

Had /you/ understood why [[#s][spoiler HPMOR]] before the author explained it to you? Sure you could have found a reasonable enough explanation for the choice of her, like "she has some bad influence over Harry", but had you guessed why Draco? Had you guessed that [[#s][spoiler]]? Had you guessed that [[#s][spoiler]]?

To extrapolate why a person does something is harder than to know what is the next move of a chess player, but we usually get the right answer on the first one because people share the most common motives.

*tl/dr* Kabuto can have a whole bunch of plans, more that is easy to imagine and guess. Author may not realize this because thay are the on the side who chooses the motives of their characters.

Post scriptum, also realize that we don't know how much of Kabuto you have changed from the original.

I would add that predicting smart or subtle or rational characters' motivations isn't that difficult, because in most cases, their intelligence shapes /how/ they express their motivations, rather than giving them radically different ones. The idiot savant canon!Naruto and the prodigy rational!Harry might have very different ideas of /how/ to bring about peace and happiness for humanity, but it is nevertheless a motivation that both share, and one which is in no way strange or alien to the reader.

Well, to answer that, would you have predicted in the original Naruto that Kabuto was a spy of Orochimaru, when you didn't even know about Orochimaru's existence?

It's obviously easier to guess motivations in fanfiction, since you already know a good deal of backstory, but less easy in rational/creative fanfiction, when a smart author may have found reasonable causes for the same events, like: we read about a Kabuto showing stat-cards around and we know that in the original was a poor move, but we know how you deal with poor moves and we expect of you to have changed something to make this work. The reason for this move can float in a sea of possible hypothesis, like, I don't know, Kabuto had an aneurysm, or Kabuto is following four-level-deep orders from Orochimaru in a bigger scheme, or Kabuto is trying to recruit Naruto like MadScientist95387 speculated, or Kabuto is trying to scare Naruto into forfeiting, or Kabuto wants to feign superior intelligence gathering abilities while e just had a stroke of luck in getting those stats, or Kabuto...

This is what I was trying to say, we can't possibly get the whole picture. We can try to guess what /you/ where thinking, based on our knowledge of your style, smarts and the rational fiction guidelines, and the fact that this will be somewhat Naruto, just like we guessed that the first test was a Kobayashi Maru because it is a common trope and it wasn't some smart character's scheme, but to guess what the hell Kabuto is trying to accomplish is a whole other story.

***** As I understand it, there were practical issues involved as well - after all, if the writers were the same as for S1, then all else being equal we should have expected the same quality of stratagems as in S1. If I may quote TVTropes,

- The original plans for R2 were changed when it was announced that the series would be moved to an earlier, primetime slot. Fans believe that this mainly affected the first half of R2, for the purposes of re-introducing the show to a new audience instead of picking up right after the first season's cliffhanger like the staff had intended. As a general rule, how much a fan thinks was changed is inversely proportionate to said fan's opinion of R2's quality.
- It's known that the Time Skip itself was a result of Executive Meddling. Other elements that are commonly suspected or assumed to fall under this include introducing the character of Rolo and removing aspects of C.C.'s and Suzaku's backgrounds without a full explanation.
