** This would be better suited to [[/r/motheroflearning]], where the top post is:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/ehpa7v/next_chapter_target_date_26th_of_january_2020/][Next Chapter Target Date: 26th of January, 2020]]
#+end_quote

The update [[https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-target-date-32719458][was posted on the author's Patreon.]]

I'm removing this post, as it doesn't add very much of substance to the discussion on this subreddit, and postponements or scheduling for web serials aren't really top-level post material.
