Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I've been thinking about time loop stories lately, and I think I have one that I haven't seen too much in other places: a time loop that only exists in a defined volume of space, such that the loop keep happening in this one place, but the rest of the world keeps going. There are a few benefits to this scheme, from a writing perspective:

- You keep things confined to a single place, which is helpful because it allows deep exploration rather than broad exploration (one of the great things that /Groundhog Day/ did was to at least give the illusion of going wide, which wouldn't have been possible if it had been set in, say, Pittsburgh).
- You naturally allow things and people to enter into the loop, if not to retain their memories through the loop, which can help shake up the story, and is already a staple of time loop stories.
- You put some kind of time pressure on the looper, which helps to maintain tension.

The way I'm conceiving of it now, the looped area presents as a bubble, and anything that passes through that skin gets put into the loop at the same time and location through all loops. In other words, if you enter the loop by traveling through the skin at hour fifteen, then every time the loop hits hour fifteen, you'll enter it again, with the same body and memories as you had the first time around (barring some way to keep memories?).

(The skin of the bubble has to account for thermodynamics in some way, since if light can get into the bubble, then in the second loop through, the light is essentially doubled, if light can't get through, it's dark, and if light can get through but isn't doubled, then the loop will have variable daylight, which changes the nature of the loop pretty significantly. Similarly, we wouldn't want a looping space that allows outside rainfall to enter the loop, because every loop would have multiple rainfalls coming in at once after enough days of clouds passing over.)

In terms of narrative structure, I think that a lot of time loop stories really struggle with the front-loaded nature of it, as the early part is naturally more compelling than the later parts where mastery has been achieved and there's not that much to worry about; it's a problem with a lot of stories where the inciting incident doesn't so much set things in motion as establish a new order of the world that has to be explored and figured out.

For story pitches with this premise, I like the idea of a small team of explorers going in, only to realize (somehow) that they're on their hundredth time in the loop, an idea that I think could carry a story. Alternately, a looper who retains memories fighting against an outside government or entity that keeps sending in more and more agents, which would make for an interesting asymmetry (if you could establish win/loss conditions).

*** My first thought is that to the extent things can enter the time warp, it grows in pressure and density until it turns into a black hole. Even if only adventurers get in.

My second thought is that the easiest way to narrate that away is to make there be a limited number of transition chambers that allow people to enter the loop.

You'll need a boundary that blocks basically everything from both sides, I think.

For example, if light can only exit the bubble that makes the boundary's temperature appear to be absolute zero from the inside. Since all things with temperature emit radiation, gases would be slowly condensing on the inside. The bubble itself would be an infinite source of low-grade heat from the outside. That would be interesting but might not be what you want.

Here's an idea. You could make it so that there is a secondary pressure across the edge of the bubble, a mysterious force such that sticking things in it takes an increasing amount of energy. Say, every additional ton of mass trying to enter the bubble doubles the repulsion force. The boundary has a thickness that one must cross while overcoming the repulsion the whole way, or you just bounce out. In short order air, rain, and thrown rocks basically can't enter by accident. The protagonist enters by ramming it with their car, while the final entrant uses a crashing spaceship. Even with that a few stray energetic particles will get in--but the nice part about having a thickness to the boundary is that you can fine-tune the precision of the necessary trajectory as well as the temperature of the entering particles. The accumulation can be made slow enough that it doesn't overheat before the universe ends.

What happens to items that only make it halfway? I prefer 'severed at the boundary'. And then, what if an object collides with another that is currently entering? Mashed together, or else you can't push air out of the way as you enter. To solve the light issue, well, from the inside perhaps you just see whatever the bubble saw on its first play through. It's not consistent with how it treats matter, and the temperature problems will still be there to an extent, but at least gasses won't be condensing. (You could still use the wall as a heat sink as long as you don't mind waiting for radiation to cool whatever your hot thing is.)

There will also be a slight breeze at the beginning of the loop from the second play through, when air was able to get past the barrier. Mirrors just outside the boundary will reflect the wrong things. You can infer how much has entered the area by making a note of the fastest thing that you've seen enter--or even better, with a detector that minutely measures gamma radiation from the boundary, knowing that only high-energy particles will be able to make it after a time. The calculations for that are beyond me, though. It might not work.

*** The Adventure Zone (dnd podcast) “13th Hour” arc had a time loop that was confined to a mining town. People who entered after the loop started didn't forget anything, I think, and I think it saved them from dying?

*** The most interesting thing I've done with a Time Loop story recently is put a role playing game in one. The players began as low level people living their lives, and then a great disaster unfolded. They had limited visibility into what was going down, and were far too insignficant to stop it.

After this, they encountered the looping mechanism, got a minor power up, got sent back to the start.

They know how many loops they have, and how much they will power up after each loop. They know the victory and loss conditions, and they have essentially complete freedom to wander around causing trouble within the loop.

It has been a lot of fun so far. The players seem really into this premise. I feel like someone ought to make a module out of it for a popular RPG system.

*** I'm not sure why you would want a bubble?

Suppose there's a Loopulation Process which causes any person or thing which undergoes the process to begin looping with a certain Duration (how long the overall looping phenomena continues from an outside perspective) and Frequency (how long between each reset of a loop). For the Duration, the loopulated entities reset to their initial state and position every Frequency. Things loop 'together' if they have a matching (or nearly matching) Frequency, but entities with a different Frequency de-synchronize just as you'd expect. Anything that has not been exposed to the Process can interact with looping entities in a normal fashion, but are not reset when the loop resets - they retain their knowledge and position independent of any loops.

As a rough story idea, let's say we have world where the Loopulation Process is well known and is included as an emergency protocol in high value targets, such as airplanes. In the midst of an airline hijacking, the captain broadcasts a distress signal to aircraft control and activates the onboard Emergency Loopulator, putting the entire plane in a Frequency 6 hours, Duration 8 weeks loop in order to make sure that the crew and passengers have the best chance possible to be rescued. Although nobody onboard retains their memories of prior loops, the people outside the loop at aircraft control instruct the Captain, crew and passengers on what to do, what's worked well in the past and what the hijackers are likely to try. An accomplice on the ground does the same thing for the hijackers, communicating via text messages.

Onboard are a set of Deloopulators, which can be used to selectively remove people, objects and portions of the aircraft from the loop early, at the obvious cost of leaving them stranded outside of the loop in whatever state they are at the time they're Deloopulated - people floating unsupported in the middle of a flight path (or on the tarmac if done while the plane is landed), removing portions of the cabin, permanently disarming the hijackers (or security) of their weapons and radio, etc. All the while, the police are trying to find the accomplice on the ground and capture them.

*** FYI, the famous Stargate: SG-1 time loop episode "Window of Opportunity" actually mentions at the very end that the time loop was confined to Earth and a few other planets (they mention the Tok'Ra being worried they couldn't contact Earth for several months), but it has absolutely no consequences on the show and is not referenced ever again. Makes me wonder why they decided to mention it at all.

*** How about a mass to time ratio? Entering objects only last a limited amount of loops, with lighter objects lasting shorter. Light and other radiation will not be able to loop because they are massless, rain and air would only last one or two loops, and most importantly, people who enter have only a few dozen or however many loops to be able to figure out how to exit or subvert the loop. This adds time pressure, since you are presumably erased at the end of the last loop.

*** energy and matter can neither be created nor destroyed. time is a dimension of space. a time loop then is 4-dimensional array of 3-dimensional objects in a sturdy formation. the 'loop' moves things and changes their state (is the vase broken or unbroken?) and so requires an amount of energy to function.

if we add entropy to the equation, then maintaining a temporal loop has a high energy cost. and a time loop of sufficient power may be indistinguishable from an event horizon. what if some singularities are just entire solar systems stuck in time loops, and this is screwing with the rest of the universe at large?

for a story, we only need to explain the parts that the reader observes directly through the story. the rest is higher dimensional math and physics waiting for someone to earn a nobel prize.

** There was some worldbuilding and thought experimenting going on over in the litrpg subreddit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/e9p3rg/how_do_make_love_to_a_cannibal_life_must_be_scary/]]

litrpg stories seem like they would be a good mix with the rational genre, though in practice they mostly fall short in all the normal ways that fantasy stories fall short.

I do like that most litrpg systems at least /try/ to set out a world with consistent rules and magic.

What internal problems / inconsistencies / munchkin opportunities do you see from a litrpg type world where experience / power is gained from killing things.

*** Well, from a storytelling/quality perspective, most litrpg stories fail (imo) because they focus too much on getting stronger through protagonists gaining levels by killing things over and over. Eventually, the reader comes to realize that the main character is functionally immortal and will always survive the next "deadly fight" to gain that next level or whatever.

Litrpgs also often have ridiculously powerful abilities for no apparent reason, just because the protagonist found some key or unique solution to an old problem (where the solution is often obvious to the reader). I find it irrational that in a world that's presumably had hundreds of generations of people living under the "system" that nobody's discovered the secret to power that the main character has when it seems so logical.

People in general underestimate the people who lived in the past, and as most litrpgs run in generic fantasy world, people assume that the medieval-feudal era people were idiots. This isn't true at all. People 500 years ago were just as smart/intelligent as we are now. They might lack knowledge or have a poor education, but that doesn't mean that they're stupid.

As for ways to munchkin or break most litrpg systems, that's easy. Often, the more "numbers" and stats there are, the easier it is to manipulate the system. For example, what prevents a character from building mechanical traps or monster funneling systems which allow the character to easily kill monsters? If the answer is that the system somehow only awards points when the character is "in danger", how do you define this level-of-danger? If you hang a sword over yourself connected to some sort of shrodinger's box cat-killing device, does that put the character in danger?

In general, the only way to write a completely rational litrpg is to only use "numbers" sparsely (if at all) or to use them in a subversive manner. For example, I'd say that /The Wandering Inn/ does this very well as (even though it's not strictly rational fiction) it avoids all sorts of numbers-based inconsistencies by basically only giving people a class, a level, and some skills. There are no strength points, no mana bars, and no status screens. The reader and the characters in the story don't know exactly how levels progress, how classes or assigned, or the mechanics of the "system". This allows the author to write an excellent story with lifelike and rational characters while avoiding any number-based traps or pitfalls.

**** Alternatively, you could roll with an RPG system other than D&D for once. The Chronicles of Darkness, for instance, doesn't reward XP just for killing things. It rewards XP whenever the GM feels is most appropriate and fitting, for the story they're telling.

The system also has a bunch of mechanical incentives in its various gamelines, that reward players for doing stupid, sub-optimal things that nonetheless fit the character they're playing as. If my character is Wrathful, I might lash out in anger, and hurt or insult someone important to my goals. If my character is Proud, I might try to show off in a tense encounter, only for my showboating to blow up in my face.

Because ChroD isn't about power fantasies. It's about enabling stories, about characters who bumble and fail and struggle in dramatic ways. Characters who are, quite often, their own worst enemies.

***** Hey, I don't disagree. That was my entire point in mentioning /The Wandering Inn./ It's leveling progression occurs when characters fulfill their narrative or self-destined roles. My entire last paragraph is about how I wish more authors who are writing LitRPG would go with a more narrative/storytelling system as it makes much more interesting stories than just killing things. The reason I think this doesn't happen, is that lots of amateur writers are lazy and throwing together an XP=killing things is dead simple compared to constructing a proper narrative.
