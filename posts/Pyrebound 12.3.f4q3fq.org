Another update, another oddball pyre to visit.

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/chapter-12-3/]]

Pyrebound has been running for about a year now--I've been posting updates on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] about half that time. It's a grim high fantasy serial with strong Mesopotamian influences. If you'd like to read it from the beginning, the first chapter starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. Thank you!
