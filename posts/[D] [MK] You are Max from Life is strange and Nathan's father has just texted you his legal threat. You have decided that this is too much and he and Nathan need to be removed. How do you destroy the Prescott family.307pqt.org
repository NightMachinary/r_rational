The tornado will not happen.

You can break as many laws as you like so long as you are not caught. If you are constraining yourself with morality you are doing it wrong.

** So- the asymmetry in Max's ability is that anything in her possession moves in time with her. Ultra gruesome method- arrange to meet Nathan and Father in undisclosed location, shoot them, remove vital organ, rewind time. Organs in your possession do not remain with their owners, Nathan and his Dad fall over dead of apparent heart existence failure.

** Max also seems to not move in space when she time travels, and nothing in her possesion does, either. This gives her the effective ability to teleport on a moment by moment basis to anywhere she can reach within five minutes. If she were driving a car, she could hit and run, and effectively teleport the car the distance it could drive in 5 minutes every second.

**** It's actually really inconsistent. When she see's the vortex, we play it like she's really there, but she seems to outsiders like she is having a vision. However, when [[#s][MASSIVE SPOILER]], Max doesn't move backwards in space, and in fact, seems to be able to move freely while using her ability. In most mundane uses of her ability, i.e., normal game play, everyone and everything moves around her and she stands in one spot- I was using that as my default mode.

***** Actually I was referring to the scene when she first activates it in the bathroom. I sort of assumed that she was not moving in space because it would have made the game tedious to play.

But since then, I finished the second episode yesterday and you're right at one point she's using her ability to move freely without time passing.

** How much backward time travel do I have? There seem to be limits on both the number of times max can use her ability, and how far back she can go.

** I purchase a VPN, and use it to google effective ways to set a house on fire.

I withdraw cash, get something flammable to help set the fire, ammonia and bleach, a paintball gun and binoculars, along with things to hide my identity like a mask. I try to do this in a secretive fashion so no one knows who I am as I look outside, perhaps driving a fair distance to buy these things. After this I go to the house at 3 or so am and if necessary paintball any cameras outside while far away, check if any lights are on. I then set up mixtures of bleach and ammonia around any exits so that anyone escaping will get a lungful of toxic gases, set the house on fire, and leave the scene. If they escape they should be severely injured at least, and thus unable to threaten me further.

That's pointless. You just do your searching, then rewind time to before you searched. You have to do it in five-minute increments and you don't get history, but you can keep a notepad.
