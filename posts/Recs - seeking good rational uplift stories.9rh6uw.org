As it says in the title, I'm looking for recommendations of rational uplift stories, particularly time-travel and fantasy world stories. I'm also happy to accept other rational fic recs for long, complete stories. Thanks in advance!


** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] is a Young Justice SI with a focus on integrating the insanity that is DC continuity into a functioning society. Magic is 100% real and anyone can learn it yet truth compulsion isn't used in trials or Earth magic to clean up pollution, a superhero built a staff that lets him fly and project force fields (in the 1950's!) and no one tries to use it to generate power etc. It's a long road (it updates every day and is currently at 2 million+ words) but I think it's worth it if you're interested in a world where there's god knows how many possible afterlives and they accidentally (in canon, though it's never point out outside the fic) made monotheism the worst one. Quite impressive that it never really bashes anyone (save Dr. Fate, though I think that's more just working with the character as it is rather than anything malicious) , it tries it's damnedest to give reasonable motivations and mistakes to poor decisions of existing characters. Also has only 1 OC in the entirety of it's run, so that's pretty impressive.

In [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]], in the kingdoms of Inath, zombies are encroaching at the borders and ancient legends tell of summoning one from another world, a place called Earth, who would learn the ancient rights of magic and find the magic sword to turn the tide. When getting /him/ they accidentally grab a materials engineer as well, and it's starting to look like they might not need that sword. After all, they have artillery now.

Also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/][A Better Class of Criminal]] just because it's mildly rational and utterly hilarious. DC SI with Libriomancy powers, but he's mildly supervillain-style insane (and because of that everyone dismissed his "I fell into a comic book story", /of course/ the guy who pulls stuff out of books believes that he fell into one, hahaha) and has James Moriarty in his head. He's also terrified of Batman because he keeps thwarting all his plans and once fought the entire Justice League with the One Ring. He ends up as the magical mayor of post-apocalyptic Gotham City and decides to build a magitech society out of the debris. Still in progress and updates are few and far between, but not dead by a long shot.

Um...how far in was that?

I have to disagree there. It's true that the SI's first year focused heavily on superheroing, because joining the Young Justice team was the deal he made in exchange for his power source. And his first six months, in particular, follow canon. But even then, he's working to upgrade his team mates' equipment and/or powers, build connections between Atlantis (full of magic users) and Themyscira (directly connected to a divine pantheon with time on its hands) and the rest of the world, brush the dust off captured supervillain tech (Dolmen Gates, elemental control a la Red Tornado) and put it into mainstream use...and perhaps most importantly, show and persuade some of the most powerful people in the world that there are simple ways for them to do even better.

The way I see it, the main point of the fic is, The comics contain lots of really cool and interesting things, but people aren't smart about using them, so let's try fixing that.

**** Original character, I believe. For uplift I recommend Cast Under an Alien Sun: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30985483-cast-under-an-alien-sun]]

Bootstrapping technology on an earth-like world. MC (main character) is a chemical engineer.

***** It has some fairly bad reviews from the few rational individuals that seem to have read it.. Look:

​

#+begin_quote
  What did I think?

  If you make a world where a human is being transferred from Earth to another planet, where some aliens, some x-thousands of years ago already planted other humans and several Earth fauna and flora have alredy been transplanted, kindly avoid that they could possibly have had the same evolution:

  - Monotheism\\
  - Indo-Germanic language\\
  - Minutes as a unit of measuring time while the complete calender is different\\
  - Abbeys with real abbots\\
  - Miles as units of measuring distance, for god's sake\\
  - European names\\
  - A substitute for coffee as in "nobody is actually able to get out of bed and something done without\\
  having one first"\\
  - Actual christian marriage with only the occasional exception of more than one wife/husband

  This is all the more grating, since the author tried very hard (and repeteadly) to describe a somewhat different world/planet.

  Also, once said is enough. There's no need to describe MC's eyes over and over, neither his history, neither his "never home again" dilemma etc. etc. etc.

  I'm giving the next one a try. Why with only 2 stars? I had a clear view of where this is all going halfway through the first volume and now I want to know, if I was right.

****** Eh. As far as I'm concerned, that stuff is baked into the premise. If it's in the premise, I can deal with it. If stupid stuff creeps in after the premise, it's a lot harder. But yeah, it's only OK.

****** I don't give a fig's leaf for unit of measurements being the same and other minor issues, because I am assuming that it's all translated.

Would be too much work if I have to figure out a unique unit of measurement compared to kilometers and miles.

**** Essentially a non-canon character made up by the author to fulfill a role in the story. They're usually awful, like a better-at-everything-than-the-main-characters-long-lost-sibling who falls in love with the protagonist.

In With This Ring it's just an Atlantean manta-form researcher/merchant who the SI tries to buy some stuff from and helps with/is helped by in magic research. Turns out power rings can make patterns (say, runic shapes) at microscopic scales, which opens up whole new fields of research and new surface world/atlantean lines of communication/commerce.

** Definitely [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30985483-cast-under-an-alien-sun][Destiny's Crucible]]

About a modern chemist that sent to a island in a AU with 16th century tech equivalent. Its not written in the typical [[/r/rational]] story style, however I found it as enjoyable as it was very well written.
