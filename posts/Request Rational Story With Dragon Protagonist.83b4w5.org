I've been looking all over, but haven't found any stories that are both rational and also have a dragon as the main character. I've started writing one in my spare time out of frustration. If anyone can point me to a story that meets the requirements, I'd be extremely grateful.


** I wouldn't say they are rational, but they are good stories that involve a dragon as a main character.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3177607/chapters/6902765][Alone Together]] - During the Triwizarding Tournament, Harry is teleported into the world of Temeraire bonded to a Horntail. It's a great crossover and indirectly fulfills your dragon protagonist request.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1810858/chapters/3886108][Sheen]] - Harry and Luna (who is now a dragon) decide to go exploring in Temeraire.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5894467/chapters/13586929][Dragon Lord]] - Smaug and Bilbo work together to destroy the One Ring.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/always-be-the-dragon-hs-dxd.348354/][Always be the Dragon]] - Some foolish cultists attempt to summon a dragon from a sacred gear and die in the process while the dragon merges with a girl. It's about a dragon freed from centuries of imprisonment trying to adapt to human society in Highschool DxD.

** /disclaimer: This series is in Russian./

It has been quite a while since I've read it, but if I remember correctly [[http://fan.lib.ru/s/shumil_p/][/Ð¡Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ Ð¾ Ð´Ñ€Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð½Ðµ/ by ÐŸÐ°Ð²ÐµÐ» Ð¨ÑƒÐ¼Ð¸Ð»]] (~550k words total) should either be rational or at least not have too many disqualifying bad writing tropes.

/(spoilers)/

It had technological uplift, colonisation of new planets, interdimensional travel (I think), some worldbuilding regarding the nature of the dragon species, etc.

The protag of the first set of books is somewhat MarySue-ish.

*** Thanks for the recommendation, I gave it a try, and it's not bad.

It has grim darkness of Dark Ages with all the gory social mores, a dragon protagonist that tries to do the right thing in a smart way, and awesome moments like [[#s][minor spoiler]], but it also has some strange moments like [[#s][spoilers]]

In my opinion, it qualifies as a rational story (with some caveats), but not really as a rationalist one, because protagonist consistently fails to see applications for technology he possesses and to learn from his mistakes.

Oh, and I personally found female characters to be somewhat insane, and protagonist as well.

** The protagonist is not a dragon but you might enjoy the Temeraire series as highly intelligent but decidedly inhuman dragons play a key role. I personally think that the characterization of the dragons in this series is the best part as it is executed exceptionally well but does not overshadow the main plot.

The series is not marketed as an explicitly "rational" series but I believe that the world and characters created in this series meet most of the needed criteria.

Holy cow, it's literally an SI fanfic with Peter Dickinson (the author of 'The Flight Of Dragons' book) taking the place of Jim. Including using Trope Knowledge and everything.

***** No, that book is speculative biology rather than traditional fiction; not even really a story per se.

I'll quote Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  In 1982, Rankin/Bass Productions released a made-for-TV animated film The Flight of Dragons, aspects of which were based on Dickinson's novel. For example, the character design in the film bears a resemblance to the illustrations in the book, and its lead character takes his name from the author, Peter Dickinson. However, the animated film derives most elements of its story line from the novel The Dragon and the George.
#+end_quote

Of course the incorporation of the "scientific" elements from Dickinson's novel is likely why the film feels more rationalist at times. There's a whole scene where the older dragon teaches Peter!Gorbash about dragon flight and he works out the chemistry of it.

[[http://m.memegen.com/f2ikli.jpg][YES I KNOW THAT]]. That's why I didn't bother going to see it when it came out (well apart from the fact that I was in college at the time auditing postgrad courses instead of fulfilling my breadth requirements because I was a young idiot who thought rules were for other people). Obviously they had to tack a story onto it. What I'm boggling at is the way they did it.

| /For example, the character design in the film bears a resemblance to the illustrations in the book, and its lead character takes his name from the author, Peter Dickinson./

i.e. /the movie/ is SI fanfic.

I'm not sure that's fair. I don't see any evidence that Dickinson was involved with the screenplay for the movie at all. Rankin and Bass certainly aren't known for feeling the need to consult authors in their adaptation of source material.

The complete lack of subtlety in the insert actually bolsters the position that it's not a /self/-insert.
