Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

1. a practical guide to evil by erraticerrata
2. ward by wildbow
3. metaworld chronicles by wutosama
4. the wandering inn by pirateaba
5. forge of destiny by yrsillar
6. worm by wildbow

Admittedly #5 is new, but remaining entries are solid, dominating the top-5 for the past year.

Moreover, there's less stability in the lower 6-20 positions, and I haven't read all, but I'm almost certain they are ~90% male protagonist.

I'm collecting data on powerfully persuasive speech acts; it's part of a dangling thread of curiosity after GPT-2 (a new and fairly powerful text generation algorithm).

I've made a form to collect personal examples of things-someone-said that caused you to seriously change some belief or behavior.

** Devil May Cry 5 is a really really good videogame. It isn't rational or rationalist in pretty much any way, but it's not trying to be - it's all about ridiculously over-the-top stylish action, larger-than-life characters, and an incoherent rule-of-cool setting. But it's a really good game for a series that was desperately in need of a new entry, and the game is just fun as hell. It has two returning characters from earlier entries in the series (Dante and Nero) and a new playable character in V, who is bizzare to control but still quite fun. V walks around being goth as fuck and reads William Blake's poetry constantly - there is an entire 'make V read poetry' /button/ in his controls - while his pet Shadow and Griffin and Nightmare fight controlled by him, and he then teleports around finishing enemies off. Nero in this entry has a robot hand that hot-swaps with different attachments including a rocket arm that flies around punching people and that you can ride on. Dante uses a motorcycle as a weapon. I can't say enough good things about Devil May Cry 5, and overall if you like e.g. Platinum Games style action games (e.g. Bayonetta, Nier Automata, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance) or any of the earlier Devil May Cry games, then this title is worth checking out.

It's a series of animated shorts, in different universes and graphic styles, going from ultra-stylized 2D to photorealistic 3D, exploring transhumanist concepts, in the most 18+ way possible (eg lots of gore and nudity).

- from "Helping Hand", an astronaut
- from "Lucky 13", a military pilot
- from "Zima Blue", a journalist
- from "Blind Spot", a truck pirate / hijacker
- from "Ice Age", a girlfriend.

Even if we count the assassin from "Sonnie's Edge", the main character from "The Witness", and the huli jing from "Good Hunting" as positive matches and make an excuse for hyperboles, that's still far from making "every woman is a prostitute" a fair description of these series.

#+begin_quote

And I feel this is even less accurate: from all the episodes I can remember rapists only in the mentioned background of "Sonnie's Edge", and in the "Good Hunting" --- and that story was more a criticism against [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong][colonial Britain]] than men in general. I couldn't find any sources for judging how accurate this criticism was. I know [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women]["comfort women"]] were a thing during /Japanese/ occupation, but nothing about abuse perpetrated while it was under British rule.

****** Not all the episodes are remotely related to sex, though. In those where sexuality is mentioned or is the subject of the story, (Sonnie's Edge, The Witness, Sucker of Souls, Aquila Rift, Good Hunting, Shape-Shifters, The Dump, Blind Spot, Alternate History):

- Sonnie's Edge, The Witness, Good Hunting, The Dump, Alternate History features men as aggressors and/or women as objects of desire when it comes to sexuality.

- Sucker of Souls, Shape-Shifters and Blind Spot are mostly neutral, with some dirty military humor that sometimes fits the above pattern, but I'm not counting it.

- I'd count Aquila Rift as borderline, because it revolves around a female-coded character manipulating a male character with sex, but it didn't feel as objectifying as eg Sonnie's Edge (where the only female character that doesn't walk around with her breasts out is the rape survivor).

If you count all the episodes like Suits and Lucky 13 where sex isn't brought up at all, then yeah, the series fares much better. And actually, I'd say the series is at its best when it's not trying so hard to get its 18+ rating.

******* Well, you didn't mention a provision in your previous comment about the episodes being sex-related. Besides that, "aggressor" and "rapist" aren't the same thing either. And even the "features men as aggressors" isn't entirely correct.

In "Sonnie's Edge", from the on-screen characters, only the mafia boss and the cage fighter can be described as aggressors (which is rather congruent with their characters), while her male friend from her team isn't. In "The Witness" both the male and female are unintentional aggressors, as we come to see. In "Sucker of Souls" the only character from the whole bunch that can be described as an aggressor is the centuries-old monster, so the analysis is still grossly inaccurate. I have already discussed "Good Hunting" in my previous comment (though there too, the main character is a male and plays the role of a defender), and "The Dump" only features 3 characters, all of whom male, and only 1 of whom an aggressor. And so on and so forth.

So my earlier comment stands --- your description of the series is inaccurate and is picking and choosing data points to make them comply with your narrative.

** Has anyone here researched the use of cannabinoids for pain relief? I suffer from a bit of chronic pain (old injuries from adventure sports, occasional headaches, muscle strains from lifting, etc.) and have found conventional approaches ineffective (otc NSAIDs, various treatments recommended by physical therapists, neurologists, etc., both prescribed medications and stretches, exercises, icing/POLICE, acupuncture, etc.).

I'm curious about exploring the medicinal applications of e.g. CBD oil, or THC, or both, etc. There's a dispensary a few blocks from where I live (in CA), but I haven't gone in yet, mostly out of concern as to the federal illegality -- I attend a public university, and part of my funding (e.g. an NSF-GRF) comes from federal sources, and I'm concerned if they find out they'll pull it or something. IDK. It might not even be effective -- I tried marijuana a handful of times in ugrad (some friends I'd go e.g. backpacking/climbing/snowboarding/kayaking/etc. with would share theirs) and it did almost nothing for me, psychoactively. But I figure several years later it might be worth trying again?

Yes, and from what I've read CBD seems legit for pain management. However, I'd vote for "worth trying whole herb again."

#+begin_quote
  I tried marijuana a handful of times in ugrad... and it did almost nothing for me, psychoactively.
#+end_quote

The first time I smoked, I sincerely believed it wasn't having any real effect on me, in spite of perceptual distortions. I was sitting on a couch in someone's dorm, and the opposite wall seemed to pull in closer and the room seemed to have elongated from side to side in my peripheral vision. Later on when we were in the car, it felt like we were driving at an incredibly high speed. The speedometer disagreed with me, and said we were actually travelling about 5mph below the speed limit. I became convinced that the guy driving the car had secretly switched around the numbers for "miles per hour" and "kilometers per hour" so he could speed without other people in the car knowing it, even though that's completely backwards and even if it weren't backwards it'd still be ridiculous. And yet I was convinced that smoking did almost nothing for me, psychoactively.

Feeling like you don't feel anything the first time you smoke is apparently a fairly common phenomenon. If you tried it a "handful" of times, you could've had a few "first time" experiences if there was enough time between each session. Or you could've been not breathing it down deep into your lungs correctly or not holding it in for at least a full 10 seconds, or it could've been dirt weed (doubtful if we're talking about college in Cali), or any number of things.

If you're specifically looking for pain relief, CBD is worth exploring. The whole herb might be better, but with your history of never having smoked multiple times a day every day for an extended period of time, you might not be able to keep it together in public, not off the potency I expect you'd get from a dispensary in California. Edibles are a good option if you're concerned about the smell getting you caught, but edibles will sneak up on you and thoroughly incapacitate you if you don't know what you're doing, they take a very long time to kick in so some people think they need to eat more because it didn't start working immediately, don't do that, it can take anywhere from 45 minutes to two and a half hours after consumption to begin feeling anything at all, it isn't unheard of for it to take six hours to kick in depending on what you've eaten and when you ate it, and when it /does/ kick in it'll be stronger than smoking an equivalent amount of herb.

Yeah, you might get kicked out if you get caught smoking in the dorms. But half the guys on my floor freshman year all smoked, my roommate wasn't a smoker so I never smoked in /my/ room, but about a third of the guys on my floor all spent a lot of time hanging out in the floor's common room and we'd all go into people's rooms and smoke and play Halo 3 or whatever. You just get a towel and stuff it against the bottom of the door and open the window and stick a fan in the window (hopefully it's obvious that the fan should be pointing /out/) and set the fan on its highest speed and cut some holes in the bottom of a plastic soda bottle and stuff the bottle full of dryer sheets and exhale through that instead of just out into the air, preferably blowing towards the window while near the window so you don't blow dryer sheet chemicals all out into the air you're breathing, even more preferably blowing directly into the fan. I used to keep a callus on my thumb from covering the bowl/pipe so it'd stop burning and releasing smoke into the room. I think most of the other guys did too. Good times.

+I don't recommend doing any of that if you have a nosy goody two-shoes living in the room next door+ Actually, as a disclaimer of liability, officially I don't recommend doing any of that at all regardless of circumstances, and officially I actively recommend against doing it. But if you /were/ to do it, that's how it'd be done. The "bottle full of dryer sheets" thing is called a "sploof" btw.

TLDR: CBD isn't gonna get you kicked out of college. Just run the experiment, try taking it every day for a week and at the end of the week take stock of whether or not you feel better. If you feel like it's helping, then keep taking it, and consider upgrading to CBD oil that also contains THC. If you feel like it's not helping, then consider running the experiment again with CBD oil that also contains THC. Do a little bit of research, don't buy hemp oil.

**** Thank you for the thoughtful comment! Yah, I probably didn't partake in the stuff very competently back when (it'd have been in 2010-2011 at universities in Tennessee and New Zealand, so who knows what the quality was like, probably pretty poor?). Definitely tried to follow the instructions of my more experienced friends -- breathing in deeply and holding the smoke in my lungs -- but may have underperformed idk. Also ate a bunch of brownies once and felt a bit sleepy and tunnel-vision-y for a few hours.

Not living in any dorms, thankfully! but in an apartment off campus. So no worries on getting caught there, but we wouldn't want to smoke anything indoors regardless. I think our biggest concern is just getting found out, or something, and being made to pay back some of the free money we've been given (wife's also received, like, $300k+ in fellowships and stuff, which she'd need to pay back if she doesn't finish her program). We tried going into a dispensary once a year-ish back and they wanted to scan our driver's licenses so we ran away lol. The risk seems small, probability-wise, but multiplying by those large $ amounts still gives uncomfortably large expected losses. IDK how the process goes elsewhere -- maybe the local dispensary doesn't need to keep records of our identities?

** This is a bit of munchkinning for real life.

I work with dementia patients every day, and it's really striking home how /awful/ of a set of diseases it is. If I were to dedicate my life to ending dementia/old age, how would I best go about it?

I'm fairly intelligent (Usually in the top 5% of whatever I dedicate myself to, if the metrics are standardized and based around pattern recognition in some fashion) so I could at least contribute if I were to go the route of a scientist. I'm no prodigy or savant though, so I doubt I'd be able to make any historic breakthroughs.

However, I'm not sure that would be the best way to increase my utility. Would a politician whose goal is to end old age be more efficient via increasing funding of education and research?

Perhaps it'd be better to aim to create a utopia in other ways first (political revolution, ending world hunger etc.), and then have humanities goal of beating death simply be a knock on effect of that.

****** Just a little bit of info according to our already wealthy-and-disease-ending-crusader Bill Gates our biggest problem with Alzheimers is the following:

"The only problem where I don't yet see a clear path forward yet is how to develop more efficient ways to recruit patients for clinical trials. Without a simple and reliable diagnostic for Alzheimer's, it's hard to find eligible people early enough in the disease's progression who can participate in trials. It can take years to enroll enough patients. If we could find a way to pre-screen participants, we could start new trials more quickly.

But there is so much momentum in other areas---scientific tools, better diagnostics, improved access to data---that as long as we can solve the recruitment problem, I am confident that we will make substantial progress in the next decade or two."
