I've long been a fan of Charles Stross; I believe of what's collected in Toast, "A Colder War" is my favorite, in part because of my love for the Cold War era (and the analysis that Stross puts towards it). For the same reason I'm a fan of "Missile Gap" (not in this collection), which features Cold War era Earth flattened out and put on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderson_disk][an Alderson disk]], which has some immediate consequences for civilizations that have intercontinental ballistic missiles as part of their balance of power.

*** /Toast/ was an early collection; there's a rather better-curated one from 2008, /Wireless/, which I view as a replacement. (For a bonus, it also contains the novellas /Missile Gap/ -- which won a Locus award -- and /Palimpsest/ -- which won a Hugo.)

I'm vaguely fumbling my way towards a Laundry Files short story collection some time in the next 2-4 years, but really, the rise of ebook distribution of short stories is probably killing the short story collection as a distinct category. (They never sell as well as novels, which makes publishers reluctant to touch them, and now that short stories can stay in print indefinitely as ebooks in the $0.49-1.99 price range there's much less point in compiling them.)

STRAP HIM DOWN AND DISSECT HIM! Then we can learn how to climb out of the internet and become real ourselves!

Also, what do you think of your recent little blog-spat about the long arc of modern politics with David Brin?

Sorry, you're already the Bizarro-world you. When real life stops resembling a cyberpunk novel about what happens when you let capitalism run amok, /then/ you can be Normal-world you.

**** /Wireless/ is great; I have both a paper copy and the ebook version, and consider both to have been well worth the money. I'm still idly wishing for a novel-length treatment of /Palimpsest/ (but I'm also eagerly anticipating /The Annihilation Score/, /Dark State/, and everything else, like some greedy dragon who collects Stross novels instead of gold coins).

***** /Palimpsest/ is going to be a novel ... eventually. (I've got a lot of notes on the second third of it, not so much on the final third. It's way down the to-do stack.)

Next up after /Annihilation Score/ and the Empire Games trilogy (of which /Dark State/ is the first volume) is /Nightmare Stacks/ (about 75% written in first draft), aka Laundry Files book 7. Then there's /probably/ going to be a one-off gothic horror/fantasy SF thing, then Laundry Files book 8. By which time it will be 2018 and all plans will have changed again ...

****** Oh god, this is wonderful news. I've long been unable to decide whether your /Palimpsest/ or Greg Egan's /Orthogonal Trilogy/ has my favorite model of time travel. Having /Palimpsest/ turned into a full novel may finally put that internal debate to rest.

******* It's going to take me a /long/ time -- I know roughly what the novel is about, but it's on a larger scale than anything else I've done except /Accelerando/ and getting it right will be hard (/Accelerando/ is very flawed).

******** That's reasonable, it's also not as if your writing queue isn't already quite long without adding it in.

I've actually been wondering how you'd fit a full version of /Palimpsest/ in a even a single book. The model of time travel seems to give you an immense space to play in, and there are surely at least a thousand interesting stories exploring any number of themes in even just the chunk of that ... time fractal^{?} ... where the Stasis wasn't in control.

The process by which you pick and choose the threads you want to focus on is something I'd love a chance to peek into after you're done. (even after you filter out the threads which don't depend strongly on the unique properties of the setting, there are a lot of choices)

Somewhat tangentially, it tends to get my hackles up when people compare /Accelerando/ unfavorably with your other work. It's a bit surreal making the same argument to you, but despite its technical flaws it's a wonderful piece of work, mostly because of its scale.

Sure, you're gotten a lot better at both the technical aspects of writing, and in how you present the various big ideas that are part of your work, but /Accelerando/ did a wonderful job of presenting a huge stack of those big ideas. The fact that you threaded a few characters and one broad narrative through a huge time scale made it much easier to relate to the vastly different worlds you portrayed.

Admittedly, I'm a mite bit biased. I read /Accelerando/ as a kid and it's had a huge influence on who I am. The grooves it etched have been worn into canyons by other works and experiences, but you can still see the eddies and meanders it caused. Hell, when people ask me about my goals in life I still end up talking about Manfred Manx, so feel free to take what I say with a bit of salt.

*** I always feel like I'm talking about people behind their back when I talk about them using their real names, instead of using [[/u/cstross]] or [[/u/alexanderwales]]. I certainly enjoy knowing when people are talking about the things I've created, even if I don't want to participate in the discussion. It's a courtesy, at least on reddit. Although I imagine if you were interested in that kind of thing, you could tune google alerts to do a lot better of a job.

Anyway, it's a very nice change of pace from the recent influx of pop-culture and anime related topics. Some nice old hard-scifi.

As someone who didn't really grow up in that much of a sci-fi household, more along these lines is always appreciated.

**** I sort of feel silly recommending things by Stross, because ... I mean, if you're in [[/r/rational]], surely you've already read /Palimpsest/ and /Accelerando/, right? Or you at least have heard enough about them to know that they're not going to be a thing you would enjoy? If you're the sort of person who enjoys singularity fiction, then you almost have to have read /Rainbows End/ by Vernor Vinge. I wouldn't go into [[/r/steampunklit]] and say, "Hey, you guys should check out /The Difference Engine/," for the same reason; if you're there, you should already know it.

But at the same time, I know that there are people who /don't/ know the classics, except by osmosis, and I know that threads like this are good for discussion.

Vinge: "fire upon the deep" is extremly well written and quite probably the most epic space opera I know of. Also fullheartedly supporting "rainbows end".
