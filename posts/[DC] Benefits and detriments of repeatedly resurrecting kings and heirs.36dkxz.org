***** I've always understood that the vanilla lich became evil due to the horrible things done in pursuit of immortality (non-issue here due to help from friendly necromancers) or due to massive influx of negative plane energy, then if the moral component of the alignment defaults to 'evil' the solution would be for ministers/family/assistants present on the ritual to use the helm or any handy alignment changing magic before releasing or waking their new undead king. (did this on a campaign to the BBEG's minions and it looked like a zombie movie in reverse. all the enemies that fell to us returned as part of our horde :D )

***** A helm of opposite alignment is /permanent/, and triggered by its donning. That is to say, removing it doesn't do a thing. The magic has its effect the second the helm touches your head, and lasts indefinitely.

Furthermore:

#+begin_quote
  The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.
#+end_quote

So, changing back isn't so trivial. But:

#+begin_quote
  Only a wish or a miracle can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated.
#+end_quote

So there is a way to transform the victim back to his or her former alignment, but it needs some seriously heavyweight magic. It's possible, but far from easy.

I actually did exactly this in 2YE; afterwards, it was pointed out to me by some reviewers that it doesn't work because undead are immune to mind-affecting spells. Even if you ignore that, a DC 15 Will save stops you from being affected, and a Lich will basically always make his save. (So the solution is to keep putting it on him until he rolls a 1.

**** Interestingly, they are also the only absolutely final-by-RAW form of death in D&D. To do the ritual the person has to lose a level and then pay 1,000 XP. If they lose the level but can't pay the XP then they die, turn to dust, and "can't be resurrected *by any means*." [emphasis added]

That even includes divine intervention.

** Remember that resurrection is a voluntary process on the part of the deceased. An opposing king is a waste of a diamond, as said king would PROBABLY rather let his crown prince succeed him than to let himself be captured --- especially if HIS OWN clerics have schemes of their own to get him resurrected.

*** Is it ever stated in RAW that the departed soul knows who is trying to resurrect him? I think it's a binary choice -- if you don't want to be resurrected you can't be, but if you do want to be resurrected then you automatically answer the first call that comes in.

**** D&D 3.5 Player's Handbook, page 171:

#+begin_quote
  A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.
#+end_quote

The reason it's hard to find this particular quote if you don't know it already exists is because it's a general mechanic of bringing characters back to life (and is therefore in with the rest of the general spell mechanics like caster level and arcane spell failure) and not a specific feature of the spells that perform the job.

Also of note, Complete Divine states:

#+begin_quote
  The soul has a general sense of how long it's been dead [...] The soul also has a sense of which spell is bringing it back to life; it can tell how painful the return journey into a living body will be.
#+end_quote

If the deceased has reason to believe that he's going to be subject to torment, torture, or just plain bizarre circumstances (e.g. being resurrected decades or millennia later), they might not be all that interested in going along with it.

Of course, on the other hand, RAW does actually have a loophole for the old-age problem -- two of them, in fact! One: Reincarnation! You're given a new "young adult" class body. Two: Polymorph Any Object! Polymorphing into a younger version of oneself is (1) the same kingdom, (2) the same class, (3) the same size, (4) related (reflexively), and (5) same intelligence, so therefore the spell effect is permanent.

****** Another interesting idea: Gate His Highness's spirit in from the Outer Planes. Heaven knows (or Elysium, or the Abyss, or whatever) what creature type he'll be at that point... but it's an interesting loophole in the cosmology.

****** PAO being dispellable is of course a valid concern, but D&D doesn't have rules for instantly dropping dead of old age. If someone does dispel it, you're just a doddering old codger with -6 Str, -6 Dex, and -6 Con. You're not dead, and you're still wearing a set of kingly magic items. The spell can be recast at a mage's next convenience (or could even be bound into a magic item so that His Highness can reassert it himself).

In fact the two loopholes can be combined -- Reincarnate the king when he falls, so that he's young and healthy but still bears the wisdom (and intelligence, and charisma) of years, and then polymorph him into his old body. This might even have the convenient side effect of making the king his own decoy: someone dispels the polymorph on the king and they think they've uncovered someone impersonating royalty, and they don't think he's worth a king's ransom.

******** Why thank you. :D It occurred to me just as I was writing that post. I tend to be a bit of a rules lawyer when it comes to tabletop RPGs, but I like looking for FUN ways to play with the mechanics as much as stuff that's simply overpowered. If there's no flavor to it, it's not really roleplaying, is it?

** I'm a bit confused about which edition this is based on. Is there any version of D&D where Raise Dead and Ressurection don't result in level loss? That'd put a big damper on the whole constant Resurrection thing.

Sure True Resurrection doesn't lead to level loss, but she never mentions that and it's a 9th level spell, by which point the game is irreparably broken anyway.

Also, in the coup scenario, they'd probably just kill the king in a way that prevents easy resurrection. That's not hard to do.

Of course in 3.5, magic is so insanely overpowered that the only reasonable form of government is a magocracy.

*** u/codahighland:
#+begin_quote
  don't result in level loss
#+end_quote

This was addressed obliquely:

#+begin_quote
  The King, his soul returned, lies in his post-battle glow for up to a week recovering from being hacked to pieces by the opposing army.
#+end_quote

In other words, yeah, it does result in level loss, because he has to recover, but on the assumption that he's carrying out kingly duties -- and considering that he just technically survived an encounter that was difficult enough to kill him -- he's got enough XP coming in to address that.
