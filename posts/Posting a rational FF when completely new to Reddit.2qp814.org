I completed (last year) a novel exploring the likely rational aftermath of the only ending to the Mass Effect 3 video game which permitted the protagonist a future.

Partly this was to tick off an item ("Novel") on my bucket list, partly a reaction to the lack of closure, mostly because I felt that the scientific accuracy of opinions on the game was lamentable.

It was posted on Fanfiction.net. A short time ago I heard about Reddit from my (scientist) daughter. The fanfic in question probably should have been posted on Reddit's [[/r/rational]].

While extremely computer literate, I'm yet a complete stranger to social media, including Reddit, so am asking for assistance in posting this story where it might be appreciated - for whatever it's worth:

Relevant details: - The title is "After Dark". - Link to the story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9847401/1/After-Dark]]


** Fanfiction.net is a good place to post fan fiction. Just post a link to your story wherever you want to promote. (e.g. here or on wherever mass effect fans are)

*** Thank you, done. I've edited the post to include a link, expanded on that in a post below, and "submitted" a link as suggested. That would appear to cover all the bases.

Warning: it runs to some 200,000 words, being a true novel rather than a novella. There are 111 chapters, in seven story arcs, though I couldn't see how to use subdivisions like that on FF.net. The first arc explores the events around the end-game from the point of view of people running around without a full picture of tevents. So the story starts slowly.

**** I should hope so. The necessary background information was included in the text; that's why it's novel-length.
