Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So, a couple of days ago, my best buddy called the Kadarshev Scale "the Kardashian Scale". Now I'm sitting here regretting my life choices.

On a more serious note, I've been binging on some mecha Anime like Gundam, Code Geass, Evangelion etc.

Now the most glaring thing that is common in them (other than the giant mecha) is that these mechas are the strongest weapons in the arsenal of whatever military the show is focused on. But most shows never explain the why; they show the mecha in question doing feats no conventional weapons could but never why it could do them. Some handwave it away as Lost Tech of the Precursors while other completely ignore it.

Another issue that these mechas are always piloted from within, instead of say, remotely piloted. This can be rationalized as the enemy being in possession of a device to hijack or block the signals. But both of these issues can be solved by a nested AI.

And it makes me wonder; in what circumstances would a giant pilotable humanoid mecha be more viable in combat than literally any other type of weapon?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

*** I think Evangelion justifies it pretty well. It's a bio-mechanical being that requires a human ego to operate it. Conventional weapons didn't work against the angels, so they needed something that could generate its own AT field. Considering the evas were modeled after Adam's biology (or Lilith's, I've always been confused by that), it makes sense that they were the only weapons capable of defeating the angels.

The dummy plug system is pretty much an AI developed to pilot the evas. The only reason they didn't use them before was because they needed to collect battle data before they could implement it. The crazy feats and flexibility of the mechs were because they were basically organic bodies held together by a metal frame. They weren't really robots, more like monsters with electronic controls attached.

*** I have a reason for mecha to not be piloted remotely: lag. Modern drones are essentially flying artillery pieces that usually target stationary targets, but mechs are usually designed to function as infantry so they need quick reaction time. If the pilot was on the battlefield then the remote might still work, but they'd be vulnerable to interference unless the pilot was in an easily visible position, in which case they're a prime target that needs additional protection.

*** A setting I drafted had mechas with human/AI pilots, in the setting AI were second class citizens, humans were there for accountability reasons (e.g. if somebody was killed the human was responsible).

It featured shape-shifting mechas, rather than plain humanoid ones, they were used to missions other than combat (e.g. reconnaissance, search & rescue), alternate shapes were useful for moving through unusual environments.

Protocol favored long range engagement, in space it meant using simpler geometric shapes (e.g. cylinder, sphere), to minimize surface area, but in short range combat the mechas armor was too strong for short ranged blast weapons and long ranged weapons would destroy both the enemy and yourself, so melee combat was most useful (e.g. hold the enemy while you focus a short range blaster in more vulnerable locations).

Mechas were preferred to other types of vehicles because they had great versatility (e.g. could reshape as some kind of jets) and could carry a decent amount of firepower.

*** Gundam series has in-universe explanation for both points, see: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics?from=Main.MinovskyParticle]]

#+begin_quote
  Yoshiyuki Tomino wanted to write a Real Robot anime. However, anyone remotely familiar with either engineering or military tactics will tell you that such devices are almost impossible to effectively use; a bipedal platform is needlessly complicated, hard to properly armor, and the easiest thing to shoot at on a battlefield. Enter the Minovsky Particle: an EMP-like, sensor-jamming, delicate-electronics wrecking Plot Device that not only renders all ranged targeting and guided missiles useless, but requires Helium-3 to produce. Consequently, humans had to go to space to get Helium-3, fight old-school close combat battles using systems capable of tricky microgravity maneuvering, and eventually standardize the technology to simplify maintenance. The result? A world full of Humongous Mecha --- which, far from being contrived, seem like a natural evolution of military technology in light of the Minovsky Particle. And what's truly elegant is the metafiction: from a Doylist view, Mobile Suits made the particle necessary; but from the Watsonian or In-Universe view, it's the particle that made Mobile suits necessary.

**** So the PLOT DEVICE particle makes mecha militarily viable - but how? How do they make the jump from "needs pilots" to "giant fucking space robot"? I mean, all of these things could be solved by conventional spacecraft - just put the dude in an armored capsule with thrusters, and, I don't know, fire missiles at short range. Or use laser stuff. Or, if you really need a physical payload, arm it with a railgun.

I mean, at least half of it isn't contrived, but the giant robot part (frankly, the most important part) is still kind of stupid.

Which answered the question How do they make the jump from "needs pilots" to "giant fucking space robot". From the creator's perspective (original 1979 Gundam), having an universe where Giant Robots are natural outcome of technical evolution was an absolute must. All the fake science and social-economic conditions are tailored towards that goal. Given the impracticality of giant mechas in real world, it's very easy to admit this is an impossible goal - however Yoshiyuki Tomino took on the challenge and thus birthed the "real robot" subgenere; what he had done in the original Gundam and some other high quality works in the franchise is not unlike UNSONG, taking an absurd idea and went with it with dead seriousness and mulit-layerd world building.

** I'm curious what applications you can think of for certain kinds of intelligence powers. Basically I'm trying to imagine all the advantages a superhuman might have if they were basically at peak human level with weak regen the standard minor hero package, and they effectively had a brain that was effectively a supercomputer, and a nervous system that operated perfectly precisely basically being replaced with fiber optics; plus some somewhat improved senses.

/How powerful would someone be if they were basically a electronic mind that happened to be stuck in a human body but still had the speed and other advantages of being in a supercomputer?/

I'm writing something where I'm giving the protagonist basically every intelligence ability I can other than being qualitatively smarter (because that's nearly impossible to writer). The obvious things that come to mind are being able to view things in slow motion, and being able to control one's emotions to remain totally calm in danger.

*BONUS:* The character also has extremely weak telekinesis (able to apply force on the scale of a dozen grams) that can only be applied on surfaces he can see, with the precision being limited only by his ability to see the effect being done. This power obeys manton effects, however dead skin and hair isn't protected.\\
How much use can you have for this if you can already see the world in super slow-mo and thus see bullets travelling (even if that's way too fast to do anything with stuff other than your TK)? How much could you affect bullets by applying extremely small amounts of force very precisely?

That did seem to me to be one of the coolest applications of this power. /Finally a situation where having a character dual wield uzi's is plausible!/ They could calculate their firing such that each shot's recoil would shift the gun into position for the next shot, and to make themselves harder to hit they may want to be constantly diving through the air. So yeah basically your typical action hero stuff, /except rational/!

In some senses the ability to use a gun without a great deal of skill was among its big advantages early on, until the gap in skill between the general populace and soldiers grew larger. The difference here is that extremely precise marksmanship has historically been thought of as being associated with skill, plus the fact the human is pretty much superfluous here, just stick the gun on a drone and you have something way more effective than a human sniper.

***** Can he sense how well he's pushing? If there's no feedback, then it's virtually useless.

If he can only move air he can 'see', then fog or some colored gas will work.

The main use of telekinesis in the novel is to direct the path of thrown knives or arrows. The author cheated a little by allowing an instinctive sense of trajectories and the ability to know where the arrow will land to allow the main character to know how to best 'adjust' the path. But considering that virtually the very first thing computers were used for when invented in WWI (or was it WWII?) was ballistics, then your character should be capable of calculating trajectories.

Can he move things through a window, mirror, or a camera? Can he affect bacteria through a microscope?

Also can you explain /why/ there's a Manton effect? It just doesn't make sense as a natural law unless it's an artificial limitation. Also if he can only affect surfaces of what he can see and if dead skin cells aren't covered in the Manton effect, then the Manton effect will only ever come into play if he needs to move the insides of a body during surgery for some reason.

****** Well the obvious point of having a manton effect is to keep him from just being able to apply force extremely precisely to basically cut into blood vessels close to the skin. If you can be precise enough to living tissue you could just slit peoples throats on sight, rendering guns pointless. I'm thinking there aren't any limits on range and it can work on any live feed, it might even work if he had good enough sonar information to work off or something.\\
Basically I think given his intelligence powers allowing him to not have manton limitations would allow easy instakills to anyone within sensing range. Plus if he could sense feedback from the TK then he could have some impressive control over lots of delicate electronics; he could snip wires inside of any electronics at range.

I think it would still work just fine without any feedback because he /always/ applies exactly as much force as he tries to the power operates like a very precise machine. He /could/ easily use the power on bacteria if he could see them in real time through a microscope but I don't actually see that being that useful.

The manton effects are the result of the fact that everybody (but not entities below a certain level of intelligence) has at least some very small connection to the superpower granting force, and that force is much better at affecting things within one's own body than on other things. So even people without powers can still automatically negate a power as weak as his affecting their body. They can't however counter that same amount of force from a hypothetical natural cause, it's way easier to negate other powers affects on your body than natural effects.

If you are interested here's a google doc with some rough world building stuff. A great deal won't make sense because the bits explaining /the actual powers/ aren't covered in my docs writing, sufice to say their are only like a dozen powers: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWbs_7Yl-oQWX2lxMOqTpOO6WyZs-7r5RPvlDJ_fOUc/edit?usp=sharing]]

******* Okay I get the Manton effect, but it's still a little odd in my opinion to be able to affect skin and hair since that's an unusual dividing line versus a few millimeters from the skin. He could pull hair strands out and stick it into opponents' eyes or pull eyelids closed for distractions. I mean, it's really disturbing in a fight to be constantly feeling little pinches and tugs on your skin and clothes.

If there's no feedback, then while it's harder to be precise without inhuman precision, it also prevents the ability to learn how durable a particular material is without extensive prior testing. Also how can you learn what a material is on sight? For example how much force can cotton take versus styrofoam? Also am I seeing cotton or styrofoam from a distance? There'll be errors if one can't learn the best amount of force to use, even if you could be perfectly exact.

******** Yeah I can see why it would make sense to extend manton effects out a bit, however on the other hand dead cells have no better justification to be protected than say clothing. Plus except for body hair, hair extends way too far from the skin to be protected. Still the examples you gave are by no means game breaking and the ability to blind normal opponents by forcing their eyes closed actually sounds pretty cool.

As for the lack of feedback it would cause errors, however given the amount of subjective time he has his enhanced senses and all the intelligence powers he would be able to correct for a great deal of them with math. Mainly I decided to give the character a weak secondary power so he could still do certain actions unhindered by physical speed, plus I was thinking about how combined with his intelligence powers this could allow him to defeat vastly larger amounts of enemies in gunfights.

Having read a few chapters into the second book of that series you linked, I can say the protagonist is still vastly overlooking some of his powers applications. Having no limit to the size you can affect, and being able to sense inside of objects you could do quite a lot. In a modern setting the power would be far more powerful because you could disable any electronic device in range by cutting some wires, which is why I'm not allowing my character to have that.\\
Even at the powers max range you ought to be able to instantly cut anything in any desired way, the power could act as a sort of infinitely fine blade unless there are limitations on size effects; however given what he can do with heat and sound this doesn't really seem to be the case.\\
There's also quite a lot you can do with lots of sound, but the author alluded to this in the epilogue of the first book so I suspect he will use this. Though I wonder if he tries some of the many effects you could cause using infra/ultrasound on somebodies body.\\
There's also the fact you could heat an incredibly small area a great deal to create light, or other forms of radiation.\\
I'll just have to see what the author does, people underestimate the sheer power weak TK would have without many restrictions.

That part makes sense to me as a function of tensile strength rather than a size limitation. I agree with your power limitations, but with a different reasoning. Even if you can concentrate it to a vanishingly small point/line, there still has to be a limit to what materials he still can cut through because otherwise he would be able to get infinite strength. I might be wrong about the physics though so take my reasoning with a grain of salt.

Good luck with the writing.

I don't really see how that follows. Just because you could use that power to cut through anything you still couldn't say lift things above a certain weight. I just don't think there's any way to escape the conclusion that precise enough telekinesis would allow you to replicate the effects of a infinitely thin frictionless sword; you ought to be able to cut anything in any way you desire without exerting more than maybe a microscopic amount of force.
