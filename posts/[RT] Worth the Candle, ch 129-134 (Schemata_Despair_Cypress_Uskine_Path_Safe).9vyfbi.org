Time to give my unasked for opinion again--Having read your back catalog there often seems to be an inflection point in your writing where you start the back half of the story and start increasing the pace (closing the plot threads that were opened and not starting enough new ones (which has the indirect effect of setting a timer on the work )) from the scope of what you have set out to be Juniper's quests it may be a little to early to go down this route. You've hit gold with this story, a deep wide vein in a copper molybdenum mine, in a way that most authors hope to do at least once in their life. Enjoy it. Don't let yourself get bored, or rushed, take your time and let your following grow. We love this work (it resonates deeply with many of us and we want to be able to keep reading it for another couple of years as you cross the $5,000 mark).

Hyposoc, who does the great Polyhistor Academy quest over @ QQ, does some similar worldbuilding interludes. I enjoy some of them more than the main story, something that comes across a bit paranoia-riddled due to having a playerbase and being a survival quest. I could see similar being the case with WTC, which is great, but scaffolded completely to Juniper's neuroses. June's story is great, but sometimes I think the best part of Aerb are the twists it puts on traditional fantasy worldbuilding. "DND Lit," or whatever you wanna call it, is a terribly shallow genre.

Just imagine: "Desperate criminal Fireteam X, put between a rock and a hard place, choose the hard place. They go to one place they know the Empire won't follow: the ____ exclusion zone."

*** I don't know if this would be considered a typo or something else, but...

In earlier chapters, Joon brought up the infohazards, in regards to the Actual Cannibal's name being said by Bethyl. When he described the transmission mechanism, she /immediately/ corrected him about how that wasn't a infohazard, and went into a description about the differences between comhazards, cognitohazards, and infohazards. Like this was a distinction that mattered, and should offer insight into the level of specificity she is used to in dealing with this phenomenon.

However, in the recent batch if chapters, she throws all that away, and uses infohazard as the go to work for anything memetic, including usages inconsistent with the previous definitions she hers gave.

As an example, the whole miraculous thing. That is pretty obviously a cognitohazard thing. It isn't dangerous to /know/ about the miraculous food, or to /know/ about baked chicken, or chocolate, or broccoli, or snot. It is 'dangerous' however, to be /thinking/ about snot while partaking in the miraculous.

The lazy use of the label 'infohazard' when she had made a deal about it earlier just stood out to me, is all.

** I continue to be amazed by how good /Worth the Candle/ is.

The number of unique magical systems/locations/creations it includes is staggering. Just this update, we had library magic, passion magic, spirit magic and soul/spirit magic interactions, all of which seem pretty unorthodox; the Infinite Library as a concept, messages from the future about both large-scale history and individual lives, speculations about the library's mechanics, hints about more complexity still (Celestar, Void Beast, Outer Reaches, Fel Seed, Thargox), memetic kill agents as used by the Second Empire, a close-up look at one of them, about a dozen new entads, eel-offsprings-beard people, and miraculous.

It feels as though every new paragraph includes information about some new element of worldbuilding, which is exactly what you'd expect from a story about a world made by combining several years' worth of D&D campaigns together. And it's still /coherent/.

On top of that, we have the game layer and the in-universe narrative, which add their own complexities while taking into account/incorporating the above.

Finally, we have upper-level narrative and characterization, which are excellent as well, from Juniper and his companions, to Uther's largely unknown history and the Dungeon Master's largely unknown goals, to relatively minor characters such as Taft. (But Amaryllis is the best of them, this is simply self-evident.)

/Worth the Candle/ integrates a fiendishly complicated world with a meta-plot to tell a compelling story, and it's fascinating.

--------------

That said, let's discuss scary red text.

First three lines seem obvious: they depict the memagent's gradual consumption of Juniper's memory/attention. Last line is clear enough too, it speaks about limiting the memagent's influence and doesn't give us almost any new information except making an opaque reference to "X5R contingency".

Let's focus on these bits, then:

#+begin_quote
  WARNING: CUSTOM LOGIC PROCESS HAS EXCEEDED 512 CONSECUTIVE FUNCTION CALLS. ESTIMATED TIME TO EXIT LOGIC PROCESS WITHOUT INTERVENTION = 5.8 * 10^{53} PT. ESTIMATED TIME TO MEATSPACE FAILURE WITHOUT INTERVENTION = 5.5 * 10^{48} PT.

  <...> LIMITING CUSTOM LOGIC PROCESS FUNCTION CALLS TO 1 PER 1.8 * 10^{43} PT <...>
#+end_quote

The most interesting question is, of course, what this "meatspace failure" is.

"PT" clearly measures time in some capacity. (Though I'm not sure what exactly it stands for. Processing times? Peta-ticks?)

From that, we could infer that the memagent would last 10^{10}X, where X = 5.8 * 10^{43} PT, that "meatspace failure" would occur in roughly 10^{5}X, and that restricting the memagent's calls-for-attention to one call per every "~X" is rare enough that Juniper is able to act against it (but presumably not rare enough that it's completely nullified).

Let's assume X = ~1 second. Then "meatspace failure" would occur in ~28 hours, and Juniper's mind would deal with the memagent without the game's interference in 317 years. That seems consistent with the assumption that "meatspace failure" means Juniper's Aerbian death (he would be killed by the librarians just before the shift change).

An alternative interpretation is, of course, that "meatspace failure" refers to the death of Juniper's physical body, with Aerb being the simulation. In this case, either Juniper is almost dead out there in reality, or X = ~2*10^{4} seconds (and the time until the failure is ~60 years). The latter seems implausible, since it would basically freeze the memagent.

Thoughts?

*Edit:* Ah. In retrospect, PT obviously means "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time][Planck times]]".

In this case, 1 PT = 5.39 * 10^{-44} seconds, memagent calls restriction is 0.97 seconds, meatspace failure happens in 82 hours, and memagent effect's duration is 991 years.

My guess was close enough, I suppose.

Really sucks that not only did Joon kill or cripple several incredibly selfless and dedicated people, and then have Raven also betray them in order to get Joon out.

I get why he wrote it this way because it's pretty fun, but it's constantly pissing me off that it makes absolutely Zero sense for this to have happened, why did Joon have such a lapse of judgement he risked a level up like that? I can't work it out

**** It's been months since I read it, but the biggest obstacle to LevelUp!Joon's desires was impulse control. The entire reason behind his shift is an extremely powerful desire to get the Level Up pleasure again and again and again, like a drug addict except it involves an even more powerful pleasure. This isn't an optimally rational AI with a strongly weighted terminal value, this is a human brain who is really itching to get its next high, so maintaining the charade that his values haven't changed is extremely difficult. I'm almost certain I remember Joon attacking because Raven got suspicious enough to invoke containment or something, he didn't just flip out for no reason.

So, in theory, anything whatsoever should be possible with the two of them.

Buut some things, including age, could definitely be arbitrarily locked (the way some skills are in the Soul), just to avoid the skill being game-breaking. On the other hand, Arthur must've had a decent reason for eliminating every practitioner out there - it must be pretty damn powerful as is.

I mean, realistically, finding your True Love is something that happens rarely, and not to everyone. I think it's realistic that, during her entire political career, Mary would never meet someone that matches her core values and tastes as well as Joon does.

They do have pretty good chemistry, to be honest. They have similar interests. Joon is always willing to listen to Mary and hear her out, and he legitimately considers and analyzes her ideas, but he also stands for himself when he disagrees with her. Their qualities complement each other's flaws.

(except for the whole "killing people" thing; they're kind of a bad on influence on each other in that regard)

I think Spirit magic can alter your sexual and romantic preferences (it could probably make Mary permanently heterosexual, for instance), but I don't think it can alter what kind of person you'd want to spend your life with, not without also changing some pretty central parts of your personality.

Additionally, there are the following words with apostrophes:

​

three letter apostrophe words: "it's, he's, he'd, we'd, it'd"

four letter apostrophe words: "don't, can't, isn't, won't, she's, you'd, let's, who's, she'd, ain't, who'd"

I was thinking about it and actually there's a decent chance lvl!Joon has the right of it.

I don't think the DM has ever actually said what it is that Joon needs to accomplish in order to take the Overgod spot. We all assume that it's quest-based - he's got to do something or other and save the world.

That makes sense from Joon's perspective because the way he runs all his games is via narrative quid-pro-quo: the player does a quest to advance the story, and the DM rewards them with more quest hooks that advance the story.

The thing is, there's /two/ tangible benefits to following the narrative - you advance the story, sure, but *you also get XP*.

What if the thing that is going to get Joon the overgod spot isn't completing the story, but /literally gaining those powers through the system/? Then completing quests will get him there eventually, but there might be faster ways to go up the power curve.

Joon seems to despise munchkinry. He's avoided re-speccing his character sheet in a life where a sub-optimal build could literally get him killed.

But you know where munchkinry gets you? Pun-pun. A kobold who ascends to literal overgod status by manipulating a series of poorly-worded rules.

And then, once you're the overgod, it doesn't really matter who you betrayed or what companions you killed to get there, does it? You can just set the universe to whatever idyllic state you want.

** Got sick, did a reread while recuperating. Here's a theory I waited for the next chapter thread to post, though it may be a literal fever dream.

The "Loyalty" stat runs the other way from what Juniper assumes and the party accepts. Loyalty tracks his loyalty to his companions, not theirs to him. He is not earning Loyalty updates through being a good guy, he is performing speech actions of loyalty to earn them.

Drop back to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25846587#workskin][chapter 2]], ctrl-f for "To my surprise" for the first Loyalty popup. "Cypress" hands over a pistol, demonstrating trust and loyalty, no popup. Then:

#+begin_quote
  “Seven souls,” I said. “I'll be back when I have them.”

  *Loyalty Increased: Amaryllis lvl 0!*
#+end_quote

Grab the full epub from the "Download" link at the top of any chapter on AO3, ctrl-f for "loyalty". Popups all happen immediately after Juniper says something to demonstrate his loyalty. (One exception: Amaryllis willing Loyalty, discussed below.)

The model is simpler:

- Just like skills go up based on practice with a "lvl" message, so does Loyalty. It's not feelings, it's speech actions.
- It's not 1. Juniper does something, 2. companion feels good about it, 3. ding. Middle step is gone.
- It removes an exception from the washater, where Loyalty was the lone stat of a companion's that Juniper sees on one of his pages rather than by connecting to their souls.

Things that feel like they're explained better:

- Companion personality/behavior doesn't change when Loyalty does (remember all the early worries about it being mindrape).
- Loyalty to Grak starts negative because Juniper thinks from Fenn's "heist" intro that they're pulling a con on da. It grows so slowly because Juniper pays little attention and does nothing for Grak. "Grak's loyalty increased four times, mostly from the two of us idly speaking with each other, usually for no clear reason." - because his model is wrong.
- Loyalty to Val leaps up because she's Joon-bait and it works. She is the superstimulus version of Maddie.
- The instances where Juniper gets Loyalty updates for multiple companions at once are when he's doing something (or apologizing + recommitting) affecting them all, like on the train getting Amaryllis's planning back on track by pushing the group to respect Grak's privacy. There's never a place where he does something for companion A and companion B is moved to a Loyalty increase, which makes no sense if the stat is tracking B's feelings.
- Bump to Amaryllis in ch 94 when Juniper offers to do chores.
- Twinned Souls and Symbiosis are a benefit from Juniper to the companion, not the reverse.
- First message about the Doe appears when he sees the deer, not when the deer sees him.
- After that, every on-screen increase for the Doe is when he makes a genuine effort to see the world from its perspective. Especially the blade of grass (lvl 3) and riding (lvl 7) bumps, that entirely happens in his head: if Loyalty tracks the Doe's feelings, it must have the totally-unmentioned power to read his mind.
- Feelings and demonstrations of loyalty that don't get a lvl:

  - Amaryllis chooses Juniper over Poul, and takes him out of Comfort, and tells him about the secret teleportation key, and nothing happens; he's thoughtful and takes his turn answering questions, ding.
  - All the companions say things in support of Juniper, or step into harm's way for him, or drag him out of bath fights, or do nine million other things, and there's no lvls srsly I'm not listing all these. If Loyalty tracks their feelings, somehow they never realize their feelings just before, in doing, or after an action; only when Juniper says something.
  - Pallida pledges her life. Even if this is less of a commitment for renacim, it's more than any companion has pledged. The next day, Pallida gifts the Egress and a crate of entads.
  - Raven tells the secret of the Inifinite Library and the conspiracy to repeatedly save the world around it. The next day, she offers Uther's buried treasure and agrees to let Juniper into the Infinite Library.

- More broadly: Juniper never receives a Loyalty increase when he can't see the companion. If it's based on their thoughts about him, never once did any companion chat with another in a different room and learn of or reflect on something he's done and feel more loyal about it? Even Fenn reading his letters in the time chamber?

Equally unexplained:

- Loyalty doesn't decrease. I'd expect Val's to drop at the funeral, but I also would've expected Amaryllis's to go down after she soulfucks herself out of love or Fenn's to drop before the breakup, so this is a wash.
- Amaryllis gets three bumps by thinking about it in chapter 50. This one's weird in either model, and Juniper calls it out as such.
- Passives are irregular. Only Val and Bethel get custom Companion Passives at lvls 10 and 20. Val gets an error about Twinned Souls (makes sense, she has no soul), but Bethel doesn't. (Juniper mentioned he wants to see how Bethel's soul would present via essentialism and but he forgot and apparently hasn't been in his soul since.) Val doesn't get Symbiosis or an error at 20 and no one comments on it.

Explained worse:

#+begin_quote
  *Loyalty Increased: Amaryllis lvl 22!*

  “What does it feel like, internally, for your loyalty to go up?” I asked.

  “Oh,” said Amaryllis. She sat and thought about that. “It feels like learning something important about you in a way that makes me like you more. I'm trying to think of all the times you told me it happened ... usually there's some element of surprise, even if it's affirming something that I already thought about you. Sometimes it's a reminder about the sort of person you are.”
#+end_quote

This is the only time a companion shows awareness of increases. Maybe it's wishful thinking on her part. Bethel even asks a "light and airy" question in ch 127 implying she's totally oblivious to them. (Grak and Bethel only comment on the new powers that come with lvl 10, not the updates themselves.)

So, there's my theory about Loyalty. Kind of wrote a lot but I kept looking for counter-examples and didn't find any. Loyalty doesn't track or change a companion's feelings, it's Joon's speech actions. Hope folks kick it around and figure out if I've missed evidence either way and that you all join me in shipping the most pure romance in the series, Amaryllimechamber.

*** re-editing basically the whole comment.

A few counter-examples just off the top of my head.

- Fenn's loyalty leap under unicorn blood. It makes no sense for Joon to raise loyalty under unicorn blood, and then not remember it at all. It makes perfect sense in the original model, though, that Fenn became more loyal as she got to see raw unfiltered Joon and liked what she saw.

- Amaryllis' bump at Auman's (ch 32) is a perfect counter-example to your theory. According to your theory, the bump must've happened before, or right at the very start of the assault. Then, there was no speech action because wards, duh.

- Grak's initial jump came to be after Joon simply pitched a smart idea. More importantly the second jump happened not when Joon commited to being totally honest with Grak, but only after Grak had a few moments to process it.

- Juniper never receives a Loyalty increase when he can't see the companion. Works both ways. Reading Fenn's letter did not produce a bump, although she really opened up. Oh, and by the way, the subsequent jump absolutely did happen without any words.

So, yeah. Not so strong.

In both stories, the protagonist decides to kill their companions not due to cliched outside forces, but due to twisted versions of internal value change. It's way better (and more convincing) than the usual case of someone being mind-controlled and then fighting it off with willpower or the power of love it whatever. They even fix it in the same way-- by making choices that appeal to their new values but revert them to their old values.

It's a very real possibility she was /created/ to be with Juniper. In fact I suspect the first princess that was created was the girl Juniper saw at the start of the story that he got the cowardice debuff for not even trying to save. After she was killed by zombies it probably rolled up princess number two, Amaryllis. She may have not existed at all until that instant. Being a smart girl Amaryllis has already figured out that there is a possibility she was created to be with Juniper, and even openly commented on it when they were in the time chamber.

Given this possibility, and now the messages from future-alternate-timeline Amy who became the best Queen ever but still wasn't happy because she pined for her missing one true love her entire life, it's clear she needs to be more aggressive to win the Juniper-bowl. There can be only one.

Let's say that you wanted the player to meet an important princess from Anglecynn, the recent victim of something sort of like a coup and the main driver of the plot. What I would do is place her down right next to the player at the very start of the game, surrounded by zombies and yelling for help. If this whole thing was like a tabletop game, then a clever GM could have planned for me to see that first girl, and for that girl to have been Amaryllis. After I had ran away instead of helping her, I'd been slapped with a penalty, and since I never knew a single thing about her, a different girl could have become Amaryllis instead, with the whole universe rewriting itself around that change. Come to think of it, I had been slapped with the second cowardice penalty after not running to help a different girl, and it was entirely possible that if I had raced after her and fought her attackers she would have, in time, revealed herself to be Amaryllis Penndraig. And actually, Amaryllis had given me a fake name when we'd first met, so if she'd died, or I had decided not to go back to her, there was still a chance for a rewrite up until the point where I returned with Poul and he recognized her.]]

Objection. There's no reason that Joon can't get the harem ending, other than Juniper himself.

Your ancestors and relatives poisoned you. You were always too cautious and to manipulative. That was not your fault. Your fault lies in not recognizing that poison and working to excise it. Juniper can help you with that if you let him. I won't suggest that you need to love him or reverse what you have done to your soul, but it would help, if and when he's over Fenn.

You love him. It's a deep love. Maybe you induced it in yourself as an ill-conceived experiment in manipulating him, or maybe it was the divine will of the Dungeon Master, but that doesn't substantially change the math. Your love for him is a core part of you, immutable by any technology or magic we have. It will poison any other relationship you have; I speak from experience.

** Joons theories about how the library work are too complicated.

Because they miss something important - The price of the computing resources the dungeon master is using, are approximately, nil in baseline reality.

The library almost certainly /does/ just run a sim of the entire setup until book production stops, every time the library is reset.

Why do I say this? Because everything about Aerb has the feel of an obsessive hobbyist being handed simulation tools of extreme power and just going berserk.

The world he is in is not the result of a corporate, government, or other collective effort. It is too ad-hock, derivative (from Joons campaigns) and focused on Joon for that.

Parts of the tools which underlay it have the right feel for a bigger, organized effort - The safety mechanism that punted him from the meme, for example? That entire bit reads like an error report from a conventional development project. So does the intelligence overflow.

But the world? That is one person - the dungeon master - who is, effectively, playing the sims 4264.3, and ripping out all the books written from a simulation run, then reverting it? Ten lines of script code. Faking said simulation run? Major code project, if it is even possible at all, and it is not likely to be a standard package in the tools the dungeon master has.

** Absolutely stellar chapters, this is probably my favorite batch of updates so far. Here's my spontaneous thoughts on them.

I felt so sick during chapter 133 that I had to stop reading and check the comment section of this thread to reassure myself. The Cypress "letters" were incredible. Everything about the library is awe-inspiring and I wish we'd spent more time there, since the bridges seem to have been pretty much disintegrated at this point in time. When the chapter ended with a "Level Up" message, I had a huge "oooh shiiiiiit" moment. In the following chapter, it's incredible just how much I was rooting for the protagonist to lose the fight, while dreading that he might win. Unicorn magic seems to be the way to go in order to unlock some of the worst achievements- basically the equivalent to save-scum to unlock a bad ending for personal curiosity. The moment where Raven opened the book with the fractal was wonderful and I felt so much relief. I feel so bad for her by the way and hope that she'll find some way to relieve herself of her inevitable guilt over betraying her comrades. She's such a relatable character and I find myself rooting for her as she has this sort of underdog vibe to her, despite how powerful she clearly is. I loved Joon's reflections on Raven being Maddie's hopeful projection of a better version of herself. I crave world-building, especially when it comes to the grittier sides of Aerb such as exclusion zones and existential threats, which is another reason why I enjoyed these chapters so much.

So yeah, thanks for the update and I can't wait for the next one!

Evidence :

Amy's rejection by Juniper turns into this huge, sad, unerasible pining because she doesn't get over it normally. She hasn't known Joon for that long, there's no reason for hundreds of years to not let her get over it.

Juniper's level up turns into an all consuming drive which produces a creature too shortsighted to think of the future because he doesn't integrate the (non soul level) addiction of level up normally into the rest of his mind.

If he didn't tamper with his soul he might still be a level up maximizer, but a long sighted one.

For a comparison, Normal!Joon wants to bring back Fenn. Can you imagine Normal!Joon having the ability to bring back Fenn, but first he has to convince someone that he doesn't want to bring her back, so his solution is to eradicate all desire to resurrect Fenn? Heck no. He would look for any literally any other way to trick or circumvent that person, because it's something he values very highly. He wouldn't just trust in game theory with Future!Joon to keep to the bargain. He knows first-hand how different Current!Joon is to Future!Joon, and knows he can't trust Future!Joon to act in Current!Joon's best interest.

Remember that at no point during the Fallatehr arc did Joon consider "maybe I should be fine with him completely adjusting everything I care about" as a viable option, because nobody would ever do that.

--------------

LevelUp!Joon had options. He could try to lie, which most people will do before adjusting their utility function (plus soul magic into SOC). He could try to do a measured adjustment. Eg, set 'level-ups' to 1/2 or 1/4 or some other fraction of their current values, and try to convince Raven from there. (Though this may lead to a Ghandi murder-pill situation with the same result.)

Or he could have put a trap in his utility function, similar to what Fallatehr did. He could push his "desire to use soul magic to perform daily maintenance on my utility function" lever all the way into anathema territory, then erase the memory of doing so. This would make Normal!Joon unwilling to do daily soul maintenance, and give a chance for LevelUp!Joon to slowly retake control later.

Instead he just gives up, throws his hat on game theory, and drops a nuke on his utility function.

He wasn't exactly thinking straight, so it wouldn't have taken much of a nudge for him to accept it either. Possibly "justified" by some form of saving throw.

This comes after it seems to me the DM put his finger on the scales to cause all this in the first place: the Spirit Magic quest was only added /after/ Raven pointed out that it could work as a solution to the level up problem, presumably for the precise purpose of giving the DM an excuse to cause a level up before he could make use of it to fix the problem. What other quests has he been given whose sole quest step involved reading a single book? (Sure, he had to go into the Infinite Library and learn Library Magic to do this, but he was already going to do that, so why would he need a /quest/ for it?)

Why would the DM do this? Well, the DM seems to love fucking with Joon so maybe the payoff for it was simply the horror Joon experienced after returning to normal and realising what he'd done.

**** Bump up how much you value "Clandestination" or something. Joon was found out because he was manic and under self-imposed time pressure. If he rose how much he valued not being found out, and maybe burn some points to dump into CHR, then he could pretend to not care about it so much.

** I have to agree with the others that the ending of the LevelUp!Joon arc has been rushed.

One, LevelUp!Joon gives up on his very identity in a way that's extremely casual. It would be like if Amaryllis had gone "Well, if I don't struggle I'm less likely to get killed, so I better let Fallatehr capture me again".

Two, the way Raven just takes him at his word from then on is incredibly weird. For all she knows, "Watermelon" could have been the beginning of a deadly infohazard that would have freed him and killed everyone in the room. She shouldn't even have talked to him before Amaryllis got a chance to look him over.

Three... well, it was kind of supremely irresponsible of Raven to bring Joon in knowing he could very well snap and go on a rampage at any moment, without giving her colleagues any advance warning, having him disarm, or keeping him under escort. They're pretty lucky Joon was in junkie mode and didn't, say, slit Raven's throat by surprise.

Four, breaking Joon out and hurting / killing additional librarians in the process is... I mean, it's pretty cold. It's murderhobo problem-solving, where you take a complicated problem and just use overwhelming amounts of violence to solve it, and don't worry about the collateral damages, burnt bridges and future retributions. And these people have worked for Raven for /centuries/. That's even colder than what we've seen Amaryllis do.

I think there is a trade-off where an Author trades their motivation and time for speed, planning, character development, and other qualities in the writing. The rationalist community demands a lot, and you end up with writing that's only appealing to a small audience (hopefully the community grows). In particular I imagine the revising the plot involves very heavy rewriting time, but I'm not a writer so I'm not sure.

With girlfriends, my approach is to find one who's had a terrible boyfriend. Now I can easily exceed expectations :p If I was cthulhuraejepsen, I would do the same - a few lower standard chapters, so that he can enjoy exceeding them :p

** That's...really bad characterization for different value systems character.

Imagine you were a cannibal. You fuckin love skin. You crave the flesh. Everyone else in the world hates you for it. There is nearly no context where you would not only stop wanting to eat people, but /stop wanting to want to eat people/, especially not after a token "oh people don't like me eating people, better stop and then hope i want to eat people again when it's safer" self-argument. Level Up is such a high value event for Joon that it's probably akin to you convincing yourself to stop valuing breathing so much.

That's not how transitioning a value function works - they're /internally consistent and metastable/ at every point. Transitioning only happens if you also currently value having the new value function, just like how you don't spontaneously become a cannibal by imagining how much you'd love being a canninal if you were a cannibal.

The entire last chapter feels like a massive cop out, honestly. Not only does Evil Joon commit identity death, but Raven /accepts Joon telling her he's OK now/. He just tried to kill her minutes ago, and she knows how much he values Levelling Up. There's no reason she should listen to what he has to say, other than belief that anti-infohazard protocols leading to braindeath is worse than him murderhoboing. She knows he's an expert Soul mage, too, and so would have a host of way to backdoor faking going back to "normal". She not only frees him without anyone being able to double-check his soul, but betrays all her fellow librarians to do it.

Consider: Amy+Joon told Raven that there was a high chance of him going rogue in the library if Amy was not there with him. Dooming Aerb in the process. Amy+Raven - onscreen - just shrugged that off. This is inconsistent with both their characters.

So the inference is that they had a nice chat offscreen, Amy+Raven talk about worst case scenarios, Amy says "hes really strong. He can do this that and that." Raven goes: "I have thirty years with Uther under my belt. I can absolutely 100% take Joon right now, even if he were 5 times stronger than he is now. " - as that was what happened.

**** It's not actually true, since people do contradictory or self-sabotoging things all the time. But it's generally true, in that 1) you will never spontaneously decide to go commit a murder for no reason, because it's contradictory to your own self-interests even if it's rational in the context of a different value function 2) you won't spontaneously transition out of your local maxima of being pretty happy not killing people to the non-local maxima being /very/ happy killing people.

Agents can be preoccupied with a goal, yes, but they'll still value everything else they value, even if they aren't considering the consequences of their actions or knock-on effects that would hurt those values.

Joon by definition is editing his own value function. If that's not a transition, I'm not sure what is.

** I just binged on this over the last week and wanted to drop some constructive criticism.

First off - I overall really like the story. The best part of it is probably the setting. I wasn't sold on it in the beginning, but it has really grown on me. There are also some brilliant parts of writing (the entire soul magic / mind control plot and to a lesser degree the episode with the illusion magic). You have a knack for pulling off plots that keep the reader guessing. You also have a knack for dialog. It works really well and it's engaging.

On the negative side, I have two main complaints - Juniper as a character hasn't really grown at all. If anything, I feel like after 134 chapters in he's almost become a flanderization of his initial character. It's very frustrating to watch because it seems like the effort goes into other characters, such at this point I'm considering that Amaryllis is either the deuteragonist or just a minor perspective switch away from being the actual protagonist of the story.

The other thing that really bugs me is the difference between the adventure scenes and the overall plot. Generally speaking, each individual adventure arc is pretty good with a lot of rising action and a payoff of some sort at the end (even if it leads directly to another arc). In that way, it's really written so that it feels like a RPG campaign. However, the overarching plot of the story is frankly, meandering. I get that as of recent events we are supposed to feel rising tension due to all of these horrible things that are on the march, but the problem with that is you just told us about it instead of showing us. It really undercuts any sense of rising action in the overall story.

I have some other minor nitpicks, like I don't think Juniper is written with a sense that he has an idealized self. Contrast that with Amaryliss and it's easy to see how he comes up short in that regard. I could flat out tell you what her idea of a perfect Amaryliss is. I also thought killing Fenn right after the breakup was too on the nose and probably the least interesting option (and it appears that we're supposed to forget about it pretty quickly because Juniper seems to be...) Valencia is kind of a Mary Sue type character, but I thought Solace had that spot filled with her "bullshit" magic??

I dunno. Maybe this sounds harsh, it's not intended to be. I feel like too many people just go "good jerb". I tried to take some time to think about the story and the characters and this is what I came up with. That's not to say I didn't like it (I do), but yeah, there are some parts that I think are well within your capabilities to do a lot better.

If he actually waits all that time till the end of the game, by the end, his experiences might shape him into a type of person with different priorities.

As for Queen Amaryllis, well, I can really see why she'd eventually cease that daily ritual. It was always rewriting her own soul to get rid of feelings that were causing problems, always denying an aspect of herself. And one day, knowing that it will no longer cause friction, she finally lets herself feel it. Feeling your own genuine feelings would feel liberating, I'd think. It might make his absence hurt more, but she can make peace with herself, and she's tough enough to take it and keep going.

I don't think soul-magic-modified feelings would register differently from the "real ones" internally. It's possible that there's some subtle effect, but we don't have evidence in favour of it, and plenty for the contrary: Fallatehr apparently happily functioned for centuries after deleting his fear, Grak has found Fallatehr's alteration /preferable/ to his default state, Juniper's current "genuine" personality is that of a level-up maximizer we saw in the last two chapters, and so on. I don't think Amaryllis undid it because her unaltered state feels more... eudaemonic.

I suspect one of these alternatives:

- An experiment to see whether she would "get over it" (and, naturally, report her findings to primary!Amaryllis).

- An attempt to catch the DM or the narrative's attention, bring them into a timeline clearly devoid of their influence.

- An attempt to resolve Juniper x Amaryllis plot arc, or at least this particular plot point.

- Some kind of soul magic research project.

(Knowing Amaryllis, probably all of these.)
