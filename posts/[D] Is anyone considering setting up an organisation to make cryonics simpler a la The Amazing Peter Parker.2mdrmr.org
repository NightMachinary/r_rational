If I wasn't planning (currently at uni) to research gerontology and try to find life extension treatments, this would be pretty high up on my To Do list.


** If I knew there was a significant market I might.

Picking a number completely out of thin air, would you pay $1,000 USD to have someone make cryonics trivial for you?

*** It is actually fairly trivial. It's like doing your taxes. Sounds intimidating, but after you do them the first time you realize it's not a big deal. Getting paid $1000 to do that level of work for someone else would be an /amazing/ deal. Enough so that I'd feel bad taking the money.

** Have you considered setting up an organization to make cryonics /work/, with rigorous trials and all that? And I don't mean "probabilistically work", where an ideal Bayesian assigns a nontrivial, much-larger-than-Solomonoff-prior objective-informational probability to the concept that the partial animal trials done so far imply a human /could/ be reanimated or, God help him/her, brain-uploaded, provided the assistance of a Friendly superintelligence...

I just mean rigorous trials showing that after killing a bunch of rats and putting them through the cryonics treatment, successful resuscitations can actually be performed.

*** Full body cryopreservation that would even hypothetically allow full resuscitation is really rare, really expensive, and mostly just impractical. Most cryopreservation is just done on the head, with the eventual goal of copying the brain structure into a new brain, or uploading it.

Frankly, I think even if you /do/ go whole-body preservation, you're prolly gonna get good brain scanning tech before you get the kinda full-body-reconstruction tech that it'd take to undo all the damage anyway

******* /shrug/ That's a problem no matter which way you cut it. Anybody with the knowhow to undo all the damage from long-term cryopreservation (not to mention the damage from whatever ended your life in the first place, since the barbaric laws we have in place right now require you to be dead before you can be preserved) is gonna have the knowledge to mess around with yer brainmeats in whatever way they like.

In the end, you just gotta trust that the people doing this honestly care about preserving /people,/ that they'd value your honest point of view and personality, and that they'll pull through on all their agreements as best they can.

********* I don't think you need to be hyperbenevolent to want to save someone from death and to keep them whole and intact. Not being a psychopath is pretty much all you need. The trust fund that a cryo patient sets up to pay for their maintenance and eventual retrieval is hopefully enough to provide incentive for the business side of things, anyway. Just gotta wait til the tech is cheap enough that they can profit off of it. Maybe a little sooner than that if they /do/ just happen to be 'hyper' benevolent :P

It's true, the chances at cryo working at all are fuzzy at best, and probably not all that good. But it beats the pants off being dead for sure. And right now, I think it's the best that's out there. If something better pops up, if a new place comes by with a better business plan, by all means switch. But for now, a place like alcor or the cryonics institute is the best you're gonna get if you suffer a heart attack or a car crash or otherwise just up and stop living for whatever reason.

Anyway, it sounds like you're looking for something more along the lines of suspended animation rather than cryo. I haven't heard of anything like that, sadly. Even if the tech was available, I fear the politics of it would be untenable, and there'd be no reputable places to get yourself preserved. And the politics are prolly gonna be a tougher thing to fix than the tech, anyway.

No. It /is/ being dead. Reality doesn't roll a die to determine if it works or not, it either works or not when you're "preserved". Your subjective probability does not correspond to a real randomness in the world.

Why am I hearing a passive attitude like this from anyone in this community? If there's a problem: "you found it, you fix it."

(And yes, there is an actual reason /I'm/ not fixing this problem, which is that I have most of my professional training in computer science, biased towards the theoretical side, and none at all in medical biology, mortuary biology, or neuroscience. I've got /other things to do./)

*********** If they've got the tech to pick your brain that casually, then they've got the tech to revive you. With any hope at all, you'd get brought back well before /that/ kind of thing became a problem.

Here's what I mean about it being chancy: We've got tons of ways of preserving structure that /look/ good. But we don't know enough about neurology yet to really know for sure whether they /are/ good, whether they do preserve the structure of the brain enough or not. Further, we don't really know what the tech to read the brain is gonna look like. It could be that the chemicals used in modern vitrification processes completely make brain scanning impossible for one reason or another.

And we /won't/ know these things until the research advances, until the brain scanning tech starts to come out on at least a theoretical level. Until that point, you really are taking a chance at preserving the structure as best you can and hoping that's enough. But like I said, it's /the best chance you have./

And I think there's nothing passive about encouraging people to shop around, to always demand the best service and the best technology. /Very very few/ people have the capability to impact the field directly, so being an /active consumer/ of the field is the best you can do there. Well, and petitioning governments and helping with advertising, donating money to research institutes, and so on, but all that goes without saying.

I don't think they'd really try much unless you immediately won the lottery or something. You're probably not gonna have many assets to your name after being dead for (presumably) at least a medium-amount of time. Not to mention how different economics is prolly gonna be by that point.

If you live in the US, contact Rudi Hoffman (a life insurance agent operating out of Florida) and he'll do all the work for you, except sign your signature.

I think the main focus for Crionics right now ought to be marketing. In my experience, so few people know about Crionics and the rest think it's science fiction.
