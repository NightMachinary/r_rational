In the (translated-from-)Chinese novel 'So what if you've been reborn?', there is a Timeline A, and a Timeline B, and a whole lot of people reborn in Timeline B with memories of Timeline A, who affect the protagonist who has /not/ been reborn.

Actually, my context is out of order. In a lot of stories (Peggy Sue type), a protagonist is reborn to an earlier age, then uses their knowledge of the future to change how the future develops (in fun-to-read ways). Once that became semi-mainstream, there started to be a lot of other stories in which there's a pseudo-protagonist who has been reborn, and the actual protagonist is also reborn/transmigrated and clashes with them in some way. These are often also fun (for me), but often the pseudo-protagonist is written as a boring villain, rather than being protagonist-like.

A certain daydream led me to an imagined setting, and I immediately became intensely curious as to whether there was any similar story.

Protagonist lives their first life normally, dies a tragic death, and is reborn in their /third/ life. They plan to change how the future develops (maybe involving taking revenge), but are shocked when a vengeful person unexpectedly causes them to die tragically. They are then reborn in their /fifth/ life, but with memories of their first life, third life, and this time their second life--a life in which they were reborn, changed the direction of the future, and as one of the consequences the third-life-vengeful-person died tragically, reborn in the protagonist's third life (the vengeful person's second life) wanting to take revenge.

This then recurs (social interactions in various forms, though) at least a few times. Probably the reader-focus would be on the odd-numbered lives, but each time the protagonist cannot tell whether they are in an even-numbered life (and so have the initiative) or whether the reborn-person with the initiative is keeping a low profile until they take action later. (Hmm, Primer also comes to mind.) The protagonist, expecting to make the same (initial) choices in a paired even and odd life, has to plan out their choices and the possible consequences to them with the expectation that this may influence the experiences and motivations of a secret reborn-person in the same life.

Is there any story similar to this already in existence? <would very much like to read it if so>

(Rational-fiction-possible-relevance hopefully in regards to how the protagonist would have to seriously think through the possible consequences of their actions, plus take into account and get used to how initial resolutions can change over time when living a lifetime in a world where you have the initiative and can effectively impose your will on the world for decades on end.)

(Edit: Thinking more about things I've read similar to this, a Terminator fiction involving summoning time-travellers from the future by planning out what to do in that future comes to mind.)

Second edit: I'm mainly replying to comments with a question or for which I have a question, but I am very grateful for all the thoughts expressed and particularly the suggestions! Thank you all very much!

** [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]] is basically exactly like this. It's an MLP fic where the premise is that there are multiple loopers, and the only person who recalls a loop is the first looper who dies in that loop. This means that most loopers forget most of their loops.

Problems: It's a re-imagined version of another (decent) fic, it's dead, and it's incomplete.

I'm imagining someone bending over backwards to avoid known previous rebirthers from being dragged in, and ending up destroying someone else's life instead... and trying to work out how from what-I-would-have-done and who's-trying-to-kill-me-this-time (and if/when unsuccessful, what-I-remember-doing and who-killed-me-that-time)...

Heh-heh, and there's always the uncertainty of 'Am I in an even life and at risk of screwing up my next odd life, am I in an odd life and just haven't been attacked yet, or am I in an odd life and I finally got my last even life 'acceptably victimless' this time?'.

*** (Thank you very much for this. It sidesteps the 'what actions to choose to handle someone who already knows what actions you would choose' thing I was curious about, but this appealed to my tastes greatly.)

Separate thoughts about it:

I very much liked the 'era you live in as though a place that you live' symbolism/structure (though that may be my own viewing-frame), as though people in the same place and nearby eras were nearby neighbours. Similarly, I enjoyed the time-war approach.

Something which bothered me the most was 'How are new kalachakras born?'. Presumably there had been a Harry August who lived and died as a linear for many lifetimes of Virginia's, unless his birth itself was a result of a near-permanent change to the timeline. Because of forgetting, that would have to have been from an mnemonic underpinning the timeline by making the same change each time, because aside from the mnemonics everything 'relaxes' back into shape as information isn't consistently passed on forever... and if linears never became kalachakra, then (mnemonic underpinning aside) you'd expect kalachakra to eventually all be wiped out except for the first few, as the timeline wipes out the most-likely-to-be-born kalachakra as it thrashes around a bit. Then again, I may have misinterpreted something never directly talked about--maybe the never-conceived can either have their next life or else start a new one, and it's only the killed-after-conception-and-before-birth which can't (in which case what's the critical moment of development? But more to the point, people recovering from never being conceived wasn't dealt with--or rather, for the first (second?) cataclysm, it was suggested that the effects were permanent even for the never-conceived.

It's been fun for me to consider this from a an immortality-seeking perspective. A mnemonic alone has effective immortality (save when never born). For a mnemonic the question becomes 'Where next?', but it's arguably fine if they still have a lot to enjoy experiencing in their lifetimes for the moment. For humanity and the kalachakras as a whole, mnemonics aside, the situation is clearer: the kalachakras live, the kalachakras forget. The world ends, the linears die out. The question then for EVERYONE is 'Where next?'. Stagnation of a sort, staticness--death. For the linears, everyone dies and everyone forgets through dying. For the kalachakras, they just forget instead of dying. The impulse next is "Okay, how do we not die? How do we not forget? How do we push humanity's future further--spawning more kalachakras besides--or/and how do we get actual immortality, for us and the linears, and extend humanity's future and learning/existence that way? Do we have the option of developing technology that we can invisibly extend earlier and earlier through history, setting up an infrastructure which lets people live their lives as normal throughout history, still birthing the kalachakra origins, but whisks them away to the rest of the hidden technologically-advanced universe once they would have died? (Kalachakras accidentally dying in the future having the option of 'leaving early' at any time?)".

With this perspective, Harry's reversal is straightforwardly confusing. By the end he's destroying the quantum mirror for revenge, but then why did he do his reversal in the first place? 'This is rot, this is stagnant, the tree is dead, let's take an axe to it for the sake of the quantum mirror, which is the ONLY WAY OUT because even the kalachakras in the furthest future of humanity with all their technology have failed'--and for that matter, why hasn't humanity and/or its kalachakras at the furthest future made a quantum mirror?--and yet, after knowingly being responsible for the cataclysm-equivalent effects on the future kalachakras (all those deaths), the reversal in response to the deaths of present and past kalachakras seems perverse.

Hmm, a last thought for now: as it takes one 'life' to pass a message backwards one lifetime, and it's been noted how long it takes to wait (several lives) for replies from the future, how many lives has Vincent been making small changes for before meeting Harry and talking about the quantum mirror and Harry learning about the end of humanity getting sooner in Harry's eleventh life? Or, maybe worse, how few lifetimes are there between Harry's life and the end of humanity? --Ah, though amusingly silly if it turns out that 'the end of the world' is because humanity ends through a happy Singularity, and that the happy Singularity was just getting sooner and sooner. Implausible and presumably not what was intended, granted.

  Its entirely possible the quantum mirror is useless. IIRC all it does is tell you about things, and its entirely possible that there is no way at all to escape the loop no matter what it says.

  After all, the answers of "Its an unchangeable natural phenomenon", "Aliens in the past did it (and we got the side effects, so only some humans loop), and will fix the tech when they spawn every loops so we can't change it" and "the AI that comes after us used supertech far beyond us to do it so that it can loop forever and escapes even the heat death of the universe" are all the same in that there is no way meaningful way to deal with them.

***** Indeed, that's like not-dying itself, or anything else where one path has only darkness and the other path has only darkness with a /tiny/ sliver of subjective light which might just be a train.

To put it in Lord of the Ring terms: "It's entirely possible that Sauron has stationed 24-hour guards on and around Mount Doom. It would cost him little (remembering HPMOR-LotR). If that's the case, we'd all just be killed or die as slaves anyway. So, why not just hand over the Ring right now?"

Because even though it's entirely possible that there's no path of life, what if there */is?/* Then by giving up on it, you're digging (or sealing up) the grave yourself for everyone who could have taken it. The point of finding out is that we don't know which is the case before we get that new information, and that new information makes all the difference.

​

--Or to put it in a somewhat more morbid way, if lots of people die in finding out that no one's lives (/futures of being annihilated through total memory loss) can be saved, /that would have happened to them sooner or later anyway/. Though I prefer the defensibility(?) of the above phrasing.

*** (I have read it, and am put in mind in turn of another story which I cannot remember the name of: a certain advanced civilisation has long-term goals in conflict with humanity, and typically makes plans through high-resolution simulations of the other civilisations it interacts with. Humanity secretly develops a way to detect whether members are in a simulation or not, and gets lots of people ready to start behaving unpredictably as soon as they find their reality has 'changed' to simulation-reality. The advanced civilisation is so alarmed by their inability to make reliable or even consistent simulations with humans in them that they all-but-wipe-out humanity in a single onslaught. The main content of the story is set a long time later, and was far less interesting to me than the food-for-thought premise.)

**** I mean, I wasn't necessarily thinking of any one thing in particular. If we're talking reincarnation, perhaps into not information from the future. Maybe each successive life began when the previous one ended, so you have the same X number of reincarnating beings interacting with each other across multiple lifetimes. Time is still moving forward, but not all lives remember all past lives so you get the same kind of information imbalance as originally described.

Or maybe you have an HPMOR kind of situation where, if I remember correctly, all changes to the timeline are already accounted for so that you end up with a single stable timeline where the actions of all "future" selves are already accounted for but just not within your knowable frame of knowledge.

Or it could be like a dream that I had once, where you had to observe a specific event in order to maintain the loop, but you had to do so in such a way that you did not draw the attention of any previous instance of yourself or the loop would collapse, so there is a semi-hard limit based on observational ability, stealth, and creativity of how many times you can loop before it collapses.

Point is, there are plenty of interesting ways to explore this kind of concept. I'm not a good enough author to do it myself but I would love to read it if someone else is.

***** Ahh.

Reincarnation without time-reversal: familiar, like in Hand x Red where one person is briefly free to act in separated time periods while another waits for him each time, or Tsukihime where the reincarnated person makes a huge fuss each time just so that he can see the unaging person he's in love with who comes to kill him each time, or Please Save My Earth where the reincarnated don't necessarily remember their past lives at first, then have to come to terms with what horrible people they previously were.

HPMOR: thus the restriction which sets in. Still, it's a good point that this comes close to what I was imagining--a situation where there are changes from the future of the timeline, in reaction to(/taking into account) your own future actions which you don't remember (yet). Simplifying/Distilling further, the question 'How can you try to win against/fight/stop a Peggy-Sue instead of winning as a Peggy-Sue?'.

Dream: Intriguing. My second thought is "Could you set up a broadcast system, so that different instances could observe it (password-protected) through their smartphones without influencing each other, rather than having to all cram into the same physical area for the observation?". My first thought is "Who's left (and with what memories) after the loop collapses?". (Perhaps a loop collapsing would just leave all the instances in the world, unable to go back in time, no longer connected?)

Now I'm remembering the game Achron, where time-waves propagate changes, and if you can't set up a stable time loop (units which go back in time getting to their going-back-in-time locations by the same time with the same amount of health) you can flip back and forth between the two outcomes. Units hiding at Point A at time A without attacking the enemy, at time B going back in time to time A and attacking the enemy with the past versions for double the firepower, and if the time-travelled versions are destroyed then the enemy is defeated and the untravelled versions can go back in time as scheduled (following preserved orders), but if untravelled versions are destroyed then on the next timewave-pass the assault will be carried out without the future-versions of those units and the enemy might not be defeated... or the clearer example of something going back in time and destroying the building which created it before its creation, which-one-is-there-in-the-end flipping back and forth over and over...)
