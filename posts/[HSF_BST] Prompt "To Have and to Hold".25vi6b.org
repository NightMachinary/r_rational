** Well it sounds awesome at first, but imagine what kind of story this premise would produce. Ultimately, it boils down to aliens doing SETI with a time limit, which is quite a bit more generic than I think the underlying science deserves.

** Thanks for those articles. I was ignoring the "quantum twist" one because of it's sensationalist title, but that doesn't seem to be a very good metric.

The story idea is very interesting. I doubt very much that eternal inflation violates conservation of mass-energy.

I think that's the interesting question here. We /know/ mass-energy is conserved, but we also /know/ that the Universe had a beginning. Nowadays, more sophisticated theories tell us there are other universes, including various other universes that could be born from our universe in some fashion (inflation universes).

Ok, so if our universe was born in some low-entropy state with lots and lots of mass-energy in it, but the underlying physics tells us we /should/ see an infinite and eternal multiverse, how do we reconcile that? Finite and entropic does not equal infinite and eternal!

So where's the stuff physics is promising us, eh? And how did our tiny finite, entropic piece of the larger infinite, eternal universe /form/?
