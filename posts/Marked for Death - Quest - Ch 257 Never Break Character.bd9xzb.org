** Honestly, this is what MfD is really about. One of the best chapters written imho.

An abridged history for returning readers.. (Up to 2019-01-13 - so spoilers folks)

*** Some of the stuff in the summary is not definitely entirely accurate. I am specifically thinking of the second to last line.

"Tsunade popped her. Akane's funeral is scheduled for next week."

What actually happened is that Tsunade /threatened/ to kill her (and is someone whose threats get taken very seriously /and/ who is powerful enough to get away with murder) /if/ Akane decides to actually use her own methods to interfere with Tsunade's way of healing Mari's mental health. Akane's ideas are pretty good looking to us the players but Tsunade, most accomplished medic him of the known world, doesn't let other people interfere on principle. Akane proceeded to do what she said she would, fully expecting to die for it. Tsunade witnessed that. The chapter ended there and we haven't gone back to that part of the story to see how it continued.

*** I dropped it when they made it into the leaf village safely and the sensei married jiryaia. It just felt like they werent marked for death anymore and they won the game. I wish they created their own village instead of the cliche of being integrated i to the leaf. I also didn't like it how the MC was trying to get a harem with ino and her girl teammate and was actually rationalizing it. Did it stayed interesing after these events or are the characters playing world police?

**** Interesting is subjective, so you'd have to make your own decision on that. The characters are attempting to prevent World War Four and promote peace, but they are not doing anything I would consider policing. It's mainly impassioned speeches, hosting games nights, and setting up a merchant empire.

** I love that the only dice roles had us lose so hard we took physical damage in a social encounter, but it didn't matter. Zabauza's only winning move was not to play, and he fell for it hook line and sinker.
