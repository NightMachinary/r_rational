  “Fuck that,” Omoi said, from his place at the side of the arena. “I've got to survive this motherfucker tryin' to break my neck, just so I can fight one of those other motherfuckers, gonna crush me up or something, man. Fuck this genin shit. Shit's dangerous. I yield.”
#+end_quote

Judging by the rapidly escalating horror in this setting, I was actually quite surprised that this quote just made me break down laughing.

** That one cloud ninja (Omoi or something) who just conceded is probably the smartest person in this story.

I really like how you juxtapose widely different moods in the story. Some parts are really hilarious and some parts are really fucked up yet they all fit and I don't feel any dissonance.

Keep up the good work, can't wait to read more!

** Man, somehow knowing Lee is going to have to find out Gai isn't his dad hurts more than reading about him getting his arm destroyed. I dunno if you're taking deliberate inspiration from Gurren Lagann in writing his lines, but they're great nonetheless.

Also seems kind of weird that the crowd is looking on in horrified silence at Lee reacting to clone!Gai's proclamation when they were roaring with savage exhilaration at Neji being pulped. More values dissonance I suppose, but I'm not sure I'm understanding exactly what they're being horrified by here.

****** Yes. It was the best chance she had to get rid of the threat he represented. And raise her status among her clan. And she still doesn't have to admit to doing that on purpose. She didn't see him yield and she could say she didn't know the shields could do that. I didn't.

******* u/derefr:

  and raise her status among her clan
#+end_quote

Somehow, I really doubt she did that. Rather, she /lowered/ her (ex-)clan's status within the village, by first dissociating herself from them publicly, then insulting their style and avoiding using any of her in-clan advantages like the eye technique, and then demonstrating that their techniques are utterly dominated (at least in this situation) by easily-learned, not-too-costly, genin-level techniques.

She's aiming for getting on the village's good side against the Hyuuga, somewhat like Itachi. In fact, to be more specific, she is demonstrating that a "Hyuuga massacre" would not be an implausible feat, given that most of them don't bother to learn anything other than the Gentle Fist---and the implications this has for the Hyuuga's inter-clan bargaining position will do more to remove their influence from Konoha's politics than anything I've seen done in any other fic (e.g. assassinating Hiashi.)

******** The problem with that is that the Hyuuga - as pointed out already - have all the dirt. And unless they are utter morons, will have some sort of dead-man switch set to spill it in the event of attack. Actually, no, it's worse - you can't organize an attack on their compound, because /the entire village/ is inside their aegis, so organizing it would inevitably be spotted.

The only plausible reason they don't rule the village is that they don't care to. - Their info gathering abilities are insane.

I think what she is actually aiming for is to establish she won't come quietly, and that bringing her in against her will is likely to involve casualties. - Because she, in her own person, and her team as a group team is every bit as ambush proof as the Hyuuga compound. Especially because Naruto can in fact leave his eye on permanently. (And he should.) Uhm. If Naruto wants to strengthen his team... Would getting a tailed beast as an adult increase regen? ;)

** So I guess Orochimaru is taking a much more direct and practical strategy in this rational-fic? Or is it the butterfly divergences with him no longer needing to overtly show himself that resulted in the alternate strategy?

Also, I am still wondering what was going on with Hinata's lethality. Good things this fic updates so often. Guess we will find out soon... unless you kill Hinata off.

I laughed at Naruto's Lee I am your father. It was good thinking, Lee might have kept going until he was exsanguinated otherwise (interesting, reddit's spell check does not recognize exasanguinated).

*** On Orochimaru: it was pretty clear that the plan with Sand was called off because he had already gotten the seal on Sasuke, and that was the main objective. That is also probably why sound refused to participate in the exam.

On Hinata: She was fighting for her life, and Naruto's... The only question si whether she knew Neji was yielding, or if she could guess but chose not to know, etc.

not strictly an error, but it's not really clear to whom "their" is refering (obvious with context, ofc, but i tripped on it). perhaps "begin /the/ fight", instead.
