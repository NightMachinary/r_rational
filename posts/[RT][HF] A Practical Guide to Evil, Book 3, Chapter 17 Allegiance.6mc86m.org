**** Cat can't be the Warlord, because that's an orc name and their culture was systematically dismantled.

  ‚ÄúWhen it comes to the Clans,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe have the Miezans to blame for that. They systematically dismantled every aspect of orc culture. They went as far as razing the holy grounds of the Broken Antler Horde, the largest city on Callernia at the time. Roles do not come to be in a void, Catherine. There needs to be a weight behind them, a cultural imperative. Had the Clans broken away from Praes after the Declaration we might have seen a rebirth of their old Names, but the first Dread Empress managed to keep them in the fold by the skin of her teeth.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúThat's kind of sad,‚Äù I admitted.

  ‚ÄúTheir most common Name was the Warlord,‚Äù Black murmured. ‚ÄúMostly known for their propensity to put entire villages to the torch and take back their inhabitants to the Steppes as thralls.‚Äù

Orcs have referred to Cat/Black as Warlord, though.

Also, Cat has actually copied Elizabeth Alban's tactics before, and Alban has been mentioned some times in the little quotes at the beginning of each chapter. And she did qualify for the Queen title before. I'm probably wrong, though.

*** I also think her cloak of enemy colors has been mentioned too many times to not be a part of her new name, imo. Lends credence to the idea of her not being a black knight or white knight, but something else. Maybe a rainbow knight? üòÇ

** Such an awesome chapter. Cat rocks. Such a lot of character development in such a short time. Those 2,000 nights are really going to kick Akua's butt in a few months.

I'm glad the author chose to skip showing how Laure was taken back. It would have been more of what we've already seen.

Wait, Laure was taken back? Was there a side chapter? I thought they were still in Marchford...
