*** I'm not the author, just a huge fan. But yeah, I love it. It's so rare to get a good story from the villain's perspective. And EVERYONE is genre savvy!

******** I did get confused for a minute by the "spears of shadow" similarity between the two stories. But the rest is distinct enough, though definitely a similar genre.

********* "spears of shadow" is something I picked up from RP games more than anything. Most games with a fantasy magic system have a shadow bolt or some equivalent.

********** Very true. I wasn't intending to hint towards plagiarism at all - just honestly commenting that it had confused me for a second.

By the way, did you ever give any thought towards publishing a physical book?

** (Reading through the chapters now, one by one. Just having finished Book 1 Chapter 12, I smiled a lot at that [[#s][]]. This can give me better perspective on seemingly-irrational villain behaviour in other fictions, including sympathising with perspectives I would have disagreed with, making up reasons for why a bad decision could make sense with background context, or in my own writing.)

...Hmm, a certain perspective in one of the F.E.A.R. games now feels a lot less reprehensible to me. 'Bet everything on a single sliver of hope, even if the world burns if failing'... well, it still requires incredible self-centredness.

*** Part of what I set out to accomplish with the Guide is a study of how something like a traditional "Evil" fantasy nation could come into being. There has to be cultural reasons for the like of a normal fantasy villain to come into being: people don't start wearing spiked leather and slapping skulls on everything just for the fun of it.

** Ok, it's definitely just because the "Seeking Mr. Eaten's Name" content in Fallen London recently returned, but SEEK is freaking me out and exciting me at the same time. ALL WILL BE WELL.

Also, I think I'm getting overly paranoid because I've convinced myself that Kilian is going to get firefly'ed and end up dying horribly. No reason to think that way, but just a feeling.

Honestly it seems inevitable to me too, and I'm scared.
