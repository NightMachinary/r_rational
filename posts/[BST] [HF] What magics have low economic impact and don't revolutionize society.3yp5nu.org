Whenever we introduce a form of magic into our fictional worlds, even a seemingly costly form of magic, we have to ask about the economic impact of people using that magic in the obvious way.

Is there a spell that creates a permanent Gate between two portals? OH HOLY SMOKES DISTANCE IS MEANINGLESS transport costs drop prices equalize between all areas big boosts to specialization since a single factory can sell anywhere winner-take-all markets people can live anywhere so urban density drops and empires have an easy time extending their reach lots of immigration EVERYWHERE IS CULTURALLY AND RACIALLY HOMOGENOUS within a couple of centuries...

Even if that Gate requires sacrificing a hundred virgins to create, people are going to create enough of them - the advantages are just too large and immediate and visible, and any society that refuses do it will probably be crushed underfoot, etcetera.

So the converse question is: What kinds of magic can you introduce into a setting /without/ completely upsetting everything? This depends to a significant degree on where the background falls in a Stone Age to urban fantasy setting; magic that allows for instant communication wouldn't revolutionize today's world, nor would magic that allows for expensive instant communication revolutionize a steampunk world with telegraphs, but it might be a significant thing to the Roman Empire. Let's assume the background is Standard Medievalish Fantasyland but with slight urbanization or modernization being okay, so long as the Industrial Revolution doesn't start.

My thoughts on this so far:

- Destructive magic that isn't bomb-scale and can't be used to operate a steam engine, although plausibly they just don't yet have steam engines (those were admittedly invented considerably after fire).
- Magic that can create or copy things but is very expensive (too expensive to be used as a printing press)
- Health/medical magic that doesn't work for indefinite life extension. If it works for contraception, that has large social effects and then starts having evolutionary effects in a couple of generations.

What we really ought to have is the entire rational dictionary of Magical Effects and their Economic Implications, but for now I'm just interested in arguments for which classic or novel types of magic are "relatively innocuous compared to Gate spells", and can have been in the hands of thousands of people for hundreds of years without implying an industrial or post-industrial society.


** It depends on what magic we're talking about, how expensive it is, how reliable it is, and who has access to it.

- Only one hundred people can do magic at any given time, each day they use magic they have a one in a thousand chance of death. Low impact on setting relative to effects.

- Everyone can learn magic but it's difficult enough that only nobility do, magic exhausts the user, and magic fails during certain astrological configurations. Medium impact on setting relative to effects.

- Everyone can use magic, they get better with skill but the benefits are minor, there's no real cost. High impact on setting relative to effects.

So if we had a dictionary of "Magical Effects and their Economic Implications" we would also have to include axes of difficulty. (You can't replace the horse with a spell if that spell has worse results than a horse.)

There are spells like D&D's /Ghost Sound/ that allow you to shout as loud as /four humans/, which does basically nothing when you can do it for ten minutes three times a day but can be harnessed for motive power if you can make that effect permanent.

I think you're largely looking at efficiency per dollar, but in some circumstances that can be hard to calculate, especially when magic is doing things that can't otherwise be accomplished like reading minds, erasing memories, creating demiplanes and extradimensional spaces, etc.

Edit: Take VirginGate, for example.

- If VirginGate lasts for ten seconds then shuts down, it doesn't revolutionize the world, because you can't put enough stuff through it.
- If VirginGate requires a million virgins, it doesn't revolutionize the world, because no one is going to be able to overcome the logistic costs associated with it.
- If VirginGate atomizes 90% of the things that pass through it, it probably doesn't revolutionize the world, because you're taking an automatic 90% loss on putting things like armies or trade goods through it. Though I suppose you could still keep resending letters, so it still allows for long-range communication.

*** So ,basically, impact of spell, as well as some piece of engineering IRL, depends on its cost and logistics associated.

Can't rules of thinking about mundane technology impact be applied to magic as well? Is there even a /categorical/ and not /numerical/ difference between how we should think about impact of wheel on our history and Gate on some fictional setting, for example? Yes, Gate may be faster etc, but they are both tools for enhancing mobility and bring nothing new in principle, only in (important, but still) details such as speed.

So question boils down to "What costs/limitations should be assigned to spells to avoid breaking setting down?", doesn't it?

Use the socioeconomic effects rather than the physical/magical ones. They'll probably have the same effects as if there was a purely science-based product/device which offered the same change to process.

Also, if VirginGate lasts for ten seconds /reliably/, it still has 90% of the functionality of a permanently open gate. In ten seconds, you can put a high-speed train or other timed cargo carrier through it. You can also put people in elevators and drop them through it. You can deliver most small to medium items. You can pour sand, grain, oil, water, and all sorts of other things through it, even if you leave half a second either side for testing/checking.

It becomes a matter of how much volume you can stuff through a gate, or series of gates, or set of parallel gates, per 24 hours (or per quarter) per dollar. If the cost is high, then it's going to be used sparingly - only by governments, militaries, and very wealthy people/corporations. If the cost is low but the volume is also low, it's only going to be used to transport things which are valuable for their size or would benefit from immediate transport. It would still revolutionize communication. If the cost per gate opening is high but you can put a /lot/ of volume through it before it closes, it might be used by primary industry and for long-distance bulk transport - think international airports and ports rather than domestic ones. And so on.

Your restrictions can reduce the impact of almost anything. If the cost is low and risk is low but the impact is still small that would be a more interesting answer.

**** I was thinking about this in the shower last night. For a 90% loss to be economical, transportation needs to make up more than 90% of the cost of the trade good at its destination. My mind went to the Silk Road, meaning spices and textiles, and the triangular trade across the Atlantic, meaning slaves and tobacco. I didn't remember to look it up until now, but it's really hard to find prices for things before steam power, let alone /relative/ prices for things that are quite far from each other and using different currencies.

(I believe slaves were the more valuable commodity to go across the oceans, mostly due to excess supply caused by ethnic wars. There are great numbers available about the cost of slaves at their destination, but a paucity of numbers about the cost of slaves at their source. I don't have too much trouble believing that transport costs were 90% of total cost though, but owing to fluctuating currency conversions it's tough to say, and I'd have to subtract profit margins as well, and we can't assume the portal is a perfectly frictionless mechanism for trade with none of its own costs.)

At any rate it's not clear to me which trade goods would have been worth it. That aside, /useful/ is very different than /revolutionary/. A portal that reduces the cost of transport by some fraction (even by half) would change the shape of history but not actually make a society undergo something equivalent to the Industrial Revolution.

****** Like I said, I've been looking around trying to get some actual numbers and they're hard to find. If someone would just say "In 1660 a pound of cinnamon cost the equivalent of £10 and sold in London for the equivalent of £110, with transportation making up 91% of the increased cost" then we'd know for sure, but so far I haven't found anything that goes into that much detail.

African slaves were more profitable than spices for a long period of time, but the closest that I can get is finding the price of a slave in South Carolina and comparing it against the price of a slave sold in Zanzibar (both places with relatively good record keeping). If I had a few weeks to work on it I might be able to make a chart of the difference in price, but that would mean trying to figure out the exchange rate of Maria Theresa thalers (used in Zanzibar) with the three varieties of currency used in South Carolina. My best guess is that there were a few decades where you could buy a slave for one money unit and sell a slave for ten money units, but that this was by no means constant.

And ten to one doesn't actually cover it, because a few of the sources of increased cost remain, including the cost of transporting payment or personnel over that distance, export tax, import tax, etc. Which would be more weeks of work to figure out and would depend on some of the particulars of the portal.

Anyway, that's all sort of moot because the big difference between historic trade routes and the annihilation portal is that they value different things. If you're moving goods by caravan or by sea, what you most care about is profit per pound, because it costs you £X to get 100 tonnes from Sri Lanka to London. With the portal, the thing you care most about is relative price, because it costs you price of goods in Sri Lanka times nine to get any number of tonnes from Sri Lanka to London. If a thousand tonnes of some material is £1 in Sri Lanka and £100 in London, then it's completely unprofitable to ship (the average 17th century sailing ship would gain £99 from the trip, which wouldn't be enough to cover crew/supplies/repairs) but wildly profitable to portal.

** What about something like "turn rocks into gold" as a non-trivial answer? I'd you've got a society that uses a literal gold standard, a naive reader might think this is instant wealth, etc. But my understanding is that gold's value was a combination of rarity, prettiness, malleability and, hence, desirability by true wealthy types. (Or is that a "just so" story?)

So while valuable if the spell is unknown to most people (and not overused, so that wizards are still price takers), once widely available, you'd see inflationary effects and/or a move to a different metal for money, and things wouldn't change much. Gold jewellery would become as common as plastic earrings are to us, although it would still take work to produce, houses might have more guiding (but, again, work requirements would limit it, etc.)

No doubt it's even more complicated (how many wizards are there?) but I can't see it transforming the world. Thoughts?

OK, what could you do with gold in medieval societies if it were actually cheaper than rocks.

Gold is non-tarnishing and easy to make watertight. You'd cover roofs with it. You'd cover outside walls with it. It's malleable, so it'll wear off, but it's also easy to repair.

Gold is heavy. It makes great ballast for boats. It makes great ballistic weapons - bullets, cannonballs. It's not really strong enough for arrowheads.

Gold is watertight and malleable. Gold piping would be used everywhere, canals and tanks would be lined with the stuff. Poor farmers would use it to line and cover their irrigation ditches.

You can beat gold thin enough it's transparent. Gold foil isn't all that strong, but it's durable. It would be used instead of paper for long term record keeping.

********* I think that most magics that don't have firm bounds on them can become Endbringer class by just amping them up. If you start with "turning things into gold" then the impact it has depends on the range, control, etc. A spell that you can cast three times a day to turn a touched piece of rock not greater than a cubic foot into gold is pretty minor if everyone can do it. Being able to freely turn /anything/ within line-of-sight into gold at the speed of thought destroys civilizations. Same goes if you're limited to stone but stone includes things that are in the human body. If rock includes "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralized_tissues][mineralized tissues]]" and the spell requires no line-of-sight and can be done at great range, then you could seriously injure a person.

Mostly I think it's difficult to find an effect that's not revolutionary once you start lifting some of the explicit or implicit restrictions. "Create light" is implied (or explicitly) something like torchlight, limited to line-of-sight or close by, not stackable, difficult to make images with, only in the visible spectrum, etc. But once you start lifting those, you get revolutions in dozens of different directions.

Wouldn't be /as/ powerful, but depending on specifics of how it worked, could still potentially let someone clever tell thermodynamics to go jump in a lake, among other things.

Security/espionage/etc would have to adapt to that possibility. The usual "code words"/challenge-response protocols would be risky for any higher security thing if this trick could be abused to have at least a reasonable chance of successful infiltration.

These are just some possibilities off the top of my head.

A possible countermeasure for the infiltration thing would be for the security people to do the divination themselves. Depending on how correlated the errors tend to be, you could predict a vulnerability in advance.

Depending on how quantum physics work in that universe, this is equivalent to having a guy with Coil's power sitting around that you can call to drop one of the timelines he's been keeping since you asked the AI for a bit (except that he pretty often drops the wrong timeline by accident). If splitting along arbitrary seams doesn't make the future timeline trees look different from each other, we can take our sequence of ones and zeroes and start letting things depend on them: As said above with that grainy picture line, we can fill the bits into the squares of a page of checkered paper, and squint at it from far away; a 40% error rate shouldn't make a black-and-white image unrecognizable, right? At least if we make the squares small enough. If that doesn't work (presumably because of how the errors correlate), we can refer to the next bit of the answers we received whenever we make a decision. Whenever we happen upon an important one (where the future timeline trees finally differ), we get a fraction of a bit of the world optimized. The point is, as soon as one of these schemes has a chance to work (or even before that), the AI does all it can to steer me (or others) towards following it, and exploits it to hell.

I mean, hell. Send in your trained wolves / wardogs / whatever as a rush. The opponents' social conditioning means that their human soldiers, and thus the bulk of their weapons, don't get deployed. Their daemons are smarter, yes, but they're also constrained with the distance they can wander from their humans, making them slower to cover ground. Even if your entire wardog division is destroyed, they might lose 30% of their daemons /and thus 30% of their humans/. Meanwhile, your human army has zero casualties, isn't needing to take care of wounded or deal with piled-up corpses, and hasn't just come out of a pitched battle.

(Come to think of it, given that your wardogs would be that much faster over terrain than your opponents' armies, why not send them into your opponent's camp equipped with timed-release poisons and biological agents (or explosives, if you have them)? Or infect them with something nasty before the charge?)

Then, of course, once you send in your humans, their daemons might be conditioned not to attack you (if they're OK with attacking daemonless humans, you can release a bunch of dumb wildlife onto the battlefield to take up their attention) - but you have no such restriction.

The problem with this idea is that, canonically, animals and daemons recognize each other as /other/. Animals know that daemons aren't animals, even if you have a sparrow daemon sitting next to a sparrow. The sparrow is going to fly off. This is (headcanonically) the result of thirty-three years of evolutionary pressure caused by daemonically-assisted hunting and also (maybe canonically) because daemons dissolve into gold sparkles when their human dies. I think that humans are also able to differentiate daemons from animals, but i'm not certain if that's covered in the books. Generally a daemon without its human would be more willing to speak.

But aside from that, the wardog approach to warfare is the equivalent of near-future dorne/robot warfare. Send in the non-humans, because they'll kill the humans. If it's a feasible technique, then any up-to-date military will have a nonhuman assets program, just like any up-to-date military will have machine guns and training in enfilade fire.

Probably some battles go differently, perhaps a few fewer people die of starvation in rural fishing communities, but I don't think it would be a huge shift if it were very difficult.

** Illusion magic in a limiting aspect would simply improve entertainment. It would be easily identified as an illusion so you couldn't use it to deceive or bluff. It can't be permanent so you can't create hidden entrances, or even better a permanent repository of knowledge that can't be destroyed conventionally.

It can only be cast a short distance. It obviously would still improve communication. This could be limited for example by the magic needing to be put on something physical like a piece of paper first, so the cost of sending messages wouldn't lessen.

I'm sure it could still be used for psychological warfare or torture such as showing something grotesque but as I said before illusions would be easily identified by any layman.

It can't provide any form of lighting otherwise you could produce cheap illumination. Maybe you could eventually allow it such as coming with the same cost as flash powder or similar things, but depending on the setting it couldn't provide lighting unless someone is nearby to maintain it constantly. Something like having a light in your hand, but the effort is so much that it can't be maintained that long.

It may be okay to let it improve documentation such as conjuring an image of an animal nobody else has seen before long enough for someone to sketch it onto paper. This would allow someone that does that to send teams of illusionists into the world to document things and come back with the results, but it obviously is still coming with the cost of simply having a team of sketch artists do the same thing.

** Any magic that operates on an absolute ("instant" anything, subverting the idea of relative time, "unbreakable" anything, subverting the idea of force or erosion, "anywhere" effects, subverting the idea of distance/space, etc) can and will break society-as-we-know-it once a munchkin of sufficient intelligence is born to recognize the non-obvious advantages it can be used for.

On the other hand, magic that just makes doing things more expedient/easy can be fairly low impact and not utterly upsetting the economy/society, assuming the person gaining the ability/training it is rare enough to be treated like a super-specialized professional.

Some ideas:

- Botany Magic. Basically being able to do what we do with careful breeding and genetic engineering of plants, but more "intuitively" and faster. It could create very nutritious and high yield crops, effective medicines, deadly poisons, etc, but wouldn't really "break" society unless users start making chimera creatures that cross animal kingdoms, which could be restricted by arbitrary "the magic only works on plants" type of rules, or less arbitrary reasons why doing it with less "simple" organisms is much harder and unpredictable.

- Illusion Magic of almost any kind. A team working in tandem that can create sounds, smells, sights and so on can revolutionize entertainment and alter how wars are fought (depending on how big/massively affecting the illusions can be), but in general being able to make people perceive things you can imagine doesn't usually break much in society.

- Telepathy Magic, as long as it's sufficiently distance restricted and doesn't grant sapience/intelligence to the receiver. It would make any activity dealing with animals much easier (being able to know that your dog is barking because it smells what it identifies as another dog versus a potential home invader), including domestication and using trained animals in more specialized situations, from construction to cartography to warfare.

**** To be honest, most fantasy kind of requires a suspension of disbelief when it comes to a lot of what we consider mundane details of living in a pre-modern world, not to mention population and resource logistics. Cities with even a hundred thousand people, let alone multiple cities with hundreds of thousands, were practically nonexistent, and even rich kingdoms with arable climates had to devote hundreds of miles of land between cities to farming just to maintain their population. Any food more luxurious than bread or rice and stew would be almost unheard of for the vast majority of the population, and the amount of time the average person had to spend worrying about food opposed to doing "basic" other things like learning to read is almost completely ignored. Not to mention how prevalent and crippling the multitude of physical ailments and diseases were.

Magic botany would go a long way toward increasing the standard of living and population sizes from "realistic medieval" to what we might consider "standard fantasy" in any given story with that setting. Whether it accelerates things to the modern era or not I think is a different question: certainly it makes it easier to reach it, but the presence of other threats (say, roaming packs of goblins or magical creatures making life or trade difficult and requiring resources devoted to protection) would be a separate obstacle to offset the ease of acquiring food.

If the child mortality gets reduced family size can be reduced allowing parents to invest more into each child which ends up effecting pretty much everything in society.

--------------

Anyway regarding non revolutionary magic. I'm not sure if such a thing can exists, the mere existence of magic ought to revolutionize our understanding of the world. Even if the magic only allows us to do things we are already capable of through mundane means but at a far greater cost, it would still be a worthwhile field of study with who known what kind of ramifications.

Though the first thing that comes to mind, if I recall correctly, is early Discworld books magic which by magical law can never be any more efficient or cost effective than a mundane approach, kinda cheating.

Second thing is the fey magic in Tad William's War of the Flowers, where the magical fey society somehow only manages to become a slightly outdated equivalent of human society. Though I don't remember if this was just due to some kind of societal inertia, or creative sterility on part of the fey, or some cosmic/magical law that states that the mundane human and magical fey worlds need to be reflections of one another.

For example. A person who can cast magic missile is potentially creating energy from nothing. With enough time and ingenuity, there will be infinite energy. Infinite energy means infinite matter and the ability to create whatever you want. No economy.

The counter-argument to your 100 virgins for a gate is that a village of 50 people would never pay that price. So, cost is always the limiting factor. There must be a price for everything. Conservation must hold.

** Even if you don't allow magics that trigger technological revolutions, technological revolutions happen anyway. Society is never stable. OK, we've just invented magical teleport gates. For a while they're going to be rare, so you can put your story in the transition period. Or you can nerf the gates:

- They're permanent but still require maintenance. That maintenance costs a lot of time and money. If you don't maintain the gate, it starts randomizing things that go through.
- They're permanent but decay. Everything that goes through the gate shrinks it, just a little. Old gates are no more than a few centimeters wide, and are telegraphs or mail slots.
- They're permanent and stable, but the first gate in a region makes it harder to set up more gates. After a while you can't set up any more gates. Some places are gateless because saboteurs set up a bunch of short hop gates that are just as much of a problem as longjump ones. Other places are stuck with gates to places that are no longer worth traveling to.
- They're permanent and stable, but they interfere with each other. After a while you have too many gates in an area, and you can't rely on them, you come out the wrong place, or don't come out at all. You end up with expanding "dead patches" that you can't gate into surrounded by newer still-reliable gates outside the interference limit.

But "small magics"?

- Magic that enhances the flavor of food. Other mild sensory enhancements and euphorics.
- Magic that glues things together, not too strongly. It does make cloth stronger, and it's useful for putting up notices. You can't use it to climb walls... it's a permanent attraction between two objects, not a "sticky pad".
- Magic that pushes things apart, not too strongly. You can use it to improve bearings, but it's not strong enough to make a hoverboard.
- Magic that sets the state of an object and lets you reset it to that state. Then you have to cast it again. There's limits to how much change it can reset, and how often it can be done, and it doesn't work on living things... but you cast it on new clothes and take them to a magical laundry to make it "like new" again. Also great for secret messages.

** Turning humans into other animals, assuming:

- Vertebrates only. Cell cultures do not count.
- The process is somewhat difficult, and to do so requires sympathetic items of the target, several minutes of preparation, direct visual contact and/or ingestion of a substance, and the sacrifice of a healthy individual of the chosen species.
- The target does not retain any of the knowledge, goals, or personality of their original form.
- The transformed target starts out proportionately satiated and aged to the original human form.
- The process can be reversed. This requires equivalent preparation to the initial transformation. The target retains the experiential memories of being transformed, but through the perspective of the target species. Interpreting this is a hard process which takes several years of training, and is roughly like learning to control a limb after moderate brain damage. Difficulty is proportional to genetic distance from humans.
- There is a significant "recovery time" which is equivalent to suffering mild trauma.
- You can only choose a species, and have no control over the exact appearance of the chosen form. The appearance varies with each transformation.
- While transformed, the target has the metabolism, vitality, and lifespan of the chosen species. Injuries and aging sustained while transformed carry across proportionately and to developmentally analogous anatomy.

This is not too distant from examples encountered in literature and folklore.

- Access to the seas and oceans allows for entirely new forms of infrastructure and warfare. Aquaculture is entirely feasible, gives access to rich fertilizers, and encourages further marine exploitation. Whales with pikes are left as an exercise to the reader.

** Water purification (a standard Cleric spell) would impact the alcohol industry (beer and wine), but relatively little else.

Some kind of personal invulnerability shield would probably do OK, as long as it's rare enough to be limited to a few specific individuals.

A spell to summon diseases or plagues.

Any spell that creates a human, or a humanlike creature, to order - or with specific properties, like a demonic self-serving adviser -could /probably/ be tailored so as to be similar to simply hiring someone from the existing labour pool. (Requires expensive materials, can't produce people who are too exceptional/impressive, random component etc.)

An "evil genie" mind control/reading spell, as an analogy for torture. You'd need to make it costly enough, obviously, but torture is already a thing. (We can say with reasonable confidence, looking at history, that it would be implemented in an incredibly slapdash and irrational manner by almost everyone, so that's nice.)

Healing spells /would/ have huge effects, honestly. You've got the ability to cure STDs; you've got reliable medical care for the rich (where before they had only quacks and charlatans, pretty much); you've got unknown and as-yet unmeasured effects on intelligence, political views, and God only knows what else from growing up with lower parasite load ... actually, that might explain the usual tendency for pseudo-medieval worlds to be populated by pseudo-modern /people/, with sexual equality and such.

The standard D&D /raise dead/, where it can't raise those killed by old age and requires 5,000gp worth of diamonds or whatever, is probably fine.

I'm not certain, but I think a /Perpetual Light/ AKA lightbulb spell wouldn't break anything important.

** Any magic with a co-introduction of sufficient counterbalancing. While this could be an intrinsic limiter to the magic itself (e.g. costs years of your lifespan), it could also be a second magic. This would circumvent your limitation clause, though add a conditional one.

The nature of the interaction between a proactive magic and its counterbalance is interesting. The counterbalance needs to be intrinsically more powerful than the proactive magic unless that magic is not that powerful (such as Yudkowsky's destructive magic example). The reason for this is that an option introduced, no matter how weak, is strictly a buff. Even if a counterbalance works 100% of the time you've still given people an option they didn't have before given isolation from counter-mechanism. If I cast bull's strength and any person who sees it can purge it at will, I'm still a more effective laborer in my own time, or among cooperative people. There's no drawback to bull's strength, even if it's ineffective in combat. Conversely, invisibility vs. an AoE negation gives the potential for punishment, which, depending on the method of delivery, could limit the practical application of invisibility to honest work (hunting for instance), a non-impact.

Generalising from here, I think that any magic that produces value without pissing someone off is difficult to counterbalance using the introduction of a second magic.

*** Presumably, "radical change" means the carefully-crafted story setting falling apart and turning into something else too quickly to tell the story, or to leave open the possibility for telling further stories in that canon.

Naruto's world definitely has one of those "settings that would fall apart", as demonstrated in /The Waves Arisen/: someone sufficiently motivated to "just put together what's in front of them"---without any novel research or large-scale engineering!---could completely reshape the Naruto world into something that's worthless for telling stories about ancient clans having Ninjutsu battles.

Any setting that /has/ an "eschaton" event in the story is one where eschatons are already really quite easy to trigger, in the same sense that memorized spells in D&D are quite easy to trigger---almost all the work of "casting" the spell has already been done. /Neon Genesis Evangelion/ in all of its incarnations demonstrates this quite well: the story is basically about the protagonists trying to /avoid/ an eschaton that really, really wants to happen. Through the various media, the heroes repeatedly start it up /accidentally/ in /different/ ways, and then have to clean up the mess.

I'm not as sure about eschaton events that aren't exactly due to power 'harnessable' by any mere human. /Chrono Trigger/'s apocalypse-event is pretty easy for various parties (Queen Zeal; Magus) to trigger, but it's more the kind of "trigger" that involves prodding a paperclip-maximizer to get on with its paperclip-maximizing already. It's really only the paperclip-maximizer itself that has enough power to destabilize the setting, and it gets to "decide" the rules for what will or won't set it off, based on its own goal-tree. Unlike /Evangelion/'s Instrumentality, you can't really /predict/ Lavos as if it were a law of physics, which means you can't really /harness/ Lavos to your own ends (as Queen Zeal found out.) It's less "nuclear bomb" and more "evil god."

And, to emphasize the point of the linked article: /reality/ is a really good example of something that /won't/ fall apart very easily. If it was easy enough to create e.g. grey goo that can unilaterally outcompete all other life, nature would have already happened onto the formula and we wouldn't be here. Every low-level phenomenon we study in labs is already happening (or has already happened) somewhere in the universe by pure chance; every particle we produce in particle accelerators has likely already been produced. We're not going to blow up the world just by making a new one. We might blow up the world by a /concentrated effort to apply those principles/---plutonium decays in the Earth's crust all the time, but never in concentrations enough for supercriticality---but it's infinitesimally unlikely that there's anything laying around our universe that we might accidentally "activate" to our doom.

(Unless, that is, it was built by some other sentient race, who "cast the spell" for us. I feel increasingly wary of the idea of life being possible in a universe that /doesn't/ necessitate the Fermi paradox; imagine if, ala /2001/, there really /were/ precursor-race artifacts left laying around for cavemen to find.)

It makes magic pretty versatile, since you can use it instead of a whole bunch of other skills, but it isn't a significant difference.

The permanent virgin-powered Portal spell is not properly balanced because virgins are a dime a dozen. Ethics, of course, never comes into the equation. Likewise, typical Mana isn't a proper gating system because Mana is ambient and basically free.

But if you replace virgins with something worth 10xGDP of a typical nation, the gates suddenly won't be popping like mushrooms. Another common gamedesign trick is making each Portal price grow exponentially. When 10th Portal costs you 10^{10} virgins, suddenly, you can't afford it until industrial cloning kicks in and at that point you can have maglev on every tile.

** Magical effects from the World of Darkness series of games and books etc. are protected from the most of society through a series of taboos mostly but also an incredibly powerful effect called The Veil which may or may not be maintained by Satan, it's a long and interesting story.

Those mages who have access to magic that is controllable in a very useful fashion, as opposed to Vampires and Werewolves whose magic is more inbuilt and generally very inflexible, have the common problem of spells that only work when you believe in them. The overarching plot of Mage:the Ascension is the idea that traditional Mages are being pushed into obsolescence by the Technocracy who are Mages that use super-science which is simply a different name for magic but who success allows the world to advance behind them and grow technologically.

So if you make magic harder the less plausible it is you also vastly reduce its effects on your setting by giving the setting primacy over magic rather than the other way round. World of Darkness's setting runs on the expectations of it's residents but only so far as the plot allows, I find it interesting to think about though.

** So, I'm going to regret this, but hey, try to exploit this power.

You can transmute a volume of wood to an equal volume of rough-fired ceramic, and back. The object has to be lifted single-handedly, so that your arm is the only thing supporting the weight of the wood/ceramic, and the wood/ceramic has to be freefloating in air and not supported against gravity by any major forces other than your arm.

I honestly can't think of anything insanely clever to do with this. Make pots out of coconut shells??? Make neat looking wood objects by sculpting and then transmuting clay??? Some sort of... weapon that uses easily-replenished single-use ceramic blades, like obsidian-edged swords? Try to make money by transmuting wood to clay and then to really expensive wood (except that'd just crash the economy for expensive wood or expensive porcelain since lots of people can do it, and both of those things are just luxury materials for artwork anyways)???

Wood density: ~0.5

Ceramic density: ~3-4

I guess if there's a rope attached to a thing to be transmuted but it slacks as you support the whole weight of a thing then magic works?

Say the ceramic thing weights 15 kg, that makes wooden thing around 2-3 kg.

12 kg of difference per thing.

If there's a big wheel with those thingies hanging from it and person at the bottom transmutes clay to wood, person at the top transmutes wood to clay and the wheel is given some initial spin - it will spin and will also be able to do some work.

It can be made to work without ropes either.

You'd need to set up some cooldowns so just making a big enough wheel would be unfeasible.

Also making ships would be easier: use thin layers of wet clay, make thin layers of wood with the curve you need, glue them together with fibers in neighbour layers at a right angle to each other. Interconnect layers in brick pattern. No need to grow special ship-building wood.

In fact, if you can cheaply make wet clay from thoroughly crushed wood-transmuted clay, you can now build a fleet from scrap wood.

Also what about reinforced wood/clay? Does it work? If it does not, soaking a piece of wood in salt water and wood -> clay -> wood makes non-salty wood? (pure water could be extracted by that, also useful for the fleet).

How versatile wood is? There definitely are some edible types.

If you are able to build a fleet using scrap wood / clay / seawater (what's the least expensive with your logistics) and give them source of food and pure water and an engine then you can have /some/ maritime advancement.

** My best immediate thought is low-level illusion magic. I'd expand though on what some other users here have posted. Most low-tier illusion spells are, as they suggest, just temporary sensory trickery. Convincing someone that X is Y (or more Y-like than X-like, or at least one attribute's deviation toward Y from X), or that X has disappeared, etc. Potency-wise, I'm thinking even below the level where you can do full human transfiguration, so you wouldn't have to worry too much about someone, say, disguising themselves as royalty or nobility, or as a close servant, for purposes of espionage or assassination (even if we admit this, I'm assuming that, once everyone knows this kind of magic is possible, smarter people will engineer tests to filter out sneaky shapeshifters). Besides, I'd argue that it's not uniquely beneficial relative to the old-fashioned way, either in kind or in (significant) degree: illusion-enchanced trickery is, at the revolutionary level, essentially isomorphic (or homeomorphic and requiring very, very few adjustments) to just having a corrupt adviser, which is not all /that/ uncommon a phenomenon for high-powered monarchs.

Beyond that, everything I imagine people would want from illusions--which arguably falls under "cosmetics"--is cripplingly temporary. So, you might be able to give the appearance of being unblemished, of having all your teeth, of being taller, etc. Except, you'd probably only get to have it for a few hours, and, given that you'd probably have to get it retail (since it is unlikely that anyone other than well-to-do merchants or nobility would have the requisite training to attempt to do it themselves), it would become prohibitively expensive very quickly to keep reupping on your beautifying spell so often, so I doubt it would amount to much beyond a luxury industry.

** Another idea: magic that's got to be literally wound up, like a spring.

You have some kind of mechanism that converts mechanical energy into "mana" to power talismans. So let's say you create a permanent gateway between two places by physically placing "portal stones" at each end, but you have to have an ox in a treadmill walking in circles for six hours to charge the stone up up enough to send the same ox six miles... about half an ox's walking speed.

This would still be useful, but it wouldn't replace muscle-powered transportation except to bypass natural barriers, and it would be more useful to bypass rivers than mountain ranges. Not only is the distance shorter, but you could power the portal with a millwheel.

It would be a great communication tool, especially if light and sound could go through the portal... but even if it couldn't, you'd still be able to transfer paper cheaply in energy cost.

One huge difference would be defensive structures. Castles would have pairs of portal stones instead of gateways. If portals transmitted light, you'd eliminate windows as well.

Let's say instead of a portal you have a kinetic energy spell. You don't bother with bows and arrows, you carry an aiming stick and a bag of mana-charged sticks or rocks, and some kind of windlass to charge them up again between battles. Or maybe the magic is in the stick, like a magical railgun that works like a cross between a crossbow and a rifle. Bombs are bags of rocks with randomly directed impact-triggered kinetic spells on them. Shaped charges are /easy/.

Warfare is driven by windmills and waterwheels holding open portals to the front that charged weapons are delivered through. Rivers are a major strategic asset. Since one limit to portals is mass, there's a tendency to overcharge the goods. Sometimes there are terrible accidents...

** If by magic we mean something against laws of physics as we know it, then I have some general ideas: 1. spells which give you a power which to others seems to be something one could achieve by other means. For example a power to stop procrastinating and focus on your goals. Or a power to arrive to correct conclusion from already held information. 2. spells which create something (for an appropriate price) which is not natural, but one could imagine a world with it. Like, a cloth in a completely new color. Or a brick made of completely new material, which behaves mostly like a clay brick, but is green. Or an animal which looks like a mix of cat and dog. 3. spells with a tricky feedback loop which causes them to not influence economy, for example a spell which gives you a sausage at the same time deducing one gold coin from your pocket and giving half of it to the closest butcher, quarter of it to the nearest postman, quarter of it to the bartender, and finally making the pig one ounce lighter, and you one hour older.
