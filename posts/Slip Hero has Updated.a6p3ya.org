** So when I mentioned this story here before, people asked me to let them know when this next updated. And after two years of the author busy with work, he finally updated!

It's a classic reincarnation into a new world except the hero has forgotten nearly all of his memories except for hints and vague information. The author does a very good job with the worldbuilding and having the slow exploration of an interesting magic system.

**** It's more like he gets ideas to try and then he has to spend time, usually months to years, testing and experimenting to make them work.
