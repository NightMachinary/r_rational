Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** So, I've been doing fatal crash investigations for about a month now, and here's my two takeaways:

1) never drive near a tree again because it will kill you (I am now pretty much like Durkon in OOTS as far as trees go)

2) never ride in a motorbike again because it will kill you

with a bonus THIRD OBVIOUS TAKEAWAY:

3) maybe drinking and driving is not a great decision?

--------------

Also, it looks like this job is going to be a lot of writing repetitive reports. I'm slowly coming to terms with it, but I kind of hate having to make reports up that are 70-80% virtually identical CTRL+F stuff with 10-20% important content and ~10% vital content.

It doesn't help that I have two types of reports, with Report 2 being done in batches (As of last Friday, I had 6 Report 2s to write; I have now written 3 of them, I think; once they're done I won't have any Report 2s to do for a month or so). So it makes Report 2 particularly bad because I don't do any and then all of a sudden MORE REPORT 2S THAN YOUR BODY HAS ROOM FOR.

Anyone have tips for dealing with this mentally, as I like the job well enough except for that? The reports require a lot of care and attention to detail, so I can't just put podcasts on and go on autopilot, but I might try putting music on next week and see how that goes.

--------------

Also, apart from the obvious "white noise"/"earmuffs"/"noise cancelling headphones"/"tell them to shut up", does anyone have recommendations for noisy offices?

*** I was a grader briefly in college, and it had a similar structure: nothing, then a huge amount of work all at once after a midterm.

I tried a bunch of stuff people suggested (Pomodoros, rewarding yourself after doing one, having a dedicated space where you only do that task), but the only thing that really worked was finding someone else who also had grading to do and agreeing to both meet up and work on it at a specific place and specific time. Turns out social pressure is pretty psychologically powerful.

On noisy offices: if you're already playing loud white noise through noise canceling headphones and it isn't enough, you're probably in a bad spot. Only advice I'd have is try experimenting with different types of noise. (E.g. you can find background noise videos on Youtube with a lot of bass, which I needed at one point when I worked somewhere with a lot of footstep noises.)

Another obvious thing you've probably already thought of is working early or late when nobody's there, depending on how flexible your hours are.

It's more that I find I work best with /absolute silence/ (like, the study room in a university library is often too loud for me), so white noise isn't great for me, and noise cancelling headphones are super expensive and I've never tested them out.

***** Noise /cancelling/ headphones don't work too well for human speech. They're fantastic for very regular sounds like wind or aircraft engines, in which case they work scarily well. From what I've read, for noise as chaotic as speech, it would just distort it and probably make it more noticeable even if it's somewhat quieter.

Noise isolation headphones can vary in effectiveness, but are usually fairly good and not nearly as expensive. You could probably use some good earplugs in addition to noise isolating headphones, which should work better than either alone. I know pro gamers use something similar to focus during tournaments. [[/r/headphones][r/headphones]] would probably know some good brands for noise isolation.

******* Try getting some over ear headphones or earmuffs to go on top of those. Headphones would be more innocuous. I can't say for sure if it would work, but I think it's the best you could do without either soundproofing your office or working from home. Headphones don't have to be particularly expensive to block noise well, like $80 or so for "good but not great" ones.

***** I'm very picky about my white noise, personally. Rain works really well for me for some reason, maybe because I grew up hearing it so it doesn't sound harsh and artificial.

Noise canceling headphones are definitely expensive, and the cheaper ones don't really work as well, but they're pretty amazing. Also, my experience has been that they last like 2 years of heavy use before something goes wrong with them, even the nice ones, so it's more of a recurring cost. That said, if you amortize a nice $200 set of headphones over 2 years, that's like a 25 cents a day, maybe 50 cents per day you actually need them. I would absolutely pay 50 cents to be able to think straight on any given day, so at least for me it pretty obviously prices out.

I know you said no obvious things, but have you tried those 34db earplugs they use at shooting ranges? Those work pretty spectacularly in my experience, and are pretty cheap.

I ended up giving white noise a different try using the soundscapes on mynoise, and I found that worked really well after a few days of adjustment. I think the variety in the noises while not being distracting and the gentle oscillation of the sounds into slightly different sounds really helped.

Just want to mention that this is the only option that's managed to work for me. My company just got acquired by a larger one which fits ~200 people in a single open office space and has a culture of folks having loud meetings in the middle of the office, often next to un-involved folks' desks.

I grabbed a set of [[https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Acoustic-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B00M1NEUKK][Bose QC 25]]s last time they went on sale and wear them pretty much 8/5 at work. They're fantastic, some days I'm sure they're the only thing keeping me sane.

For $200 (and often on sale for much less) amortized over the number of days you can actually pay attention to what you're doing, I couldn't be happier.

EDIT: worth noting that the sound cancelling can be enabled even when music is not playing, which is how I often find myself using them.

**** My partner was given a pair of high-end noise cancelling headphones for his recent birthday; maybe once he's gotten bored of them I'll borrow them for a few days and see how they go.

Funnily enough I tend to use the opposite type of headphones - bone conduction headphones that let me hear absolutely everything that's going on around me (I bought them for cycling for safety reasons). It's meant that being unaware of my environment while I have headphones on makes me uncomfortable.

Cheers for the recommendation but those bad boys are ~300AUD and that's not a gamble I can afford making. Even then, the open office has "quiet rooms" that you can go into when you need to, which are basically tiny offices, so I might try using that.

Scifi. The worldbuilding is very rational, but the protagonist isn't at all.

On the topics you mentioned:

- Young western guy: main character is a preteen asian girl.
- Good analytical but piss-poor social skills: she sort of doesn't fit on this axis. Her primary skillset is hurting things, being lucky, and stuff I can't mention because spoilers. Gets along well with basically everybody who knows her.
- Dearly held views on science and rationality: also sort of doesn't fit on this axis. Her thinking is more tactical and political. She has a very clannish right-wing attitude toward life. Likes learning things, but mostly because they help her succeed, rather than for love of learning.
- Meek but hardworking and philosophical: definitely not meek, very hardworking, not terribly philosophical.

*** Depends what sort of data-science he wants to be doing. There's a lot of different sub-fields within datascience that have their own toolkits. My teams' datascientists mostly focus on NLP (natural language processing) results and do so anywhere from fairly bog-standard heuristic methods up to LSTMs and CNNs (the oh-so-prevalent "deep learning" buzz words...). They work in Python, which is pretty standard for anyone in the industry working on /products/ rather than /research/.

As a general rule, an entry level position on the team requires: - a basic understanding of Python, just enough to glue libraries together and insert your math - a rough understanding of one or two of the "glue" libraries: (numpy, pandas, scipy/scikit-learn) - a medium understanding of one of the more in-depth do-your-job libraries, for those interested in deep learning rather than heuristics: (tensorflow, pytorch, keras, gensim, nltk maybe)

Nice to haves (datascience perspective -- ie. "I want to get hired and the folks interviewing me are datascientists"): - lots of datascience work (not just my company, more generally) uses Jupyter notebooks, so an understanding of that - data collection, cleaning, etc. Search term: "corpus cleaning" - corollary: knowledge of parsing large datasets ("corpus"es) - the pure math background will probably be fairly impressive here, any works from that will be relevant - data visualization -- even as simple as being able to visualize a dataset in something like matplotlib can be helpful here

Nice to haves (engineering perspective -- ie. "Oh no, there are engineerings involved in this hiring process too!"): - more than just a basic understanding of Python. Engineers tend to find that datascientists undervalue how much they need to use this skill - understanding of runtime and memory usage concerns, ie. "will the models this datascientist produces actually be able to be used, or will they often be too slow/too bloated/etc" - ability to test models, especially in an automated fashion. Any sort of mention of testing for things like recall/precision being more than an ad-hoc manual task - knowledge of parsing large datasets /using real-world tools/. Datascientists will be happy here to see "I can work with a 5GB Excel file", engineers will be more interested in "I have an understanding of SQL syntax and know how to work with it".

Depending on company, the average job will sway between the two datascience vs engineering extremes listed above. If he wants to live in the research world, come up with cool things, and hand them off, focus a bit more on the datascience asks. If he wants to bring features from conception to product, work in smaller companies with less engineering support, etc, focus a bit more on the engineering asks.

*** Python is the big language in data science right now. For learning python, Learning Python and Fluent Python, both published by O'Reilley, are good resources. They're both fairly comprehensive, so he probably doesn't need to fully read them, just the parts that are relevant. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is also a good book, although geared more towards beginners. I'm currently learning data science myself, and my course textbook is Python Data Science Handbook, so that's probably a good start. Specific libraries to learn would be Matplotlib for data visualization, Numpy and Pandas because I know they're related but I don't know specifically what they do other than "math stuff", tensorflow and keras for machine learning which is heavily related to data science, and probably some relevant libraries for interfacing with stuff like Excel documents to directly work with the data. Learning databases would also be rather useful, in which case my text is Database System Concepts which teaches database theory along with some chapters on SQL. Would probably be valuable to learn more about specific SQL implementations from a dedicated book, although I don't know which ones are good.

Spyder is a good IDE for data science, and includes most of the above libraries without any additional work.

For more than that, ask me again in a few years. Or, you know, ask someone who works in the field what their University course lists taught. That would be quicker.

** Random thought: You are having a reoccurring dream where every night you are dreaming of being transported to an abandoned city that looks like it just survived a bombing. The dream is incredibly realistic to the point where if you weren't waking up in your bed come sunrise each morning, you would believe that you have been kidnapped to somewhere foreign. Each night, you return to where you last ended the prior night as if your waking life was a dream. You switch 'worlds' whenever you fall asleep in one and wake up in the other world as if you are waking up from a normal sleep that lasted just as long as the amount of time you spent awake in the other world. You feel like you are living two lives split into day and night. What would you do in the dream? When you are awake?

I'm just curious how people here would react to the situation I've been putting my characters through in the story I've been writing recently.

*** Find out if both are really persistent. I would injure myself in some small way on both sides, say cut my right or left index finger, and notice if the injuries remain after "waking up" and coming back from either side. If the injuries disappear on one side, then it would be fairly safe to say that that is a weirdly lucid dream, although persistent injuries wouldn't disprove that hypothesis.

To more firmly prove or disprove the lucid dream hypothesis, make a 4x4 or 5x5 grid of numbers on the ground, and write out the sums of each column and row next to it, then memorize the sums and *only* the sums. If the recalculated sums work out to be the same across switches, it's extremely unlikely to be a dream, because I don't think you could work out that grid from the sums without a lot of conscious effort. I'm unsure how long it would take me even right now, if I wasn't allowed a computer.

If it's a dream, go see a therapist. Something is wrong.

If it's not, try looking for landmarks, things that are easily identifiable. Are you stranded across time, space, or both? Do the ruined building have any distinguishing technology? You could get a rough location if you learn how to read the stars in the sky, so try that. Similarly with any local flora or fauna.

If you can get a location, try finding out the nearest human settlement from maps on the "waking" side, and find other humans. That would be the best way to get information. After meeting humans, the decision tree is too big for me to encompass in a post.

*** Is the dream continuous? That is, do i wake randomly in the city, or where I left off before waking up? How much of the dream do I remember? Presumably I try and test how accurate the "dream" is, to see whether I'm having the mother of all lucid dreams or whether it's all self consistent enough that it could very well be (a) realitity.

I'd try and find out where or what the city is; Is it my current city, a destroyed new york, what?

Do I feel pain in this dream? Hunger? Thirst? Do injuries develop, accumulate, go away? Am I "Awake" and can worry about things or am I drifting around in lala land?

A lot of it I bet would be trying to see how things progress from one dream to another, especially whether it's seamless or whether I have the appearance of 12-18 hours occuring between dreams. I guess I'd also look for mirrors and writing supplies, to see if it's me and to write notes. I'd also explore, I suppose, depending on how scared I was with the environment. if it really felt real enough I'd probably fear or be aggressive to any people I met in the dream. I'd talk to my friends and family about the dream, as well. if it got far enough along I might even ask if they could watch my sleeping...I'm not crazy or anything, but such a realistic dream would make me wonder if I'm being teleported or something.

*** When I'm awake I have access to Google and Wikipedia. I can look stuff up.

At first, I look up about persistent dreams and the lucid dreaming. I try lucid dreaming when I'm asleep - at least to the point of attempting to fly in the dream - and when that doesn't work and I experience pain in the dream (possibly a twisted ankle), then I try to fly via lucid dreaming while I'm awake (being careful to start out flying /upwards/ so that I don't fall if it fails to work).

--------------

Presumably I am unable to prove which existence is real and which is not. I then start using my internet access to look up survival guides which I can use in the Bombed City, and trying to use things I find in the Bombed City (newspapers?) to identify where/when it is. (At this point, I'm more than a little worried). If there is a significant time difference between real life and the Bombed City (e.g. the Bombed City is in the future) then I attempt to take advantage of the temporal paradox (i.e. hiding useful supplies in the present so I can find them in the Bombed City - that may well work even if someone in the present removes my supplies, simply because I /expect/ to find them there).

If I meet any other people in the Bombed City I will attempt to ask them about their dreams and, if they admit to also having similar experiences, I will share my email address with them (allowing coordination on both sides of the Dream Barrier).

*** I think 4chan's most important innovations were, and continue to be, structural: the adaptation of Futaba's anonymity and posting style to American norms and interests. Japanese 2chan posters invented the internet meme as a genre, 4chan brought it to an English-speaking audience and set it free to the world.

Enforced anonymity also encourages a particular style of community creativity much of the rest of the internet has lost. When somebody is consistently funny elsewhere, they get a lot of followers and develop a personal style. To be funny on 4chan, robbed of the personal, one must embrace the particular style of each individual subgroup. Humor becomes derivative and in-jokey... reused and remixed and reposted until the cream rises.

That said, the process is no longer unique and no longer alone.

The originality on display in this art is amazing. Even beyond the caricatures, reading trolls and/or idiots argue over global conspiracies and genetic dilution in /pol/ never fails to amuse.
