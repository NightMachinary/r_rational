[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4mwcvl/rt_the_great_filter/]] <-- first post about the story. [[http://www.begoodenough.com/the-great-filter/]] <-- the actual story. Warning. Below is spoilers.

Given the conundrum of that every time travel is murder of everything, killing one more person is irrelevant.

Would you perform the following? After the first time-travel where you wrote into another persons brain, would you continue this trend, developing time-travel, waiting to see who is the next best competitor, checking to see if they are not you and then overwriting their brain one second after you were sent back? thus having one extra person who is 'you' and dedicated to seeing who else is on the cutting edge of technology and going to develop time travel.

At what point would you be able to bypass the filter by having sufficient experts in the field actively ensuring other people do not time-travel or by creating a general purpose AI that can take over or by finding a way of preventing time-travel etc etc.

How would you bypass the filter?


** The main problem is that we need to find a way to improve our situation between resets.

While its technically true the infinite series with a termination state eventually terminate; in practice not really.

Consider these two math problems

1: if you flip a heads increase x by 2 else decrease it by 1; if x falls below zero, everyone dies

2:roll a dice, if 1-4 increase x by 10, if 5 decrease by 1 if 6 set x to 0; if x falls below zero everyone dies

While situation 1 has a 50% dieing on the first turn, if you make it past turn 5 or so your set and the chance of dying decreases at an absurdly low rate

while situation 2 ... death is /always/ 2 turns away, it doesn't matter if surviving the first turn is a 5/6 chance, long term success is far far lower.

This means, being the ones who control the time travel and using it. Perhaps you should try to prevent brain emulation form being funded, when ever you find its funded you reset with your memories. Which is potentially a very shitty life.

edit// maybe you should release a plague, force people into a digital life, where your to only person with access to the necessary quantum tools to make a time travel thingy and reset very few centuries just to prevent other civilizations form popping up

edit2// Wait fuck, waiting centuries means an alien civ probably is cycling time travel as well; upping your failure rate to a situation 2 setup.

.... You have to cycle realities quickly as well or find a way to communicate ftl with an alien species that also have the tech or disable their time travel.

*** I'd be very skeptical of the relevance of an alien civilization with this technology. After all, the chances of two species creating it at what is essentially the /exact/ same time in cosmological terms is surely orders of magnitude smaller than there being a timeline that once existed where they did exist at the same time that as we did.

**** The whole point is that the great filter is time travel.

faster then light is broken in this universe and explicitly states that this creates different aliens.

if there is a .1% chance they discover time travel in a given time frame, your designed looping gets caught into slight variations until they make them self extinct or your planned looping fails.

As soon as the ball leaves your hands, it stays out of your hands until the that guy dies, or anyone in the game manages to create a new player. Having two different species trying to mess with time at the same time will take away control form who ever is using the longer loop and add whole new losing conditions.

***** this of course requires them to loop first. Whereas if you have the first loop they will die, entirely, in the first loop they discover time travel. only if you're inside their loop is there an issue.

****** No it doesn't, if they have a chance of looping during your looping they eventually will.

Their loop can be nested inside yours and spread side effects to your own world

Remember ftl is in this universe

  It means you can effect things at the quantum level far faster than the speed of light

***** I find weird that all civilizations are incapable of not using time travel. For the same reason that nuclear bombs can't be the answer i think we would find at least some civilization that decides to avoid using it and tires to prevent other civilizations on their light cone from using it, even if other especies did use time través , there is no reason for that to mean the species that avoided time travel will disapear on the final logo, heck maybe they were the results of the loop.A lot of civilizations can fall to the same thing they can deduce happened to the others , but, all of them?!.Where did all competent aliens go?.
