When I started reading Wildbow's Worm I remember I ran across a number of message board threads in which readers were speculating that Wildbow was female due to how well he seemed to be able to write a female character. And I'd also wondered briefly if Wildbow was female, but then I saw how the plot went and decided based on my past reading the author was probably male.

What was it that made me think this? It seems to me that I've noticed a pattern in sci-fi/fantasy plots by male vs female writers. In Worm (which I consider to some extent the archetypal example of this) POV characters have a tendency to become more dangerous and capable the more they're tortured. Taylor is at her most terrifying when things are at their worst. Indeed, the whole setting revolves around the conceit that in a small percentage of cases a person who has been totally crushed will gain the power to effectively fight back. This is a theme I seem to see over and over in male authored sci-fi and fantasy, especially in the "rational" writing community, which is, presumably, almost exclusively male. POV characters become more dangerous and capable the worse the situation is and the more they've been tortured by the author, almost as though the torture earns them power. Overwhelming odds produce superhuman performance.

By contrast, female authored sci-fi and fantasy more commonly seems from what I have read to have plots where a POV character confronted by overwhelming odds or torture will not exhibit corresponding superhuman performance, but will instead simply fail. However, they generally survive that failure, often (it seems from my reading) falling into an imprisonment or slavery situation in which they lose the majority or even all of their agency (sometimes even a situation with disturbing elements of sexual slavery and humiliation) from which the POV character will then be able to organize a chance to escape and turn the tables, but only after a prolonged period of helplessness and commonly subjugation to a hostile character's will. The archetypal example of this plot in my reading is in the works of Vernor Vinge's former wife, Joan D. Vinge, in her Cat series, and another great (horrible?) example is Stephanie Meyers' Host. I am, sadly, in general less able to offer examples of this than of the "overwhelming odds produces superhuman performance" plot, as I have a tendency to quit and discard stories with too much failure and helplessness and too little superhuman performance.

To put this in crude and very sexist terms, from my reading it almost seems that if, for instance, a male author's POV character were about to be raped they would be more likely to suddenly develop superpowers (in one form or another) to fight off or kill their attacker, either before or after the attack, while a female author's character would more likely fail to offer effective resistance, be raped, get pregnant (or get a disease, or get abducted and held in slavery), have to piece back together their shattered life/psyche, and then finally reacquire full agency and go on to do something effective.

I formed this observation after a period during which I sought out the works of female sci-fi and fantasy authors, however I accept the possibility that I may be wrong (indeed the likelihood that I am wrong and have fallen victim to my own biases). I have definitely noticed occasional counter examples, for instance Richard Adams has a number of stories in which his female characters are literally held in sex slavery, and Brian Sanderson's Stormlight series has a main character enslaved early in the first book and stay a slave for more than one book (although I notice that Sanderson's character seems to have rather extreme amounts of agency for someone who is a slave, including such things as hidden superpowers, something I've observed to be more common among male author's characters who are enslaved in some manner). Stephan King also represents a counter example of sorts, though an odd one, in that his male characters seem to generally follow the normal pattern of increased capabilities under pressure, while his female characters instead seem to have a tendency to show hidden depths of weakness and helplessness when the chips are down.

Could I have some outside input? More counter examples are welcomed.


** I'm not sure if I've noticed a gender difference, but it's an interesting thought While reading this, though, I couldn't help but think that the latter example of failing, having horrible things happen to you, and having to pick up the pieces is more rational and realistic. People don't suddenly gain new abilities when the chips are down. If you fight in the face of overwhelming odds /you'll probably lose/.

I'd be interested in a different perspective to this, though.

Another interesting thought is to wonder if male readers like the power trip fantasy of the unrealistic plot more, while female readers prefer the "realistic" one. Is is interesting to notice that almost all "rational" fiction follows the unrealistic irrational power trip plotline.

You used /Worm/ as an example, and yet the sequel /Ward/ features a protagonist who is an excellent counter example, someone who wasn't empowered by being broken but instead has required four years of intensive therapy just to get to being /functional/ after what happened to them in /Worm/. Not to mention that the unconnected work the same author wrote immediately after /Worm/, /Pact/ is one I lost interest in for the same reason as you did with many of your counterexamples

And that, I think, may be at the root of what we're seeing here.

Without overly generalizing, it's within reason that many female science fiction authors, who have generally had to show the maturity to succeed in a male-dominated subindustry (and an industry based on imagination, to boot!), may tend to write characters who similarly have to mature before they can display agency.

I think that's pacing - I stopped so I could read it all at once, since that's how I read Worm*. Doing a bunch of characters can requires a fair amount of setup and time if you're doing a bunch of POV characters. It might also be about a hook versus slowness, although with the Parahumans series Wildbow goes really epic, and lots of characters /and/ speed would probably be pretty hard.

*When I read something all at once it's easier to keep track of the characters. And Epics have /so many characters/. Worm feels like it has 47 characters or more whose names I know.

*** I think one of the major criticisms that I have seen of the Harry Potter series is somewhat in line with the thoughts outlined in this post. I've seen repeated many times on a predominantly male forum (which shall remain nameless) that there was this shift in tone between book 1-4 and 6-7, with 5 being a transition between the two.

In the beginning, the story plays out like a typical boyish fantasy, with Harry being set up as the archetypal hero figure, performing amazing feats and overcoming incredible challenges against all odds. In these books the plots revolve around Harry (+friends) acting independently and trying to resolve their own problems; he has a boatload of agency, and the authority figures are often the main antagonists. And then in book 5 he is sidelined by these same authority figures, and when he eventually rebels and acts independently it goes awful.

Book 6 is Harry trying to recover from the slapdown life gave him, and he just goes along for the ride with dumbledore, and his attempts at independence go awfully. Book 7 is just Harry reacting to plot and doing what dumbledore or some other person tells him to do(read: hermione), with the anti-climactic grand finale being to surrender in a dumb christ parallel /to the literal/ (figurative) /devil/ (which, lets be honest, was an awful idea. What if it didn't work? Harry is dead, voldemort proceeds to kill all the mudbloods and rules britain with an iron fist).

Also, they complain that this shift in tone is accompanied by Hermione going from helpful sidekick to kingmaker. :shrug:

I don't agree on all points, and I definitely don't think it's simply because Rowling is a woman that it played out this way. What I do agree with is that I felt the books became increasingly unsatisfying to me as I was reading them, even though I couldn't say why that was. It is the main reason I gave HPMOR a shot and eventually found my way here, so I'm thankful for that.

He's way off in the female portion, I think because the specifics he provides, which indicates he probably does not read a lot of fiction authored by women, and because his examples seem to be drawing a false equivalence.

Even in your main example - Worm, there are characters who dont improve under pressure (e.g Panacea and Glory Girl), and this is even more so the case in Ward.

** I haven't read most of the works in your analysis. Off the top of my head, some major sci fi/fantasy books involving a realistic depiction of trauma and ptsd are

Harry Potter (Rowling, female) is kinda a superpowered revenge fantasy against the Durseleys right at the start (albeit, he doesn't gain powers via torture, they torture him because of his powers). He revisits this dynamic with Malfoy and Umbridge to some extent (Malfoy's bullying gets Harry the broom, etc)

Animorphs (applegate, female) tend to become more formidable the more they are tortured. Although, sometimes this ruthlessness is arguably bad and leading to worse decisions. Much of the serious is ghostwritten.

Winston from 1984 break under torture (Orwell, male). But the whole story is a tragedy, which shifts the dynamic.

Ender's game (card, male) confirms your hypothesis by getting more formidable the more he is tortured (but it was all a mistake in the end, and ultimately most of the people he hurt were not the ones who hurt him).

Matilda (Dahl, male) confirms your hypothesis with her psychic powers being triggered by anger.

So far I'm not convinced. That said, all these works are so popular that they filter more for success than any artifacts of the author's gender's psychology. If you wanna make generalizations about gender it might be more helpful to see what books boys and girls /read/ rather than /write/.

If you're reading a lot of fan works or personal projects then I suspect that the vast majority of the writers are not going to bother trying to write in a way that would obfuscate their gender, but a skilled writer could definitely do so, or even write in a way that people might perceive as more masculine or feminine, intentionally.

Like others have said, trying to pin this down to specific buzzwords or concepts, like some sort of mathematical formula, is likely to be an endeavor fraught with mistakes. Instead, I think a study of the characters and settings would be able to reveal much of the authors worldview and then you may be able to infer a gender (or even a race or class) from there.

The pern series is more about powerful relationships giving you power in my experience (dragon bonding). Both series are sci fi although science marches on happened to a lot of the psychic stuff its no more out there then dune.

For a direct fantasy try the enchanted forest chronicles. Its actually a pretty fun fantasy/fairy tale deconstruction. Although I think it was written backwards so the last book ends up being oner of the weaker ones.

However power and ability is not exponential and not strictly speaking what any of the stories are about.

Ursula k leguin tends not to focus on exponential power much at all in my experience and although trauma and stress might give characters a boost its just as likely to destroy them.

A further counter to where this trend is coming from could need made with the Lauren Faust MLP reboot. Her contributions and push for the show was more of a action/adventure pattern and less slice of life. So the bias you might be seeing is in publishers (who are often established people from an older era with their own bias bundle) and readers favoring a familiar pattern rather then an inherent bias in the authors on gender lines.

** What you're referring to is a general trope where characters learn from bad experiences and get better at action during crises. Comparable to leveling up in games.

In Worm getting powers is usually a traumatic event that isn't of immediate benefit. Taylor getting her powers only ended up with her in the hospital for days. There was no fighting back then, only the suffering. She didn't get to use her powers against her tormentors until much later when she fought against the Wards. And it's suggested that capes are drawn toward similar crises that resulted in their trigger event. Anyone undergoing a trigger event results in nearby parahumans becoming incapacitated and suffering momentary memory loss so those conflict situations still aren't easy.

Same thing with HPMOR, where a rational Harry Potter takes stock after a traumatic event, listing all the ways he could have reacted differently to prepare himself for the next crisis.

** I think a good sanity check might be thinking about random books written by women and seeing how they compare to this.

I'm having trouble coming up with these myself, but probably one of the biggest modern fantasy novels by a woman is Harry Potter. This is a counterexample (Harry routinely does superhuman feats when pressed, rather than fail).

** I definitely understand what you're getting at, but I don't think it's a certain general-case.

What I've experienced in Male vs. Female authors is that with female authors, the books tend to have more "It's ok to stick around at our current level of power and write slice-of-life stuff."

Male writers seem to be more interested in getting to the point, and going above and beyond. Male story-telling seems to revolve around getting somewhere, going places, and being ambitious as hell. With female authors, the characters go to the same places, get around the same areas, and they ascend to the same levels as male-written ambitious characters, it's just not /about/ the getting there.

It's surprisingly similar to how men and women look at sex. With men, there's a slow build-up, and you're slowly but surely /focusing/ on that one bit of release at the end, when you're above everything else. With women, it's more about the build-up, the sexyness beforehand, during, after, etc...

Men seem to also be a lot less accepting of defeat and submission because of hormones and the like.

TL;DR: Guys and girls write books like how they have sex, but not in the way you've implied, in my opinion.

** You are absolutely correct. It comes down to wish fulfilment fantasies. Men want power and domination, women want gradual empowerment.

First Fifteen Lives of Harry August is writen by a female, and character literally spends FIFTEEN lives to stop the antagonist from the shadows. I can't see a man writing something like that. I have issues with seeing what female perspective in wish fulfillment in fantazy is, but all of us just want to be Goku.

***** What? No he doesn't.

It takes literal years of grueling work, only made possible by incredibly unusual circumstances, dies due to his own failures /many/ times, is forced to flee for an entire book, and even at the peak of his power cannot "blow up cities on a whim". His greatest assets are subtler kinds of magic like mind manipulation and psychically synchronized simulacra.

We are talking about a guy who makes and then wears an explosive necklace programmed to trigger and kill him if anyone gets past his mental barriers or manages to capture him.

It is ultimately still a power fantasy, but a /very/ different kind of one then you would find in a shounen.

  Like you said it is a power fantazy where main character at the end is closer to Goku then Harry August.

  Both Harry and Zorian are in time loop. Zorian ends up destroying cities to get a single piece of artifact and crushing Kings palace defenses in 5 years of time loop, while Harry doesn't defeat a single dude in combat in 15 lives of 80+ years.

  Differences in time loop story is are astounding. Like i said it comes down to wish fullfulment, and men in the end wish to be Goku like.

******* That's because of the conceit of the universe in Harry August. He does, however, gain power, as well as kill. There's surprisingly little difference between that and MoL. Both are time looping chess against an adversary doing the same, and information matters a great deal more than casual murder.

** (While not relevant to the central question, throwing out the line of thought that while overwhelming odds brining Deus Ex Machina is frustrating, and overwhelming odds bringing use of a remembered power that should have been already known about and used even more so--actually, this sentence is getting too long.)

​

As I think of three examples of what I want to bring to mind, I realise to some dismay that they also count as 'suddenly using a power that a normal person couldn't use'. Specifically: Arachnid manga, Prisma Illya anime, Zerozaki Soushiki no Ningen Shiken manga (and presumably light novel too).

​

The part I've enjoyed, and the part I think I would enjoy even without special powers that others couldn't use, is the suggestion that the critical thing is actually something being given up in the person's mental state--ethical constraints especially, but in general self-limiting 'constraints' to do with how one behaves in a social fashion, with self-awareness, when interacting with society. Whether hung up on being 'normal', or for purely practical reasons--

​

I love the moment when a character realises "I'm going to die unless I kill" and drops /everything/ in favour of survival. No thoughts for others (ethical behaviour, 'fighting fair', behaving in an upright fashion that police or teachers or friends or family might approve of later), no thoughts for the persona usually shown for others, no thought for anything at all--except stopping life signs of the threat in front by the fastest, most direct route possible. No hesitation, no buying-time, only an unrelenting onslaught of actions for which the sole consideration is their effectiveness in killing the other.

​

Reading the above paragraph, I'm somewhat concerned that it gives the impression that I'm obsessed with the action of killing itself, whereas my perception is that I'm fairly uninterested in the methods and more interested in that (portrayed) mental state of someone who is driven to the brink and reacts (instead of with only despair or with their thoughts falling into panicked chaos) by discarding everything they're used to that's holding them back and narrowing their focus to a single line of driven ruthlessness.

Really?

Do you have any numbers for this? Or could it be that this is a bias, in that you assume that people whose gender you don't know are male?

(I am genuinely interested in this, as I do not know the gender of most people here but would think that while a _majority_ is male, it isn't so much as to warrant the phrase "almost exclusively".)

** Some jears ago, I got the impression, that with inexperienced/uncreativ/bad writers I can tell the gender, because they reproduce a lot of stereotypes unreflected, while the works of experienced authors contain much more nuances and variations.

That said: It seams to me my library contains a lot of male authors:

Lem, Strugatzki, Martin, Brin, Pratchett, Noon, Gaiman, Tolkien, Moers... and then Yudovsky, DaystarEld, Velorien, cthulhuraejepsen, D. D. Webb, Exterminatus, Wildbow

Well, I need some more datapoints :-)

Poor language skills? Perhaps, but that's hardly a deal-breaker. I prefer that they offered this, accidentally offensive, than to continue thinking about it without external confirmation.
