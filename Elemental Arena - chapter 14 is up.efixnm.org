[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/438273/chapter-fourteen-sidequest][Another fine chapter]] from [[/u/Gilgilad7]]!

The Elemental Arena is a litRPG story with characters struggling to survive and optimize themselves and their actions in a game-based environment created by an ultra-advanced intelligence. The elemental theme is Eastern rather than Greek.


** I'm not a fan how the mc is sexualizing the female protaginists so much every chapter. All cliche harems start out this way and I am getting ptsd. Sure it adds into the "romance" story, but I feel that there is no depth to it. It actually takes away from the whole apocalyptic death game scenario. I feel people should be more tense and grimdark rather than flirty.

*** I get where you're coming from. Though I'm not expected a harem at all, mostly considering that the MC seems extreme undesirable to all the women shown. I'm not super into the amount of flirtation on both sides from MULTIPLE characters, but I'm going to give it more time to see if the execution goes well.

I'm not as opposed to the MC sexualizing the female characters as long as it remains in-character and doesn't become more like something out of [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]]. The Male Gaze exists and its how a massive amount of men perceive their interactions with women, but I hope it doesn't go to extremes.

I'm not super familiar with the grimdark genre. Would you have any grimdark fiction you'd recommend? Bonus points if its Rational!

*** Thanks for the feedback. I will admit that romance may not be my strongest suite as a writer, so this kind of feedback can be helpful. I'm not afraid to edit or adjust something either if it will improve the story so feel free to give opinions, even critical. :)

Firstly, there will not be a harem trope or anything resembling it. There will be some romantic complications though. I actually added more romantic tension in my second draft, because it didn't feel realistic enough without. A bunch of random fit people surviving horrors together, it's only natural that they will want some way to feel normal or distract themselves, whether it is superficial or not. Most often it's superficial.

Many of the awkward moments Nathan has with the female players is to highlight the lack of resources they have, clothing specifically. It's something we take for granted, but clothing is on the bottom level of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs along with food, shelter, etc. The fact he is awkward about it is more to characterize him as a gentlemen, as opposed to someone who is ogling all the girls. Notice not a single female player's breasts or butts have been given a physical description once in the story, even though we are seeing everything from Nathan's point of view.

**** Hey. I appreciate that you took the time to respond to one of your critics. However, I'm not sure how to feel about the Information you just revealed. I think parts of it could certainly be considered spoilers.

***** Thanks, I just spoiler-ed the relevant parts. I apologize if I ruined something. Was kind of sleepy in bed when I typed it and didn't think about that. Haven't learned when to say something or to stay silent yet, but figuring it out.

Edit: decided just to remove the spoilers entirely. Sorry again.

****** I hope I didn't harm your mood by commenting.

Truthfully, there's evidence that spoilers can enhance one's enjoyment of a work. However, most people have a mindset that they can only really enjoy something without spoilers.

I'm not in the latter category. However, that latter category is the majority of people (at least in the western world). I personally just wanted to say something so that someone more sensitive to spoilers wouldn't feel discouraged to keep reading.

For future reference, if you're comfortable with advice from someone who isnt currently writing rational fiction, it may be good to not speak about plot-important or character-important aspects of the story which haven't already been shown or that you, at some point, intend to include.\\
For example: in WtC (no spoilers), there is a character that owns a cheese factory. The fact that the character owns a factory does not appear in the plot. It was simply stated by the author that they did and it was a location the author decided not to use for [SPOILER].

I HOPE I made sense and that mu example felt reasonable. I'm really enjoying your story and am excited each Wednesday to read more. I can tell you're enjoying the process, which I'm glad to hear

*** Constructive criticism is not only fair, it's to be expected here. Still, "getting ptsd" is pretty hyperbolic. This sort of comment looks more likely to sap the author's enthusiasm than to help improve the story.

**** Don't be discouraged, I have a huge personal bias and my opinion should be taken lightheartedly. I am a refugee from [[/r/litrpg]] and let me tell you man the most idolized and recommended works I have seen there will give the most battle hardened ratfic reader PTSD. They glorify OP MCs with illogical progression, harems filled with damsels from around the world, and a shiny road of world building ridden with plot holes upon plot holes. The end destination of said road is where the MC power creeps themselves to godhood and proceeds to solve the mystery of "The System."

Your fic is a cut above the rest and the quality does not compare from the absolute filth that comes from [[/r/litrpg]]. My only critism is that the story should lean toward an apocalyptic nature emphasizing survivaI at all costs(the human race kind of depends on it). Cynicalism and Anti-heroes is what we need. It should shy away from petty high school drama where the MC has to micro manage every character to keep them cohesive. I am really enjoying it and no matter what direction it goes, I eagerly wait for every chapter.

***** Just to clarify, [[/u/Gilgilad7]] is the author. I'm another reader, and a bit of a fan.

I find poorly-executed sexuality pretty cringe-y as well, by the way. The chapter 14 bra scene wasn't particularly bad by my view. Iliya isn't coming on to Nathan. She's playing with him because she finds Nathan's awkwardness uproariously funny. This is very consistent with her outlook from previous chapters since her introduction.

If all their interactions follow this formula, of course it will be problematic.

Antiheroes aren't normally my thing, but they can be if done with good motivation and a large measure of wit. A Practical Guide to Evil is a great example of this.

** [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Character][The wiki]] is coming along well. *Middle Twin*, a wiki wizard, added skill blocks which neatly summarize skills in a format similar to game powers.

** The low-tier skills available to the players seem to be about halfway known.

- /Tough Skin/, /Strong Body/ and /Expansive Mind/ work on similar principles.

- /Improved Heart/ and /Improved Lungs/ seem likewise very similar.

- /Earth Shield/ and /Water Shield/ look very similar.

- /Blunt Weapons/ and /Pole Weapons/ are similar skills from differing elements.

It will be interesting to see if skills fall into two exclusive categories - those randomly rewarded, and those unlocked by player actions. Maya's prior inability to learn /Wilderness Survival/ hints that this may be the case.

I strongly suspect the players will get a NP bonus for initiating the dungeon. The Guthrak Chieftain will probably drop something interesting - hopefully his machete for Iliya to use.

*** Like a lot of RPGs, the several of the skills seem to be re-flavorings of one another (Earth Shield & Fire Shield, etc). From both a mechanical and practical standpoint, it makes sends that we'd see different variations. Fire Shield, Metal Shield, & Wood Shield are extremely likely to exist.

Blunt Weapons & Pole Weapons existing already clarifies the existence of different weapon Skills. Since the machete was (seemingly) dropped, I expect the "Edged Weapons" Skill to show its Metal-element face. I am of course only conjecturing since I don't have the the answer.

Tough Skin & the other non-elemental Physical/Mental Skills seem like the building blocks for making characters truly superhuman. In particular, the 35% increase in strength from Strong Body could be absolute essential for any Melee combatant. Assuming the term strength is specifically referring to muscular explosiveness, her 1-hit damage potential sounds ludicrous. for the purposes of combat. Combine that with a weapons skill, and she's the best physical fighter in the group.

(WARNING: Tangent up ahead)

Speaking of Physical, Lilly having a base 131 Physical sounds like something Nathan would have noticed when first meeting her. The lack of comment could be because of the fact that Physical is simply an average of physical scores and not simply muscle mass/strength. For example: Lily may have a super high Physical, but her average is skewed by an extremely high Dexterity/Agility/Coordination/etc. (Similar to how Kean's Mental-Score skewed him into being a candidate, but within the Physical-Score itself). This could also explain how fucking Asahi, a (seemingly) active-duty military officer has 5-points lower starting Physical than Lily.

Now that I think about it, The composite Physical & Mental Scores, as far as we know aren't taking the average of each aspect of Physical/Mental

Physical, as stated from chapter 2:

/[The Physical attribute statistic is a numerical assessment of the player's average physical abilities.  The Physical stat encompasses traits such as strength, speed, stamina, hardiness, reflexes, flexibility, constitution, etc.]/

What i'm getting at is that, just like Lily may have had her average skewed, others may have as well. Nathan, iirc, was a track runner and went on frequent hiking and camping trips. His "stamina" and "speed" ability may be above average for the group but he may very well be lacking in reflexes, flexibility, or even strength.

This concept also makes Asahi even more valuable. As a military man (I'm using my knowledge of U.S. Marine Core training to make a conjecture about Japanese military training, so take this with a bowl of salt), he likely has above average Strength, Stamina, Hardiness, Reflexes, & Constitution compared to the rest.

​

- /[The Mental attribute statistic is a numerical assessment of the player's average mental abilities.  The Mental stat encompasses traits such as raw intelligence, creative problem solving, pattern recognition, stress management, willpower, mental health, etc.]/

This attribute is a bit more abstract, but definitely no less important. High Intelligence could very much get someone included in the arena despite them lacking in mental health, willpower, or stress management.

I think I had a stronger point to make, but it's about midnight for me and I think I should quit while I'm ahead.

Enjoyed the chapter. Hope to read more. Hope to join the the discussions.

**** The guthark tribesmen were Wood Primes and used /Pole Weapons I/ skill. It looks like the guthark chieftain is using the edged weapon skill. Since it was also augmenting its attack with elemental Fire, it's almost certainly a Fire Prime - implying that edged weapon skill is Fire-based.

The Physical stat and some of the passive skills seem counter-intuitive to me at times. A very strong character would come in with a high Physical score. Someone else with a lower score and /Strong Body II/ could, in fact, be physically superior to the original character in every way. Fridge logic would suggest that there are ways to prevent passive skills from working, perhaps via debuff.

Asahi has a remarkably good base Physical stat - for a 50-year-old man. A younger man, or extremely physically fit woman with military training would probably score better.
