A Certain Magical Index and A Certain Scientific Railgun are both /almost/ rational as they are. I wonder if anyone has taken the final steps?


** There was an attempt at a more rational rewrite of Index ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam][In Memorium]]), but it died of neglect.

What's there is a good read, though.

*** That's really good, I just started reading and I'm hooked, too bad the last update was at least 2 years ago, I'm not really looking forward to get to the last published chapter

**** I think the author wrote himself into a corner and didn't know how to predict or incorporate the AIM burst into a meaningful story.

I'd be a bit stumped too, to be honest.

*** Interesting. The first chapter was funny, the third onwards were not particularly moving (though I was disconcerted that Misaka was about two years older while Index was the same age) (though the events were different, they didn't strike me as that distanced from the sorts of events that regularly happened in the original), and the second chapter was awesome to the point where I find myself wanting to see a J.C.Staff anime adaptation of it.

Reflecting on my own motivations, I can separate this into 'I enjoyed a lot the anime battle scene where Index goes up against a golem (with the 'jellyfish' song background music)' and 'I really want to see that camouflaged plainclothes Index (doing things effectively--see golem point (the different mobile church approach was also nice))'.

** Raildex "scientists" are, regrettably, beyond salvasion. They don't follow any kind of scientific method other than "prod it with a stick". Mages are a lot more scientific, ffs. And it kinda makes sence, since Academy City is ultimately ruled by one of the strongest mages in the world.

I think it'll take a full rewrite on the science side to turn Raildex into rational fic. The characters are good, at least, and magic too.

*** The science side isn't populated by scientists, it is rather filled with people who are angry that magic breaks physics and hence want to eliminate it. That's my headcanon at least.

*** (In a way, Kihara science reminds me of (Heterodyne-like?) steampunk, in terms of 'throw enough gears/tech at something' -> '???' -> 'Physical laws bend down and grovel'.)

More generally, an emerging pattern for Kazuma Kamachi works (at least the later volumes?) is 'Strange thing are happening!' -> 'What if those strange things are caused by /this specific far-fetched hypothesis pulled out of nowhere!?/' -> 'The hypothesis was absolutely right!', or else -> 'Oh no, it wasn't that hypothesis after all! That means it's probably this other, even-more-far-fetched hypothesis also pulled out of nowhere!' -> 'The hypothesis was absolutely right!'.

--Ah, and for Index I feel compelled to report my initial impression of 'for rational!Index, Accelerator would have rendered Kamijou incapable of standing with ease'. Then again, rational!Kamijou might try a more effective method of interacting with rational!Accelerator than trying to punch him.

Hmmm. Thinking about the overall matter, what I find I'd really like to see out of a rational Index fiction is to really get inside the head/software of Aleister, and actually see his grand self-correcting plans in detail while still being believable to the reader. This would also lend poignancy to those parts where he or others are showing emotion about his plans, since we could see /why/ he felt he had to or that he wanted to do those things, rather than have it all be vague hand-waving. Difficult, however, as I'm not convinced there's a coherent narrative that can believably explain the events Kamijou goes through (as serving a purpose for deliberate manipulations, even if separating intended and unintended phenomena) other than 'because reasons'.

** Sadly not. Pity, since the world building is incredible, so most of the work is already done.
