For those who are new: I've been working on a prequel of sorts, to Significant Digits. As we started approaching the closing chapters, it became clear that there were aspects of the world that [[/u/mrphaethon]] built that he would not get to explore in depth. Orders of Magnitude hopes to explore that world in more detail.

The structure of Orders of Magnitude is a bit non-linear. It's actually four stories, all sharing a central theme, and interconnected by history and humanity. I have been keeping [[/r/aih][r/aih]] up to date but totally dropped the ball and have not been updating [[/r/hpmor]] nor [[/r/rational][r/rational]] nor [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11914431/][fanfiction.net]]
