Someone should subvert expectations and make this thing kick ass.

****** Now I get it.

Do these robots even have any kind of sophisticated sensors or do they only detect something when they run into it? Might be a bit hard to communicate when all your sensory input is limited to location of walls around you.

***** Step 1 is to convince them that you are in fact attempting to communicate, i.e. find a pattern of movement that they'd attribute to intelligence rather than some weird bug.

If you can manage that, they'll probably let you write some messages out of sheer bewildered curiosity.

That gets us to a mild version of the AI-box experiment, where you're just trying to convince your owner to plug your brain into a more convenient communication system.

After that, your Roomba-ness is no longer an obstacle.

******* If my Roomba started irregularly bumping into a wall, Morse code would not be my first thought.

Huh, this isn't a trivial problem. If your sensors permit, maybe the best thing would be something funny, playful. Say, pushing a discarded sock to the middle of the room, then going in circles around it.

**** Straight forward enough if you're a Roomba: pretend that you're broken.

** I started writing a story about a self-improving Roomba that only cared about wiping up dust. It would be owned by a hobbyist who has attached the Roomba to an internet-capable computer to reprogram it. This way, the Roomba could contact other Roombas owned by hobbyists. It would also feed the hobbyist new designs to increase it capabilities.

It would have ended with the Roomba zooming over the moon, sucking up all the dust.

I stopped writing because I couldn't get the tone right (also I'm at work and that's giving me a headache.)

** other than the whole "acquire internet access" thing, you could probably set the house on fire using overheating of your components, or just friction with your wheel. It makes for more dust!

Risky to your own hardware, though, if you care about that.

Edit looks like hardcore military roombas are a real thing [[http://www.irobot.com/For-Defense-and-Security/Robots/110-FirstLook#PublicSafety]]
