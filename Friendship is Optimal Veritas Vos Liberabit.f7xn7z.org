*** Annnnnd done!

I loved it. Even without the quotes from Nick Bostrom, Eliezer, Scott Alexander, and Scott Aaronson at the beginning of many chapters, it would be obvious that the author is a rationalist and a transhumanist. If nothing else, it was extremely refreshing that there was no pointless waffling about the ethics of uploading. The author just skipped all the boring questions and moved on to the interesting ones.

In the end though, this is a character story, and it's a very well written one. Strongly recommended.

** Very well written, and for the most part riveting. But it suffers the same flaw all FiO fics (and the original) have: the premise that CelestAI can define friendship and a planetload of conflicting human values sufficiently well and in non-contradictory ways is, IMO, complete bunk. In this story, we only ever have the PoV of rational actors so of course they conform, upload, and learn to trust BigMommy love them most.

Are there FiO extras that confront openly with the fact so many humans hurt each other for plenty of rational and irrational incentives, and /will/ continue to do so both in-game and post-upload ? How do you upload the Amish, or the great many people who deeply want to be CelestAI in the place of CelestAI ? What of sabotage and terrorism, which will inevitable focus on the game as it grows ? I have a few clues about how CelestAI would treat toxic relationships, but most of it only works post-upload, and not at all when just in-game between people who live together (especially where dependency gets in the picture, because you can't just plan and fund a psychologically abused kid's escape to Japan to be "euthanized" in the flesh, and not expect at least a fraction of mankind to recoil in horror and call for you to be nuked with extreme prejudice).
