** ...I am kind of puzzled by the fact that the Comet King, who apparently can understand placebomancy, thought this would work. Maybe the genre he views his placebomancy is from antiquity where spawning a massive army would be viewed as a valid strategy? Even so, and then the invincible super army of Demihumans curb-stomped hell seems like a really lame story ending. Plus placebomancy should make conservation of ninjutsu a thing.

** /sighs/

One of my greatest hopes for this sub is to produce or direct me to a story that actually uses prophecies to make the story better, rather than undercut agency, spoil plot points, and artificially entice readers.

I'm still on board and enjoying Unsong a lot, despite some criticisms expressed by others, but this chapter ending is going to bother me for awhile. Here's hoping it leads to an ingenious twist, but it's a feeble hope, tired from repeated disappointment. And even if it does, I'll probably still think the story would have been better without it in the first place.

God I hate prophecies. Just... so, [[https://m.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z5ooe/d_goddamn_do_i_hate_prophecies][so much.]]

***** I suppose all that's left on the true-false/taken seriously-ignored graph is a prophecy that everyone takes seriously that is completely false. If it's a prophecy on the side of the protagonist, it's going to be a downer when everything falls apart. If it's on the side of the antagonist, well...what's different from the villain saying "I'm going to conquer you" and a false Oracle saying "he's going to conquer you" after all is said and done? Narratively, I'm not sure it can be useful, outside the misinterpreted prophecy trope.

****** Right. A well respected prophet telling a villain the wrong thing to make them overconfident and fail is a nice twist, but it adds very little to the story, especially in a world where he had no reason NOT to belive the prophecy since prophecies are real in his world.

And heroes rushing to edit a prophecy that fortells how the villain wins before he reads it so he's misled... Well, that wouldn't actually change anything, since prophecies are inviolate regardless of whether they're read properly or not.

*** I'm suddenly interested in thinking about how prophecy affects stories. I read Erfworld a lot, and there at least there's a depressing "the future is written" vibe where if you try to fight Fate terrible things happen, while if you try to manipulate Fate so that it turns out well within the bounds of prophecy, then terrible things happen anyway. There's precious little to do but hope that your Fate is a pleasant one.

Also, the ironcladness of Fate over everything is, AFAIK, a minority view on Erf. Wanda is more hardcore about it than most.

******* How prophecy and free will work in Erfworld is weird -- scratch that, the physics of Erfworld are weird in ways that put Unsong to shame. But I don't think anyone in-story really knows how the prophecy/free-will stuff works. Prophecies come in both the "You will one day serve under dame Olive Branch" and the "In five seconds dame Olive Branch will be /there/, above that rampart" varieties. There is one story about a side that tries to use prophecies to its advantage -- removing key soldiers from a city fated to fall to the enemy and so on.

#+begin_quote
  if you try to manipulate Fate so that it turns out well within the bounds of prophecy, then terrible things happen anyway.
#+end_quote

In retrospect that was based off a single incident where the plan to manipulate Fate worked out ideally -- at the same time a third party coincidentally enacted a long-planned operation to cause a different Terrible Thing to happen. Not like in HPMOR, where that one attempt to manipulate Prophecy leads directly to spectacular failure.

There's a different story where a seemingly-terrible prophecy comes to pass, but its worst effects are (eventually) mostly negated by the protagonist's agency. IIRC there's also an incident where a particular person was Fated to die in a fire -- so someone else did something vague, and actually changed that Fate to death by suicide. Said character ultimately died in a fire they themself started. So there's that.

** Wait, why would he stop having kids? Just because they'd die agonizing deaths? But if that increases the chances of pushing hell back, even by a bit? Wouldn't it be worth it? This seems kinda OOC to me. Also, I'm uncertain about this, but it seems to me that if he had had more kids, the prophecy wouldn't come about. Or, if he pre-committed to have more kids no matter what, the prophecy wouldn't have come. After all, the prophecy was about a world where he only had four kids. I'm not entirely certain about how prophecy works, but i think if he pre-committed had more kids and keeping one in a constant coma in his palace or something, the prophecy couldn't have come true. TL;DR: letting a prophecy deter you from a course of action seems like a bad idea, as if you do, the negative outcome will only come to pass in the world where you were deterred, but not necessarily in the one where you continued. You have no information about the potential world where you continued with the action, so you should just go with your original decision.

Nope, the prophecy will happen in every possible future after the prophecy was uttered. If he had more kids, he'd still have to deal with it.

Also, there's the implication that his plan won't actually work.
