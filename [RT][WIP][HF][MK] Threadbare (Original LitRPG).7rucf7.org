** For me, Threadbare was most enjoyable when it wasn't trying to be much more than a fun, unique take on the litrpg genre that didn't take itself overly seriously and focused on its protagonist.

As soon as the author started changing the tone a little, prioritising plot more and adding in side characters left right and centre, it exposed the quality of the writing a lot more. When i'm reading a story that's aim is to be fun and not take itself too seriously then i'm a lot more lax in how critical i am of character motivation, competence, realism etc. but as soon as that tone starts to shift i feel the standard i hold the story up to starts to shift with it. And Threadbare hasn't really met that standard for me.

Ceclia and Fluffbear are the only side characters i have any real attachment too, I don't particularly care about Cylvania or its citizens, i dont believe many of the characters have strong motivations or more than the smallest amount of depth and i don't find the plot particularly engrossing. None of this is overly surprising when the author is pumping out 5k words a day but if you're going to pump out 5k words a day in effort of a story with a large character list and a 'serious' plot with 'serious' consequences then, well, good luck.

**** You are very kind to say the writing quality being not jaw dropping. I read this in RoyalRoadl and the transition from fun adventure in a cave into high-stake combat involving side character newly introduced is a nose dive, imo. To expand; POV keep changing, priority getting reshuffled again and again without strong cause, with just slightest clue about what's actually happening. It was confusing. After finding such confusing style persists for several chapters, I just did not have the will to go on.

Actually, that stage will become much more readable if author spare some chapters early on to show readers who the characters are, what's their motives, how they react in tense situation. What I've read, author only describe them. That only enough for relaxing type of adventure.

*** The world does have consistent overarching rules. (Well, in the recent past those rules have changed, but that's a big plot point.) That the characters are unlocking new skills and abilities isn't inconsistent with the worldbuilding at all - if entirely new ways of gaining skills were suddenly introduced, that might be an issue, but that the characters don't have access to all information and powers from the start doesn't break that rule.

I also don't think the plot is pulling new skills out to "save" the characters. In the beginning this was arguably the case, because starting from nothing meant that whatever they gained in the short term (when levels are easier to gain) would be used to solve the immediate issues relating to "not dying". Later on though, the characters develop skills much more slowly - where skills are needed to overcome a specific issue, the characters clearly work towards unlocking said skills, rather than them dropping from heaven into their hands. That's just making use of the existing system that they're aware of.

I appreciate this genre (where discrete new abilities appear as characters progress) does often fail as you've described, but I don't think it's happening here.

[[/u/Flashbunny]] agreed about the characters getting skills they need in the beginning of the story and [[/u/LordGoldenroot]] agreed that a character got a skill that might have been crucial in one of the latest chapters. So I think we have a consensus that while this story may not break that rule as bad as something like yu gi oh, it does dabble in deus ex machina periodically (though infrequently) and I'd therefore think it's not really [rt].

I haven't read all of Threadbare, but this does not strike me as inherently irrational -- changing rules and paradigms are a natural part of how the real world operates.

For example, in the early part of the middle ages, one of the "rules" of conventional warfare was that stone castle walls were an impregnable barrier, and most methods of assaulting a castle consisted of trying to surround it and cut it off from outside resources and trying to indirectly attack the castle's occupants with hunger, disease, and thirst rather than trying to actually penetrate the stone walls.

Then humanity unlocked the "cannon" skill and the rules changed.

Whether rule changes "makes sense" is mostly related to how closely these rules can be tied back to first principles. For example, we can treat "gravity" is a first principle (or about as close as you can get to it), while "it's impossible for a human to vertically jump 3 meters" is not. If tomorrow we discovered a human who had a vertical jump of 3 meters, it would defy a lot of assumptions, and break a lot of ideas that athletic coaches have probably been enshrined as "rules" about what the human body is capable of, but it wouldn't fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe.

I'd argue that depends on how the jump was accomplished. If it was done because there was faster than light communication between the jumper's nerves and muscles, that's pretty major. Same if it was done because energy was created out of nothing to give lift and same if during the jump the jumper's bones magically withstood the pressure despite material physics dictating that they should break.

If the jump is within the range of possibility provided by human biology and it happened because of training, etc. then sure it wouldn't mean much for the world of academia.

******** I don't think healing is as big a departure from the laws of nature as something like teleportation is. Healing in golems in particular seems to be pretty straightforward because they're just cloth and stuffing so the stuffing can repair its host by just dividing until it finishes filling its container like mold or bacteria and then the cloth can repair itself like skin in humans. Healing in humans and animals can be explained by some factor that reduces the odds of cancer since AFAIK the biggest hurdle to rapid healing in animals in nature is cancer resulting from cell division that is too rapid to correct for genetic mistakes.

There's nothing in nature that can suggest any method for teleportation to be possible, that's why I think once that's introduced physics go out of the window.

(For what it's worth, the "healing" thing bothers my intuitions less too. My sense is that "(living) objects change over time" is fairly natural, while things having to move through space at a finite speed is an object permanence thing, or something innate in the way I run my visio-spatial sketchpad.)

That said, we've been pretty sure that the world of Threadbare doesn't run on physics for a /long/ time. [[#s][spoilers]]

*********** It's possible that we have different definitions of "fast" here. I'm expecting "heal" to cure a stab wound in less than 6 seconds. (1D6/round or so, right?)

1) Normal healing is a metabolically expensive process. It takes a lot of calories to do, and generates a lot of waste heat. Where's the heat go? (First law of thermodynamics)

2) There was loss of blood and perhaps other tissues. These need to be replaced. Where's the mass come from? (Conservation of mass)

3) Cells depend on enzymically catalyzed chemical reactions to do things like heal - reactions which often only don't go faster because the enzymes are working full time - "rate limited by availability of enzymes". Healing magic would either have to provide this cellular machinery (not enough room to put it), change the laws of chemistry (requires changes to how quantum mechanics works), or change how fast time goes (yikes).

Same place the mass comes from in any other healing, the nutrients broken down from previously ingested food/fats.

************* Eh, Ok, actually doing the calculations for relatively minor healing (the 10g of muscle required to close the stab wound - that number pulled from thin air) shows that it only requires about 9000J of energy to be dissipated. While this would boil the effected tissue twice over if done instantly, it could probably wouldn't cook anything if it happened over a couple minutes.

Over a couple minute time frame, you can probably scavenge the required protein from the blood, though you'll be essentially loosing a small quantity (~1/3 pint) and replacing it with saline. You almost certainly need new blood vessels to form to feed the rapidly growing tissue, but that's no big deal, I suppose.

I'm pretty sure you still need the literal "exotic magical nanoassembly" function of the exogenous enzymes, but you /might/ still be in the same genre.

************** I'm not sure where you're getting the "boiling twice over" part.

9 kJ is 2151 calories, which is enough to raise body-temperature water (probably not too far off) to boiling point, and then convert it into steam approximately 0.4 times. You'd suffer severe local burns, but it wouldn't be boiling the tissue.

As for the general argument, I'm not convinced you couldn't get around that. For example, by storing reservoirs of these building blocks/enzymes/more efficient enzymes throughout the body, paired with more nutrient flow in the blood than typical, with damage triggering a local release. This would especially be the case if the healing process was prioritized. For example, stop bleeding fast, rebuild a basic "scaffold" within a seconds/a minute, and then fully regenerate the tissue and restore functionality between minutes to maybe an hour.

I mean, we're talking about non-real world fiction, so there's already a certain level of suspension of disbelief involved.

*************** Earlier, and below, I am assuming the energy consumption during healing occurs only in the tissues being healed:

2000calories / 10 grams = 200 c/g = Δ200°C

200°C is twice the boiling point of water, so "boil it twice over". If we wish to be pedantic, we may note that, of course, the liquid can't reach 200°C - it boils first, so instead:

10g water @ 40°C + 200c/g → 7.5g water @ 100°C + 2.5g steam @ 100°C

Depending on the speed of the healing, this steam either: Doesn't exist, because the healing is slow enough that conduction ensures that the tissues never get that hot; escapes slowly, cooking the adjacent tissues in the wound; violently blows the healed tissue apart, as 1 cm³ rapidly tries to occupy 2000 cm³.

The above of course entails making a silly assumption that these enzymatic processes continue, regardless of the temperature of the place that they are occurring - but that's half the point. Steam is hot; if the tissue gets hot enough to boil, things like "replace the damaged proteins with intact ones" become impossible, as the new ones are immediately denatured (cooked; destroyed) by the heat. (And it should be noted that conventional enzymes are proteins, BTW.)

(BTW, I like how you kept three/four digits on my calculations. Let's just say that my sources were of the ±10% nature, and that only got worse during the three steps of mental math involved...)

Anyways, yes, if you wish to modify the body in advance if the insult, more options open up. My own opinion is that, at that point, you might as well just replace the flesh with magical steel, but to each his own...

I disagree. Replacing the flesh with magical steel is entirely less believable than having an organic system that is designed/has developed to facilitate rapid regeneration.
