*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the biweekly challenge, post recommendations, questions, thoughts, etc. below.*

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality][Black and White morality]] is generally a trope that is avoided in rational fiction. From the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

As such, I imagine that people will tend to go towards subversions or inversions of the premise, which is completely fine. I do generally enjoy stories that lead from the concept of good and evil toward a moral quagmire, especially if the protagonists are under the impression that they are Good and the enemy is Evil.

However, I think there's a place for pure evil and pure good in rational fiction. [[http://unsongbook.com/][/Unsong/]] describes evil at one point as "your utility function multiplied by negative one", which I think is a very interesting way of looking at evil, though it still leaves some ambiguity. For a normal story (in other words, not /Unsong/) you then get most of your mileage out of good fighting against evil in a rational way that lends itself to analysis on the part of the reader.


** I love how conflicts are handled in Witcher short stories. There are a dozen or so short stories, are based heavily on conflicts between strong characters, where nobody was "good" or "bad", but everybody has different interests and different ways to achieve their goals (mostly because of their character and social position). The result was chaos and conflicts (usually solved by Geralt with sword and philosophy ;) ).

Saga has much less of that, but the short stories collections (Last Wish, and Sword of Destiny) are highly recommended. I especially liked "The Lesser Evil" short story. It's not exactly rational fiction (magic has very few consistent rules, and there is a concept of "destiny"), but the handling of morality, conflict, and decisions made with imperfect knowledge is very good. Almost all characters are rational (given their knowledge and beliefs) and practical.

Because you can actually define scientific can't you? If he says that he is scientific I would say what is scientific, which is clearly following the Scientific Method. If he thinks he follows that then clearly we're debating what counts as "following" not what counts as "unscientific".

How do you expand on evil?

If you want to define evil as causing suffering, the utilitarians in the world are going to disagree with you. Sadists and masochists will disagree, etc. Evil is morally bad, and that's completely subjective.

In this thread alone there are like fifty definitions.

*** are you describing an evil utility function, or a utility function that considers the utility of people to vary very widely by arbitrary characteristics with no clear underlying rules for why it does it that way? I would argue that this is not a case of someone's utility function itself being evil, just someone who's relying on wrong epistemic methods like "because this is what my parents taught me to believe", combined with scope-insensitivity bias. I find it highly unlikely that someone would want to get rid of all jews or gays or whatever as their /terminal/ values. These clearly seem like surface phenomena, rather than the underlying rules that decide what a person wants or likes or cares about. They probably are outputs that fall out of a combination of utility function and mistaken beliefs. I read somewhere that people who commit genocide pretty much always believe themselves to be the victims. Unless you think that most or all germans who lived in or fought for germany during world war II were evil. And that's a heck of a lot of germans.

Since the claim is that there is no such thing as evil, I only need to believe that /at least one/ German in World War II was evil.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It's easy to rephrase terminal values as non-terminal values and vice versa in such a way that it's hard to tell them apart, making this unfalsifiable. Someone who has a terminal value of getting rid of X, for instance, could also be described as having a terminal value of getting rid of undesirables, and falsely believing that X are undesirables.

Furthermore, I said that there are beliefs and values which are evil. I don't see how pointing to an evil belief rather than an evil value contradicts that--I said both beliefs and values!

** I don't think anyone in real life actually has a utility function inverted from anyone else's. But I do think there is real evil in the world. I wouldn't describe evil as an alignment, though, but rather a misalignment. It's a failure condition in forming an intelligence, analogous to failures to make a friendly AI. I think there is a single friendly utility function derivable from first principles, and that evil is a product of our failure to get to that good. (Compare and contrast learning disorders, where the effective route to getting things done fails to come together, rather than the proper goal failing to come together.)

In short, evil is a failure of intelligence to assemble good.

Reifying the concept of an inverted utility function would be a bit like trying to create a systemic definition of Opposite Day. If /you/ have a hierarchy of instrumental goals that derive harmoniously from your terminal goals, you'd think the "anti-you" would have "anti-instrumental" goals that /oppose/ their goals (i.e. an inversely-proportionate amount of akrasia to your own.) If /you/ want to live to continue optimizing, you'd think your dual would want to die as soon as possible. Etc. It seems like a "naively inverted" utility function would necessarily be an /incoherent/ utility function.

(Which is too bad, because otherwise it'd be a pretty cool and simple way to procedurally-generate the villain in a create-your-own-character RPG.)

**** Neah, systemizing an inverted utility function is pretty easy. Just sort all outcomes from most-favored to least-favored. The entity with a utility function opposite yours has the same list, but backwards.

Of course no such entity exists, but it's a conceivable entity with simple properties.

**** You have to resolve pronouns like "you" and "him" to invert utility function.

Opposite utility function to "I want to have all the money in the world and don't care about anything else" isn't "I want not to have all the money in the world, and don't care about anything else", it's "I want Smith not to have all the money in the world and I don't care about anything else".

So in fact 2 people that want to hoard all the money in the world have almost exactly opposite utility functions.

***** Oh, sure, a utility function opposite to one particular person's exact current set of goals could be set up this way and work. You don't even need to extract and define the referent's utility function first for this; you can just evaluate your choices by how unhappy they would make your referent.

I was picturing something a bit different: a person who is an adaptation-executer for the exact opposite set of adaptations that would result in the original person. So, instead of "coming from a world" where eating food was a good and necessary thing to do (because inclusive genetic fitness), they would "come from a world" where eating food was a horrible idea. The inclusive-genetic-fitness calculation would be the thing being multiplied by -1: the more helpful a trait was in our world, the /harder/ it would be for it to achieve fixation in the design simulation.

In other words, this wouldn't be a creature created to /best thwart/ the goals of person X, but rather a creature created to be /as ineffective as possible/ at satisfying the goals of person X. The creature a resentful mad scientist would build to get back at their boss if asked to design person X. A person X that is so bad at being person X that they are worse than a pile of random garbage, or an empty room, at satisfying person X's goals.

Being really bad at being person X, and terminally valuing anything that thwarts person X, probably look the same if you make them into person X's nemesis. I feel like they're different things, though, if the point is for the invert to serve as person X's employee/avatar/go-between in some situation. A genie that is explicitly against its master is at least /predictable/ in some sense. An almightily incompetent genie, on the other hand...

I don't think that follows. Thamiel has instrumental goals that derive harmoniously from his goal of maximising human suffering.

Their instrumental goals are largely the same. As are those of any entity, regardless of utility function.

This perception of evil frames it as an internal struggle against your own faults, as well as humanity's struggle to overcome the faults we realize exist in our world.

Is it tho?

I don't think thats all that true in that story; "evil" in the story is brought into the world by god's left hand, while god's right hand does nothing; and there is alot of mention about god's hands

On the right hand you have someone extermely powerful but useless, a city high on lsd that all about happiness but that people avoid and in general "holyness" without action and when you move away form the "pure" you find incompetence, the angels are retarded in almost every respect, the most most competent of them all is severely autistic and forgot to give humans all the holy books including the one that would clear up which storys are literal or metaphors

On the left you have T who lies alot and has reportedly done terrible things on the other side of the world in a world where tv don't work(hmmmm, maybe russia in the 80's fall apart due to communism not to hell) a "hell"(that again is only reported on by a known lier) and who in a(only?) direct interaction with a main character asked to be killed and "demons" who haven't really showed up in the story

I think the story is going to get about how its hard to be a "cantor and a singer"(each one being a "hand" of god) but you really /really/ need both

** I think that evil and good are nonsense (perhaps overly harsh) concepts, basically like arguing over whether or not there is beauty and ugliness or trying to say that something is attractive. Everyone will have an opinion over what is evil and what is beautiful, but no one agrees.

As such I'm sure that people looking at WW2 would go oh, this story is dumb Hitler is clearly super evil, and Hitler would look at the story and go, how can anyone let those Jews walk free, the Allies are so evil.

Equally I'll look at a sheep and not find it beautiful or attractive but if you're from Wales or Aberdeen then it's totally different.

Amusingly Unsong's definition for example, let's say there's an Evil RMcD, so their utility is -1, now Unsong defines evil as YOUR utility *-1, so evil RMcD reads that sentence, and look at that normal RMcD is now the evil one.
