[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53w0yx/biweekly_challenge_memory_modification/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Memory Modification". The winner was [[/u/eniteris]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53w0yx/biweekly_challenge_memory_modification/d7x2ufs][We Have Always Been At War]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/eniteris]] on your third win!

** This Time

   :END:
This time the challenge will be *Elves*. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter][See the TVTropes page here]], but as always the prompts are to inspire, not to limit, so pick whichever elves you'd like to do your own take on. Reading recommendations include /The Nightmare Stacks/ by Charles Stross and /Lords and Ladies/ by Terry Pratchett, but obviously the ur example of elves is /The Lord of the Rings/ by J.R.R. Tolkien. If you're looking for things to rationalize, you might want to think about the eleven mindset, the types of societies that would form is people lived for hundreds of years, and cross-species politics. Or write about the Keebler elves, I don't know, I'm not your boss.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, October 19th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be *Androids*. Here I'm using the term to mean "humaniform robots". [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo][TVTropes has this page, which provides a good overview.]] There are a couple of challenges if you want to make these rational, but mostly they have to do with aspects of world-building, which I think are sometimes skippable when writing rational works. This challenge topic is somewhat obviously prompted by the recent premiere of Westworld.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/19.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/562tzl/challenge_companion_elves/][is available here]].

*** That's a very interesting take on Elves, I like it. Rather than adapt or build a civilization to lean on, they just become the ideal Elf with no dependencies on anything but themselves in the end.

**** Just so.

Much credit goes to Nighzmarquls and many others as well as me on the /r/r discord server for hashing out the idea.

** City of Elves

This has an exceptionally unique depiction of the Elvish civilization and biology.

**** Woah! I didn't think anyone would read it. And yes... my grammar / spelling etc is horrible. Thank you for looking that over.

I was not sure about what fonts can be legally published, not that it's a big deal but I try to keep track of that.

The body font is called Lora and is an open source font that is available through Google Fonts. It's a serif font designed to work well both for print and screen.

The heading font is [[http://www.1001fonts.com/dyer-arts-and-crafts-font.html][Dyer Arts and Crafts Font]]... also free for commercial use.

In the rules section of the rpg game, the heading font changes to Ubuntu Condensed, which is also an open-source font.
