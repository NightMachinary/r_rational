I really enjoy the video game plot (e.g. "The Gamer", "The Games We Play", "Naruto:Ramen Days") and have read enough of them that I've having trouble finding new ones. Does anyone have any suggestions that they particularly like?

**** This is actually what got me to ask. I just blitzed the entire story in...24?...48?...very few hours. Really enjoyed it, and was sorry when it ran out.

Out of curiosity, do you have a reader-viewable timeline anywhere? I'm not clear on how long Juniper has been in-world, but I think it's only 2-3 weeks, even counting the downtime week they just had.

***** The erogamer, which is really funny, and takes the implications of the premise shockingly seriously.

Most of the other example of this particular sub genre I have run across have really unlikable pro-tags, as they start behaving like powergamers while surrounded by people, rather than sprites. So, really, worth the candle and erogamer are it for things I will actually recommend

** You listed some top ones already. Off the top of my head I can only think to add:

- I'm a Spider, So What (one of the legendary classics, start with the Blastron01 translation until it runs out, it bogs down after a while so don't feel obliged to keep reading)
- Evil God Average / Jashin Average, got me on the LN kick that led to GirlIntercorrupted
- [[/u/FeepingCreature]] would tell you to read The Erogamer, and I wouldn't dispute it. Tagline: "This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest."

Royalroadl is only updated through Act 1.

Act 2 is a bit of a departure, though it's started getting back to the old feel. WercWercWerc is talking about rewriting it, in a different tone, before posting it to Royalroadl.

** I also second Log Horizon. One of the few anime titles the plot of which doesn't turn into a complete mess by the time it reaches the last several episodes.

There are also some asian webnovels that you ought to check out:

- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/][/Reincarnator/]] --- “has some repeating tropes, but otherwise is well-written. Protag goes back in time to try saving humanity after a meta-verse merging event.” Unfortunately due to some translator scene drama it's temporarily unavailable.

  - [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-king-of-the-battlefield/][/King of the Battlefield/]] --- Except for the fact that it's a bit too similar to Reincarnator, it's a pretty decent read.

- [[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/ti-index/][/Terror Infinity/]] --- ”[...] is a Chinese web serial that is technically a multi-crossover fanfic. The premise of the story is how a random group of people are forced to travel from one horror \ action movie into another and try to survive each one. Among the universes the protag has to travel through are also those from the following franchises (spoilers): Resident Evil, Alien, Final Destination, Nightmare on Elm Street.”
- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/life-mission/][/Life Mission/]] --- A virtual reality game called “Life” suddenly becomes real, transporting players to alternate dimensions (they don't know that at first), making it possible to buy items from game store and bring them into real world, enhance their body, etc. The monsters in the game are “mutants”, and the lore suggests that some virus outbreak turned all people into such mutants. Those who manage to not get infected got killed instead.
- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/][/Evolution Theory of the Hunter/]] --- Dungeons and skillbooks existing in real world; each person can only learn one skillbook.

All of these (except for maybe Log Horizon) have some penalties attached, for them to be called completely rational stories. But from all the currently available LitRPG stories that I've managed to find, these were the only ones that were more or less rational at all.

*** Thank you, that's a lot of recs.

I have had very mixed results with anime, but in this case I'm really looking more for reading than watching. Still, workout distractions are a necessity, so I'll definitely check out Log Horizon.

Reanimator's description sounds really good, so I hope it comes back. I read the first page of KotB and couldn't get past the clumsy translation, but I'm sure it's great in the original.

Evolution Theory of the Hunter has a premise that made me laugh happily. Very Nodwick, which is a good thing. The prologue was well done so I'm definitely going to keep going. Thanks very much.
