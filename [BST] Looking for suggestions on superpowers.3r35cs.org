I've been posting chapters of /The Change Storms: Induction/ here for a while, and the whole story is available for free [[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][on my Patreon]] -- it'll eventually be published, at which point it may be taken down, but I'll give away an archive of it for free before I do.

I'm looking for suggestions on superpowers, because I can always use more.

I have plenty of powers that are based on phlebotinum ("powerful telekinetc, but only with things that are triangular"). More suggestions along these lines are welcome, but I'd really like to get some that are based in physics. I've been asking over on [[/r/askphysics]] -- I asked about "what happens if the speed of light doubles?" (answer: nothing), and "what if the nuclear strong force doubles in strength or becomes repulsive instead of attractant?" (answers: "don't know" and "a sleet of ionizing radiation that kills everything in the area")

Any suggestions?

EDIT: I should have said: I'll credit anyone whose suggestion I use, so please add the name you'd like me to use.


** How about these:

-A person that can convert kinetic energy into thermal energy in a short-ranged field. Bullets become clouds of steam with no net forward motion. Punching him will scald your hand. He can perform incredible feats of impact, fall and damage resistance, but they come at the risk of boiling him alive, so he carries flas-vaporizing bottles of liquid nitrogen to act as heatsinks.

-Quantum dis-entangler/suppressor. Had no real combat effect... but some theories maintain that our consciousness and higher-level thought are linked to quantum properties of our intra-neuron communication. Suppressing someone's entangled neurons can cause them to become 'dumb', as in, they can think, react, feel, but not more than a really well-trained dog. In combat, being unable to react intelligently might cause you to lose. In other scenarios, you'd become much more open to suggestions, lies and misdirection, without feeling any different.

-Some more common examples: slowing down the speed of light. Imagine your opponent having to deal with relativistic effects at walking speed. The edges of their limbs shear off as they try to punch someone. Blood being pumped from the heart is sddenly many times heavier and blood pressure builds up... fun times.

-A magnetic capacitor: A weak-level magnetic manipulator that can't do more than pick up a kilo or so of iron in normal circumstances, but can accumulate 'magnetic energy' over time. In a combat scenario, he can hurl cars and swing lamposts about, but if he runs out of energy, he's back to being weak. For more gun, he has no upper limit.

-An touch-based electron-stripper

-A vibration manipulator that can only create extremely low Hz waves with massive pressure gradients. Basically, slow-moving aerial tsunamis.

And more, if you ask :)

**** -For the magnetic capacitor guy, just make sure you shy away from recreating Electro: someone who can power up by directly connecting himself to an electric current. Maybe our magnetic protagonist wears a copper wire suit that he can hook up to the grid and turn himself into an electromagnet, thus directly feeding himself magnetic energy...

-Why not make this an actual male stripper that was kicked out of his profession for causing electric shocks and burns?

****** That person would have to step into some pretty big shoes...

Two more ideas for today:

-Third eye/Ghost: This person has a 'ghost' they can project from their bodies and control remotely. The ghost can phase through matter and theoretically travel right through the Earth. However, increasing the distance between ghost and user creates a feedback lag, as in, new commands are relayed instantaneously but the execution takes longer and longer to be accomplished. The supervillain uses this mostly for spying and scrying, as more solid interactions, such as manipulating switches, are very exhausting. Why villain? Imagine not knowing whether you're being watched, anywhere in the world.

-'Crowdsource'. A superhero with powers proportional to the size of the crowd they're in. Basically, they skim off a portion of the surrounding people's energy, making them Superman in a bustling city, but a skinny teenager out in the forest.

******** Had two ideas today:

- Status quo: when this guy enters a battle, the macro outcome will be fixed. Whatever you do, the balance of power at any point of the fight will not move. The guy doesn't decide what the balance is, but he can choose whether to use it or not, so rhe onl way to beat this power is through deceit. It can also be used negatively: if you're a villain and you see Status !uo being used, kill a teammate. Enemies will die.

Trigger: can cause anyone to have high fever symptoms and auto*immune attacks, but with no physical intermediate.

Mutiltate: self-harm allows the user to mutate limbs into nightmarish appendages.

Hypnolight: can cause any strong source of light into a powerful hypnotic. Hilarious when used on TV channels. Has never tried using it on the Sun...

** My favorite gotcha along these lines was a Larry Niven story in which the characters discover a time accelerator - time inside the field speeds up by orders of magnitude. Later they find out that the inventor didn't mean it as a time accelerator, he meant it as an inertia-reducing drive for space travel purposes. It wasn't until years later that I thought back to the story and realized the link - I don't think it was ever spelled out in the story.

** Any specific area of physics you would like a focus on?

Either way, I think forms of momentum manipulation are fairly easy to think about while still being fairly interesting. A roleplay i started involves a character that has a field in which they can sap and re-use momentum from objects in that field. Although maybe your not looking for something telekinetic-ish.

I like to use random verbs to think of interesting abilities. Just got the word "Queue", how about some kind of local time manipulation in which you can re-queue events, or something.

**** Hmm, just thought of it off the top of my head so not well defined at all.

perhaps it needs to be activated, then once a certain amount of time has passed, they can re-organize events that happened in the bubble that the effect covers, within the time that the ability was activated. Being able to go and make sure that your friend stepped out of the cover after the bullets were shot, then having your return fire happen before the they ducked back down.

this would need good awareness of when the power could be useful, and maybe good intuition of how things play out after events have been re-organized. probably with a cooldown so they cant just constantly activate it.

Or perhaps its always active for the past 10 seconds or so, and serves a more re-active and defensive purpose.

other things that might need consideration: event awareness, do they need to know that a particular thing has happened to re-queue it. how do people react to having there actions requeued. if the alternate events would have cause different decisions, do those get added to the queue, or is there some other kind of resolution system.

***** Hm. I think this would end up being difficult to manage. Maybe something like time clones?

You play each level four times; each time, your previous playthroughs are repeated alongside your current run so, by the end, there are four of you shooting, but three of them are repeats of what you did before. There's a series of playthroughs on YouTube that were really interesting.

Blowing them up gets you money; white are tougher but worth more. Usually the blocks move, generally in flowing streams but in a couple of cases they've been carefully arranged so that they make a giant spider that walks with realistic leg motion, or something like that.

******* I'm definitely not allowing any sort of open-ended time travel. Something like time clones is very limited.

Although, one of the main characters does have the ability "borrow time from her future self." She chooses an amount of time (e.g., five minutes) and when to borrow it from (e.g. ten minutes from now) gets that much time right now, while the rest of the universe is frozen. When the five minutes ends everything starts up again. Ten minutes from when things start up again, she vanishes from spacetime for five minutes. There are some rules about how she interacts with things while she's in hypertime, but that's the general idea.

And yes, it's a ridiculously powerful ability that has required some very careful handling.

** Perhaps something with warping spacetime. If you warp time, you get crazy gravitational forces, but warping space alone is pretty safe. As long as there's nothing rigid there. He may or may not be able to warp the space to make sure it stays flat anywhere where anything is. They could use it to make a bag of holding (although it won't be any lighter) or wormholes. I would make it so both ends of the wormhole need to be created right next to each other and then he warps space to move them apart.

Although you could still presumably move one end of the portal from the other end, and just keep it so tiny that nobody notices. You could have it so they can't hold a portal that small open for long, so any portals they leave lying around would be clearly visible. And they have to stay next to one end to keep it open, so if they left a portal where they shouldn't, someone could shoot them through it. There's also problems with air pressure. If they try to cross too much vertical distance, there'd be large amounts of wind through the portal. They could fix this by messing around with the time part of spacetime, so that there's a force to counter pressure, but it's probably better just to avoid giving them that part of the power.

** +Two+Some random suggestions:

1. The power to decide to change your physical state and position to what it was 10 seconds ago (in the reference frame of the heaviest nearby object or something along those lines), everything else is unaffected . Naturally since your brain state is part of your physical state using this leads to losing all memories gained in that time. To make it more interesting and powerful change the time to anything less than 24 hours. Now the character has the option to do things without having knowledge of having done it as long as they do it within 24 hours of having the idea. Also creates the possibility of noticing you just made a big reset and have no idea why.

2. Having access to your mental state precisely 10 seconds into the future that would exist if you didn't use your power in the next 10 seconds. This allows things like gather information counter factually (for example to learn what is behind the forbidden door decide that in one second you will check if you already know what is behind the door, if you don't open the door, now use you power). Also allows thinking faster than usual by repeatedly reading the mind of a version of you that has already spent time thinking about the problem, but unless the information can be absorbed very quickly this would only allow for something like a 10x speed up. Also perhaps somewhat surprisingly someone with this power can be surprised by something so long as it happens within 10 as a result of using this power.

3. Probability manipulation working as follows: the character may specify any number of events as long as it would in principle be possible to tell if they had occurred. Then out of "all possible futures" futures in which any of the events did not occur are eliminated at a rate proportional to the number of futures remaining. So, for example if it say takes 1 hour to eliminate half of all futures then this character can make something which previously had a probability of 1/2 be guaranteed with one hour of use of their power, something with probability 1/4 with 2 hours of use of their power or something with probably 1/sqrt(2) be guaranteed with 30 minutes use of their power.

*** Nice. I especially like the first one. I think I would do it as 'set a chrono-anchor, then revert to that anchor', and let him have up to 2 anchors set at a time, with an anchor "coming loose" after 24 hours.

Number 2 is interesting to think about, but I think it would be hard to write for. Not just that it's very powerful, but also that it's complicated and would be hard to explain.

Number 3 is also very cool but hard to write. I'll put it in the list, though.

Also I seem to have undersold number 3 since you only seem to only consider number 2s power noteworthy. Allow me to try to amend that:

Suppose you want the answer to some yes/no question, you can decide to toss a coin in 1 hour and use your power to eliminate futures in which the coin lands heads and the statement is false and futures in which the coin lands tails and the statement is true. Then in one hour the coin is guaranteed to land heads if and only if the statement is true. This gives you one bit of information, by repeating this and using binary search you can find the answer to almost any question.

Suppose now that you want to work out the answer to a problem which you could solve in principle but might take you a very long time. You start to use your power to eliminate futures in which you don't find the answer within 2 days. After one hour you will have eliminated approximately half the cases where you don't find the answer effectively halving the search space or doubling the speed at which you search. After 10 hours you will have effectively increased the rate at which you search by a factor of 1000. The same trick allows them to build a computer that computes NP-complete problems in polynomial time.

By running their power for long enough they could make essentially anything happen (they can force one in one quadrillion events to happen by applying their power for 2 days). Their main limitation would be that they need to ask for something far enough in advance, and their requests may be fulfilled in ways they did not expect (with potentially catastrophic outcomes): The way the power works is simply by eliminating futures in which the event did not happen. So, the event will happen in the way it was most likely to happen:

For example say they want to force the outcome of a lottery draw, so they request that a certain string of numbers is drawn in the next lottery. It will probably be more likely that the power user will decide to rig the lottery more directly and because of their power succeed, than the numbers appearing by natural means, so the request will be granted by making the user decide to use their power to rig the lottery by more conventional means.

Essentially they have an [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/][outcome pump]] with an adjustable power setting. If they are smart they will avoid using it at anything close to full power. Apologies for the wall of text.

You can create spatial bubbles where there exists an arbitrary maximum speed that physical objects are allowed to travel at, and this can be used for instance to stop incoming projectiles or to essentially kill people by preventing them from breathing.

** - Nonchalant time-based superspeed. The less user cares, the more he/she slows down time and thus the faster he/she moves.
- Tactile fat polarization. Ability to make lipids dissolve in water (or any other polar solvent) upon a touch. At first glance may not seem impressive, but when you consider how cellular membrane of living beings is built, it turns out to be basically touch of death.
- Contagious reverse empathy. User of this power unconsciously makes nearby people assume his mental state and they in turn pass it on other people like a virus. If he/she gets sad, everyone gets sad; if someone pisses him/her off, it may end up with riots; if he gets drunk/doped, then well...
- Energy storage through talismans. This power allows to sap certain kinds of energy, store it in inorganic trinkets and release on will. One trinket can keep only one kind of energy, so you cannot put e.g. lightwaves and momentum in the same object. So user can e.g. create flashbangs or accelerate himself/herself with stored momentum.

** The power of drag coefficient manipulation. Not true fluid telekinesis like Leviathan, just skin drag, pressure drag, maybe even laminar to turbulent flow boundaries.

The wielder of that power could synergize very well with a tinker, creating otherwise-unusable hypersonic transport or projectile weapons. Would also be very difficult to harm kinetically in an atmosphere. Offensive options would depend on manton limits, physical range, and the ability to independently affect different regions or objects.

**** Yup, exactly my thoughts! For higher speeds, she could just make the airflow laminar around an arbitrarily shaped jet or rocket-powered vehicle, adding slight turbulence as needed for trajectory adjustments. For combat, with absolute control, she could even halt melee attacks; but even slowing down punches by a significant percentage would provide a huge advantage, dropping the kinetic energy by the cube of the slowdown and throwing off the attacker's expectations. Asphyxiation, of course, would depend on the manton limits of the power.

** /"what happens if the speed of light doubles?"/

Taken straight: particles in the zone where the speed of light doubles can be accelerated to a higher velocity than the speed of light in a vacuum. When they leave the zone they will emit the extra kinetic energy as cherenkov radiation.

Otherwise... what does it mean for the speed of light to double? Can you link to the places where people answered "nothing"? I'm not at all sure that's correct.

**** I think the original response is wrong. Doubling the speed of light would have the effect of replacing "1" with "2" in all those equations the poster is talking about. Or changing all the other constants (including the mass of everything) to bring it back to "1".

I /think/ that the most likely result would be the same as changing the rate at which time passes. Time is derived from the speed of light, not the other way around.

** The power to change matter into magnetic monopoles.

Not sure what it might do. Large explosions are a guess as the matter converted into monopoles would no longer be bound. Also possibly larger explosions as I have heard a rumor about monopoles catalyzing proton decay(?). And if you could hold some monopoles in one place odd magnetic effects because monopole magnetic fields fall of with distance in some other way than by the inverse square, providing much greater range.

Secondary effect would be to revolutionize technology if the character can produce and package large amounts.

** I don't think this fits quite so well, but maybe it could, and I've been thinking about it for the past couple days, so: Human Shapeshifting.

The idea was to make it look as much like standard "change into anyone" shapeshifting as possible, without making it too horrifically broken. (That you already have someone with subspace-related powers helps, since I was thinking that would be crucial to making it work.)

So, for example: you can't violate conservation of energy so much (not that I know where the energy for the transformations come from), so you can't change into anyone larger than your default form, unless you exploit some technicality regarding eating while shifted to stock up on mass to use later.

Transmuting elements would be absurdly energy-expensive, but moving around molecules less so.

You'll want your clothes and ID to change along with you, so the ability should probably extend as far as clothing can be reasonably expected to extend (so a couple inches or so). Anything that leaves your range will quickly revert to its original form (maybe there would be a delay that follows your favorite inverse power law, so you can show your ID to a police officer or a bouncer without it immediately changing in their hands, but so that it won't make it easy to disguise money or jewels?).

Identities: you can only change into humans (I was thinking you'd need to change into unique people, excluding your default form, because the impersonation possibilities are scary and overused). The same applies to things that you transfigure: clothes change to clothes, rocks change to rocks, coins to coins, guns to guns, smart phones to smart phones.

Brute: not only can you shapeshift away many injuries, but it'd be real convenient if lethal damage to a shapeshifted form cause dyou to revert to your (uninjured) default form, subspacing or forcefully ejecting any loose penetrants. That wouldn't work so will if, say, someone has their arm through your chest, or if your body is in pieces that are more than a few inches apart, but if it's slow enough, you could take a typical burst of gunfire and keep going, provided nothing important got blown away in the process.

I kinda focused on civilian exploits. For example: you can't make anything persist once it leaves your range, but if you make something that can be copied (for example, stick a transfigured jumpdrive into a computer, hold onto it with one hand, copy data with the other), you can still get something out of it. The same applies to medical developments, if with more tedium. After all, your transfigured cells are replicators, and if you can get them to copy onto some unmodified material, you might be able to get something out of it.

Then, of course, there's the momentum question: what happens if you change into a differently-sized form while in motion? How long does this take? Can it be exploited to, say, jump higher, or get finer control over one's speed, or something? What if you're in a small form, someone grabs you, and you try to change into a bigger form?
