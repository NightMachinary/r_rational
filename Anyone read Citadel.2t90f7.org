** [[https://unillustrated.wordpress.com/][Citadel]]. It's about a military school for capes. I dropped it after just a few chapters. Something about the writing and the characters seemed too grating for me.

** I am the author of the piece in question and freely admit to bias. That said:

The story is a militaristic take on the school for supers genre. Additionally, the training is pragmatic and brutal. I think calling it violence porn would be overstating it, but the early portions of the story are probably the most violent and, if they bother you, I wouldn't recommend you continue. Both the setting and elements of the plot are fairly dark.

This is the second time it's popped up in a rationalist thread but it is not intended as rationalist fiction. I do make a deliberate effort to have characters act in a fashion that makes sense to them. As a natural result, there are a few individuals who make a concerted effort to better themselves, constantly improving, but only a few. One of those characters seems to be a fan favorite and that may be the reason Citadel appeals to some rationalist readers.

Citadel is a work in progress. The current intro, the two sections that have been most heavily discussed in this thread, are by no means final. The first two versions were each significantly worse and I freely acknowledge that there is a lot of room for improvement in the most recent one.

I prefer not to comment on the alleged Sociopathic Hero in depth. I'll simply say that, in my opinion, he does not fit the trope or the medical diagnosis. The trope is subjective but I am actually semi-qualified to say the latter.

Spacing. It seems a little unreal to me that this is an issue that prompted so many comments. I use the double-space because that's how I was taught to do it and because that's how many of the books I read in my formative years were written. I am aware that it is at least mildly anachronistic and has been for quite some time. Even the later typewriters did not truly need it. I intend to continue for two reasons: (1) it's what I'm used to and I'd rather put the effort required to change it into improving content instead and (2) precisely because it's old fashioned, double-spacing is what most of the large publishing companies prefer. I realize that those same companies will never touch Citadel, or anything else that's been put on the web, but I do intend to write and submit other works. Much as I value my current and future web readers, I'd prefer to keep my writing habits in tune with the publishers' expectations.

Regardless of anything else, I love feedback. Good, bad, so long as it's honest, there's almost nothing said about what I've written that can't help me improve. Thank you for what is clearly honest criticism.

*** Hey, since my comment was the longest and most negative ITT, I just wanted to clearly say thanks for writing. Not everyone can put themselves and their work out there like this. Keep it up.

Not every story is for everyone but I meant every bit of my comment as constructive criticism. That's honestly what I felt reading what I did, and I would have said the same to your face at a writing workshop.

I'm super critical right now as a new writer myself and all of these issues are forefront in my mind because of that. That could make me other than an average reader, for better or worse. That's one reason I was so exact in my description of my reactions -- which a lot of people take really personally, and understandably so. It certainly isn't objective data. Maybe I had an off day. Maybe an undigested piece of beef lent affect more from gravy than grammar to something I read. However it happened, that's what my experience was.

That, I feel, is more useful than suggestions on how to write -- at least when it comes to style. As you suggest, without honest and personal reader feedback and opinions I don't think anyone can improve their writing very much. Those improvements have to be in your voice and direction, though, and it isn't like my word is gospel. So even though I meant it, and still do, take everything I said with a grain of salt. Which from your post, it seems you may have already. A healthy attitude.

Bravo. I was worried. Sociopathy -- which doesn't exist as a medical term, the correct DSM label is a case of /severe/ Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) -- is a strange tic fiction often has, and that you even /know/ that this is an issue, and a medical one, resolves a lot of my worries. I withdraw all possible concerns, though not of course my initial reactions.

  Spacing.

For perhaps the first time in my life, I think agreeing to disagree may actually be an appropriate and accurate way to describe the situation -- rather than, as is typical, an attempt at a social power-play. I will say nothing more, as you seem to understand and have stated all the issues involved, and that was all I was attempting to clarify myself.

** Just tried it cold and couldn't get into the story. Writing is okay but uninspired. Presentation, plotting, and pacing have issues. Might try again later if someone who has finished it gives it +a strong+ an absolutely glowing review ITT. Here's mine for the first two chapters.

--------------

First of all, a hard to read intro chapter that does nothing but disconnected and emotional background? Not a good sign. A slightly-clichéd first-person intro from an interview or something -- a detail which I missed until half-way through before I went back to reread the right-aligned title line -- doesn't make a great first impression.

Serials have a habit of rambling and being padded with "atmosphere" and "gritty background." This one starts with both. I really want an idea of what the story is /about/ first. Bodies hitting the floor isn't a strong hook by itself. Unless the story is about bodies hitting the floor. Which...maybe that's what's going on?

The story screams shockbait and violence porn from literally the first chapter. That alone doesn't make a story either rational or interesting to me. The second chapter continues more of the same and finally mentions the titular "Citadel". And (/very/ briefly) introduces a cold, emotionless child pretending to be someone he's not, entering an elite training program. An adult immediately notices and suspects them because of a mysterious family background and unstated powers.

Oh wow, okay. I smell an incoming [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero][Sociopathic Hero]] (TVTropes warning), at best. Thinly veiled Ender Wiggin (or rather, Peter) at the horribly-clichéd worst. Leaves me looking for a female [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain][Morality Chain]] to pop up at any moment -- and then either get kidnapped or straight-up fridged to continue "escalating," the latest watchword in by-the-numbers serial fiction. Meh. Maybe I'm wrong. But I don't think I am. It certainly points that way.

When I start reading a story, I look for characters I can care about and events that I want to see through to the end. A story needs to have a heart that a reader can latch onto, or least a protagonist to link to events. Here, I get disconnected mass deaths, some awkwardly-presented plot hooks, and a late presented, possible protagonist who is made entirely of power-fantasy clichés.

And worst of all? *Double-spacing after sentences*. On the internet. In 2014. No. Bad author.

*** It is different and strange, that's certain. There is no real main character, but there are main character(s). I agree strongly that this can be confusing, but I like that the characters all feel different.

Jason is indeed a bit scary. His power is extraordinarily OP to the point that he doesn't dare use it on humans directly, he can only use it to heal himself.

Double-spacing after sentences? Really? That bothers you enough to comment on it?

Fair enough. But not seeing them as such, or a coherent storyline, in the first two chapters? Bad show.

As predicted, then. Was I right about the morality chain and the inevitable "oh shit" moment when he /does/ use it on humans?

It was literally the first thing I noticed about the story, as silly as using "thee" and "thou" in modern composition. Choosing it as a style in a digital medium is showing. That is a relic of a bygone age, related to font and typographical issues that no longer exist in the modern era. It is the worst sin I found in the first two chapters, showing a great ignorance or disregard of the medium, so of course I commented on it.

This suggests the author is either very young or inexperienced and trying to appear more professional (and failing), or is old and stubbornly stuck in their ways. Everyone else chooses to esche that unnecessary and distracting style. Given the clunky prose, it could go either way.

Hopefully it eases up later on and smooths out. One of the odd issues with serial fiction is that the style usually gets better as it goes, but that seldom gets back to the most important part: the first few chapters. Good authors writing serials go back and style edit if they care about new readers. I'm almost certain that hasn't happened here (yet) but the spacing thing immediately drew my eye to other style issues. Not a good first impression.

Smooth reading experiences help forgive a bevy of sins. Using words like bevy and double-spacing breaks that. Don't do it, certainly not early on, unless the composition can support the pretense. The first two chapters of Citadel don't hold up well to the extra scrutiny, in my professional opinion.

***** I'm not sure why you are missing the coherent storyline that I see clearly. It's a school for people with super powers, where teaching occurs to train soldiers, not students. It's an extremely grimdark world. The author is showing it to us from the perspective of several characters.

Because the story is being told from the perspective of several characters, as if they were each main characters, it seems fragmented. No, it IS fragmented. But there's nothing inherently wrong with fragmentation.

Would I have written it that way? No. But I'm not the author. Am I saying you should like it? No. Like what you want. If you do not like the series, then you have a perfect right to say so, and perhaps give reasons. You did those things.

It simply puzzled me to no small degree that you latched onto something as completely trivial as double spacing to complain about. You had legitimate things to voice opinions on. Things that I can actually respect. Then you criticize for double spacing? and emphasize it? I just cannot wrap my mind around where you were coming from.

I am also a serial internet fiction writer. I, as this author also does, have gone back and made edits in recently completed work at the direction of readers who point out problems. My work was admittedly rather terrible when I started. FAR worse than this author's work is. That being said, my work has dramatically improved since I started, somewhere around 800k words ago. I have improved enough that I literally cannot go back and simply make significant modifications in prior work completed only a few months ago. If I do try to do so for anything more than a triviality, then I end up rewriting huge blocks of text. Which I do not have the time to do when I am also working on new content. Serial online fiction with regular, frequent updates simply does not work that way, with very few exceptions.

Let me be clearer. Despite the fact that I identify far more strongly with the writer than I do with you, I respect all of your opinions except the opinion on double-spacing, I don't agree with the others, and have explained why, with a little illustration.

I also double-space. I will not be changing that habit.

As a side note, Jason has not yet used his power on a human.

In the first two, most important chapters? I'm not reading 20k words just to get into the meat. Maybe if I'd just read one more chapter, this wouldn't have been as much of an issue. But I didn't because I was tired of it already. Personal opinion, sure. But I think it is a real issue with these sorts of background and atmosphere heavy stories. You have to lead with both punch and something that matters to the reader. /Citadel/ misses the second part for me, hard, and accomplishes the first in a rather wincingly unsubtle way.

I appreciate all the tone defining you do in your reply, and I certainly don't take offense, but don't act like I am missing something. The storyline simply isn't there in those first two chapters. It is an excruciatingly slow start for all the violence and death.

This is very interesting to me. That is the only factual style issue I had, all the others being opinion, and yet it is the one you "don't respect." Because you do it yourself, of course, and think nothing of it. Which is your only argument for why it is trivial. Because you think nothing of it. Hmm.

As you say, it is a habit, and a bad one. Hardly "completely trivial" but clearly poorly examined. Which is why I spend so much time explaining this point. Not so much for you, who have already determined through the ever-logical process of "I will not" to never change, but to other authors who might make the same mistake. I wonder, if that 50k book contract landed on your lap along with an editor who holds this common opinion, would you still say "I will not?"

Double-spacing after periods is almost as bad as using too many adjectives, thus making it about as bad, in my opinion, as stretching out long, if strictly grammatically correct, compound sentences by overusing commas. It is something you just don't do in the modern writing world. We have perfect typeset now, not typewriter monospace. Extra spacing isn't required or desired. Unless you are writing intentionally ergodic literature, don't screw around with these sorts of things.

With the blocky sans-serif font the author choose for /Citadel/, it is especially egregious. If I don't notice it at a glance, it is obviously okay with me. I'm not some sort of zealot who searches for this. With the serif font on what I assume is your writing blog, I don't notice it as much. Possibly because that font it is designed for smaller typeface. But it is very, very noticeable in /Citadel/, and detracts and distracts. Which is why I brought it up. Also, because it is such a clear-cut rule nowadays.

This is something you and the author of /Citadel/ are both absolutely, flat-out wrong about. The majority of typographic experts, editors, and writers agree on this and there is no rational reason to go against that. No reader will be offended if one /doesn't/ double-space. If one does, some may be thrown off or take it as a signal for the issues I mentioned above. That was certainly the case with me.

The counter argument so far presented is, it is trivial and habit. Oddly, no discussion of my points on social signaling in writing style choices. Given those widespread and so far in this discussion uncontested public precepts, it seems really irrational to continue to hold a hardline policy on this issue.

******* If a 50k book contract landed in my lap, I would have absolutely nothing to do with sentence spacing. That's formatting, and formatting is the editor's job. The editor would probably be annoyed with me if I even mentioned spacing between sentences because I shouldn't even be thinking about formatting. I should be writing a good story.

I agree that this conversation is irrational. I was taught to double space decades ago, and I will always double space. If some potential future editor of mine doesn't like it, I guarantee you that they know how to use the find and replace all option on a word processor.
