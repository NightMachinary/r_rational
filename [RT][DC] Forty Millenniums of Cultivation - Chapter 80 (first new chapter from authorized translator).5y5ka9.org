** Is it just me or does the quality of the translation seem slightly lower than it was before? I'm not sure if it may all be in my head, because I'm comfortable with Strivon's translations.

Also, I noticed that they didn't start translating from chapter #1. No they just posted the first 79 chapters that Strivon already did and simply continued from where (s)he left off. Does anyone know if they got Strivon's permission for the translations? I mean they gave Strivon credit at the beginning of every chapter, but it's still something I would like to know.

Has anyone heard of the site [[http://www.webnovel.com][www.webnovel.com]] before? It sounds like it just launched very recently.

EDIT: I just went to [[/r/noveltranslations]] and found the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5xsliz/a_special_announcement_by_qidian_international/][announcement post]] that says the website just appeared yesterday or today. The commenters have a very low opinion of some of the translators on the site and mentioned that the company with the copy-rights is known for under-paying their translators which has lead to low-quality chapters and slow releases. Very disappointing compared to wuxiaworld's stellar service.

** The copyright holder [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5sm9fc/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_translation/?ref=search_posts][asked the fan translators to stop]] last month. They say they're going to post two chapters a week, and the first one is out now.

** While I am happy to see the translation continue, Strivon's translation is far superior in quality.

** God dammit, I already read ahead like 20 chapters with Baidu's machine translation.

Well, nothing left to do but wait for the story to catch up. =/
