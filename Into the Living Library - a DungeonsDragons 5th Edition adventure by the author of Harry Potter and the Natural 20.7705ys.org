  Glad to hear you enjoyed it! I often find myself wanting to go back and work on Nat20, particularly recently. I wouldn't rule it out.

*** Just looked it through, haven't played yet.

I like the foreshadowing and it has a decent dose of puns as well.

*** Works for me. Try another browser or device and see if that helps. DTRPG has problems on mobile, so if you're on mobile then that might be the issue.

** 23 pages some of which are just maps... suggested price $4.99??

but "pay what you want." you /totally/ don't have to feel guilty about not paying the suggested price.

honestly I really do hate haggling--especially when it's this sort of "honor system haggling" where I'm supposed to do his side of the haggle too.
