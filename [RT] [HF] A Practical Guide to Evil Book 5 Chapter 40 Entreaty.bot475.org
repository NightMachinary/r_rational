** The agreement at the end sounds like a setup for the Pivot. A lot of discussion has been made about what Saint will do in the end, and that kind of choice and its consequences is precisely what a Pivot is. Here, they're just adding more weight to that choice.

Now, the question is whether or not Cat even wants Pilgrim's crown or not. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but they've just been throwing a bunch of crowns at Cat, namely Pilgrim's, Tyrant's, and the two revenants. The last crown will shape the nature of the realm, so it's important which one is chosen. They've also mentioned that, after kill Larat, there will be a cost to use the realm for fast travel, and it's my guess that what the cost will be will depend on which crown is chosen.

For example, if Tyrant's crown is used, I'd imagine that the resulting cost will be something ironically bad, like all the boots off of the soldiers' feet, or the exit leading straight into an ambush. For Pilgrim, it might be a deep personal sacrifice for the greater good. For Cat, my guess is that the cost will be a Name, as in someone has to give up their Name to use the gates. It fits neatly into what we know of the Liesse Accords, and it fits with Cat's current path. Or alternatively, the cost will be more crowns, hence the realm later being called the Prince's Graveyard, which fits the name more, considering only one royal actually died for those current 7 crowns.

*** Ohhh, I like the idea of a Realm which lets you sneak-attack your enemies, but only at the cost of your own right to rule. All the upsides of a nuclear deterrent with none of the downsides. If anyone signing on to the Liesse Accords is getting destroyed by another, all they need to do to win the conflict is sacrifice their reign and gate an army to the enemy sovereign's bedchamber.

This would give good and wise rulers an actual advantage over the mad and ambitious, as it would be a threat only the good could wield.

Lowercase good in particular, since the various nitwits with crowns participating in the crusade are all on the "Good" side. I feel like the purpose of the restriction could be bypassed since it's magical in a sort of way, we know Warlock has access to at least some knowledge and ability with realms outside of creation considering Hierophant grew up in one. It might be something the choirs swing in Good's favor for a name to show up with a magical understanding of how to break into the realm.

Personally I feel blanket effects within the realm is the more likely outcome from the last crown, if I recall correctly all mentions of the effects on the realm haven't included the creation of the gate, just the inside of it. Also consider the gates to various Hells just allow passage for devils, they don't make the area hell-like. They don't even seem to corrupt the people creating them considering it hasn't been mentioned so far, plus an artifact (Akua's Folly) would've been able to make one without even a person to corrupt.

My guesses for the effects if we're betting on this:

Tyrant - Either randomness in the realm e.g. getting lost, arriving much later or earlier than expected, peaceful or hostile areas interspersed wherever; or some mini-madness on people in the realm, e.g. people more inclined to betrayal, people not caring about their loyalties anymore.

Pilgrim - Choir's Providence, the realm. Stories have a much larger effect, a crusading army probably would literally have glistening armor. It might even be similar to what would've happened if that angel actually called for the crusade in the earlier chapters before Cat done Cat'd it.

Dead King's dead minions - Bad idea, never going to happen. Probably would end up like what happened with Maesago, only the dead king would have control over the realm instead of one person.

Cat - Literally the only outcome I can see happening is Cat giving up her crown. The realm would probably be about sacrifice, people lose Names, stories lose weight, rulers lose Crowns, armies arrive exhausted, half of supplies might spoil. Cat's whole career has been the lesser evil, if something saved a thousand lives at the cost of a hundred she'd take the deal and mourn the hundred. Hakram sacrificed a hand for Vienna and he's just acting the same as Cat has been in a narrower sense. Whatever the cost to enter ends up being it's going to be enough that things are going to end up in a MAD sort of way.

** Good Lord am I learning to hate Tariq more and more with each passing chapter.

"Hey Cat, I know Laurence seems to be a rabid dog out to kill any and everything she thinks is a threat, and that might put a friend of yours in her crosshairs. (PS, she and I might be a teensy bit responsible for the Eldritch horror currently pursuing said friend)

Can she get a pass on killing him cause, y'know, who are you to question is when we say someone needs to die?"

I'm starting to hope that in some very real, cosmic way in the Guideverse, this whole era and Cat's story is about the Good guys not realizing they've stepped into the Role of misguided, self righteous props supporting a system that kills innocent people in banal everyday ways that people like the Pilgrim and Saint ignore. Cat had to suffer through the Conquest and rule by Evil because The Good Guys were busy prancing around Procer and Levant patting themselves on the back for snuffing out minor villains. And then they have the audacity to ask Cat to stand aside while they butcher their way to another Win For The Good Guys.

What makes Tariq particularly hateful is that he'll never, ever, ever see that he's the one past redemption because he's already convinced himself that biological warfare is a Merciful way to end a war, so long as it ends it for the ones that claim they're the Good Guys.

*** I think Rule is more abstract then that, he probably wouldn't be able to lead armies or cause political change (Like the legions), and it probably requires someone to actually be Ruling in some regard, otherwise any soldier (And probably one very eager field promoted general) could be made to give up their potential rule. Plus, the right to climb the tower is something available to literally everyone in a way, considering the current Empress was just a good looking serving girl prior to her current position, and she was fully able to take the tower.

** [blatant copy paste incoming]

I've never been one for speeches, even if I do tend to ramble. I do not care to listen to someone spout paragraphs worth of text at me over the internet or quarter hours worth of speech over words at me, but this speech was good. The quality of the speech however does not discount my dislike for the long winded, And my want for people to get to the point.

We get it, the saint deals with that which no one else wants to or can, but she is old and failing. Her judgement is becoming clouded, corrupted by stubbornness. I do not doubt she was a sight to behold in her prime, but now her story is ending fast. Someone else will take up her job, and the world will move on.

This chapter is another of the sort I grow tired of, an entire chapter dedicated to a single conversation. Sure, it needed to happen. Sure, it is important. But I have grown bored of these sorts of chapters, because the same point could be made in half the words, and we could get back to the plot. Back to dealing with the dead king. Back to actually doing something other than having yet another debate of morality! I get that some people enjoy this sort of chapter, I truly do, but we have more important things to deal with than moral posturing!

Now, to get to the parts that should have taken us only half a chapter to get to, we finally have a concrete answer for the 8th crown. Sure, it may not be guaranteed go be the 8th, but it is at least a willing possibility.

Also curse the tyrants sudden and inevitable betrayal! Honestly if you weren't expecting this you either thought this already all counted as one big betrayal of the dead king or you haven't been paying attention to how kairos does things. As I have said before, he is irritant+traitorous+the spirit of goblin kind+ a smidge of Saturday cartoon villainy, and it is glorious to behold. I only wish we could have witnessed his betrayal first hand, as it surely was glorious
