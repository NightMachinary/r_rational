Taken directly from qntm's [[http://qntm.org/models#sec4][Modelling Time Travel in Fiction]]:

- You can go back in time whenever you like.
- Every time you go back in time, you create an entirely new timeline.
- If you go forwards in time, you stay in your current timeline.

I wanted to write a book that follows this model and takes it to its extremes. But [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/33qx3k/dbst_society_has_access_to_terminatorstyle_time/][this thread]] sort of makes me doubt my ability to get the concept across in short order so that the /real/ plot can begin.

The general problem here is an exposition one. I don't want to infodump, because I think that's terrible writing. I can't really use Naive Newcomer, because everything that the newcomer would be introduced to is common knowledge to /everyone/, unless the newcomer was something incredibly contrived.

So let's say that you are trying to explain this model of time travel to someone, in the form of a story. What's the best way to get the rules and most of their implications out there and established so that the plot can begin?

(For what it's worth, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15p4mABUBMu1Hp56dCHk4bSUwfOFGlJ3kI1x92JcqkNU/edit?usp=sharing][this]] is my first scene in /The Murder That Wasn't/, which I think needs work in clearly establishing the rules.)


** Why try and explain the rules? why not just tell the story from whichever perspective you choose, and let people figure it out themselves? i mean by the end of the book they will have a set of observations which would either show the rules you predefined or they would match other possible rules, but that won't matter too much and i can't really see how that would hurt, unless your are trying to write a rationalist story and want people to be able to join in from the start, as opposed to after a while when they will have sufficient observations to be expected to have figured the rules out already..

*** The two primary reasons that anyone stops reading something is that they're bored or confused. The worry about not making any attempt to accommodate is that they'll get confused and stop reading before they get to the point where they think everything is going to make sense. It's my personal opinion that you never start with the audience's trust or interest, and if you just assume that people will figure out all the stuff that you've decided on (even if you make sure that there's only one valid interpretation) you risk alienating a huge amount of people.

So I do think that having the audience pick things up as they go along is valid, but you have to be careful about how you do it, so that they don't realize that they're being fed information. The question is keep them from getting confused without interfering with proper storytelling.

**** Hm. Do you never start with the audience's trust even if you've developed a previous reputation?

For example, if I were to read Charlie Anon's story and get confused, I might set it down. But if I were reading a story from /you/ and I got confused, then I would keep going because you've established a reputation with me for well-crafted stories and worlds, so I'm going to keep going with this.

Are you meaning something else when you talk about how an author never starts with the audience's trust or interest? If not, this just might be a story that is for, ah, the veteran Waleswatcher (as we might call those of us who are always on the lookout for a new story from your corner).

***** Well, I think part of gaining trust is leaning on that trust as little as possible. You trust someone to pay you back a lot more if you know they're the sort of person who doesn't borrow money lightly. It's also sort of a gradient. Even a master craftsman of genre fiction like Charles Stross can't depend entirely on the goodwill that he's built up, which means that I'm far, far away from that.

Maybe what I mean is that you should always behave as though you don't have trust or interest.

As for having something just for this sub, which has a much higher than average tolerance for weird scifi ideas and stories that have to be puzzled over ... I'll give it some thought. My big (perhaps overly) ambitious plan was to have a loose cycle of time travel books that cover all of the basic models. /Timewise Tales/ is in rough draft right now, and uses static model time travel, and the plan was to have /The Murder That Wasn't/ as the branching model novel (and a third ripple model novel to round out the series). But if I can figure out a way to do a novella instead, maybe I'll go that way.

** You got it across in 3 dot points, I doubt infodump is going to be much of a problem. You could probably get most of it across through terminology such as branching. There's also the point that when people other than the protagonist time travel then they vanish and the current timeline stays the same. You could also have it explained in a monologue where the character is planning the jumps they need to do.

It seems strange that travelling to the future doesn't split the timelines like it does going back.

The time-travel system should probably open a short-term two way portal, that helps distinguish multiple timelines from other forms of travel

** I'm curious about your plan to overcome some of the narrative challenges of that model of time travel - seems like it makes it difficult to put together coherent character motivations when their time-travelling actions can never help the people they care about in their original timeline.

You /can/ change stuff as a way to help out the inhabitants of your new branch of the timeline, but butterfly effects are liable to mean that the resulting world is changed sufficiently that you don't find exactly parallel copies of anyone you knew before. Further, to anyone who doesn't travel alongside you, you've just disappeared - exited the universe, never to return, and they can't even "come after you" because when /they/ jump back, they'd end up segregated off in their own branch of the timeline.

Unless your main characters are very careful and coordinated about always time-travelling as a group, it seems like a rather efficient way to permanently separate and scatter them into their own individual timelines, which makes any kind of traditional story /tricky/ at best. Not saying that there's no possible story to be told despite those difficulties but as I started out saying at the top, I'm curious what your plan is.

*** The very first attempt at writing this book came about four years ago, and most of those narrative challenges didn't exist, because no one actually time traveled (with only a few exceptions). I believe the primary plots were:

- A small group of weeaboos is in training to go back to Edo Japan as part of the homebrew retroactive colonization movement (leaving behind everyone they knew in life)
- A college-age girl gets a letter from her future husband telling her to seek him out (sending something like that back is a common anniversary tradition)
- A detective is closing cases before they happen
- A long-form reporter who was fired from his job because of poor expected future returns tries to infiltrate the company responsible for time travel
- Someone makes an assault on Chicago through time travel

There might have been some others. It was kind of a mess. But the point wasn't to have people traveling through time wily-nily, it was to show a modern society where time travel was a reality - immigration to the past, emigration from the future, rapid technological progress and massive social upheaval.

Time travel laid out some of the challenges to characters, and sometimes cut branches of possibility, but time traveling backwards into the past creates duplicates if you don't go far enough, and abandons the world that you once knew, which all the characters took seriously.

Obviously if/when I write this story again I'll be paring it down - there's not really a need to have eight or nine viewpoint characters who all have their own intersecting plots - but the point is mostly to use future information, and have the plot follow a single one of the repeatedly forking timelines.

**** That makes sense, I hadn't really considered the angle of the 'viewpoint' universe being the one that receives various arrivals from the future, rather than following an individual or group using time travel repeatedly.

Your detective puts an idea in my head - if he sends his past self a note after every case, telling himself the solution then it creates an exponentially branching tree of timelines with different versions of himself who have, to varying degrees, been assisted by those notes. And one timeline of "all the note branches" where he's never had to genuinely solve a case in his life... but then with every successive branching there's a new 'twig' on that branch that has, for the first time ever, failed to receive a note, and suddenly needs to learn to detective from scratch without letting on that his perfect record is kind of a sham...

***** Hm. While this wouldn't solve the problem entirely, the detective might ameliorate it by sending back complex mysteries (on the order of the ones that he's solving IOTL) that must somehow be solved in order to access or put together the notes for the case.

Or alternatively, he trusts in his own forethought and lack of crippling laziness and simply sends back the notes about his cases but also sends back the mysteries so that these other iterations of himself can work on them. Either way, while observation and people skills may not remain so sharp, the detective will at least be kept thinking in the right ways.

But it's not just that the detective has gone five years without actually putting in the work of solving a case - everyone has. That's just how police departments work now. The city balances the enormous staffing needs of the "first iteration" versions of themselves with the low staffing needs of the later iterations which have probabilistic foreknowledge. And though you go into work every day knowing that today might be the day that /you/ have to be the first iteration, the one working blind, it's sometimes hard to remember that. Every day is just a matter of going down the optimal path that your side-along selves have written for you, or working on cold cases so impossible that you literally couldn't solve them if you devoted a dozen lifetimes to them.

Think of going forward in time as exactly the same as the stasis version, just that you aren't physically present for the duration; if the timeline splits while you are 'out' (by someone traveling backwards /to/ that period) you split with it, but nothing else can affect you during that period. Changes to the past before you left affect you exactly the same amount as they affect anything else, regardless of when they came from.

** Narratively, I'm not to sure.

Reality-wise, I think the interesting thing happens when there is more than traveller.

Because the issue here is that this basically isn't distinguishable from a person spontaneously coming into existing with a memory consistent with what you might observe from a time-traveller.

Because it's not distinguishable... they're the same, right? (The way you tell two things are not the same thing is that they're distinguishable, the way you tell two things are the same thing is that they're not).

Which means that /other/ time-travelers (whether the implied "I" is one as well or not) just kind of... show up, with no otherwise-defined cause, or other-wise defined reason.

So you need to figure that out. Because it either /is/ for no cause, in which case it's random, and thus you either figure out how that works with regards to chaos and entropy (ie, it doesn't), or there is a cause, and that "create an entirely new timeline" doesn't quite hold up.

My usual rubric is that causally looped information is as accurate as it is tested, which means time-traveller arrivals occur when it is sufficiently likely for a series of subsequent events to result in a time-traveler showing up /now/... but that doesn't quite work in a new-timeline situation.

Ramble, ramble - Stories are interesting because of how they effect people; and usually, that's plural. Figure out what it means to have more than one person traveling under this model, and how the two+ time-travelers interact and effect each-other.

**** This wouldn't get around the issue. In the first place, the timeline still gets erased. In the second, you can prove that the timeline gets erased in that people can obtain future information, and that no one is observed randomly becoming comatose, or at least at much lower frequencies than provable time travel occurs. I suppose it could just copy you, but you could also note that attempting to use the power does not have a 50% success rate. On the other hand if it did, I suppose this mechanic would be very likely, but characters would be able to differentiate between them and I am suggesting using one for narrative reasons.

The OP's description of time travel very explicitly says that the universe someone leaves from does continue to exist, and indeed, in the setting people are aware of others leaving to go branch off new timelines in the past all the time.

The link in OP's description describes a number of different varieties of time travel, of which he has picked one for this story. Maybe you're looking at one of the other descriptions?

Another option if you don't want the Naive Newcomer to be a main character, could be that one of the time travelers goes to a time period where time travel isn't common knowledge, and has to explain some things to the locals.

** Okay whaddya think of this example?

The protagonist is watching a talk show. The hosts are interviewing a man who won the lottery. There is a .01% chance of winning. They ask him about his unusual method of playing, and he says that he kept time-travelling back and playing until he won. In fact, there is a whole community of gamblers who continually does this, with lotteries and other games of chance.

The host points out that for every branch containing a winner, there are 9999 losers. The man agrees, but he calculated beforehand that /on average/ he only had to spend one day looping before running through 10000 tickets, so he was sure of victory.

The host points out that each of the 9999 losers must be doing the same thing and further increasing the number of both winners and losers, which means that the number of timelines in which he never wins the lottery remains constant, with winning and losing timelines both increasing in number until the unluckiest losing timelines eventually get bored of repeating the same day so many times or run out of subjective years to spend.

The man replies that /actually/ he thought of that, and there are only 10000 possible tickets, so /each/ of the timelines he splits into is guaranteed to find the winning ticket /eventually/ so long as they themselves keep splitting timelines.

The host harrumphs, and says that even if those 9999 losers keep diligently playing, it's /still/ a matter of chance whether one finds oneself in the split timeline or the original timeline, and this means that every loss must create create at least one permanent loser who is never able to successfully travel back in time again due to sheer bad luck. And this means that he has created a fairly large, ever increasing population of /permanent/ losers in addition to winners.

The lottery winner looks thoughtful, and the remainder of the discussion turns to whether or not, now that he has found the winning ticket, he owes it to his past self to travel back in time and buy that winning ticket /again/ in order to increase the number of branches in which he reaches the winning ticket, despite having no personal interest in doing so and wasting subjective hours in the process, and whether or not pre-committing to that course of action beforehand would truly have been beneficial from the perspective of his past self. The host asks the audience if they would be willing to go through with this, and to mail in discussions of what situations they think time travel is worth it.

The protagonist ponders the issue, and the owner of a casino is just beginning to weigh in on how this new gambling trend might effect the business when suddenly...

PS - one necessary tool for lottos in this universe assuming no quantum dice is that they must not disclose which ticket is the winner, even from the future. You can find out whether you won, but you can't go back in time to give someone the winning number. Also, I didn't carefully think through the implications of this so I might be missing something big and obvious which changes everything, this is mostly just one possible method of introducing rules and implications in a totally plot neutral setting before starting the plot.

PPS: I think the implications here are complex enough that it's not weird if people in this multiverse need it explained to them sometimes. Things that naively seem like good ideas could easily end up creating lots of copies of a Bad End, for example. I bet they would have time-travelling councilors who think through this stuff for people, who could also serve as mouthpieces for you to explain confusing stuff.

  It's /inconvenient/ because it means there is no way to go "home". But it is consistent.

I don't think you quite understand what I'm suggesting. I'm saying that if you start in timeline A, then go back and end up in timeline B, going forward should take you to timeline C. That's even more inconvenient than the normal way.

** I was distracted by your mention of /Terminator/ originally.

Places where you might reasonably expect infodumps on people who already know it:

- Government briefings
- Advertisements and brochures
- School
- Technical documentation

Other ways you can exposition:

- Start with a scene appreciably before your main story, when the thing actually is new. Then shift to X decades later.
- Just plain narration.
- Follow a parcel as it's being delivered.

** This is relatively similar to what happens in the man who folded himself.

Not quite, but I often recommend that as a story to read if your doing many world timeline stuff.

** You'll of course use the same time-tested storytelling technique by which anybody ever explains the mechanics in their story --- by beginning with a short, lower-stakes arc that demonstrates all the important rules that will get used later in the book. A concise little example test-case that shows me your rules in action will always beat just telling me those rules.

Thinking of some other time-travel novels (though admittedly not your model), /Kindred/, /To Say Nothing of the Dog/, and /11/22/63/ each start out with a very brief jaunt to the past that serves as a simple example to show us readers the relevant rules, before their characters embark on much longer adventures into history.
