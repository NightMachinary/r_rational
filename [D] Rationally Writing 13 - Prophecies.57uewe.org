** Have either of you read [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime][Wheel of Time]]? It's one of my favourite fantasy series, and it's incredibly prophecy heavy. I'm not sure there's a prophecy trope it doesn't use in some way. Dozens of PoV characters, and by the later books they're all being influenced by one or many prophecies, which they may or may not be interpreting correctly.

*** I don't know if [[/u/alexanderwales]] has, but I haven't. Keep hearing a lot about it, but it's not all good, so I've been prioritizing other things :) I think I'm concerned that it will basically be another Sword of Truth, in that I'll enjoy the early books and characters, but the plot itself will eventually become a twisted and convoluted mess, and the characters will become caricatures of themselves.

Has anyone read both series and can compare them a bit for me, without spoilers?

**** I haven't read Sword of Truth, and honestly I doubt I can give you an objective assessment of Wheel of Time, since I started reading it at thirteen and my fondness for it is probably influenced a lot by nostalgia.

**** I got about halfway through the first book and then stopped. Most of the analysis I'd heard about the series was that it really started getting good around book four, then there was a stretch from book 6-10 where nothing much happens.

I wanted to read the series mostly because it's one of the big ones, but I have a fairly strict "drop it if I'm not having fun" policy on longer series (i.e. don't throw good money after bad). The prospect of suffering through somewhere between four and seven books that I wouldn't really be enjoying just to get fantasy reader completion credit didn't seem worth it.

***** Oof, yeah, that does seem steep. I've read through a few books that were just "okay" to try and get to the meat of a series before, but if the first one is bad enough I might stop there too. I know I'm going to give it a try eventually, but my current reading list is too packed to really fit it in anywhere.

***** A note: This description has very mild spoilers of the type "Book X has a climax." I didn't feel those were worth spoiler tagging, but I thought I'd mention it here because I have a friend who dislikes even that pauce info.

I've read it 2-3 times. Personally, I think it starts getting good around the last third of book 1, around the time [[#s][very mild spoilers]] The book 6-10 stretch is rough; about 80% of books 6-9 is very slow without much happening. The last time through, I tried the audiobooks, which I highly recommend in general (the readers are excellent) but especially for this stretch. They are slower than reading, but it's easy to tune out and tune back in when something happens.

Books 6 and 10 are probably the worst. To be honest, so little happens in book 10 that I usually recommend skipping it in favor of the plot summary on TarValon.net. There's only 3 or so scenes in it that are worth reading. 6 is just as bad for most of the way, but the book's climax nearly makes up for it.

Books 1-5 and 11-14, though, I found to range from good to excellent. I really appreciate the incorporation and re-working of elements and themes from so many mythologies, as well as the themes of stories that change in the telling ("legend becomes myth, and even myth is long forgotten..") that pervade the whole work, so YMMV if you aren't as into this. 11 is where things start picking up again, but they've been so slow for so long at that point that it's almost hard to notice. Sanderson picks up the pace when he takes over, which is greatly appreciated. His writing style is noticeably different, but everyone I've talked with agrees it's satisfactory. I don't like his quirks as much as Jordan's, but he did a good job: The end of book 12 was one of my moments in the series, and the series climax, which I expected to be kind of a letdown, was ~200 pages of sheer delight.

**** Haven't read SoT, certainly have positive nostalgia bias for WoT, but trying to consider it objectively...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This happens. I found that each plot thread, and the relations between them, remains relatively straightforward and intelligible; the problem is mainly that there are too many threads and progress on each is painfully slow.

#+begin_quote
  the characters will become caricatures of themselves
#+end_quote

This also happens at various points with most of the main cast. The girls have it especially bad.

Both of these issues are worst in books 6-10, and are fixed by end of book 11 or so. (By the end of the series, only one character felt like a caricature, and there were extenuating circumstances.) So yes, the middle books are definitely a slog. But the end is a great success that fulfills the promise of the beginning, rather than being a huge disappointment.

On the comparison between the two, I've heard it said that (to paraphrase) SoT was good when Terry Goodkind was ripping off Robert Jordan, got bad when he stopped, and then got better but more controversial when he started making everyone Objectivists. This was and remains an obviously uncharitable summary. However, if there's any truth in it, I suspect that you won't enjoy WoT quite as much for having read SoT first. A lot of Jordan's strength is in worldbuilding and in incorporating a lot of more subtle mythological cues into the story, making parts feel like familiar things you never knew you knew. It's my understanding that he was among the first to do this well, and it's my belief that he was the best to do it at all[1], but he certainly isn't the only one to have done it. I've heard from some well-read friends that it doesn't do a lot new, which leads me to expect that there is a Seinfield Is Unfunny effect here, an inverse relationship between [Has read lots of high fantasy published since The Eye of the World's release] and [appreciates Wheel of Time on a first read]. Though I can't speak to the effect size, it's possible that having read/enjoyed Sword of Truth has an outsize effect, due to similar tropes appearing in both stories.

[1]: I think Catherine Valente actually does it even better in /Deathless/, but that's a bit different because 1), it's set in the real world, 2), it's in the tradition of magical realism, not high fantasy, and 3), it has more of a folklore vibe than a mythic one.

***** Thanks for the writeup, I can see why that might be offputting for some and enjoyable for others.

Yeah, this is mostly what I'm thinking.

Goodkind did some interesting things in that his stories were pseudo-rationalist: the first book is called Wizard's First Rule, which is, paraphrased, People are Stupid (and can be made to believe anything if they want them to be true enough or are afraid they might be) and each book sort-of explores a different Rule that wizards have to help them understand people and avoid problems interacting with them.

Besides the mostly enjoyable setting and characters of the early books, I enjoyed that aspect of it a lot for obvious reasons, even if I've mostly forgotten the other Rules and doubt many of them would hold up now that I've gotten older and hopefully wiser. Is there anything similar in the WoT series?

****** No; no people or groups have anything resembling rationality advice (or dealing-with-people advice) in Wheel of Time. Not that I recall, anyway. A socially aware reader may learn from the characters' mistakes, but this is true of nearly any story.

Wheel of Time is fairly traditional fantasy that plays all the big tropes pretty straight. There are a few interesting quirks in the magic I suppose, but it's mostly worth reading because it's same old stuff done bigger and better than anywhere else. I love it dearly, but extrapolating your taste from your comments on the podcast, I suspect you may not enjoy it enough to be worth the time/effort.

One further note...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This seems to make the (afaik accurate) observation that Wheel of Time is more polarizing than most series. I suspect this is mostly due to his portrayal of gender. Jordan is a gender essentialist. He isn't malicious or hateful or otherwise negative about it. As far as he's concerned, that's just the way the world is, so it's the way his fantasy world is, too. That would be fairly minor/typical, but the big thing is it's reflected in the structure of the world's metaphysics and magic. Many people, even those who hold different views of gender, are not bothered by this. However, it does put some people off very strongly.

** I saw in your linked post that you said:

#+begin_quote
  Almost every single story that has a prophecy or any kind of "precognition" in it could remain exactly the same, or be improved, by the clean removal of them.
#+end_quote

I think there is one prophecy that falls out of that category, the one from the Lego Movie. It's unique for a specific reason: it's complete ########. To quote the guy the seer: "I made it all up." What are your thoughts on it? I'm not trying to nit-pick your views or anything, I would just like to hear your thoughts on it.

Edit: Just saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z5ooe/d_goddamn_do_i_hate_prophecies/cpfzsjv][this comment]] you made which answers my question. Sorry about that.

*** No problem :) I also talk about it a bit in the episode. Overall it was amusing and mostly well done, but it still acts as a "twist" that subverts the prophecy, while the whole movie you and everyone else has no reason not to treat it like it's real. Plus, he really does end up being the hero that saves the day, so...

** From a story structure perspective, what about prophecies that are resolved towards the beginning of the story, as the inciting incident? For example, a post-apocalyptic story where there was a prophecy in the backstory about what would set off the apocalypse? In this case, the prophecy doesn't so much drive the plot directly as it establishes the legitimacy of the source.

*** Sure, that's less egregious in that it affects less things, but again, what's the point of it being there at all? Why even include a prophecy that would fortell of the apocalypse if you're going to just start the story after it already happened? Doesn't its very existence bring up a whole bunch of new questions that need to be addressed? Why not just have the cataclysmic event occur without the prophecy?

**** "Doesn't its very existence bring up a whole bunch of new questions that need to be addressed?" is exactly what I'm getting at. Include the prophecy /only/ to point at the power that went into making it, and put the prophecy's realization in the story's past to avoid comparatively been-there-done-that not-as-clever-as-the-author-thinks questions like "what does the prophecy mean" and "is the prophecy infallible". Its narrative purpose is to give the faction that already trusted the prophecy a "told you so" quality.

***** Ahh, I see, so you've basically got some doomsayers that turned out to be right lording it over everyone else and getting converts and followers because of it?

In such a case there's really no reason to make it explicit that the prophecy really existed, unless you /want/ that faction to be seen as the obviously-correct-and-sensible-group, which kind of feels like cheating, but if it's supposed to be part of some bigger twist I guess it can work.

If you /don't/ plan on having that faction actually be right about everything, then just have them talk about the prophecy but don't make it clear that it actually happened exactly as they said it would. Leave it up to speculation, make them seem like maybe they just got lucky to a critical thinker in the story.

It really depends what kind of story it is. Without more details it's hard for me to judge, but I feel like using a magically ineffable source of knowledge to establish the legitimacy of some higher power or faction's goodness/rightness is, again, cheating :)
