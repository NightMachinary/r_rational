** Chapters like this one makes me understand the actions of Dread Emperors a lot more.

Cat lost her way. She used to be known as someone who'd bring a sword and bottle of cheap wine to the table. Then tell the other party that although the wine is shit it's arguably better than getting stabbed.

Just fucking kill them all, Cat.

Heroes aren't invincible. The Angels aren't infallible OR immortal and The Story is NOT set in stone.

If you need help, scry Black. He's sure to have good advice on handling the Pilgrim. The Saint is not overly a problem since she's old and there are hard limits to her power. The other useless angelic toe kissers already fear her power because she has already sent two of them to their ancestors and it would have been a team wipe had the Pilgrim not interfered.

Replenish your entire numbers by raising them again as Winter Zombies which was proven resistant to the priests' efforts. Their purpose is not to bleed the heroes, but to bleed the Proceran mercenaries and fantassins. Have Larat ride in the back and murder the last of their supply lines. Even if the Heroes got some bullshit second wind, what the fuck can they do against The Woe backed by a FULL army?

Win? No! If that were the case why haven't we seen a single overlord heroic Named? Why does the Grey Pilgrim need an army to wage war against Praes? Why doesn't he simply walk by himself into Ater and topple the tower? Or the Saint, for all her bullshit holy war mantra?

Conservation of Ninjutsu demands they'd both come out victorious, no? Two Old Veterans standing against the approaching Darkness wreathed in Light ONE last time. Fucking hells they'd even have a Story of it. So why haven't they done that yet?

The only reason I can conceive is that for all the heroic second wind bullshit, the dickheads above have limits to what extent they can interfere. Keyword being LIMITS.

Again, they're not invulnerable, they're not invincible. They can bleed. They can die. So kill them. KILL THEM ALL! The BLOOD GOD DEMANDS SACRIFICE!!

This world runs on narrativium, and these heroes are numerous and powerful. She might beat the odds and whipe them out, but the heavens cheat and someone will rise from the dead with a powerup or some other BS deus ex machina will go off and Cat will end up dead. She'll manage to kill all but one, or she'll manage to kill them all but still lose as a Hero sacrifices themselves to defeat the evil queen.

The more the Good v Evil narrative is enforced, the worse Cat is fucked. The more it's undercut the stronger Cat is. Playing too much hardball during negotiations enforces that narrative. The more Cat tries to de-escalate, the less people she kills, the weaker that narrative becomes.

**** "Except those Dread Emperors you mention always die."

They die because they don't deign to make lasting reforms that will survive them, instead embracing their stupid Bond Villain philosophy. They also die because they're surrounded by scheming assholes that live on a bullshit Klingon promotion philosophy.

Black and Malicia are living proof that villains can last long enough to bring about lasting reforms and Cat was a direct pupil of the Knight. My main point in Cat killing them all is to make Cordelia realize that Callow is not a country to be fucked with. Cat forgot one of Black's cardinal lessons in that you never negotiate from a position of weakness. She'd have an easier time getting Cordelia to sign the accords if she breaks the spine of this Crusade and then takes an oath that she would not invade Procer and would provide assistance to the Principate should the Dead King make a return or any of the other forces of Evil. After that's dealt with she can begin implementing lasting reforms that would survive her.

Regarding the Deus Ex Machina, need I remind you that Triumphant and Black have killed a lot of heroic monsters? For all their second wind bullshit they are NOT immortal OR invincible! This is added to the fact that Cat is not even truly a villain! Her Name is weak enough to be non-existent (and Squire is by default a Neutral Name) and unless she delves deep into Winter she doesn't even have a Role so to speak. So she can neatly sidestep all the bullshit stories because remember, stories only care about Named and they don't apply to mundane plebs or "others".

So all those Deus Ex Machina shit you talked about Black undoubtedly already knows and knowing the Carrion Lord he has a plan to deal with that.

"She'll manage to kill all but one, or she'll manage to kill them all but still lose as a Hero sacrifices themselves to defeat the evil queen."

Evil? Is defending your homeland from invaders by killing them all Evil? In what sense is that Evil? Let's not forget who threw the first fucking stone here. Cat in no way provoked Procer. She even offered the Pilgrim free fast travel directly to the REAL capital Evil country but he refused out some bullshit principle. She made every single reasonable concession to avoid bloodshed but the other side are being obstinate assholes. This Story is NOT about heroes heroically venturing forward to liberate a country so they DON'T have the narrative weight. And as I said, raise the dead army to decimate the Proceran forces and have Thief whisper to the mercenaries that there's better pay and less death fighting on Callow's side. For all their powers the Heroes would not be able to stand against an army backed by three Named and the last titled Fae Noble. Replenish the ranks with the dead and mercenaries. Meet up with Hakram and Kegan and join Black at Vale and kick Klaus Pappenheim's teeth in.

But that's the fun thing to do. Let's rather do the boring thing and try to negotiate with the assholes who broke into your house, screwed your wife, broke your flat screen and had the nerve to tell you it's your fault. That is imminently more reasonable.

***** This is a *Practical* Guide to Evil, not a Fun Guide to Evil and personally, I like reading about the diplomacy and politics. Also I'm not just speculating and making shit up here either. From Cat herself

#+begin_quote
  I wasn't sure what Akua's plan had been but it hardly mattered. While it looked like she might have been getting the better of the fight with the heroes, fighting them at all was a mistake as far as I was concerned. Even if I killed a few they'd still get me in the end.
#+end_quote

You're not entirely wrong though, there are plenty of reasons to think Cat and Co might be able to beat the Heroes. However there are also plenty of unknowns and a heavy element of chance. Cat could very well best the Heroes, but it's an inherently risky proposition and its just as possible she'll lose.

Maybe you just see her as a character in a book, but from her own perspective she is a person who doesn't want to risk death if she doesn't have to. The Woe are her friends not just combat assets. An all out battle puts them at risk. Furthermore it puts Callow at risk.

But here's the clincher:

The longer the ceasefire, the more she negotiates in good faith, the weaker the Good v Evil narrative gets and the better the chances of Cat winning if everything does go to shit. Secondly, the Procean army is out of food and so the longer this ceasefire lasts the weaker the enemy army gets.

Simply put, even if negotiations fail Cat will still have gained relative advantage.

***** Yeah well, the problem is that if said spine is broken Hasenbach loses any reason to negotiate. Levantine armies will be joining them, who will be /livid/ with rage if their Grey Pilgrim is dead. And remember this - No man/woman rules alone. Just as the high lords act as a sort of counterbalance to the tower's power, the princes supporting Hasenbach will not hesitate to turn on her if she comes off as weak.

What happens if Cat just "kills them all"? Well all prospects of long term peace with Procer (which is a small part of what she wants btw) goes straight out the window.

Why would Cat do something that would destroy the culmination of /years/ of her work and planning?

"But Hasenbach would realise that Callow is not a country to be fucked with, so she'll sue for peace."

... is not what is going to happen. If Hasenbach attempted that, she would immediately be overthrown by less reasonable princes and Cat will have a fight to the death with the entirety of Procer and the Levant (which will greatly appreciated by /Malicia/ by the way, who you've seem to have forgotten the existence of).

Oh, sure, she might even /win/ that fight. But then she just becomes another card carrying villain, who will eventually be overthrown. Black and Malicia, for all their ruthlessness, only have the fear they inflict to protect their precious institutions. I have no doubt that the next dread emperor/empress who comes along will gut the reforms and cause the downfall of Praes proportional to their victory. Cat wants the shit the does to survive /past/ her. Hell she even considered abdication as an option and seriously considered whether it would have more merits.

Just think of how much fun you could have if you just put ya middle finger to everything and embrace the role of Evil. Look at Kyros, he gets it. Sure those darn tootin heroes would eventually kick your ass but if you do it well, like Triumphant (may she return), you will be able to seriously ruin Procer's shit. Levant too, when they come bitching about their beloved Pilgrim.

Though she doesn't know it yet, if Levant and the rest of the continent take arms against her she'd have the backing of the entire Free Cities under the effective rule of the Tyrant of Helike. Sure he'd backstab her down the line but hey, omelette and eggs. And hey, you might even get resurrected, like Dread Emperor Revenant before you. It even works with the whole Callowan grudge thing. "Not even Death will stop me from having my revenge!" For MORE fun!

So come on Cat, throw common sense to the wind and teach Calernia to fear Callow...

... But you won't do that, will you? It doesn't jive with the reasons you took power, does it? You need motivation.

Don't worry.

I'm sure the Saint will give you ample motivation soon enough, like a dead member of The Woe. Or Juniper. I wonder then, once you've lost someone that close to you and not just the thousands of nameless mooks, if you'd still want to negotiate peace. I wonder if you'd be able to shut up and multiply then.

Because it is said that when we are in most need of our art, is the time when we're the most likely to forget it...

*** Blood for the Blood God.

Honestly, I rather agree, we're it not for the fact that she claims she's trying to prevent further loss of life.

Still, them saying they can't negotiate in good faith means all of this talk is meaningless.

I'm seriously surprised she hasn't employed a Scry and Die strategy at this point. For all the talk of assassination teams using portals to kill enemy monarchs and generals being seen as a major threat, using it on the battlefield seems to be common sense. Use Masego and the Observatory to locate heroes than can be ambushed or abducted (or their bodies taken, at least, so they can be disposed of with goblin fire). Use your portals (in quick "tied off" forms) to create murder holes in space through which your allies (or remaining repeating siege engine, or Archer) can launch attacks. Oh, the heroes might be able to turn this around? Fine, use it to pick off the sergeants and captains. That'll cause more chaos in the enmy ranks anyway.

Her not knowing Saints location is criminal. Oh, they have a set range you can't put a scrying sensor? Put one ABOVE and use it as a spotter. Or just have some dedicated goblins with spyglasses keeping track of Hero movements on the battlefield.

Cat is using her powers fairly poorly right now, but more annoyingly, she is not using her brain very well. I can only hope it is part of a cunning plot waiting to be revealed. There are enough characters whose actions are hidden from us that this is quite possible.

They said they couldn't negotiate in good faith under the terms of "negotiations between the Kingdom of Callow and the...invading army." Which was their polite way of initiating the haggling session that ended with the "Queen in Callow and mandated expeditionary force" compromise. They weren't declaring a refusal to negotiate in good faith /at all,/ just pushing for a concession on the "invading army" language, which would have put them at a disadvantage right off the bat.

As for the rest--the whole point of this arc is that Cat is trying to achieve her goals without resorting to the kind of villainous escalation that will, per narrative logic, fuck her and Callow over in the long run. If she wants to restore Callow as a lasting, functional kingdom that won't fall apart when she dies, she has to work within the system to an extent.
