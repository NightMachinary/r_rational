** Seems strange to suggest these factors are hidden, when in reality it is obvious that external factors effect our enjoyment of things, including art.

But getting from there to suggest that this is the main aspect which makes many different forms of art great is a big leap, which was not proven in the video.

So until actual research supports the claim this the video is nothing more than a hypothesis.

*** I've found that things that make sense pretty much always seem obvious, once they're said. But if you ask people before, they can't tell you.

**** I mean that for example when I was evaluating why I liked a particular song or a particular type of food It was one of the factors I was considering. So this video didn't actually suggest any new factor, it just claimed that this factor is actually the main one.

***** The claim is that external factors /influence/ our view, not that they /determine/ our view. You seem to be arguing against the second claim.

Also, regarding that this isn't a new factor. I've always asked people, when proposing this, to please direct me to where this was previously studied or discussed. They've never shown me where. I've seen Apparatus Theory (which says that film influences our view of the real world, this is the opposite), and Structuralism (which relates art to other art by saying that common structures work well, not that external emotions play a major part). And some spotty mentions in a few papers on marketing research (which found the different ratings for the same product in different contexts but guessed wrong at the cause), and one mention that associated emotions play a part in people's rating of music that didn't go any further. And that's it.

So PLEASE, show me where this has been said so I can look into it. I've been trying to find out for a long time. So far, the only conclusion I've been able to draw was that people have a vague inkling of it that they don't quite understand, and it just SEEMS that it's been known or isn't new once this is clearly explained, purely BECAUSE it's clearly explained.

well, from the video explained it I cannot be 100% sure this was the intention, but from the phrasing they used I got the impression they were suggesting its the framing which makes something "A masterpiece". It didn't suggest that there is no such thing as good or bad art based on the technique etc. but from the way it was said they either suggested a bunch of art currently considered to be really good to actually not be good, but just have the right story to elicit that feeling in enough people for them to consider it a masterpiece even though its not actually good. Or it suggest no art is -really- a masterpiece, and that what make something a masterpiece is the story of it.

about studies I don't actually have any studies to one direction or the other. but the point is neither does the author of the video. he just brought up those suggestions and was trying to show how the fit\explain a bunch of stuff. but that is not research. to research this would be to prove statistically that X number of pieces of art only became special after their sad story got publicity, or somesuch.

******* The video says specifically that the internal quality of the art itself is about half of what matters, while the external factors are the other half.

"No one has ever painted an artistic masterpiece, at least as we understand it" is similar to saying that no one has ever passed the 30-foot mark on the long jump without crossing the foul line.

Regarding studies, this actually relates to several studies that have been done that found this result, but didn't find the proper explanation. Here's one done at King's College in 1983 ([[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060914114727/http://www.psy.jhu.edu/%7Elapd/dl/coke2.pdf][http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060914114727/http://www.psy.jhu.edu/~lapd/dl/coke2.pdf]]), where they gave people the same drinks and changed the labels and letters of them, and it continually changed people's rating. They could not offer an actual explanation for it, mainly just reported the result. The idea here explains studies like this. But of course, in all social sciences, you can ALWAYS well-poison data. It's unfortunate, but we can still learn from doing it, and people have to look at and understand the actual idea to determine its validity.

** Interesting, but less profound or new than you might think. I'm sure context and ideas and narrative affect art. They're also not the only things that do so. As often happens in this kind of essay or video, the author overstates the case. I found myself skipping forward and listening to it in bits and pieces. Poor choice of soundtrack.

*** I occasionally see this type of reply and don't understand it. "Yes you said something effects art, but other things do too." Well yeah. You don't want to see a 72-hour video though, right?

Also, if you know a precursor to this, please link to it. I would be interested to see.
