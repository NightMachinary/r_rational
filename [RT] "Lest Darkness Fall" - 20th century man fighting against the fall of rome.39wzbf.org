Lest Darkness Fall is the story of an archaeologist and latin scholar who finds himself in the 500s AD, with Rome in decline and barbarians at the gates. He makes it his personal mission to preserve learning, civilization, and scientific reason through any means necessary.

Most notably, the author doesn't give the protagonist any unrealistic advantages. The hero has to learn the vulgar latin of the times, and has no knowledge beyond that of an educated man of his era. Many of his experiments fail.

To give you a taste, he gets his first break by approaching a moneylender, challenging his best scribes to a complicated division problem, and offering to sell the secrets of double-column accounting.

I personally don't have a great love for 19th century classics, but this is one of the very few that I truly enjoyed.

If you have any recommendations for other such stories, let them fly!

*** [[#s][Re: Ending Spoilers]] I suppose things sort of start going his way by the end of the book and he ends up a little sue-ish; that's fair. To give a brutally honest review: the story itself isn't a great page-turner - it's a decent concept with good execution at the start, with a mediocre end that ties up the loose ends and gives the story a satisfactory conclusion but not much else. It is the best "rational" take on modern-man-in-ancient-times I've seen, I'm quite glad I read it, and if that's what you're looking for, I think you (the prospective reader who visits [[/r/rational]]) will enjoy it too.

**** There's no actual sequel, although there is a unofficial 'sequel' of sorts written by S.M.

*** Why would you want people to buy it? My usual reason for paying for a free thing is to support the creation of similar things, but the author's been dead for 15 years already, and I suspect that the publishers (etc) aren't getting much of a cut from it either.

**** The money goes to the author's family, I presume. It would be better to donate to charity, I admit, but I didn't think of doing that. Also some people might prefer to read it in print or have the official ebook rather than read it on scribd.

*** You mention that it is available for free. Do you just mean the scribd version? Because that makes for a pretty bad reading experience, what with all the clutter everywhere. I also neither have a kindle nor do I prefer print (or the shipping cost larger than the actual price that would be attached to it) so if you found a plain PDF version that'd be great.

Edit: Never mind. Found a way to remove anything that was bothering me.

** I just read through the whole book and I must say that while it shows lots of promise, stays interesting enough throughout and made me smile often enough it is pretty lacking in any kind of emotion or really human seeming interaction with the environment. To be honest I would say that after [[#s][]] it all reads a bit like less than awesome SI fanfiction of the "problem-fixing" kind.

*** I'm glad some people enjoyed it! Thanks for posting.

Here are some books I haven't read, but might fit the bill: (synopsis stolen from elsewhere)

*"Household Gods", by Harry Turtledove and some other author. An American woman sick of bumping against the glass ceiling dropped into Rome in 2nd century AD. Sounds very similar to me. Turtledove writes a lot of alternate history books.

*Zelazny's "Roadmarks". Protagonist is traveling down the Road of Time with a pickup truck full of automatic weapons to help the Greeks beat the Persians at Marathon. (apparently he has adventures along the Road). This doesn't sound quite the same, but Zelazny has a dry wit I think the folks here would like.
