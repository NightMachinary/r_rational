*** You know...that would make a LOT of sense. Back in Chapter 26, after Red Robe wormed the info on the aranea out of Zach's mind, Quatach-Ichl said "The aranea were never part of--" before being cut off by RR leaving, the unsaid part most likely being "the time loop". I always wondered how he would know, since his only info should have come from RR - but your explanation provides a very good reason why he might know so surely.

The one contradicton, though, is that he /is/ also the one who dumped Zorian into the loop via soul-blending. I mean, that particular result /was/ unexpected in every sense possible, but if he really did use to be a looper, you'd think he'd have a more sophisticated plan of attack against a potential time looper.

Er, no. The professional opinion of the Filigree Sages was that the Cyorian aranea had zero chance of reading the lich's mind. That thing's had a thousand years to gather every kind of magic it can find, with no moral compass worth mentioning. Even if you could somehow get into his mind, you might as well invade hell: highly unpleasant and quickly fatal (or worse).

** Mother of Learning fanart I made while waiting in between chapters:

[[http://i.imgur.com/z7W9gc7.jpg][Zorian and Quatach poster.]]

[[http://i.imgur.com/DZcUowt.jpg][No text version.]]

I originally drew this as a poster to have printed for the wall, but it can also be used as a cover for anyone who wanted to print out a hard copy for offline reading. It looks pretty badass in full-res. Detail shot [[http://i.imgur.com/l9plevE.jpg][Zorian]] and [[http://i.imgur.com/o6eJ6Db.jpg][Quatach Ichl]].

I followed the written descriptions as best as I could, but filled in the gaps with artistic license, thus the schoolboy uniform for Zorian. Here is the original rough [[http://i.imgur.com/UCsdjau.jpg][concept sketch]] and an older drawing of [[http://i.imgur.com/4RyBayz.jpg][Red Robe]] shooting purple laser beams, whose design was inspired by the wizards of Magicka. He's not as cool and imposing as Quatach Ichl.

  A sudden gust of air blew the dust away and a gaunt humanoid figure stepped into view. Zorian actually gasped in surprise as he took in the appearance of the thing in front of them. It was a skeleton wreathed in sickly green light. Its bones were black with a strange metallic sheen, as if they were not bones at all, but rather a facsimile of a skeleton made out of some kind of black metal. Encased in gold-decorated armor, with a scepter held tightly in one of its skeletal hands and a crown full of purple gemstones, the creature looked like some long-dead king risen from the dead.

An exception came when Zorian start making physics communication discs (no, not really). Without a psychic to test the creation, spell forge cannot design a working formula. However, if the formula design is to be leaked, any spell forge can just build them.

#+begin_quote
  what I had been trying to build up to was that spell formula are... support magic. Magic affecting other magic. By itself, even the most elegant spell formula is merely a theoretical exercise. You need to actually cast the spells and anchor them to the spell formula before it's of any use. I note this because Ilsa seemed to think your skill in invocations would do you no good in my subject, which annoyed me because it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the discipline.

********** That passage clearly explain the important of invocation skill in testing unfinished spell formula. But, the word 'anchor' confused me. Isn't the spell formula act as mana shaper? You supply it with mana, and boom, a spell is invoked.

But I suppose a formula is a tool which it's user need to know what limitation it has and how to use it. Otherwise, you cannot cramp 3 spell formula into one tiny ring (it involves overlapping geometry that only activates if supplied with correct mana shape) or use multiple kind of magic missile in just one spell rod. If I understand this right, Kael must be really good at making his banishing silver coin. Zorian only need to supply it with mana and it worked just fine.

*********** What you're thinking of are auto casters, very hard to make and not very useful beyond basic spells. The rods we saw at the start allowed to skip some of the steps to allow for very quick casting, but they still needed someone with a soul to cast the spell. And anchoring the spell is the act of casting the spell for the spell formula.

The spell formula has to constantly drain mana to stay active, if it runs out the spell has to be recast. Here's a quote from the author on the matter:

#+begin_quote
  Wards, not having souls, cannot cast anything. So once the spells used in their construction are cast, they never really turn off. If they were to ever completely shut down, they would have to be remade from scratch before they could work again.
#+end_quote

I think you're confused because of what spell formulas have been shown to do, but what you have to realize is that by putting lots of mana into a defensive ward you're just strengthening a spell that's already there.

Also the coin had been anchored with Kael spell, so Zorian didn't have to do anything, the coin was likely just staying active thanks to ambient mana. Once it touched the lich it "released" the spell Kael had already set up on it.

**** Kael's teacher was his mother in law. Presumably he got introduced to Silverlake through her, with both being traditional witches and all. Considering she didn't even know his teacher and wife were dead the relationship wasn't so close.

At this point there's little reason to deal with Silverlake. He initially wanted an expert's opinion about the loop and defense against soul magic, but he already got both from different sources. I think the Grey Hunter is more likely to be relevant, since it's a go to for that magic sense training Zorian wanted.

Maybe, but I kind of wonder about this. The five parts of the Key are tied to the loop, and for a Controller to collect them is significant (it increases his/her authorisation level). It's not unthinkable that they would follow a Controller who collected them - especially since you have to present them to the Guardian, and you can only visit it via projection. But yes, it's also entirely possible that they have to be collected in the same iteration.

In a normal story, obtaining the crown would be saved for last, there would be an epic showdown in the Final Loop, a mad scramble for the gate with moments left before the End...

In this one, I see a few things -

1. They'll try to get QI's crown at the end of EVERY loop from now on, unless they don't make it to the invasion (aka, die early)

2. There's a mad scramble at the end and they DON'T make it to the gate before the End... but there's an admin failsafe that dumps them into Guardian-space anyway, because that would be sensible.

3. They'll try to get QI's crown at the end of every loop, but it'll come down to the last few possible loops anyway just because it's just so freaking hard.

** So...what skills would a Controller practise inside a black room?

I can think of:

- Soul awareness meditation

- Deep memory probing, /if/ Zorian/Xvim/someone can bully Zach into admitting he needs to get checked.

- Learning new spells (hexagonal shield!), and/or making casting flawless. This depends on whether they have a resilient target inside the room, and whether their mana recharges normally. (Of course, given that Zorian's magic missile training method involved dropping the power of the missiles, Zach could probably practice it on him if need be.)

- Unstructured mental defences, for Zach.

- Going through the contents of any caches they find, eg the ones mentioned by Zach (lich sanctum, demon-worshipping cult treasury, vault under Marbolkano).

- General reading, especially whatever they can find about the Ikosian emperor.

Any more exciting possibilities?

***** Yeah. I just thought of them in particular because Zorian used to do them while he wandered around in the countryside. I'm not sure if skills-training shaping is something Zorian should prioritize. Given that he's probably good enough at shaping to proficiently cast most spells, and that there's now a time-limit, I think it'll be more useful for him to take books and add spells to his arsenal, as you've mentioned. Zach, on the other hand, could certainly benefit from additional skill at shaping, but I'm not sure if it's important enough when compared with the other options.

One thing that occurred to me while writing this, however, is that by bringing in tools and materials, Zorian could spend the whole time making golems and working spell formulas to prepare for the invasion or the likely key-collecting boss fights. That's lower-priority until they know where all the keys are, though.

Being able to make artifacts well allows him to use any preparation time he has to counter specific threats, while Zach relies heavily on battering them down through force.

** The more time goes on, the more I realize that Zorian is a super unreliable PoV about his brothers. In this chapter, we see:

#+begin_quote
  "That is an interesting idea," Zorian said after a short pause. "I'm not sure how effective it would really be, but it's worth a try. In fact, it kind of reminds me of the fact I do have some small amount of reflected fame myself, courtesy of my older brother. It might be a good idea to see if I can get something with that. That didn't work too well for me in the past, but back then I clearly wasn't a magical prodigy like Daimen. Now, I can effectively pass myself off as a second coming of Daimen by demonstrating some of the magical proficiency I picked up in the time loop."

  Zach gave him a surprised look.

  "Yeah, I know," Zorian said unhappily. "It kind of rankles to rely on Daimen like that, but desperate times call for desperate measures."

  Zach just shook his head in amusement, not saying anything.
#+end_quote

Obviously, Zach is surprised that Zorian is willing to do anything involving Damien, but Zorian interprets it as "Zach, like me, thinks everything involving Damien is awful. This is a normal thought." My vote to Zorian for most thickheaded empath!

When Zach punches Zorian on the train platform, Fortov comes hurrying over. When Fortov sees everything's okay, he leaves without speaking to Zorian. Afterwards, commenting on it, Kirielle points out that Fortov can be considerate, in his way...

#+begin_quote
  "He knows that neither of us can stand him, so he keeps away," Kirielle said casually, doing her best to snatch the little animated water drakes flying around her out of the air. Zorian and Zach had competed earlier to see who can create more realistic-looking drakes out of the surrounding rainwater, so the entire shield bubble was still full of them. Zorian was pretty sure he won, but Kirielle was the judge and she claimed she couldn't tell the difference. The little traitor.

  "I don't think he's that considerate," Zorian scowled. "He just didn't feel like spending time on us. He had better things to do than waste time on his younger siblings."

  "No, I'm pretty sure he knows you hate him," Kirielle said, shaking her head. "He even said so when we were alone once. It's why he tries to avoid you if he can help it. He thinks he's doing you a favor."

  Zorian frowned. He supposed he hadn't been terribly subtle about his opinion about Fortov, so he wasn't really surprised that Fortov knew. He did find it hard to accept that Fortov's behavior was motivated by anything other than his selfishness, though. If he wanted to do Zorian a favor, why was it that he still came to Zorian from time to time to ask for favors? That was the worst reason possible for approaching him -- the whole reason why he hated Fortov was because he always had to make up for Fortov's failures to do his job in addition to his own duties.

  "So you think I'm being too harsh with him?" Zorian asked curiously. Before he had gotten stuck in the time loop, the mere insinuation that this was the case would have been the equivalent of throwing a lit match in a bowl of lamp fuel. Now he found himself honestly curious about what Kirielle thought about the topic.

  "No. Yes. Maybe," Kirielle said. "I mean, he's still a jerk and I don't like him either. So I know how you feel. But maybe us being mean to him back isn't the correct thing to do. Maybe he'd be better if we were more patient with him. I'm not. I try being nice to him sometimes, but he makes it very hard."

  "Yeah, I'll bet," Zorian snorted derisively.

  "You know, I'm getting the idea that your family is a little messed up," Zach said.

** This is a bit late, but here's a prediction for the next chapter:

The polyglot teacher, Zenomir, the one who initially told Zorian about ancient Majara language, is one of the high-ranking members of the Cult of the Dragon Below. Not only was he familiar enough with Majara language to know what language it was upon hearing an imperfect transcript of a spell heard only once, months before, but he was also able to accurately determine that it was a soul magic spell. The latter would imply that he is familiar with soul magic himself, and the efficiency with which Zorian was targeted afterwards to be assassinated seems to be too much of a coincidence.

For that to happen without Zenomir himself being a member would mean that either Zenomir immediately informed the wrong person about Zorian's experience without making efforts to confirm his claims, and that he also specifically mentioned Zorian's name to that person. Or alternately, that his mind was read after he mentioned this to the wrong person, which would also be careless and odd, coming from a teacher at that institute.

So yeah, Zenomir is most likely involved with the Cult. That's my prediction.

** Re taking over the rat swarm: I don't think that Zorian needs a specialised item to bind a rat to the swarm. His existing mind control and locator spells should be sufficient.

If he dominates two cranium rats, he should be able to make them telepathically connect to each other. He should then be able to dominate them as one entity - which would still be weak enough to easily control. Then he can use locator spells to find more rats, and add them to his competing hive mind. Until a) the original hive mind stops and talks to him; b) he takes over /all/ of the rats; or c) he reaches the limit of how large a hive mind he can control, at which point he has probably largely achieved his objective (subverting the swarm) anyway.

At some point along the way, his swarm will probably even become large enough to reach out and collect the disowned rats without needing to dominate them first.
