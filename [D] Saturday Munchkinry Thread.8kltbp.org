Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You're given a choice between two weak versions of the Death Note: a Happy Note or a Sad Note. When a person's name is written in the Happy/Sad Note, their entire utility function is modified such that they feel slightly happier/sadder about everything (by the same amount). (It's hard to quantify happiness, but let's say, roughly the amount of happiness an average person would get from hearing a good joke.) When their name is erased from the Happy/Sad Note, their utility function returns to normal.

Which Note do you choose and what do you do with it? What unorthodox uses for these Notes are there?

*** I think it would be morally repugnant to rewrite someone's utility function without their consent. Whether we do that by just speaking to people in our day-to-day lives is debatable. I'm just going to stop considering the moral implications for now, but I wouldn't use either notebook without examining the question further.

Both notebooks are useful for forming associations. Want people to help you more at work? Happy note them for ten minutes after they help you. Want someone famous to quit using twitter? Sad note them for a few minutes every time you see a new tweet.

In general, I think it's easier to use the happy note to get what you want--you can happy note anyone you are about to interact with, and let the positive associations do work. Let's consider only the happy note, for now. You could become a behavioral psychotherapist or devious salesperson. You wanted unorthodox uses, though...

Embarrass and befuddle public figures by making them smile inappropriately during speeches and debates.

Form a medium-size cult by giving your brainwashing sessions a boost.

Become a very successful comedian by having your patrons sign in before performances.

Make babies on planes stop crying through introductions and small talk with their parents.

Make any club or activity more compelling to the members. (That's why they have pizza!) Actually, we're back to the mundane.

In the limit of trying to get every human being on Earth to sign a page of the notebook, with the ability to tear out five regenerating pages (at a time) per second, and 30 names per page, it would take you about a year and a half of continuous tearing to supply enough happy note pages. You'd need a network of people to distribute the pages. Perhaps talk to James Randi, then the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Anyway, with four hours tearing pages out per day you could supply enough material to improve the happiness of everyone on Earth in less than a decade. You'd also develop really tone forearms.

That's assuming a machine can't tear the pages out, without compromising the power. (I assume machine writing doesn't work on the notebook.) If a machine can tear pages out, you need to set up a printing press. You might even put your ideology on each sheet of paper, so that people think they not only get a happiness boost but that it comes from them agreeing to behave how you want them to behave.

Trying to get the world to not freak out about signing contracts with direct psychological consequences is another aspect I'll not consider for now.

I don't think the Happy Note is strong enough for this. Being on a plane is an absolutely stressful experience when you don't have any idea what is going on.

Every little smile, sure, but also every time we don't complain or get exasperated or fail to make eye contact. Each point of contact has the opportunity to improve or deteriorate the life experience of not just the person we contact, but every person they contact for the rest of the day, the week, the month, the year, their life.

** The setting is a virtual reality videogame with full immersion. The game is composed of duels to exhaustion.

Your avatar is your mental image of your self. Moving through the simulation feels like moving through reality. You can equip yourself with weapons and armor by visualizing them in sufficient detail. The game does physics simulations on objects after they are created.

Some rules:

- Stronger visualization means a stronger object.
- Practice makes perfect for visualizing objects, and it's easier to visualize named things from real life.
- It's easier to maintain an object than to create a new one.
- An object's appearance can vary, but simulation-wise everything has identical density.
- Larger objects, more objects, distant objects, hidden objects, objects moving independent of simulation, and transforming objects are harder to visualize--they require more will to create and maintain.
- You can't materialize an object inside of another.
- Colliding objects tend to bounce off each other with deformations that cost will to reverse (or a small constant level of will to accept). Stronger objects deform less, and slow collisions don't damage either object.
- The above means that sharp objects inflict greater 'damage' (cost to will) on objects that aren't sharp, depending on how they collide.
- Spending more will can make a weaker object outlast a stronger one with repeated collisions.
- Objects vanish when players choose to stop visualizing them, or are forced to stop from exhaustion.
- A duel is lost when a player's brain is too tired to keep the mental image of self coherent. IE, your HP and Mana are the same: your ability to concentrate. The game rough-estimates willpower as an HP bar.
- Direct collision between an avatar and an object is much more mentally taxing for the player who owns the avatar.
- Duels take place on an infinite featureless plane with consistent lighting.

Finally, for the sake of scale, assume that at most you can maintain a visualization of 100 cubic meters of ephemeral unmoving blocks, or 10 cubic centimeters of inviolate material, without draining your will excessively rapidly.

Under these conditions, how would you go about becoming a successful and skilled player of this video game?

What sorts of avenues would you explore regarding fighting style?

How would you counter the strategies of others?

Do you just mean this as in, normal physics? Or is there an actual sharpness bonus? In other words, are we going to be rewarded for visualizing pincushion armors? Should everyone just turn themselves into Hedgehogs with spikes everywhere?

Does complexity matter? E.g. does a crossbow cost more to visualize than a cube of the same volume? I'm assuming it does, otherwise victory goes to whoever designs the greatest tiny non-self-moving machines.

Also what about objects that don't move, but exert forces on other objects? For example, can you visualize a magnet? Then visualize magnetic stuff and move them around with your magnets? To make this not game breaking, the visualization cost should scale upwards with the amount of force exerted, otherwise players would be able to visualize ridiculously powerful railguns.

Is there gravity? If so, the next question is how hard is it to fly? Can you repeatedly visualize a board under your feet to jump off as soon as it appears? Having the high ground offers a great advantage if there is gravity, so there will be a lot of players researching different methods of flight to find the cheapest ones. For example: visualizing compressed springs under you that immediately decompress, shooting you upwards (or in whatever direction you prefer).

Once you get above your opponent you can just start visualizing stuff to drop on them, while they will have difficulty fighting back since they would either have to visualize stuff near you (which is far from them and thus costs a ton) or visualize stuff that moves itself towards you (which is self-moving and so costs a ton). At sufficiently great heights, you wouldn't even need to visualize heavy blocks to crush them flat. Just visualize needles, they're deadly enough and very hard to see, making them hard to dodge.

Excellent strategy! Preventing objects from falling requires will, however--they aren't static once created. Flying has a will cost, so a counter-strategy might be to flee in some direction and wait for the flyer's willpower to deplete. Running on the ground is nearly free. Also, falling and hitting the ground strains your avatar, so having to dodge while flying is high risk.

Can you visualize gases, or things that will turn into gases? For example, can you visualize a block of dry ice, which will rapidly create a suffocating fog? (Do you need to breathe? If not, it is still a good smokescreen.)

What about radioactive material? Does it count as a transforming object? Can I visualize a chunk of uranium large enough to explode (or any bomb really), killing us both? I would win if I visualized it closer to the enemy than myself!

*** Imagine a large sphere, with a single spike on the bottom, pointing down. Imagine this directly over the opponent's avatar. The huge boulder gives it a lot of weight, and the needle underneath puts all that weight on a point - it's really simple, so it's easy to create, and if I pile my willpower into the /point/ of the needle, then the rest of the boulder doesn't use much will. Sure, creating that at a distance will take a lot out of me, but it's going to be rather difficult to defend against... it should smash that point through any armour unless I'm /totally/ outgunned in the Will department.

A single spike is easily dodged, though the huge boulder isn't. I can think of two counters: either don't get close enough for the enemy to visualize a huge boulder above you, or put your own objects above you. Visualize a whip and spin it around above yourself. Since objects can't be visualized within other objects, your enemy won't be able to visualize a boulder where your whip is. He would be forced to visualize it further up in the air, costing more will and making it easier for you to dodge.

** I need help exploiting a setting I've designed.

Basically, imagine you have access to an alternate earth with no people in it, but otherwise almost identical to the normal world. Text, logos, and other aesthetic stuff is scrambled. It fixes itself when people aren't around, and it usually only takes around 24 hours to reset.

Furthermore, large enough structures turn into dungeons. Dungeons are infinite, based on the building it grew from, and as you go deeper in the warped-ness of the products, the strength of monsters, and the general bizarreness of the structures increase. A normal, fit, experienced human can go about 5 building lengths into a dungeon before being overwhelmed, more or less.

Deliberate alterations stick around for more than 24 hours if you maintain them.

The size required for a dungeon to generate is approximately large enough for a little kid to get lost in.

Open air malls turn into dungeons, cities don't. Parks, even national ones, turn into dungeons, while unclaimed or unimportant wilderness doesn't.

Your goal is to extract as much value from the alternate earth as ethically possible. Selling gold, jewels, and electronics is in, selling drugs is out. Donating truckloads of food is one of the things my characters are going to do.

What other methods of money making are there? I thought of stealing paintings from a museum dungeon, and then selling authentic forgeries, as one possible method of revenue.

If you build a building on the normal earth, does it appear on the alternate earth? If so, you can construct buildings with layouts designed to give you an advantage or give monsters disadvantages.

The next question is: is there any merit for fighting monsters? Do they drop valuable stuff? Magic equipment or materials? Do they give you experience points that let you improve yourself?

If there are merits for killing monsters, the next question is: define kill. How does the world tell who is doing the killing? Can you build a very fragile building in the real world, transfer to the alternate Earth, then knock it down and effectively kill everything inside the dungeon at once?

If the fact that the dungeon is infinite somehow strengthens the structural integrity of the building, what about creating horrible death traps in the real world building? Fill it up with all kinds of horrible machinery turning it into a massive meat grinder, then go to the alternate earth and turn it on to grind up all the monsters.

Alternatively, what about item duping? If buildings built in the real world magically appear in the alternate world, can you just construct a building out of extremely valuable materials, then go to the alternate earth every 24 hours to take it apart for materials over and over?

Yeah, monsters drop energy cores. Monsters are also based on stuff from the building the dungeon grew from. Living sculptures from a museum, power tools from a hardware store, etc. This follows the same scrambling logic of everything else, and there tends to be a lot of variety.

Power is more like calories than xp, yes they can make artifacts, but the limiting factor is power growth and teamwork.

Destroying a building closes the dungeon until the building repairs, and you only get the sparse stuff, weakest monsters when you level it.

Unfortunately, that just gives you monsters that are death traps, or traps the monsters control.

I'd also look into dumping sewage and nuclear waste into a pit dungeon, which presumably the alternate Earth can dispose of with the same magic it uses to generate things. And I'd see how much power I could draw from a dungeon with electrical lines in it.

All of these possibilities depend on how things are moved between worlds: if I can move truckloads of food, I can probably move truckloads of water, waste, and batteries. Whether it is worth it to do so depends on the specifics.

Now I know where all those IPhone knockoffs come from!

**** Aesthetic stuff. So Barnes and nobles might be called Barney Dukes or something.

Yes, and they'll be comprehensible. Infinite media for your absorption, including dvds and games.

That's less efficient than gold dupes, but people will do that after it becomes enough of a thing in society.

All of that paragraph works, as long as the real world has that stuff. Which is where it gets tricky, because maintaining real world infrastructure depends on maintaining the twin world, and vice versa, and you don't have the same incentive structures maintaining stuff.
