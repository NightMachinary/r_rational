*** My guesses regarding the dreams described:

Could describe the time loop. My rough understanding is that it's a "series" of pocket dimensions, instantiated one after another. The glowing threads are the looper's souls transferring or the transfer of whatever power is being used to sustain the loop.

I can also see this representing (primarily) the non-looping reality/realities and how they're connected to other realms such as the Primordial prisons and celestial realm.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think this is going to involve one of the primordials. Edit: It doesn't seem like lava or volcanoes is their domain. The Primordial below Cyora seems to be noted for shapeshifting abilities specifically. Still looking for more and any information on others.

This could also be an issue that they encounter when they go across the ocean searching for more keys. If the place is buried by volcanic eruption when they arrive, they may have a harder time finding a gate.

Edit: +When they counter-assaulted the invasion with Alanic and Xvim, was there any indication of lava in the hole?+ Doesn't seem like it, but [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/60/Mother-of-Learning]["bright red light"]] as the ritual +activates+ is interrupted and the loop ends could be lava. It's also completely different from the description he gave when scrying on the ritual completing in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/52/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 52]] (like a crack in reality as it breaks).

#+begin_quote
  a carpet of smoke crawling across desolate lands
#+end_quote

This could just be the natural result of a volcanic eruption, which would explain why the lands are desolate. If not, it could be the aftermath of direct action by the primordial, or another party, to choke the life out of Eldemar. Possibly QI against Eldemar, maybe aided by RR?

Could the second and third parts be outside the loop? If they involve a primordial, they probably have to be. Can prophetic dreams see into a future where Zorian has broken out of the loop?

Edit: I'm wondering if the primordial might have gained (or expended) power from any time during the loop where the cult succeeds or partially succeeds. It would certainly be a surprise for Z&Z if the primordial breaks free by itself the moment they get out of the loop! Not that I think that's likely.

That may be unlikely. Remember that prophesizing for people within the loop, as attempted by the aranea and the church at least, was impossible to do for any period beyond the end of the loop.

Zorian may somehow be an exception, but that rubs me the wrong way. I think it's more likely that these are images of events from within the loop.

***** I was forgetting about that, yeah.

BUT! When did he have the previous set of dreams in relation to when those things (perhaps) came to pass? Did he dream it during one iteration and encounter Xvim's marble pyramid in another? Edit: [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/5/Mother-of-Learning][Chapter 5, at the start of the second loop.]] So he was definitely having those dreams during the first loop /at the latest/ and possibly before entering the time loop.

We know he's dreaming towards the end of the loop /this time/. Does that mean he can dream about his personal future beyond the current loop and into the next? If so, it's hard to believe he /isn't/ exempt from prophesy beyond the loop entirely. Something like his personal future being involved, whereas that's not being the case for unmarked souls in the loop.

Edit: This all assumes that the dreams he mentions are actually prophetic. I mean, it is actually hard to match up some of these dreams to events he's experienced.

You're right. I don't feel he should be able to prophecize about things from future loops. Meeting Silverlake was only within the realm of possibilities once Zorian went through all those initial loops.

You make a strong point: Perhaps, being a marked soul connects him to the broader loops of the Gate. But even so, I fail to see the reason for him to prophecize about Silverlake when she had so little to do with him and his future at that early point. Although, one could argue that having a mangled soul and a high level of discipline dramatically increases the likelihood that he would eventually search out soul mages, and since Kael was already on his way to the academy and has close ties with Silverlake. Also, there may be another link to Silverlake through his mother's witch lineage.

Also, it may not be that the prophecy is predicting events from future restarts, but rather it's showing him events he could reasonably encounter that are important to his current situation.

Well, the general idea with prophecy is that he will in the future, not that he does right now.

Even if it's a form of probabilistic prophecy, nothing we've seen so far indicates any probability blind spots or nudging of probability towards certain outcomes. That suggests we're /probably/ seeing the timeline with the highest probability of occurring. Which is a timeline in which Zorian encounters Silverlake and all these other things he had dreams about.

If anything is likely to affect the probability of timelines, I'd guess that it would belong to the realms currently unreachable because of the time loop. That would suggest any prophetic dreams Zorian has would be purer inside the loop than out. Nothing in the story suggests any of this though; we don't have much information on how prophecies work in-universe.

That seems fine. The following makes sense to me:

Before he enters the loop, all the events in the loop are part of the future, so you can prophesy them. Once you enter the loop, the future is only until the end of the month.

******* That wouldn't account for his dreams mentioned in the current chapter. He's right near the end of the month already. I posit that Zorian can prophesy his own personal future (tied to his soul*) as it extends into any further loop iterations and, probably, back into the world beyond the loop.

It would also be weird to see into the loop beforehand in that case.

*Lore says souls are a tool of the gods to record a person's history, or something like that. May have been a work building post, but I think it appeared in-story.

Edit: Ah, I can see one way that seeing into all loop iterations from outside the loop works. If the real world's reality touches all loop iterations or has a bridge (the gate) to them, but loops are not connected to each other.

E2: That would mean he can see out of the loop and none of the current chapter dreams can take place until they leave.

I was picturing the loops in series, like stepping stones where they move from one to the next. Although the loops don't seem to work like this, it works in terms of Zorian's soul 'travelling' from one to the next, and him being able to prophesy the future of his soul's timeline.

** Huh. Sure does adjust my belief that Veyers was a red herring way the hell downward. The immediate system 1 prediction was the Boranova heir really is the third looper, and that they had discovered a method to exit the Gate as a soul alone (presumably to soul parasite their original body), which would also be yet more evidence that Zach is the original. That said, it also sounds like a great bait-and-switch to have somebody Zach knew /through/ Veyers suborn the time loop. In this theory, the third looper edits Zach mind and excises Veyers from the loop just to prevent Zach from tracking him down. At the very least it's fantastic that they found the appropriate link between the Cult of the Dragon and Veyers.

I am surprised the lawyer didn't mention the entire company of mercenaries that were ALSO found dead of mysterious causes, sometimes in heavily warded homes, with no sign of a struggle. Maybe he didn't hear about it until after he'd panicked and put V in the chill chest.

It's funny, I had generally imagined they'd spend a lot of time at the end of Arc 3 preparing for what they'd do once they got out. But it's starting to sound like they almost accidentally have that on lockdown. The answer might be a very simple, "Catch up to third looper early, curb stomp montage presumably set to X Gonna Give it To Ya; kidnap and tastefully edit Sudomir before dropping him and evidence off with Alanic; gather small army and boot the invaders back through their portal, possibly in a montage set to X Gonna Give it To Ya (Bass Boosted). Proceed to destroy evil, aid allies, provide payback, and coordinate better life."

After their conversation about Zorian's soul perception, I am definitely leaning more towards a prediction of Zorian rejoining the world outside the gate as a sort of golem-lich (something like: piggy back as some kind of soul-package on Zach, Zach constructs golem with special soul anchoring mechanism, creates a simulacrum based on Zorian's soul that attaches the magical brain and physical appearance of Zorian to it, lets his soul detach from his own).

For some reason I think I'd gotten a wire crossed and thought of the true Controller as physically in the Sovereign Gate, when the deal is that it's their soul that's the only one not made by the Gate, which makes my ideas in the first paragraph a bit confused.

That's a pretty interesting notion, very worth chewing on. It's a toughy to puzzle out with current information because we're already looking at a failure state. There's only supposed to ever be one person who leaves, and that's supposed to end the loop. But the Gatekeeper knows that the "Controller" exited, so we know that whatever method was used interacted with the loop's control systems. So I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that the results look like one of the control system's functions (a soul not being re-created at the beginning of an iteration: because that's the Controller's soul and they left).

On the other hand, it does seem a bit odd. I think ultimately this makes me put more weight in Veyers being ejected just to prevent Zach from tracking down the actual Red Robe.

Why not? That seems quite possible:

1. If one month has passed, gather any souls into the Gate.

   - The Gate gathers multiple souls because the controller can temporarily mark individuals.

2. Destroy the loop.
3. If there are marked souls remaining with a controller marker, check if there is enough energy to recreate the loop.
4. If there isn't enough energy, then shut down the gate.
5. If there is enough energy, then recreate a new loop.

Maybe the creators of the Gate didn't anticipate there being three controller-marked souls, so they simply did not put in a "Validate there is only one controller-marked soul" clause.

Or maybe the creators anticipated that shenanigans may occur. Maybe they realized that a significantly skilled soul mage might be able to, theoretically at least, make their soul resemble the controller's soul and the Gate would not be able to tell the difference.

Maybe the creators couldn't figure out how to make the Gate identify one soul from another hollistically, but it was relatively trivial to put a marker on the controller's soul and key the Gate to that marker. It's analagous to how it's much easier to make a computer read a barcode than it is to teach a computer to identify an item by shape, color, texture, etc. waved in an arbitrary orientation in front of the computer's camera.

Unable to solve the problem, they decided that they'd ensure the Gate would, if it still had the energy, absolutely not collapse if a controller was still inside.

Not necessarily.

We don't know whether Zorian can track RR by soul marker, since he only learned how to do that after RR had already left. We don't know whether Veyers is RR, and if he's not, then we have no idea who it is. We don't know how paranoid RR is, and how carefully he'll cover his tracks after exiting.

I can't see the Ibasans continuing with the invasion if they lose the gate under Cyoria (or the one into Sudomir's manor), demon support or no. For one thing, Cyoria would have angel support. Their whole plan hinges on surprise, without the gate they wouldn't be able to even bring in the entire invasion force. The much bigger potential spanner in the works is pretty much RR taking out ZZ before they can implement any of their plans against the primordial unsealing and the invasion. Hell, he could even kill them but if they get a notebook with details to Alanic first, and RR doesn't know that, it's show over. The actual literal army comes down on Sudomir's or on the gate compound, and there is at the least too much scrutiny on the head members of the Cult of the Dragon for them to unleash the primordial on their own.

Tracking down RR is definitely still the rough part, I just don't think there's much that one mage (who is described as roughly on par with Zach in 26: Soulkill) can do against them. I do think he's gonna be pretty paranoid though. He may've hoped that the gate would shut down without them able to leave, but who knows.

This means that any plans and practice within the loop that ZZ might do now will be somewhat similar to what will happen outside of the loop. They'll most likely have an easier time dealing with the invasion.

Compare this with not killing RR. RR is /extremely/ familiar with what the invasion looks like when hardly anyone loopers were changing things---in fact, RR had several dozen loops where Zach would piss off completely and go do his own thing. As soon as Zach and Zorian start running interference, RR will likely be able to tell, and at /that/ point, RR is going to have to start improvising, which means the entire situation will become more unpredictable and thus the potential for unexpected disaster rises.

Yet Z&Z make tiny portable dimensions within their first month. So why is the Orb so special? Is it just the size? Does making a pocket dimension mobile make it harder to make, or smaller?

Two other questions about pocket dimensions, although not specifically related to this chapter:

what does the border of the pocket dimension look like from the inside? Is it just an empty void? Or is there some view of the outside?

What lights them? Silverlake has a small garden, and the Orb had plant life inside, so presumably there is some light source. In the case of the Orb, whatever light source had to have operated continuously since it was last sealed, when most other magical devices had broken down.

I thought it was simply that he never found someone that knew that spell. It's been mentioned a few times, but apparently teleportation isn't a commonly known spell among mages. I think it can't be that rare (5-20% of mages) because of the number of people we see use it, but it's not trivial to cast. Someone who knows the gate spell is even rarer, because dimensionalism is supposed to be really difficult. Zorian said something about people knowing that spell are "as rare as hens' teeth."

Actually, I think the way Z&Z went about getting the knowledge of pocket dimension creation is more or less the normal way. By the time someone has the necessary ability in dimensionalism, along with all the other required skills like mana perception, they would be too old for an apprenticeship. They would be full mages, and would trade for such a valuable skill with something else of equal value.

And they're hardly trading "nothing in return". Grey Hunter eggs are probably the third most difficult thing to get seen so far in the story, exceeded only by the imperial dagger and crown. Silverlake had essentially no avenue to acquiring them, and they seem to be necessary for her potion of youth.

I don't anticipate her doing this, for the same reason that I don't anticipate Zorian invading Xvim's mind for extra training: it's much more efficient to cooperate with a willing subject.

And Silverlake wouldn't benefit by tampering with ZZ's souls. Messing with Zach would likely trip the reset, and messing with Zorian might wreck his marker and drop him out of the loop, but neither benefits her.

If she really wants in, she might want to /study/ their markers and use them as a basis to experiment on /other/ souls, and I would anticipate them being OK with that. If she has actual expertise on soul magic, they might gain valuable information from her experiments, giving clues about how RR gained a marker (or, if he was first, how Zach gained one). She wouldn't want to damage the two existing markers.

That's one perspective on the loop, but a more pragmatic perspective would be: if all iterations of yourself in the loop are indistinguishable, then giving your next iteration a 75% chance of survival is better than giving your current iteration a 25% chance.

If she wants to eg help take down QI and get the crown in case it allows them to bestow temporary markers, they'll gladly work with her. If she knows mind magic well enough that she could place a compulsion on Zorian to go to her at the start of the loop and restore her memories, then she probably also knows enough that she can simply hand over a memory packet that he'll willingly return to her.

and even if this isn't why zach has metric tons of mana, it's still a potential route for zorian to avoid having to kill his outside world self. he is already well on his way to becoming a soul mage capable of doing something so wildly complex, and with soul sight he is equipped to continue down that path.

*********** I would assume soul-merging to be another function of the Marker. When the Marker detects two souls in one body, it probably duplicates itself in the 2nd soul (like it mostly did with Zorian after QI's attempted merge attack). From there, with the identical scaffolding throughout the two souls, it merges them into one cohesive whole. There would still be just one soul core, but certain aspects would be strengthened, like mana capacity. It's probably a lot less dangerous with the souls being identical at the start of the loop. Zorian will probably not be in the best shape once they get back to the real world if it happens to him, with his 10-20+ years older loop copy of his soul merged with his original soul.

A few other thoughts about this: Would Zorian have his mana capacity doubled or just added to by his initial strength, with the possibility of further growth? Would the empath abilities be doubled in range and strength as well?

***** This is a relevant [[https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_hanson_what_would_happen_if_we_upload_our_brains_to_computers/up-next][TEDTalk on uploading ourselves to computers]] where the speaker essentially discuses exactly this problem of simulacra (he calls them emulations). Imagine you got really drunk and had a really fun time and experienced a bunch of stuff and met a bunch of people, but then you blacked out and forgot most of it? The next day, you'd maybe have a bunch of texts from people you don't really remember and you have a little bit of new information from what you can recall of the night, but most of what made you "end of the night"!you, the memories and experiences, would vanish. And yet we don't mourn that situation as the loss of a person; it's just an offshoot of you.

I actually find the death of a simulacrum to be more troubling than the replacement of Real!Zorian by Loop!Zorian.

Say a simulacrum was created in the morning. By the end of the day, you have this: Zorian + (simulacrum's new experiences) and Zorian + (Zorian's new experiences). When the simulacrum dies, some of the simulacrum's experiences are integrated with Zorian, so finally you have Zorian + (Zorian's new experiences) + (some of the simulacrum's new experiences). Notice that a bunch of what made the simulacrum a person is lost.

Using a similar logic for Real!Zorian, Loop!Zorian = Real!Zorian + (Loop!Zorian's new experiences). So, if Loop!Zorian totally replaces Real!Zorian, basically nothing of Real!Zorian is actually lost as far as memories and knowledge are concerned.

Thus, it's arguable that the death of a simulacrum is more troubling than the replacement of Real!Zorian with Loop!Zorian because when a simulacrum dies, information is totally obliterated, whereas if Real!Zorian dies, all his memories continue to live on in Loop!Zorian.

However, being a simulacrum, there are likely small imperfections in the magical brain, so perhaps the it's better to refrain from a total overwrite of Zorian by a simulacrum.

So I suppose simulacrums can technically cast the spell, but they would still be forking the original and not the simulacrum that cast the spell. Also, since their thoughts had subtly diverged from the original at that point, there would be minute incompatibilities between their image of base Zorian and his real identity, which would amplify the normally minor differences between the simulacrum and the original and possibly result in some kind of critical failure.

** Lately I've been wondering a lot what enhancement ritual Zorian will end up using shiny new blood-magic skills for (or from the similar angle, what I'd pursue if I were in an identical situation). It's a puzzler, because lots of permanent enhancements would be /extremely convenient/, but Zorian's becoming a high caliber archmage: every iota of mana he has could be used for a dizzying array of effects. Something needs to be very special to be worth permanently tying up any of his mana.

Here are the enhancements and enhancement adjacent options I can remember or speculate exist:

*Mana* (probably not possible): the obvious wishing for more wishes option. If we had Zach's mana pool it'd easily be like, "Okay, so staple half a dragon's worth of enhancements up one side of my soul, a gray hunter's up the other, but make sure you leave some room for a salamander+troll+hydra regeneration complex. After that we'll go look at some obscure creatures I've fought over the past thirty years of adventuring and play it by ear." But there've been a lot of questions on the wordpress blog about different options, like shifter soulmelds or necromancy, and nobody103 has mostly shut it down (that level of soul manipulation is the domain of gods and primordials). Though I'm sure +Flowey+ the soulseizer will spark new rounds of speculation. My personal impression is that almost anything Zorian could do with /HORRIFYINGLY UNETHICAL AND VILE SOUL FUCKERY/ he could do with more mundane mana batteries. (Which actually makes me wonder if he couldn't offload some of the simulacrum upkeep cost to a spell formula on his proxy golems.)

*Mana Regen* (probably infeasible): almost as good would be the ability to generate or assimilate mana at the kind of speeds trolls regenerate flesh. In comments on wordpress, nobody103 implies that this is at least more feasible than adding capacity, but a creature or bloodline that actually does it is unknown.

*A Familiar*: Zorian seems unlikely to take a familiar while in the gate, because he fears messing up his delicately, one-in-a-million damaged brand, but it's entirely possible outside of the gate. It could even help with mana, since with enough practice, using a willing familiar's mana is only a little slower and harder than using your own. Plus, if he learns more transformation magic, a willing and living creature makes an ideal template for temporary enhancements.

*Shifting* whether mundane or magical: A lot of people are really interested in this one, though, as above, it's unlikely inside the loop. You can see why he'd want the ritual though. It doesn't even tie up any mana just to be a shifter---though it does to use their abilities. There's even the potential that a supernatural shifter would have more mana. Even mundane animal shifting has a lot to offer: superior senses, swimming or flying, strength or stamina, etc, and if he knows the ritual he can become a multi-shifter (meet my son the eagle-bear-shark). On the supernatural side, there are even more possible advantages, but you never know how big a barrier being unable to have sane kids would be to a given individual (not a dealbreaker for me). And whatever opinions Zorian/I have of his/my will, the risk of overestimating it is extreme. And there's still the fact that enhancement/transformation can give you individual advantages temporarily. The main advantage of shifter magic over transformation is the instinctual use of the other form---where Zorian is already ahead of the game on with his Openness. Sure, absolutely, the ability to call on a grey hunter's or a dragon's strength, resistances, senses, etc, at any time with no preparation is very appealing, but it wouldn't be a priority for me.\\
Some people have brought up the tantalizing idea of a shifter like soul meld with a spirit being. While you would theoretically get a lot of the spirit's (often impressive) innate magic, nobody103 gave the impression that the apt metaphor would be, "What if I tied a tender baby (my soul) to a pissed off alligator (a spirit)?" To quote, it is, "Insanely dangerous." To come out of a soul fusion sane, your soul needs to be the dominant one, and that kind of wrestling is occurring on the battlefiend where the spirit was born. You also don't get an alternate form, and there are few examples to show you how to do it. This isn't going to keep me from thinking about my DeviantArt-OC-tier Mary Sue that soulfused an angel or powerful fey or something.

*Alteration*: given the time loop, it's almost surprising that Zorian hasn't experimented with bio-alteration magic (why not at least magi-lasik, for instance?). I guess since nobody else has had the protection of the loop, Zorian would basically be inventing a new branch of magic out of whole-cloth, and complex organic compounds are currently just out of consideration at their science/magic level. He'd be losing parts of restarts for any tests that went wrong enough, and there's no telling what continuing to grow after he stops resetting would do to changes. So I guess it makes sense, no matter how sweet and transhumanist it'd be to lace his skin and bones with carbon fiber or whatever.

*Psychic Power*: Zorian already won the bloodline power lottery in getting this. Even if I lacked his absurd educational opportunities, if I were dropped into MoL-verse, I'd be scrambling to grab it. It's not just the intuitive mind magic and passive empathy, but the overall enhanced ability to interpret information. (It's common and potent enough that I've found myself wondering if a primordial's not involved.)

*Ghost Eyes*: another for completeness' sake. I wonder if it'd be possible to use blood magic to make spirit perception an inheritable ability, and whether or not this "natural" version would work any better than the apparently slightly hack-y approach that potions or ritual murder give. I feel like giving my kids intuitive mind and soul powers is a ticket to getting the fam run out of town on a rail though.

*Elemental Powers* (eg, Boranova or Grier): one of the things I really appreciate about this world is that there's no actual like, fundamental magical property to elements, they're just "a thing an elemental happens to embody". So there's no real earth magic, but there is a blob of Earth Elemental Essence that explains to a soul how to do all kinds of nifty high quality and efficient unstructured magic that involves earth and stone. I'm sure these are convenient and I'd play them up if I were already born with them, there's not a lot of reason for Zorian to pursue this kind of active ability.

*Reid Family Bloodline*: in a wordpress comment nobody103 said that this makes them really resistant to toxins and allows them to analyze things they ingest. Honestly, between the defense and information gathering, it seems solidly worth considering trying to steal this, but being mistaken as part of The Family could be persistently annoying.

*Physical enhancements*: I imagine there's a whole spectrum of these for strength, durability, regeneration, etc. Honestly though, unless he can find a ritual that's especially efficient (eg, peak human physical ability for 1% of your mana), I don't see him going this way. It might be emotionally satisfying to be double burly, but magic's more effective. And so long as he's not caught completely by surprise, his magic is a better defense than tanking some hit (for instance, I'm expecting him to very shortly develop a high speed "swap places with my golem-simulacrum" spell). And if he survives something he can heal later. Far better would be something that helps him not be surprised in the first place.

*** *Enhanced or Additional Senses* mundane or magical: This is probably my first bet for the actual story, and I think one of the big reasons I'd personally become a shifter. Zorian seemed excited by the eagle sight and grey hunter tremorsense. More information about his surroundings is always going to be useful to avoid unpleasant surprises, and though divination can cover a lot of the info, a permanent sense can catch things even when he doesn't think to look out for them or be extra cautious. A better-than-humanly-possible mana-sense is a noticeable stand-out option, given how the better you are at sensing your own mana, the better you are at magic, period. There are also other or combined senses; consider that rabbit in the most recent chapter: two separate, enviably powerful archmages could not find a way to hide from them (plus a jewel embedded in your forehead that gives you magic powers is /always/ cool).

*Enhanced Mental Speed or Reflexes*: Another one of my top spread guesses, especially if he can nick a version with all the kinks worked out (eg, you don't feel like people are talking like the sloths from Zootopia). Imagine being able to see that disintigration beam or high-power stun wave coming and cast a defensive spell before it even gets there. This is one that that gets MORE useful the more things he can do with the rest of his mana, but it also sounds a little rare, expensive, or infeasible.

*Nonsomnolence*: I asked nobody103 where it's possible to permanently do without sleep in his verse. It's one of my favorite oft-overlooked powers: 50% more active time (even simulacrums still need sleep), never at risk of ambush during sleep, and immunity to the whole spectrum of deleterious effects of sleep deprivation. But his response was that he decided it's possible, but has unpredictable side effects on ones mental state, taking it out of consideration for Zorian. I still wonder if it'd be possible to find a lesser version, like classic D&D elves' trancing (only need 4 hours of sleep a night and retain marginally awareness of surroundings).

*Supernatural Accuracy*: assuming that the ironbeak's power is general enough that it'd be applicable (and not just with dropping things from the air), stealing this seems like stellar synergy with Zorian's low mana. If it works with telekinetically hurled items, this helps Zorian catch up on one of Zach's more useful abilities: you can't dispel a super dense rock. And if it extends as far as guns? That'd make it an automatic choice. Imagine just sniping the grey hunter.

*Concealment*: Just rounding out the kinds of magical abilities we've seen monsters use, being able to go full tunnel octopus or chameleon drake has utility, but more the "let's make some potions" than "let's sacrifice 10% of my mana forever" utility.

*Mobility*: Zorian's on record that teleportation is the ultimate tool for getting around. Flight, enhanced running speed, phasing, none of that for him. Personally, I feel like the ability to maneuver around foes and traps at high speeds in three dimensions makes a good supernatural flight worth practising, but again, probably not worth permanently tying up mana.

*Unaging*: Another I'm including for completeness sake. Zorian probably won't work on this during the loop, but after? I sure know I'd prefer, you know, not dying. In a reply on wordpress nobody103 implies this is probably a unique alchemical potion (or series of potions) for each alchemist that does it. You can't just buy the recipe and make a batch for yourself and each of your friends. But surely between his own ability, ability to acquire ingredients, Kael helping, and maybe buying Silverlake's research notes off her, Zorian will have a leg up.

**** Great posts. I agree that most of these abilities are better kept as enhancement potions in a freezer inside your pocket pocket-dimension. Some thoughts:

*Mind Speed* Zorian may be able to increase his thinking speed and mental reaction time via mind magic.

*Mana Sense* Pair this with mana sense and, as you said, not only do you improve your ability to improve your ability with magic (heh), but it'll be much easier for you to see how an opponent is manipulating magic before any spell effects occur. This gives the illusion of improving reaction time and strategic. Further, it acts like an invisibility, magical trap, and ward sensor unless special pains are taken against mana sensing.

*Shifting* Bonds with powerful or aggressive creatures is unlikely to happen for the reason you stated: Shifting is not about merely getting the characteristics of the animal, but your rather melding another animal's personality with yours as well. So, doing this with a dragon would result in an individual who was probably more dragon like than human. Likewise, a gray hunter meld may result in a psychopathic, territorial, and homicidal individual.

*Underwater Shifter* The deep ocean is a scary and violent place to be stuck with merely shaping exercises, and civilization takes place on land, so I feel that wouldn't be a great option.

*Multiple Animals* Also, I think shifting multiple animals would take too much of a toll on Zorian's mind.

***** I definitely agree that a lot of people underestimate the dangers of a shifter bond, especially to a magical creature or to a sapient creature. Like even a winter wolf or ironbeak would be too much for the average person; a dragon is on a whole other level. People point to Sudomir's insane experiment, but while there's a lot bad to say about him, weak will and personality are not among them. I do think it's within the given Zorian's drive, he'd have a chance to, as Kael said, "---Master a grey hunter's soul and not let its urges rule [him]." But it's not something undertaken lightly, I sure wouldn't relish having to constantly be on guard lest my dragon half's personality overwhelm me.

For an underwater shifter I was thinking more about quick travel through rivers or being able to navigate flooded ruins or caves.

In [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/sapient-species-of-the-world/#comments][this worldbuilding article]] there were a lot of questions about shifters, and the author's responses to ones about fusing with multiple mundane animals made it sound less of a terrible idea than bonding a single sapient or magical creature.

****** You make a good point that if someone could make bonding with a Grey Hunter work, Zorian with his advanced mental abilities could. However, I do feel it would make him (even more) antisocial and possibly aggressive over the long period. Sudomir kept it together . . . kind of. I mean, his sensibilities were questionable to begin with being a necromancer and all, so who's to say?

I've been dismissing the grey hunter bond out of hand because it's so dangerous, but lemme think about it more carefully. What are the advantages?

- Extreme durability to physical and magical attacks.
- Extreme reflexes, strength, and agility.
- Mana sense
- Tremor sense.

Critique:

*Durability* Zorian has golems and simulacra. They can be made more durable (perhaps from Grey Hunter carapace?), could potentially be made modularly (detachable armors, etc. to switch up resisitances), and have the benefit of not actually being Zorian on the front lines (except in the case of simulacra if the enemy can use offensive soul magic).

*Reflexes, Strength, and Agility* Reflexes and agility would certainly be useful to Zorian in a fight, although since Zorian is rarely a sole actor (golems, simulacra) or surprised (mind magic), it's a bit less important. Should he risk his mental stability for these? Well, let's say I'd definitely look into a reflex enhancement ritual because faster reaction times means faster spells.

*Mana and Tremor sense* We both know how awesome these is. I would definitely take this as an enhancement ritual, but these two abilities, especially the mana sense, really make bonding with the grey hunter enticing. Tremor sense is a bit overkill because of Zorian's mind sense, but being able to navigate terrain easily and get information about aircurrents is pretty cool.

*Transformation to Spider* This is where the decision becomes clear for me that this shifter bond is a bad idea. Zorian is so utterly effective in mage form that I feel turning into a spider wouldn't be of great benefit. Arguably, he could be a little more aggressive with his mana use, then upon running out, just turn into a spider and break shit, but then we're talking about melee combat when really he should have just teleported back to safety long before it got to that point.

--------------

All in all, I'm itching to see where Zorian goes with the blood magic enhancements because it would obviate the need to deal with the Grey Hunter's psyche.

I just took a look at the chapter you mentioned (chapter 62) and . . . I'd also like to see them draw on their life force to power spells at some point toward the end of a restart. Maybe Zorian uses it to dramatically boost his mind magic abilities and just wreck an entire base of Ilbasans by squinting aggresively at them.

Oh, and he mentions an enhancement ritual to just passively have flight. That'd be pretty fun. If I were Zach, I would pack on a bunch of those.

The biggest draw of a shifter bond like this over enhancement is that he doesn't need to say goodbye to ~10% of his already anemic mana capacity to have quick and easy access enhanced durability, strength, reflexes, and special senses. It's apparently both efficient and easy for a shifter to draw on abilities from their other form, but at the same time will also draw more on their instincts, which means constant durability or reflexes also means constant increased danger to his sanity. And of course, as you say, he's got his golems (and wards, and shields, and potions...) if he /knows/ he's in a situation where tanking hits or ignoring poison is necessary; the value of enhanced durability is all about being constant and unconditional.

But rather than overkill, I think some kind of special physical sense is the perfect complement to his mind sense: he's golden against anything with a mind, so now he needs something to help against the mindblanked, mindless undead, traps, etc. (Heck, that eyebeast caught him by surprise, and it presumably has a mind. But more skill and paranoia are the better response there.)

We've also been discounting the venom, but with his mind magic Zorian has no problem disabling creatures anyways.

And yeah, I grouped flight under "mobility" in my write-up. /I/ would seriously consider permanent flight, but Zorian doesn't seem interested.

I don't recall anything that specifically supports that. I hypothesize that spell formulae carved into nice durable metal could shape raw mana and the end result be a perfectly healthy artificial brain. Certainly I agree, we've been told repeatedly that living things (and artificial brains, fully as delicate as the pink head custard kind) can only safely /shape/ personal mana, but this isn't a situation we've heard about. The artificial brain isn't handling the ambient mana, it's merely the end result of that handling.

Well, maybe that's precisely why his new simulacra use golem bodies; their bodies are durable enough to draw a small amount of mana from the environment to help maintain the spell. Perhaps, Zorian is unable to offset the entire cost of the simulacrum in this manner without frying the golem body or maybe some amount of his /personal mana/ is a necessary ingredient. After all, a simulacrum needs to be closely linked during creation to the caster and their image, mana, soul, etc.

********* edit: to [[/u/thrawnca]] too

Let's make sure we're all on the same page here. Even if a spell formula is maintaining a persistent spell, no item (not one made by mortals anyways) can cast a spell on its own, so something like a golem requires casting a complex series of animation spells as it's created, using the spell formulas instead of spell elements (invocations) to constrain the spell boundary. But once the formulas have been primed with that spell, they can continue running by drawing on ambient mana (or a mana battery). Ambient mana is toxic and corrosive, but wood, stone and metal are durable enough that it's mostly irrelevant.

The simulacrum spell seems to work in three parts: shared soul, ectoplasmic body, artificial brain. We don't have exact details of how he makes the golem frame simulacra work, but it sounds like he spends less energy because he supports physically less ectoplasm, and doesn't need to provide mana to make the bodies move. My suggestion is that if he can make a spell formula, presumably inscribed on something in the golem, that persistently maintains the brain part using mana from a battery.

The core of the disagreement here seems to be whether the effect created by a spell formula drawing ambient mana still retains some of the toxic properties of the mana it was made of, which I don't see. It's not quite the same thing, but the entire point of blasting rods is that they channel ambient mana into a, "Barely constrained torrent of energy, usually fire," missing is the notion that this fire retains the toxic and corrosive properties of the raw mana. Being inside a privacy ward run off ambient mana doesn't make people sick, or more relevantly, passing through a ward that scans some element of their mind and body. The distinction I see, made several times in world building posts and comments, is with words like "use" "shape" and "channel".

We're not talking about Zorian's simulacrum assimilating mana like a lich for use in casting spells. Rather, we're talking about using the golem body like a blasting rod, but instead of blasting, the golem has formula to assist in paying for a piece of the simulacrum mana cost used maintain some of the simulacrum's spell boundary at a reduced cost to the caster.

Sudomir seemingly used formulae to put extremely complex passive effects on his dragon golem, giving it flight as well as other capabilities.

Furthermore, the diviner who was in Daimen's group used an object to aid the casting of certain spells. We saw Zorian use a similar object during the Grey Hunter fight.

Similarly, a golem might be able to have similar capabilities that make the simulacrum maintenance cost go to or approach zero. This is what we're referring to. And indeed Zorian might have already done this.

And then on a separate note, rather than channeling this part of the spell directly through Zorian, if he could allow the golem to bear the brunt of the channeling, then Zorian could partially offload the burden of powering the spell by having a reinforced golem body directly draw a safe amount of ambient mana. Again, be might already be doing this.

To keep the brain to a practical size, the components of the spell must necessarily be so small that they are both delicate and unsuited to a spell formula.

ETA Also, on the subject of the dragon, it wouldn't have to be a dragon soul. Sudomir had access to thousands of human souls, and evidently had time on his hands. And mana from souls is not corrosive, just harder to use (which, with a carefully-constructed spell formula, is acceptable).

***** To be frank, Zorian has most of the advantages one could want:

*Mind Magic* One of the most versatile fields, this makes him a controller type, which is subtle and leverages the power of his opponents' forces against them. More importantly, in time he will improve his ability to think, focus, remember, and self-motivate. These are priceless advantages.

*Spell Formula* This allows him to create items and effects that are incredible force multipliers. Enchanted guns, bombs, utility devices, golems to tank, and now golems to house his simulacrum.

*Simulacra* Of course, basically now he has a small team of himself, increasing his productivity by factor of seven currently as he has six simulacra working on projects. This may also lead to lichdom.

*Soul Sense* Zorian already achieved the major advantage of being able to create simulacra, but hopefully soul sense will give additional benefits we don't know of yet.

*Wealth* The often forgotten superpower, wealth has allowed him to spare no expense in his training or the materials he uses and hire teams of experts to help him with his work, which is possibly even more effective than having simulacra.

** I was trying to post here before but my new account wasnt allowed to, so I ended up creating a new theory and will try to put it all into this one post:

My theory is that the lawyer Jornak is actually RR. Since Veyers shows the same symptoms as the spiders, it is highly possible that he was removed from the loop (template) by Jornak after Jornak managed to enter the loop. The main reason why I don't believe Veyers is the culprit, is because he is too young. A boy with basically no knowledge about magic, including no knowledge about soul magic, is supposed to have entered the loop using his brain alone? Think about how "knowledgable" Zorian was in his first iteration. He also has only one month left to find a way to enter the loop from the moment zach tells him. Veyers is also some kind of an outcast and with no help from anybody besides Jornak and maybe Zach he is supposed to be able to enter the loop? Even then Jornak would have tried to enter the loop as well. How could two kids be able to stop a grown up mage? Zach and Zorian are trying to find ways to enter and exit the loop and they are failing so far and they can be considered arch mages. But we believe that Veyers is capable of solving that without any real shaping exercises or other resources? Jornak on the other side could be perfectly capable. He might even know about the Sovereign-Gate through those books he has in his home. For all we know he might be a powerful mage, he even has basic mind magic skills. He has far more resources and the motive. He said it himself, that he was mistreated by the state. So the question would be why is he back to his normal self when he is supposed to be RR? Zorian was a part of the loop like Jornak until he got a marker. From that point onwards his soul was no longer recreated from the template. But Zorian also knows, that if something happens to his marker, he will lose everything and his soul will be recreated. So if Jornak leaves the loop, the Guardian will only find two souls with a marker and recreate everything else. The "new" Jornak does not know the loop exists and only finds a "dead" Veyers in his home and panics.

I also had a nice idea how to "abuse" Jornak or at least find out if he is the culprit ;P ZZ could tell him about the Sovereign Gate and persuade him to help them. Zach does also have a motive to go against the State Leaders and he would believe them about the Sovereign Gate if he is RR. The main idea is that Jornak as RR found a way to enter the loop and maybe could do the same again. It is a little bit like playing with fire but this time ZZ are far too powerful to lose against him. They dont have to let him actually enter the loop. It would be enough if he is capable to find a way for people to enter. That would definitely prove he is RR.

I am pretty sure he did some experiments with Veyers. But in the end the ability to remove people from the loop-template is supposed to be used that way. Get rid of useless people and maximize your own possibilities. One more important reason to test the ability on Veyers, is that it will never be public. Remember how everybody was talking about people (the mercenaries killed by RR) found dead in their homes at the start of the month? RR definitely does not want Zach to notice somebody else is inside the loop. Dead people will definitely change something and Zach would eventually notice.

*** This is a great theory. You're right that it is unlikely Veyers by himself got in the loop; he simply doesn't have the magical ability.

Although I really like your theory, I'm going to play devil's advocate for Veyers as RR:

We don't know much about the loop as neither does Zach. If he /is/ the original looper, maybe he knew of a way to include people in the loop more permanently. Maybe he hung out with Veyers and they somehow became friends.

Counterpoint and possible nail in the coffin for the Veyers as RR theory: We've now learned that Veyers likely begins and possibly spends the loop at Jornak's house. If that's true, then Veyers would not have had contact with Zach and thus no opportunity to enter the loop normally. But Jornak wouldn't have that opportunity either. The plot thickens . . .

To switch topics slightly, under Zorian's compulsion, Jornak says:

#+begin_quote
  "I didn't kill him! I didn't kill anyone! I already said I just found him dead one day! It's the truth!"
#+end_quote

If Jornak were RR and he left the loop, I might expect this is pre-loop Jornak was unaware of the whole situation. However, Jornak!RR could have also obliviated himself of certain information before leaving the loop.

Notice that very soon into the interrogation with Jornak, Alanic has Zorian stop aggressively using mind magic on Jornak. This makes most subsequent information somewhat suspect. What is really needing is a thorough interrogation of his thoughts like what was done on Sudomir, with special care to look for any signs of memory tampering . . .

**** If Jornak's soul actually left the loop, then the new Jornak is recreated by the template. Just like if Zorian were to leave the loop-world now, a new Zorian would be created in the same way he was before (knowing nothing, no shaping exercises, no soul sight, etc.). So the current Jornak does not need to lie, he really does not know anything. Even if Zorian would search his mind, there would be nothing of value.

In the end I am pretty sure that if Veyers is RR then Jornak was playing an important role, because he is the only adult those two kids (Zach and Veyers) can talk to. There is simply no way two unexperienced kids can hack a divine system like the sovereign gate.

*** Hmm. I do approve of the idea that if RR was not the original Controller - which is probably the case - then we can expect him to be recreated from the template each loop. So yes, Jornak is a plausible candidate.

Of course, we don't have any way to verify it, since if the Gate is indeed recreating RR, then there is nothing any more to identify him. The only signs of his former presence are the barred Gate (but the Guardian can't or won't say anything identifying), and the soulkilled individuals (but their bodies are recreated from the template, so they carry no clues), and ZZ's own memories (but Zach won't let Zorian poke around in his head).

You may be correct, but not necessarily, and in my opinion, it's unlikely that there would be no hint that an individual is not RR. If RR is someone who met Zach and learned of the loop, then that person would have a very limited amount of time to figure out how to get into the loop. At best, that person would need to convince Zach to give them a temporary loop marker using one of the keys.

Also, it's likely that to be able to create an entry point into the loop, RR likely already was a skilled mage, perhaps even in relevant areas such as soul magic, dimensionalism, possibly necromancy, and might already have soul sight.

Remember that it RR begins the loop with access to the difficult-to-get red robe. Maybe he steals it, but given the nature and reputation of those robes, I don't find that likely. Rather, this indicates that RR is some kind of prominent member of the cult, thus deserving the robe. Inspecting Jornak's mind thoroughly might reveal this level of involvement.

Also, entering the time loop may have been the result of planning that occurred prior to loop activation. Here's a hypothetical situation: RR is the lawyer and is involved in the cult in a deep way. However, he also becomes a lawyer for Zach's caretaker. With access to certain documents, perhaps he stumbles upon plans to activate the loop. Working with the cult, he figures out a way to piggyback Zach into the loop. Rooting around in Jornak's mind might reveal any such plots.

Lastly, looking into Jornak's mind might reveal mental tampering. Seeing as Zach's mind was messed with, Veyer's mind and by extension Jornak's mind might have been altered.

Zach's memories are indeed the best shot at identifying RR, if he'll ever let Zorian into them.

Probably, yes. That definitely narrows it down, but still leaves a lot of candidates - especially since RR has ties to the Cult of Dragon.

Nope. In the proposed scenario, Jornak's mind will be a clean slate. He's a new, untouched instance of Jornak, who honestly knows nothing about the loop.

****** I should have been more clear: When I said Jornak's mind may show signs of tampering, I'm of course referring to pre-loop tampering. I don't know how much Zorian would be able to discern, but if he can determine the tampering occurred within the past few months, then it would indicate that perhaps the lawyer and Veyers may have ties to RR or one of RR's associates and further that RR likely joined the loop via a pre-loop effort by some group, likely the cult. I say this because mind tampering would indicate Jornak was involved in some capacity but also project information was kept under extremely tight wraps. Further, if the mind alterations were not done expertly, Zorian may be able to recover something useful.

Most importantly, this is the best lead they have. A full memory investigation of this individual above any other they know of right now may yield something useful (other than Zach).
