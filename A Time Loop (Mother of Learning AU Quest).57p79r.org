** How does this thing work? At the beginning there seems to be a panel with tabs full of info about the character and setting. Then people are discussing it? Does this launch into a story and people offering suggestions on how to continue somewhere? How am I supposed to read this or participate?

*** It's a quest and it works exactly as you speculate. The author asks for votes on the characters actions and then writes the story to match.

You can participate however you like. Either by joining in with the discussion/voting or staying back and watching it unfold.

**** It seems the story starts quite late, in page 7. There are a couple omakes before though.

***** If you're just there for the story, you can always skip the discussion using the threadmarks. Keep in mind that the author/qm clarifies some things and answers questions in the other posts too though.

*** AFAICT it's basically DnD played online in slow motion with people voting on what the character does and what the rules are.

*** The panel in the beginning (character sheet) is updated as the quest progresses so its best read after catching up with the rest of the thread.

*** It's quite a bit easier to enjoy a quest in my opinion. You have a personal stake in it, because you just got finished arguing for three pages about /why exactly the protag should be magic focused. It's clearly the best option you goddamned idiot./ It's also hilarious to watch the participants choose a mystery option every single time it's presented.
