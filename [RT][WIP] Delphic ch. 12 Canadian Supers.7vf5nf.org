** I love this story, precisely because of the power interactions in it. To be more exact, I like how Hector, who seemingly has such an unbelievably unbeatable investigative power, is effectively countered by something as seemingly basic as invisibility.

It's wonderful. It reminds me of some of the video games I like to play, where sometimes it doesn't matter how powerful you are if your opponent completely invalidates your play style.

I do wish the chapters had a bit more action, and (I know you probably get this a lot considering how big of a success Worm was but I still feel like I ought to ask) would you be willing to consider Interludes? I know asking for interludes after I just asked for the story to advance faster is unfair, but you're hinting at such a wonderfully wide world it would be nice to see it from more perspectives.

I also like how you mentioned how powers can affect a super's mind as much as their body. I like how there is a mental trade off for Hector's clairvoyance (the bad sleep), and it makes me wonder about the invisible assassin. In a show I used to watch called Alphas, that also had an invisible assassin in it, the assassin's power had been 'always on' since she received it and, as such, she found actually being seen very uncomfortable. It's that kind of thing, where having powers leads to a true qualitative difference in experience, that I would love to see more of in this story.

*** I have some ideas for interludes. Would readers accept them in lieu of my regular weekly chapter update, or do they need to be in addition?

**** I know I'm generally disappointed when a scheduled chapter of something I'm into is replaced with an interlude, but you know what? It's your story, and I'm grateful to get to read it however you choose to put it up.

***** Disappointment noted.

I'm currently managing a chapter about every 5 days; I just finished my draft for chapter 13 and started on chapter 14 yesterday.

I'm considering building up to about a two-week buffer, then "spending" some of it on an interlude chapter. That way it doesn't interrupt the weekly schedule.

** Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

- Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
- Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
- The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.
