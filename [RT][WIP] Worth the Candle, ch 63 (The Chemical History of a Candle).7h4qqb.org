** I'm getting a hostile AI vibe from the elf guy, in the sense that he's a foe that the party will assuredly lose to if they engage with him for long enough.

He appears to have (maybe literally?) dialed his Insight up to like a hundred, and seemingly keeps pulling way too much info out of Juniper's tiny misstatements: several times in the last few chapters he's caught a slip up, queried Jun about it, then watched for a reaction while letting the massive Insight-Poise mismatch do some major body language/mind reading work. (e.g. the "residual" statment/Matrix implication cluing him in that Jun is dream-skewered, thus revealing a weakness that can be uniquely targeted by via soul magic?) I just get the feeling that he's mining a ton of info from the smallest of clues and using it to build a way too accurate model of Jun's situation.

All we really know about the guy is that his goal - above escaping the prison/personal freedom, his centuries-long experimentation, or even his immediate personal safety - is to gather information on Juniper. Which makes me think that his curiosity on the subject may go hand in hand with him being able achieve all of the aforementioned, in addition to in him being able to beat the party in a fight. (And given his supremely twisted set of morals betrayal seems kind of inevitable...I know Jun isn't your standard lawful good protagonist, but I can't see him unleashing this psycho on the world to go around casually reprogramming people's minds. And the elf guy almost assuredly knows that Mary was lying through her teeth about him ever getting a pardon/freedom to use soul magic, so now everyone involved knows that one side is ultimately going to end up dead/enthralled.)

If so, then maybe the elf guy's win condition revolves around gathering enough info on Jun's condition to customize a method of attack that is inherently "unblockable" due to the party's unfamiliarity with soul magic, or perhaps Jun's particular weakness to it. (If he's already grasped the entirety of the situation then I could easily see his goal being as basic as rewriting Jun to have access to the superweapon on par with King Arthur.) And Jun wins by ferreting out enough soul magic training to be able to ditch his almost certainly more intelligent tutor (since being hundreds of years old should translate directly to a high Knowledge stat?). This doesn't really bode well.

It's like the soul mage is tailor made as an enemy to counter Juniper: the party is forced to treat with him rather than just kill him, they're playing an infosec game governed by social stats ("dump" stats...), and there's inherent time pressure that forces Jun to engage in such a losing game in the first place.

Even the null counter demon puppet person seems like a challenge deliberately concocted by the DM, with this one subverting the whole "companions are safe" expectation. Like a stage magician the elf guy kept burning potential trap card after trap card, forcing the party to worry about threats like numbers disparity and soul-link mechanics, while quietly sliding the null into the group without much of a fuss. (Apparently she's such a nonthreat she can be countered with a "punch to the mouth"? Really guy?) It could be argued that he left her behind with his rage mutants to die, but assuming he's an enemy that's cleverer than the party he could have by that point modeled Jun accurately enough to have predicted his penchant for "heroism"/avoiding the cowardice debuff.

It could be I'm making the guy out too be way more hyper competent than he actually is, but like I said he just comes across as a threat they'd never have gotten close to if it weren't for their current desperation. Which kind of puts the ball firmly in the bad guy's court here.

Analog could be early-modern surgeons digging up corpses and doing dissection on them, action abhorrent and immoral for their contemporaries. The moral problems of Soul Magic are not dissimilar to problems of invasive brain-computer interface reserach, wich is forbidden for healthy patients in most of (or all) western countries.

#+end_quote

That's a weird question. Not /bad/ weird, but ... there's a set of all the stories that I want to write, and out of that set, which is /enormous/, I've chosen this one, and I don't know that I can boil the "why" down to something sensible.

I guess when I decide to write a story, I have three big criteria:

1. I like to write the sorts of stories that I like to read, because after a few years I'll have forgotten enough of the details that I can come in somewhat fresh to it and have the incredible experience of reading something written /exactly/ to my tastes.
2. I like to write things that are fun to write. What makes a story fun to write varies, but worldbuilding is a big part of it, and little flashes of insight when I've figured something out are another.
3. Given the above, I would much rather go for something that's in low supply, particularly if it's something that I have high demand for (i.e. works that fill holes specific to me).

So this story has a lot of things in it that I haven't seen done in other places, and the high-school-friend-group thing is modeled (almost unethically) closely on actual people, which gives associated therapy/catharsis/nostalgia for me.

But I'm not sure that answers the question, because there are /other/ stories that I could have written that would have filled those same needs and wants for me, and the next thing that I write will have those same three criteria as above, but I don't think that I will be able to say "I needed to write /Worth the Candle/ before this other thing". I'll hopefully be a better writer by the end of this, and hopefully have changed somewhat in the process of spending hundreds of hours writing and thinking, but I don't think it's a prerequisite for those other things that I'll write, nor do I think that I'm writing this because of an honest sit-down consideration of what was most important (or highest utility) for me to write.

*** I'm guessing the author will only convey snippets of it because it sounds like a true game state file that is very, very large.

Our hero will need very high intelligence to parse it. In these kind of games you end up just boosting your INT stat all game long if you're playing a caster, because you need every point you can get. This seems to be the same way, though for a different reason*.

*in the games, all the big enemies are 'resistant' to getting hit with magic and you have a better chance the higher your int stat is. And, of course, the bosses are outright immune to any really 'save or lose' spell, which is why it's generally better to invest in direct damage spells despite them not being very good against mook level enemies...

And many games try to bring in magic immune enemies, making it where the best role of a caster is buffing your companions, since game developers can't really make enemies immune to physical attacks - that would make warrior and archer characters completely useless.

*** To further elaborate on what the others said:

A pointer is exactly what it says on the tin: it's an address that /points to/ a variable. In order to access what's inside the address - or rather, to access the variable itself - you /dereference/ the pointer. It's a very useful tool in programming, but comes with a set of problems:

1) A given program only has access to certain parts of memory. If you dereference some part of memory that you don't have access to, the program crashes.

2) You could potentially dereference some random accessible part of memory that was never initialized. This means that the "variable" you access will be whatever was in that part of the memory at the time, which is difficult to debug because you don't have any idea why you're getting weird numbers or letters.

We solve this problem by using the null pointer, which typically has a value of 0. This is technically an address, but it's an address the program can't access, and is therefore guaranteed to cause a program crash if you try to access it. You can catch this by detecting the null pointer and aborting before even trying to dereference it, which helps you detect failure points in your code, failed memory allocation, and so on.

If the pointer had been a valid (accessible) address, but the /variable/ was never initialized, it's completely up in the air what you'll get. In C, strings are null-terminated, which means you read characters byte by byte until you reach a byte with the value of 0. You'll get a string of nonsense or nothing at all, depending on where that 0 is.

Disclaimer: I'm still a pretty new computer science student and my knowledge is limited to C. And assembly.

From chapter 25 [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/26887371?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_135053688]] Wondering about skin magic, and the Vampire+Portal session

From last chapter (62) [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/29330487?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_137219745]] About inheritance rules, bone magic, and putting skill caps in the hover text on the stat sheet next time it come up.

*** Ah, you know, I have this horrible habit of reading comments like that when I'm on my phone and thinking that I'll answer them later when I'm at a keyboard, then putting responding to them lower on the list of things to do when I'm at a computer, then sort of forgetting about them because they're not in a place that I normally interface with. So I apologize for that. (I also sometimes do this for reddit comments.)

Re: skin magic, that's a read and find out question (i.e. I can neither confirm nor deny, etc.).

Re: St. Paul's cathedral ... I honestly have no clue, but that's how it happened IRL. Probably because cannons are cooler? Or it might have been one of those cases where someone started doing the math and the quest for alternate solutions stopped.

Re: hovertext, it's a pain in the butt and I'm probably dropping it soon once I have some time (read: desire) to devote to it, mostly because it's non-functional for mobile, tablet, or alternate format users, and thus needs to be spelled out in the text /anyway/.

Re: partial draining of bones ... read and find out, maybe? I'm not sure that we'll ever go there, but if we do, I'd rather it were a surprise.

Re: leveling up skills, I've been shying away from showing every in-game message, mostly because they can really screw up the flow of a paragraph meant to convey some other information to the reader or set a mood/tone. Joon has re-capped both Blood Magic and Bone Magic by this point, both at 24.

Re: entads, they take some time/effort/bonding to "set", which is when the inheritance rules are established, though some entads simply don't (heirloom entads are a subset of entads). So there's a window where magical items can be sold or given away, before there's a risk of them simply sticking with the person who made them (which does sometimes happen). More on this later ... maybe.
