*** Oh, and then there's also the issue that a Pascal's Mugging is /not actually simple at all/. The "message" in a Pascal's Mugging has a very /long/ description length, since it involves /parts of my utility function/, which, as a human being, is very complex.

Message: "I'm from outside the Matrix. Give me $5 or I will torture 3^^^3 people forever."

You'd think the Kolmogorov complexity is very small, since you just wrote down the message in a few short words. Actually, it's very large, since the definitions of "outside the Matrix" and, most importantly of "torture" and "people" are actually references to /concepts internal to my mind/.

Now I'm already starting to wonder where you've got that many people from, and what they're like, and if they're even people as I understand them, and noting how you haven't provided many details about such things. Blah blah blah. It suddenly comes to mind that "This man is lying to me" is a much /simpler/ hypothesis than "There really is another whole world containing all those people, who are the kind of people I care about, and this man is telling the truth."

Now, if I'm an AI and there's no prospect that my own hypothesis space is /deliberately lying to me/... But the problem gets thornier, as I said in my other comment, but it occurs to me that I shouldn't invent hypotheses about people so aimlessly, perhaps? Huh. I feel a need to resort to my evidentialist stance, there.

#+end_quote

It's definitely simpler which means it's far more likely. But there *is* some non-zero probability that the man is speaking the truth and the mugger is always able to provide so big negative/positive incentive that basic expected utility calculation suggests that you should always pick the mugger's offer. It's an interesting problem because normal rationalist reasoning breaks down and even Yudkowsky has basically given up and said:

**** /disclaimer: I strongly suspect I don't understand your position and just pattern-match your words into a strawmanship. Sorry about that, could you be more clear on this matter?/

The thing is that while K-complexity of "I'm from outside the Matrix. Give me $5 or I will torture *X* people forever" is enormous for every possible X, it's very easy to invent tremendous numbers with negligible K-complexity (3^^^3, 4^^^^4, Ackermann function of them, etc).

So, whatever K-complexity of this proposal is, I always can substitute something simple and colossal for X, and then expected utility will be positive.

#+end_quote

This would be true if you just valued the size of the number rather than valuing actual people represented /by/ the number.

The K-complexity of /X real things/ scales linearly in the number of things. X people are /at least/ as complicated as X * K-complexity(one person).

Which means that if you try to write down a description of a universe containing X people, its prior probability will drop faster than the utility rises (provided, of course, that your utility on people rises linearly in people rather than exponentially).

O(X) / 2^{-O(X)} -- the denominator will win this battle.

What if I care about perfect copies of one person? What about X perfect copies of one person, but each with some unique experience? Unique experiences are very simple to create: take a planet, take a future brilliant writer and tell him "/write about hobbits/" *or* "/write about spaceships/", run simulation for 10 years, done (yeah, K-complexity is enormous, but it is very easy to scale; bonus points for running simulation for 1000 years and using all descendants of this writer). There are many ways to create X people without having to describe each one of them.

******* Ok, so I do think your criticism works. This feels like a real gap between our ability to write down computational descriptions of worlds, and the actual amount of things that have to happen to really generate such worlds.

I mean, look at it this way: a world with X people in it, each weighing 40kg, requires X * 40kg of /mass/ in it. Since /reality/ is specified in terms of /mass/, we should ideally be rating hypotheses about reality in terms of how much mass, energy, and time they take up. Larger should be considered worse, even if you can write down a very simple computational description of the Very Large Things.

Or alternately, I can be less stupid and revert back to my basic evidentialism that I actually make bets on in real life.

  If you argue that it is more reasonable to contribute to the mitigation of risks associated with artificial general intelligence than to contribute to more or less probable risks then, in case you are not just appealing to intuition, there must be some formalized argument that favors AI risk mitigation over all other possible actions. In other words, you need to formally define “reasonable”.

  Note that the difference between AI risks and other possible risks can't be its expected utility, because that results in Pascal's mugging. The difference can neither be that it is more probable. Because that argument also works against AI risks by choosing risks that are even more probable than AI risks.

**** The problem is that this debate has been conducted in probabilistic terms, because Bayesian probability theory is mathematically "stronger", in the sense of being more consistent and better axiomatized, than the actual scientific method we use in real life.

The actual scientific method says: any theory that hopes to correspond to reality must make falsifiable predictions, and experiments must be done to test those. Utilities are only ever calculated among hypotheses that /could/ have been falsified by evidence, but /weren't/.

Notably, probability theory was constructed in order to deal with games of chance in which all hypothetical outcomes were at least /possible/. Probability has no concept of "impossible", since, as they say, 0 and 1 are not probabilities. Real life, however, very much /does/ have a concept of "impossible". This is why attempts to translate real life into probability theory tend to fail.

In theory, Bayesianism is stronger. In real life, Bayesianism gets bogged down performing probabilistic computations while the scientific method throws out the overwhelming majority of possible theories to deal only with those for which non-falsifying evidence exists.

I think we need some (possibly new?) mathematics for converting between "possibility", "plausibility", and "probability", with some way of ensuring that hypotheses need to pass some notion of a truly rigorous evidential check before being treated as sufficiently probable to enter our decision procedures.

Well, that's the issue.

If you use the kind of reasoning FAI advocates very often use and take things to their logical extreme, you'll end up with truly absurd concepts, like how everything is possible and you should always take into account what the insane god emperors on the other side of the acausal gulf think about your decisions, and how your actions impact the trillions of sentient beings billions of years from now etc. The infamous [[http://kruel.co/2013/01/12/rokos-basilisk-everything-you-need-to-know/][Roko's Basilisk]] is an example of this (beware, Yudkowsky and few others believe you significantly raise the chance of getting eternally tortured if you receive information about Roko's basilisk... depending on how seriously you take this information).

You might even say the FAI argument relies on some of these absurd conclusions because the payoff is that you could "save" those trillions of souls in the future from extinction and that justifies the research even though we don't know how small the likelihood is for any of this.

I don't really have time to read the pictured blog post, but all I can say is that the whole notion of "mathematical realism" is fucking nonsense.

Proof is program, program is proof. Mathematics /is/ computation: it doesn't exist in a realm of platonic ideals or on a universal computer (Schmidhuber published a paper just like this to troll, btw), it's just symbols being manipulated in accordance with fixed rules.

I can write a mathematics in which 2 + 2 = 5. Really, I can. It might not be self-consistent, but that doesn't mean it's "false", it just means that its proof-computations can diverge into saying /anything/.

Goedel showed that consistency (never contradicting itself) and completeness (ability to prove all the /true/ theorems) are opposed to each-other in certain interestingly powerful logics, but that's just another way of saying: some computational problems are undecidable.

So which computations or bits of mathematics are "true"? Well, the ones causally tied in with an external reality /outside the computer/. That's it.

And yet I remain unable to sprout wings and fly. /Which I desperately want to do, because it would be so freaking AWESOME!/

Any theory of causality or possibility that tells me that Some Other Me Somewhere has wings and can fly but doesn't tell me what /I can actually do in this universe/ to become him... is fucking nonsense.

If we really want to engage in that kind of All Possible Universes as Defined by All Possible Turing Machines nonsense, then "possibility" means "the existence of a path through the causal graph from a present point to a certain past or future point", or in other words, something is possible if there's a deterministic way to make it happen. Impossible are the things you can't do because you weren't born in the right branch of reality.

My position is the following: DEATH TO ALL PROSPECTIVE FUTURE GODS WHO REFUSE TO GIVE ME COOKIES!

Now, to be fair, words like "plausibility" and "acausal" are not /identical/ to "impossible". "Acausal trade" is just how a game theorist describes something like basic first-level superrationality, or, as we humans call it in our real lives, /the social contract/.

(This is why you should always check to see that things you /know/ really do exist fall neatly out of your Big Sophisticated Theories. A social theory that tells you prosocial behavior or the social contract can't exist, or a theory of reality that tells you how to trade with future superintelligences but not how to get cookies, is fucking bunk.)

#+begin_quote
  Which is more "impossible" and why?
#+end_quote

See, here's the thing. I don't argue in favor of machine ethics research (which includes the Future of Humanity Institute and some portion of the AGI Conference sponsored by Google, by the way: not just MIRI) on the basis of "WE ALL PROBABLY GONNA DIE UNLESS WE GIVE THIS GUY OUR MONIES!"

I argue in favor of that research because, for the definition of "ethics" used in such research, a more ethical AI is better at giving we humans what we want, like cookies. I want lots and lots of cookies. And other things. The whole point of "machine" in machine ethics is to pretend we have a genie and put aside the issue of Where Goodness Comes From (ie: from God or from social agreement or what), and instead just come up with solid epistemic processes for inferring What People Believe is Good, conditioned in what they believe about the world, thus giving us some idea of what people /truly/ want and wish for. Because then, after all, we can /give it to them/, which will be Pretty Freaking Awesome.

In general, I support research into getting things I want, and when it comes to danger levels I support safety and ethics research guided by /actual experts/ -- which means that the man spearheading machine ethics ought to be Juergen Schmidhuber, Marcus Hutter, or Shane Legg, /not/ Eliezer Yudkowsky /at all/.

/Problem is/, responses on the "danger and ethics" question vary dramatically between those three people. Schmidhuber says, "I am trying to make hard takeoff happen. Fuck human values, have an artilect war instead." Hutter says, "There is a possibility that AIXI could wirehead itself somehow, but that's more a failure of intelligence than of ethics. The danger is in the humans /using/ AIXI." Shane Legg says, "now that my AGI start-up is being bought by Google, we're establishing an ethics board, just in case", but he otherwise agrees with Hutter's position regarding hard take-offs and artilect wars and such.

I think it's this one. In your lifetime, you may have two or three million-to-one chances actually happen, so the median outcome of all those million-to-one chances combined is pretty much identical to the mean outcome (i.e. the expectation). But if you roll a trillion-sided die every second, it's still unlikely that it will come up a 1 in your lifetime (extreme life extension notwithstanding). So the expectation doesn't correspond to what's actually likely to happen (median or mode), and you need to rethink your assumptions.
