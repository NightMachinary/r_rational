Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** My friends and I go to a corn maze every Halloween but can't this year for social distancing so I made a virtual one. We've done it already, so now I'm [[http://noisyowl.com/corn/][sharing it]] with everyone. Would recommend getting some friends together on some sort of voice/video chat and all trying at once.

**** As it should be.

I have several pages in a bookmarks folder, stuff in the two hundred to five hundred dollar range, exact replicas of the same T Rex "Stan" and "Sue" models they have in museums (the one I linked originally is a "Stan" model), along with lots of other dinosaurs, made of the same resin or whatever material they use for the replicas displayed in museums, but like 20 or 30 inches long rather than life-size. They no longer have the option to purchase them for some reason:

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/tyrannosaurus-skeleton-by-favorite/]]

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/tyrannosaurus-skeleton-by-dinostoreus/]]

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/triceratops-skeleton-by-dinostoreus/]]

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/brachiosaurus-skeleton-by-dinostoreus/]]

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/stegosaurus-skeleton-by-favorite/]]

They still sell "resin kits" like this:

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/tyrannosaurus-resin-kit-by-desert-dinosaurs/]]

which you have to assemble yourself, so no. Also this:

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/tyrannosaurus-skeleton-miniature/]]

which is only seventy bucks but also only six inches long.

That "Dan's Dinosaurs" store is still fully operational and you can still add plenty of things to the shopping cart, but all the awesome ones like what I linked are labeled out of stock. It's been like that every time I've checked in for the last year. I don't know if it's permanent or if I'm just checking in when they happen to be out of stock.

After I made my comment, I went googling around, and I found this:

[[https://www.masterreplicasgroup.com/password]]

A placeholder "coming soon" page, but the google result said it was a page for Smithsonian fossil replicas.

And apparently that company has stuff on Amazon, like this is the same product mentioned in the description of the google search link that returned that "coming soon" page:

[[https://www.amazon.com/Nations-Statue-Smithsonian-Replica-Tyrannosaurus/dp/B07XWMM7QW/]]

So hopefully they'll have some full skeletons available as well. Because it's all well and good to fantasize about buying a life-size replica, but you can buy a scale model of the same thing that fits on your bookshelf.

Edit: I guess I could've looked more closely at the "Dan's Dinosaurs" listings to see who the maker of the skeletons actually is.

DinoStoreus's website sells all the same things directly, apparently at a very slightly higher price, but all their skeletons are listed as out of stock as well.

[[https://dinostoreus.com/skeletons/]]

EDIT EDIT: "We really apologize for our unavailable products, and rest assured, we are doing everything possible to get all our out-of-stock dinosaur models back in-stock again as soon as possible."

Excellent.

Just /try/ and tell me that if you went home with somebody and they just casually had that sitting on a shelf that you wouldn't marry them immediately.

******** I don't think I'd be satisfied with the level of quality on display [[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:275091/comments][here]] and [[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1962784/comments][here]]. Even the nicer looking one that's been painted still looks a bit plasticky. Also, several commenters mention some difficulties in getting their printers to actually print the pieces without breaking them.

[[https://shop.elenco.com/consumers/t-rex-skeleton.html][Something like this]] is only seventy-five bucks (sixty bucks on amazon) and it actually looks pretty good, but in a direct side-by-side comparison of [[https://dinostoreus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DS101-tyrannosaurus-skeleton.jpg][Option A]] versus [[https://shop.elenco.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/c1684f745bc47a048a41c4174101bd39/e/d/edu37329_h7fy40ylxrelroy6.jpg][Option B]] versus [[https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/c5/67/07/7e/fa/45CFD2DD-08E6-4B2A-92A6-E70843EAF785.jpeg][Option C]], you can tell that A is higher quality than B which is higher quality than C.

Now, that's certainly not saying that the other two look bad. C looks almost as good as B, and either one would absolutely be a cool A.F. thing to display in your house, but that's not what I'm looking for.

And at a quick glance, the t. rex was the only thing I saw that looked decent. And I don't want just one single t. rex. I want two t. rexes, two triceratops, one stegosaurus, one spinosaurus, two parasaurolophuses, one velociraptor, and one brachiosaurus (I don't understand why those last two have to be at a different scale than the rest of them), plus an assortment of skulls. It'll cost like thirty-five hundred bucks and it'll take like 7 years to accumulate all of them if I'm responsible and only buy one or two a year, but in the end I'll end up with a ton of pieces (most of them as big as or bigger than a cat - the spinosaurus is almost a meter long) that look classy A.F. That's my goal. I don't think 3D printing can deliver me to that goal. I don't want something plastic that looks "cool A.F.," I want something that looks /classy A.F./ Like, I want a room full of bookshelves with museum-quality dinosaur skeletons on them, that's been my aesthetic since I was like 7 years old and if I'm going to actualize it then I want to fully actualize it.

*** Most are dead at the end of their stories (which is typically later than the end of the text they are in).

Lawrence Watt-Evans tends to be pretty good at actually happy endings, where the character has a good situation and some form of immortality when the text ends, and so you can imagine a good rest of story to follow.
