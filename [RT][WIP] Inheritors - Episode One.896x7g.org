*** It was my previous comment actually. I posted this when Reddit was having the site wide issues, I believe.

But essentially I was self promoting my own work. It's a superhero serial exploring themes of depersonalization and formation of identity. I wanted to share it with the sub to see if it was appropriate, as I felt it followed the rules of rational fiction.

**** No problem with you posting your own work here afaik. It's just bound to be more successful if you also make a comment as to why you think it fits here and what people can expect when reading.
