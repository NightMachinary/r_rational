Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I have a sci-fi world that combines elements of The Matrix, Westworld, and Inception in my most high concept idea yet. The Singularity may have solved many problems by uploading everyone into a virtual universe where they could do whatever they wanted, but it turned out that even digital minds need regular REM sleep in order to stay sane. This wouldn't be that big an issue, except that dreaming is now a high-fidelity simulation the subconscious mind creates to trick you into thinking it's real.

This simulation increases in detail with the brain's processing power, which can't be modified on a daily basis, so what happens when someone dreams sentient life into existence? This is a society that thinks it's immoral to delete sentient life and that free will cannot be expressed in a universe run by an omnipresent god, so the only ethical thing to do is save the data from the dreams and integrate it into the virtual reality. People who's whole lives were imagined overnight become refugees in the waking world, while first contact is made with sprawling worlds created by the musings of massive minds.

What kind of civilization would this be where the dreamscape is a new frontier for exploration? I can see immigrants saving money to recreate loved ones who didn't make the cut, political debates about whether to change imaginary worlds to be more hospitable or set up an afterlife, and lucid dreamers being charged with imagining what it was like when people mourned the dead since it subjected people to suffering that turned out to be real.

I honestly don't have an idea for a story in this world, I just think it's an interesting twist on the idea of life in a simulation that allows for boundless possibilities. It could be be like if Night Vale was an urban ghetto in Altered Carbon, Star Trek meets Psychonauts where they visit worlds of fiction filtered through someone's subconscious, a coming of age story about a romantic fantasy searching for the person who made them, or a criminal who hides from the law inside other people's dreams.

*** Why not require those who are advanced enough to dream up sentience to be trained enough in lucid dreaming to not do so automatically? If sentience can be detected and saved from a dream at its conclusion, why can't its imminent formation be detected and aborted? Perhaps it is discovered that not dreaming of people at all gives you mental problems such as losing your theory of mind. Perhaps the current Manhattan project is to have the enhanced humans research how to solve this whole problem while at night they spawn a managable number of immigrants. It seems to me this scenario will be hard to tweak such that it would be hard for a /civilization/ of /superintelligences/ to solve; and if you succeed that fine-tuning might be enough to have the characters discover the fourth wall.

**** I saw the present situation as the solution superintelligences came up with, everyone's dreams can be saved as simulations and the hive mind can tell when sentience emerges from a sufficient accumulation of data. There may even be theories about whether biological minds have always dreamt up sentient people who died upon waking, so they feel morally obligated to preserve this newly discovered life.

Additionally, they probably view integrating dreams into their civilization as a net positive. New people, places, and ideas are being created all the time in a post-scarcity society of immortals who want for nothing. What else is there to do once you grow bored with your comfort zone but to seek out novelty? It's not like they're short on space in a matrioshka brain, and even if they were they can just put people in stasis for now.

This... could actually be a solution for that problem. If all means of creating sentients /other than/ dreams was disallowed. (That is, you can't fork a copy of yourself, and you can't create a mind to order).

The more superintelligences there are, the more excess space they need for the dreamborn they are more likely to make.

The big consequence of this is that most characters can be relatively human, and that a server with even a single superintelligence can have huge populations of dreamborn from worlds they had imagined. However, I'll say that a superintelligence doesn't need to sleep on a daily basis so new worlds aren't constantly appearing overnight.

** Time travel is difficult and expensive...or at least it was until some insane wizard teleported into our reality and made it easily available to Muggles in our world.

You have Time Turners as they are used in the Harry Potter books where anyone can travel back in time, but history can't be altered since all time traveling results in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop][Stable Time Loops]]. Arbitrary restrictions are no going back more than 6 hours into the past (even if you used a different one in the past to attempt 6 more hours), only one person can use a device at a time, and they are easily accessible (for at least the first few days before anyone tries to control their supply).

There is no other magic available; I'm just curious what impact Time Turners would have on our society.

EDIT: Feel free to also answer how you think society would develop if this ability has been around for a long time rather than it just miraculously appearing one day.

*** Isn't the answer to such questions always 'somebody doesn't get their learning neural net/seed AI quite right before sticking it into a time loop, and we all die'?

Less flippantly:

- I expect many, /many/ zero-day exploits to occur starting six hours before Mr. Magic gave out time machines. Disconnect all devices from the Internet and hope you aren't too late (you are).

- The global economy crashes horribly. If the markets somehow manage to survive, there's probably now a six-hour (minimum) wait for any transaction.

- Spy agencies can recieve data from six hours into the future. Expect Minority Report-style police teams to show up seconds /after/ crimes have been committed.

- Disaster relief teams have up to six hours to prepare for instant response.

- Weather is predictable with perfect fidelity up to six hours ahead.

- Sufficiently motivated thieves can fence their loot /before/ stealing it.

How do the mechanics of time travel respond to precommitment to violate causality unless <improbable event> occurs? Can we use exploits like in chapter 17 of HPMOR (instant factoring of large numbers), or is there some 'do not mess with time' filter that intervenes?

HPMOR and some of the proposed solutions to the final exam talk about some of this in detail. I recall [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] has some detailed time travel exploits w.r.t. disaster response.

I'm not sure because I don't have too good of a grasp on the consequences on whether or not causality is violated or what it means if improbable events can be easily 'fabricated'. The closest understanding I have is the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes][Outcome Pump]] which basically means easy access to godlike power.

Poorly.

Most of modern cryptography is rendered null, and thus every device not protected by an air gap is likely compromised. The process of identifying, adapting, and distributing systems that might still be secure (one-time pads, Carter-Wegman) would take ages, and the damage done by bad actors in the meantime will be excessive.

It's even worse from a physical security perspective - with basic time travel you can arrange to have a signal sent from the future which tells you that your objective was successful and not act unless you recieve said signal. If you can also precommit resources towards retroactively undoing false-positives, this guarantees either your success or that your opponents have interfered via time travel of their own. Warfare and counterterrorism now become even more of a game of cat and mouse. With a full-on loop, you can extract detailed information on how your plan failed and iterate again. Weird things may happen like the authorities waiting seven hours to arrest perpetrators so the 'guaranteed success' described here does not work.

You probably have to wait at least six hours in isolation before any kind of standardized testing to ensure you didn't get the answers from the future. Ditto for giving witness at any kind of trial so you can't prep for unexpected questions. Changing anything security-related definitely takes seven hours minimum.

On the positive side of things, computationally-expensive but fully specifiable problems are now solved as soon as someone sets up a vaild loop. Protein-folding, searching for gene sequences, finding large primes, computer chip design, searching through interesting datasets, etc.

There are some interesting alert systems you can set in place for unexpected deaths - if someone is in a car accident, automatically send the name and cause of death back six hours. If the system receives a given name, send it back six hours later even if nothing happened in your time line. People who pay attention to this service should in theory never die due to sudden accidents (assuming you have an easy way to avoid whatever happened). Now in addition to 'sick days' at work you have 'death days', where you stay home because otherwise you'd get in a fatal traffic accident. If done right, deaths due to car/train/plane accidents, surgery, heart attack, drowning, and more can all be avoided.

Edit Addendum:

You can also get the results of any six-hour course of action before or without actually going through with it. Thus, persons wishing to avoid counterfactual kidnapping and interrogation must set up a time loop of their own that is fail-deadly to interference. This will not necessarily prevent said counterfactual kidnapping and interrogation, but it /will/ alert you if it happens. Sort of like a cell phone fail-safe 'text 1 if you're okay' except it's 'if you are recieving this message, you will not be kidnapped in the next 6 hours'.

Then password hacking and various cryptography hacks become laughably small-scale. Think *BIGGER!* If you are the first person to get a time turner, do the following:

1. Write a computer program that quickly outputs random strings of characters in black every time you run it. Make it output the characters in red if the new string is exactly the same as the previous string. Make it so that every random string is equally likely: i.e., "a" is as likely as "asdaiosidfhpjdq jwi dq23rvW#$WV!.a, isd".

2. With the program open and ready to run, close your eyes for a while.

3. When you open them:

3a. if the program hasn't been run, wait 6 hours, then time turn back and run the program.

3b. otherwise, obey the outputted string to the best of your ability. Within the next 6 hours, if you become god, time turn back and use your god powers to make the program output the same string you obeyed. If you haven't become god, time turn back, and run the program. If the program gives the same random string that you just obeyed, run it again and again until either you get a different random string or you got the same string 1000 times in a row (you can immediately tell if it is the same string after the second time because it will be output in red).

There are only three stable time loops:

A) You find that the program hasn't been run. You died in the next 6 hours, before you would time turn back. So future you never comes back to run the program. Try to prevent this loop by staying in a very secure location and doing nothing dangerous for those 6 hours.

B) You find that the program has been run. You obeyed the random string and became god. You time turned back and used your god powers to make the program output the same random string. You are now god.

C) You find that the program has been run. You obeyed the random string but did not become god. You time turned back and ran the program, but it gave the same string. You ran it again and again a thousand times but it kept giving the same string out of sheer random chance. You conclude that either there is no way to become god in 6 hours that can be written in a million characters, or you are extremely unlucky. Like somewhere around 1/10^{1000?} unlucky depending on how many ways there are to become god in 6 hours that can be written in 1 million characters.

If you get outcome (A), you are now dead. Should have planned your secure location better.

If you get outcome (B), you are now god. Pat yourself on the back, remake the world to your will or whatever.

If you get outcome (C), repeat the experiment with a different overpowered goal. Like finding instructions for how to freely time travel or gaining super speed (which would make the next set of experiments far more powerful since now you can do a lot more in 6 hours). If you're in a rush, you can actually combine a lot of these experiments together to get more out of your time.

*** In order to really make this sensible you need to put a limitation about not being able to use roundabout ways to transmit information farther back than 6 hours, because as is there' nothing stopping multiple people chaining information together as far back as desired, this restriction is basically mandatory because if you don't implement it then you should expect the post-singularity world to /immediately/ spill backwards in time resulting in a world full of bizarre bootstrap paradoxes and stable time loops that nonetheless is extremely alien.\\
Also you will probably need to alter things such that time itself actively conspires to prevent you from abusing bootstrap paradoxes or using the stable time loop limitation to generate arbitrary information and other such tricks.

Basically if you don't want this to immediately end up turning into some incomprehensible post singularity setting you'll need to put the same limits on the time turners as were implemented in HPMoR.

** I'm trying to refine this setting that I thought of, I need help to identify any inconsistent elements and to further develop my ideas.

In this world, there is Mana, which is everywhere, it can be used by many plants and animals, and all humans. So it depends if an animal evolved to use magic or not and humans did evolve to use magic.

So the magic can be used by all humans but there are differences in how much mana their body can process, so this leads to weaker or stronger magic users. It's somewhat dependent on genetics but not entirely, kind of like intelligence.

So magic has always been part of life for people of this world, of course there will be other humanoid races which I haven't fleshed out yet. There's also wide variety of magical beasts and plants. Mythical beasts like dragons unicorns, etc as well.

The first humans were able to use very basic and simple magic, highly inefficient and very intuitive kind of magic, they overtime improved in using magic. But most early human communities developed Ritual magic first as it allowed them to sidestep the early inefficiency of magic. Magic was passed on within families and became like an inheritance.

Later on as the humans began to settle down, and agriculture happened, the communities began to specialise in certain types of magic. Families began to specialise in their own type of magic, and as they developed the most powerful families were leading the village, and against external threats these villages were forced to develop into cities. A city is ruled by a council made up of the most powerful families as well as independent mage who are powerful.

So each area(city and its surroundings) in this world, would have their own general specialty, like one area specialises in water magic, etc. It would depend on what type of area they live in, and what type of threats they face.

There are no limits to the type of magic one can practice, as it all depends on time and practice.

There is also the aspect of bloodline magic, certain types of magic can be passed on to your descendents, most bloodline magic is created through rituals. And in order for descendents to awaken their bloodline magic, they have to complete a step according to the ritual, otherwise the bloodline magic will lie dormant. A dormant bloodline will still give you some enhancements.

There are no religions in this world and no gods, there may be powerful god like entities but no gods, and no organised religion.

And also this world never develops kingdoms and empires, the largest polity would be cities and there will be no Kings or royalty, as the rule of cities is done jointly by the strongest families, no single family is strong enough to rule the city alone and it is near impossible to destroy a strong family as they'll have built up magical defences over the generations on their Home and the same with cities, taking a city is too costly to attempt which is why no one has been able to conquer another city. So no kingdoms.

Many magical beasts have special materials which can be harvested not always by killing them. There also natural materials like magical metals or crystals which have special uses.

Types of magic specialisations

Slayers- This is a magic that absorbs certain aspects of magical beasts that you slay, like killing a dragon may give you claws or scales etc, depends on the ritual. It also gives general enhancments to strengh, speed etc Can be passed on through bloodline magic.

Shifters- This is a magic that allows one to turn into a magical beast, the ritual requires a live specimen of the beast. Can be passed on through bloodlines.

Tamers - These guys raise magic beasts for their materials as well as for fighting and selling as familiars. They are the experts in rearing beasts, different families specialise in rearing different kinds of beasts, and the knowledge is accumulated over the generations.

Riders- These guys are experts in riding magical beasts and for combat They tie their bloodline with a bloodline of magical beasts and leave them in the wild so that their descendents can find the beasts and awaken their connection.

Hunters - These guys hunt special magical beasts for materials or juvenile beasts to sell, they also specialise in certain areas and types of beasts as the knowledge is accumulated through the generations.

Herbalists - These guys dabble in using herbs and plants to create concoctions for healing and buffs etc. The knowledge is passed on through generations.

Elementalists - These are magic users who use elemental magic and have contracted elementals which particularly strengthens their elemental magic. The elementals are found in special regions and contracting one is very difficult, the knowledge in how to find and contract one is passed on in families.

Shamans- They specialise in using rituals and are proficient in buffing and enhancement magics. They can make permanent enhancement through ritual tattoos by binding the spirits of departed beasts. The rituals are passed on in the families.

Druids- They specialise in using rituals to be able to transform into magical beasts, but this requires a special part of the beast(like unicorns horn) and a ritual and they have to always keep that part of the beast to transform, and they can only transform for a limited amount of time. The beast part can be passed on to descendents but they'll have to redo the ritual to be able to transform at will.

Enchanters - They are able to enchant items or weapons to be able to produce certain magical effects when those items are infused with mana. The knowledge of the enchantments is passed on through families.

Smiths- These are the people who work with magical metals and magical beast parts to shape them into weapons or armors etc. The knowledge of how to work with different magical animals or metals is passed on in the family.

Seekers(Ranger?) - They specialise in magic that allows them to be stealthy and fins the lairs magical beasts or find magical plants to sell. The techniques and magic of surviving is passed on in the family.

Hexblades - They are magic users who have mastered the use of magic weapons and posses a variety of different magical weapons. They magical weapons are passed on in the families.

Explorers - They specialise in searching for new things, magical beasts, magical plants or trees, special places, exploring dangerous areas, making contact with other races etc. To be an explorer you need to be really powerful and/or rich to finance expeditions. These are very rare and no families specialise in it.

Wizards - These guys are at the forefront of researching magic and studying and creating magic, they mainly use spells to induce magical effects and create scrolls, expendable spells which are powered by imbuing the scroll with mana.

Casters- They use magic through voice like poetry or singing, this helps them focus the magic and can strengthen the magic. The art of poetry or singing needs to be taught, passed on in familes, and the power of magic needs to be bound to the voice through a ritual, which turns it into a bloodline.

Arcanists(Magewright) - They use language as the basis of magic, using it to shape magic. The language needs to be bound to magic through a ritual first. The language is kept secret and only passed on in the family

Sorcerers- They are powerful magic users who have not learned or can't control their power fully. They have large capacity to process management but with that they rarely learn to finely control magic. They are usually born to small families and thus their magical guidance is limited.

Some problems that I have is that with no religion, how will the people find a purpose in life, in the beginning it'll just be survival and then as they develop what will their goals or motivations be? How will they stay on the correct moral code? Also what should I do about souls, as I believe that souls are eternal in this world so where will they go after death? Reincarnation or a spirit world?

  Some problems that I have is that with no religion, how will the people find a purpose in life, in the beginning it'll just be survival and then as they develop what will their goals or motivations be? People are not born with religion. People will find a purpose in life the same way people will find a purpose in life now. For most people religion isn't their purpose in life or a primary concern even if they pay lip service to it. Moral codes are generally acquired through culture rather than scripture. People aren't magically born with an inherent desire to serve a god or gods. They get trained into it via systems of reward and punishment and stuff like the threat of hell that doesn't always take.

The reason people don't murder others isn't because they are born with an ingrained desire to serve religion and religion says murdering is bad. It isn't because they fear the threat of eternal hell. It is because they are generally born with the capacity for basic human empathy.

In any case people not having religion in your world makes no sense. There is very literal magic with rituals and stuff that actually works. People are going to worship that harder than primitive tribes worshipped the sun and weather. The magic would also probably prove Intelligent Design so at the very least your world is going to be deist.

#+begin_quote
  And also this world never develops kingdoms and empires, the largest polity would be cities and there will be no Kings or royalty, as the rule of cities is done jointly by the strongest families, no single family is strong enough to rule the city alone and it is near impossible to destroy a strong family as they'll have built up magical defences over the generations on their Home and the same with cities, taking a city is too costly to attempt which is why no one has been able to conquer another city. So no kingdoms.
#+end_quote

This also makes no sense. Large cities should be able to take out smaller cities unless your magic has a major defensive advantage or is geographically specific. Even then a city could be attacked through economic warfare or outright bought. Kingdoms aren't just formed through conquest. They are also formed through strong alliances for trade or economic profit. If City A and City B have a strong trade between each other and there is a river in between then they might co-operate to build a bridge and perhaps create a unified council to work on shared projects like it. Members from the ruling council of City A might marry members of the ruling council of City B and so on. There are a lot of things in economics and administration which benefit from centralisation and standardisation. Those benefits would push cities to unify much like they push cities to unify in our own ancient past.

I find it unlikely that every single city would have a council of ruling families rather than at least some having a hierarchy with a head family. Some having kings and so on. You would also expect that rich families with lots of powerful blood magics would end up having more kids which would end up spreading the blood magic.

** Apples fall down because people believe they fall down. People grow old because they are expected to.

Imagine a world that look like ours on the surface but that are run by the belief of people down to the core. We'll call the unit of belief mana. Each person only have a certain amount of mana and mana is spent unconciously to effect the world in the way that the person believes. People who have certain strong beliefs have more of their mana allocated to those beliefs and people with no strong beliefs don't use their mana as much. Effects are localized by default but can be extended with a diminished return of effect, ie. the belief that everything is made of atoms is universal and therefore each person who believes it only reinforces it with a tiny ammount. Two contradicting beliefs can damage each other, with the stronger ending out on top or can create multiple coexisting subbeliefs.

Imagine the total power of all humans to be growing linearly by the number of people with a sharp artificial drop around the scientific revolution, such that a hypothetical belief created just before that period that were shared by all people would be roughly 4 times the strength of a similar belief created today.

Clearly there would be weak versions of the older gods and some version of an abrahamic god exist. Hinduism have a lot of followers by they also have a large number of gods so each individual god would have relative less power. Vampires exist in many different variations, not by geographic location but by trope.

In which other ways do you think that the world would be different?

*** For one thing settings like this have the obvious issue that no matter what you do it's /never/ going to look remotely like our world unless you're massively tampering with things so they don't progress naturally.

Firstly you have the issue of how things arise in the first place, is the world following the same rules as our own up until some life evolves intelligent enough to start mucking everything up? If so then you expect the first fish with an internal model of the world (and thus beliefs) to rapidly evolve to have stronger and stronger beliefs (about things important to its genetic fitness) until the universe is dominated by fish-gods.

If the ability isn't gradually imbued and just instantly appears in early humans then things are still going to be pretty weird. After all for most of human history people overwhelmingly believed in animism and magic, which means you're going to suddenly have humans be outnumbered by non-human spirits whose beliefs will then trump those of humans. Alternatively another stable attractor state might be that since people believe in magic tribal shamans will have their beliefs count vastly more because of other people's belief in their power. They can then use this power to impress their followers thus reinforcing the beliefs in their power even more, this spirals upwards until the world ends up ruled by a single godlike tribal shaman or multiple ones (though having more than one is likely to be an unstable equilibrium).

There's different ways things could play out depending on initial conditions, however something that needs to be understood about powers like this is that they're extremely likely to spiral out of control due to feedback loops in people's belief or other situations where the power of belief is having a recursive effect on itself.\\
One thing however you should never see is magic getting /less/ powerful, since people will always believe in it if they've seen it and human tendencies bend towards exaggeration rather than downplaying events so magic should always get more powerful over time.

***** Even without beliefs being able to directly affect how other beliefs are scored (as in belief that some beliefs have more or less psychological "power" doesn't affect them) pretty much all of the same issues still remain.

For instance if you can't tamper with how beliefs are scored then you can simply increase the strength of your own belief to incredible levels and also increase the strength of others shared belief, so effectively you're altering your mind so that you can generate the amount of belief that would ordinarily be created by a vastly larger number of people.\\
Similarly you could believe rather strongly in fertility related magic and have your tribe take over because you all have a crazy amount of kids which mature extremely fast and are all extremely conformist and share their parents beliefs. Even better however you don't need to rely on normal breeding either, since you can just believe in the existence of spirits which share your beliefs. This belief thus creates those spirits ex-nihilo and then those spirits can produce more belief power, thus enabling them to spawn even more spirits.. leading to an exponential explosion...

Another thing to mention would be that even putting the above issues aside there's still going to be a tendency for things to converge until you get a single god. After all you start out with lots of shamans, but some of those shamans go to war and defeat others with their magic. This results in them having new people who believe in and fear their power thus increasing it further. And so sooner or later you end up with a single god who is never usurped because nearly everyone believes in their power and so any usurpers can't hope to compete with that since they have less belief power.

**** It could somewhat work with some reinterpretations of history. Suppose this "belief-magic" slowly evolved with human intelligence, and can only be used by actual physical beings, not belief-beings. I.e., you can't believe in something that believes in itself to strengthen your belief magic. That seems like a natural law to have in a magic setting, just like how in standard magic settings you can't create more magic out of magic, so you can't cast magic spells to refill your MP bar.

And then you would need historical events to happen that weaken the power of magic to get to our modern world. First, you could have the church declare that magic is evil witchcraft (good motive: less magic = more stable societies/ evil motive: only my organization will have magic, called god's blessings). The people with stronger belief-magics that let them cause supernatural events would be branded as witches and swarmed by church believers who think god will protect them from evil witchcraft, thus nullifying the witch powers and making them helpless as they burn at stake.

The scientific revolution would then start out as some kind of conspiracy of magic-haters, who decide to raise societies that are indoctrinated from young with the belief that supernatural events are all frauds. It would then snowball quickly, because these societies would be full of powerful nullifiers, wiping out the belief-magics of other societies as they spread, adding more to their ranks as self-proclaimed mages try to use magic in front of the nullifiers and fail because they have been nullified, further "proving" that magic isn't real to everyone watching.

See this doesn't really work as a solution because beliefs are stated to be able to have nearly unlimited power to affect the physical world (they can even affect the laws of physics after all!). Which means if "spirits" can't have their belief count then instead people could simply believe in other entities who are close enough to physical humans.\\
Also if belief magic evolved with human intelligence then you have the same evolutionary issues I mentioned before. Except in this case maybe it's some birds, monkeys or whales who first reach the starting point, then they rapidly begin an evolutionary arms race to increase their belief power (through stronger beliefs, more intelligence) which again results in things being rules by eldritch gods.

Similarly you're thinking of things as being way too close to our own world starting out. For instance since nearly all cultures start out with animism and belief in magic then those cultures will actually have that magic. They will believe in it much more strongly because they see it which results in a rapid feedback loop. Point is magic would start out way too much a part of everyone's life for any ideology to take hold which actually forbid it, for the same reasons it would be wildly implausible to imagine some sort of super-luddites ever converting most of the world to their religion in the modern world.

I'm thinking of making the starting point more recent so it is closer to our world. Since this magic is based on "belief", it isn't unreasonable to assume it has some minimum intelligence requirement to activate, since creatures that are too dumb can't have "beliefs". Make it so that this minimum threshold was only passed by humans in recent history (~10000 years), so the animals can't join in, and belief-magic would only become strong enough start having significant effects around maybe ~5000 years ago as humans kept getting smarter.

Is it so implausible though? Suppose a skeptic tribe and a mage tribe of roughly equal power went to war against each other. Then, just by random chance, the number of people from each tribe that participate in each skirmish would be different, and so there would be skirmishes where the mage beliefs are stronger and they can use their magic, and skirmishes where the skeptic beliefs are stronger and the mages magics fail.

Let's look at how the beliefs of each tribe change in each skirmish. In the skirmish where the magic fails, the skeptics validate their beliefs that magic isn't real, that's a positive feedback loop. The mages start doubting their magics, since they failed, or start believing the skeptic tribe has some kind of magic nullifying ability. That is also a feedback loop that makes it more likely for magic to fail in future skirmishes.

What about the skirmish where the magic succeeds? Well, the mages would validate their beliefs that magic is real and strong enough to counter the skeptics' nullifying powers, that's a positive feedback loop. But the skeptics won't believe that magic is real. They are skeptics. They will think it is a fraud. That the mages are just using tricks to create special effects that they call magic. That the mages' magic is mostly fakes that they can't consistently produce at the same power. And so the skeptics' belief that magic isn't real reduces by little or not at all. So the feedback loop on this side is weaker.

This way of thinking, that other people are frauds trying to trick you, gives the skeptics a massive advantage in terms of belief feedback loops. This in turn could make them win against mage tribes of equal strength, absorb them and turn them into more skeptics, and thus expand exponentially the same way mage tribes did. It wouldn't work if they went up against mage tribes that were significantly stronger than them, but in thousands of years it's not so hard to believe that some skeptic tribe eventually gets lucky in their battle matchups.

Alternatively, you could always just tweak the magic system to give the skeptics an advantage. You could argue that since mage beliefs force the world to deviate from the natural order, they cost more mana than skeptic beliefs that bring the world back to its natural state. Thus nullifying magic would be far stronger than other magics.

See even that doesn't work because people start using fertility magic to breed at some absurd rate or something similar. More generally the issue here is that the amount of rules you need to tack on to make a system like this work is so extensive that you either end up defining your preferred system into existence (which feels a bit dirty and renders questions of what a world with those rules would be like moot) or you almost certainly leave loopholes. And not the sort of loopholes that make it exploitable by a clever munchkin either, but the kind of loopholes that destroy plausible deniability.\\
Not to mention you have /sooo/ many other exploits besides just creating more people to share your beliefs.

The issue is that that explanation doesn't even come close to working, you would be better off just saying humans got this power at a set point in time just because.\\
It doesn't work because if you say that a certain level of intelligence is required for beliefs to "count" then you're forced to exclude any belief which wasn't produced by a cognitive process of some given level of complexity which becomes super hard to apply as a rule. Not to mention it's not clear how you would even go about judging a cut off like that since animals which are clearly capable of having complex models of the world that could be called beliefs have been around long before humans.\\
Not to mention if you're going to set a cut off point wherein this only starts applying to proto humans then you're still going to have an evolutionary arms race since the selection effect for intelligence is suddenly vastly greater, which almost certainly doesn't result in something that looks like modern humans.\\
Also there's really no evidence that the genetic underpinning for human intelligence has really meaningfully changed in the last 10k years and even some weak evidence which would seem to point in the other direction. I mean you have the Flynn effect more recently, however a lot of what that covers is getting rid of malnutrition, chemical exposure and other thing which would have affected agrarian cultures more than hunter gatherers (as in how we were for nearly all of our history) also if you're talking about something like that then only sufficiently clever people should have these abilities so they wouldn't just suddenly arise.

See you really can't fundamentally stop beliefs from strengthening themselves if you're going to accept that some people have stronger beliefs than others or even that intelligence is a relevant multiplier on power. If you have it be graduated like you were previous implying then that gradient is going to be something that can be exploited by using belief to "hack" the brain as it were. Also getting other people to join in is also something with plenty of other extremely exponential feedback loops as well, for instance as has been pointed out charismatic people could end up in a feedback loop that ends with them having mind control.\\
Sure you could crudely attempt to patch those issues but you either end up with vague rules that basically just eliminate anything you don't like (which isn't great world building) or you leave /many/ loopholes no matter how you try to avoid them.

What you're failing to realize is that you don't get skeptic tribes period, I'm literally unaware of /a single culture/ that didn't start out with widespread supernatural beliefs and practice something like magic (even if it be praying to deities). So if all cultures start out with magic it's hard to imagine an exception gaining power, since they have to compete in terms of belief not just with their enemies but also with the entire rest of the human race. Also it's pretty likely people would be using magic to help them get food, cure disease and other such things so people would be extremely resistance to relinquishing magic and doing so would /severely/ lower their genetic/memetic fitness.

"No it was just a trick" "but he did blow up sir" "well /yes/ but it wasn't /magic/" "What the hell does it matter what we call it!". The issue is that proving something (like say magic) is super easy and not a gradual process, however _dis_proving it is much harder and is a gradual process of lowering certainty (when it comes to something expected to be unpredictable to begin with). Plus if you see your enemies doing something, well you may deny it's magic but you still believe they can do that because you saw it, and what you call something probably doesn't really matter here.

******** Thanks for engaging in this.

Ideally I would like as few patches as possible.

I'll remind you that people can't choose what they believe. They might think that they believe something when they really don't. That of course doesn't stop the charismatic leaders from persuading people but it does stop the low hanging munchkin. For instance you can't just start believing that food instantly pops into existance because you are hungry and need it.

On that note it seems likely to me that charismatic leaders with sufficiently many followers did become gods. I'm not seeing any good arguments as to why people wouldn't be affected by other people's beliefs, so you'd expect that gods would end up acting in certain set patterns, as many people not only had beliefs about their power but also their behaviour. There's nothing wrong in any of that.

I'd say that intelligence probably should be separate from(or perhaps even have a diminishing effect on) belief effects, as both take energy. A certain intellince would be required to have a model of the world but I haven't decided on why people specifically have this power. I am thinking either

- It's related to some set of natural laws that the human brain chemistry happened to mutate to mildly affect. Evolution made it more powerful but evolution is a slow and messy process, and belief control is a complex process. The complexness of it also slows the process.
- Another specie(or species) actually were first and their beliefs granted humans the same power(or actually created humans). The animalism religions are remnants of that period and humans won the great war.

Your point about power convergence is valid although I think you are overstating the nessecity. Different groups fight over power and empires crumble, especially if they are controlled by people who act in patterns. I wonder how settings in which gods are powered by worshippers tend to handle that.

The point about the power of population is valid. It isn't as much a problem historically speaking but it's a problem for the story I had in mind. Essentially MC and others have their limiters removed and have their beliefs altered to fight off a major existential threat. It would just be more efficient to breed a trillion kids and convince them that a) someone has absolute power b) pregnancy happens in seconds and c) food spontaneously appear if you are hungry. Suggestions for reasons to why that might not happen aside from moral conserns?

Given humans seem to be really good at tricking themselves into believing things that are convenient (for instance it's bizzare how many cult leaders start out knowing they're full of shit but eventually end up drinking their own kool aid, potentially even literally), so given the limited power of a single belief anyway I'm not sure world breaking power being limited to cults really solves the major issues here.

Yes in theory you could do just fine with a setting with gods, however the primary issue with this settings premise is that it tends to rapidly spiral into the kind of setting too alien to really write stories in. And even if you limited writing to the transitionary period when things would still be recognizable to humans, well it's pretty much impossible to try to take into account all of the the complex interactions involved here.

For instance here's some things off the top of my head that would be an issue with a world that rapidly ended up devolving into having gods: For one you probably wouldn't have multiple gods for long, since whichever god was slightly strongest would likely win out in terms of belief and in a direct conflict any small gains could be amplified. If course their would be some randomness here, however long term having a single god would seem like the only stable scenario.\\
Secondly since people will probably believe their god to be the most wise and the most just it seems like things sort of end up with you having effectively a godlike FAI which while desirable does get you a very alien world without large scale conflict.\\
And lastly is that due to the feedback loop that grants charismatic people mind control, it's likely that competing gods are going to turn their followers into not totally human thralls in order to gain the upper hand. Which of course results in a even more alien outcome than a FAI utopia.

As someone who doesn't spend entirely too much time munchkining fictional scenarios I think you serious underestimate the scale of the issue here. It's not just that power will tend to snowball, but that once it does you're never going back to normal. Once one empire of cultists gains an edge they can beat everyone else and then there's no realistic way for less powerful factions to gain power. Worse for the reasons I stated before the end result isn't do much a fantasy world with gods who grant their clerics power, but something so alien it's hard to even speculate about.

Even putting aside power convergence I haven't even gone over all the ways the setting is going to be massively altered just by the beliefs most people hold by default. For instance nearly everyone believes they are above average in basically every regard, which means that every person has the belief of most people being worse than them causing them to /become/ worse and most people only have a small group of people whose beliefs will protect them from the rest of humanity.\\
So if everyone believes they're cleverer and healthier than most people then everyone will have their abilities reduced in an out of control feedback loop until either they die from some physical qualities being reduced too far, or the population is all rendered too dumb for their beliefs to hold any power.

Another example is that tribes (i'd say groups generally except all this starts mattering during a period when non-tribe groups wouldn't really be prominent) tend to naturally demonize their outgroup. Which means that if every tribe is demonizing every other tribe except themselves then you get another feedback loop that results in humanity rendered cartoonishly evil, though of course I can't predict exactly how the various feedback loops would interact but it doesn't likely end well.

And of course that's just a spattering of random beliefs people basically all have by default due to their psychology, which would rapidly overhaul and begin rapidly throwing the setting off the rails right out of the gate.

Umm... people would be able to believe random pieces of paper or virtual bits are valuable, and they will actually become valuab- oh wait that's money and bitcoins.

Err... when people expect something to happen they will see it happen more ofte- oh wait that's confirmation bias.

Hmm... there would be psychics wielding supernatural powers because they believe they are special, and then skeptics who strongly believe that there's no such thing as supernatural powers would go to the psychics and prove that they are frauds, and the stronger belief of the skeptic would nullify the psychic's powers so psychic powers are never proven... argh!

Oh I know! The scientific revolution produced a lot of skeptics so the frequency of supernatural events per person per day should be far lower after the scientific revolution than befor- oh wait it is.

Erm... are we sure we aren't already living in this world?

**** If we were, then there would be a luminiferous aether through which light moves in the same manner as sound travels through air. Confirmation bias would not merely be a perceptual effect but would be statistically measurable even when considering /all/ possible data. Heavier things would fall faster.
