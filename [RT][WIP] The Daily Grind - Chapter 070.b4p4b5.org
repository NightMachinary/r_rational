** So orbwise, I think it works like this,

There are four types of use for an Orb.

1. Imbue. This seems to come with some aspect of vitality or vital energy alongside it. The orb is absorbed into something to transform it into something alive or similar to life in line with it's element.

2. Absorb. This merges the orb into your body, giving you an internal reservoir of that orb's element. Greater control and versatility then cracking.

3. Crack. This gives you a randomised, theoretical benefit you could have gained from the element, focused on yourself. More powerful but less control over the outcome then absorbing.

4. Totem. These broadcast the element.

Yellow is Time. Comes from native fauna of the Office. Imbuing Time into something creates life. Absorbing it gives a reservoir of Time that sustains you as it ticks down. Cracking a Yellow gives a skill you could have theoretically learned by spending enough time. Totem unknown.

Blue is Tool. Comes from magic items. Imbuing Tool is unknown, might create magic items. Absorbing it gives you a limited number of uses for a unique superpower. Cracking it solves one problem, semi-randomly. Totem for Tool supposedly creates magical objects within it's broadcast range.

The following is more hypothetical on my part.

Red is possibly Awareness. Comes from disarming traps. Imbuing unknown, might create traps. Absorption unknown, might grant some form of enhanced perceptions. Cracking grants the benefits you could have theoretically gained from self-awareness, a greater understanding and harmony with your own emotions and sense of self. Totem grants a particular awareness to those in it's range.

Green is (possibly) Work. Comes from a bunch of bigger creatures and Employees/Puppets. Imbue unknown, may create Employees/Puppets (Workers). Absorption unknown. Cracking grants theoretical benefits from extra Work in a local area, like reduced crime, later open hours, partial rent covered, renovations, etc. Totem unknown.

Orange is weird. Comes from space-distorting creatures and totems. Imbuing unknown. Absorption unknown. Cracking grants things like licences and ownership. Totem warps space and time in it's reach. My person theory right now is that orange is Authority. Or I guess just Space, to balance the yellows with Time.

Finally, there's purple. Traded for with the monitor lizards that live in idea trees. Imbue to create infomorphs. Absorption unknown. Cracking grants Shell Upgrades in the form of personal, permanent enhancements. Totem is unknown. I have vague ideas the Element could be "Conceptualisation", or something similar that would result in upgrades, like "Design" or "Refinement".

Anyway that's my understanding plus ideas.

*** If the purple represents reality of refinement, then perhaps the monitor tree has deep roots, that cracks into the building blocks of the dungeon, and allows it to produce purple orbs? Otherwise, why would it produce these?

** Can anybody give me a refresher on the orb types/uses?

Yellow - theme: time - used to power Ganesh/illipedes, et Blue - healing (often messing with casuality) Green - beneficial environmental effects

*** Blues aren't healing, they're tools. All their effects are geared towards being used or being useful.

Reds, I'm pretty sure, are sensation/perception. When crushed, they give emotional resonance, when warded they give off information about the general area, and when imbued they create traps (the key piece there being that a trap must be able to determine if it's been triggered)

Greens I'm less certain of, but my current best guess is that they are ownership.

Purples I think are are about reality. When imbued into an idea they create infomorphs (making the idea "more real") and when crushed they amplify the users body (more real as a physical object)

Oranges are structure. When crushed they give access to bureaucracy, and when warded they warp the physical structure of the world.

Edit: I forgot oranges. Silly me. Also aside from yellow/blue these are all guesses.

*** So these are what they do when you break them and where they come from:

- Yellow are the random skill levels, and drop from most mobs\\
- Blue are 'problem solvers', and drop from breaking magic items\\
- Red give 'emotional resonance' ranks and the characters generally decline to use them\\
- Purple? are 'shell upgrades' -- body improvements, and they're acquired by trading reds to the monitor lizards / trees.\\
- Green were space improvements, and come from disabling space or time warping traps.\\
- Orange grant legal status.\\

I forget where red/orange drop from.
