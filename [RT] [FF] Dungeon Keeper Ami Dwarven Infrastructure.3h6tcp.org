***** You can get by with basically no knowledge of either world. A few quick glances at the wiki and you're set, basically.

***** Instead of watching Sailor Moon per se, I'd recommend reading [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2133352/shadowjack_js.html][In Which I Watch Sailor Moon, by Shadowjack]]. It's sort of a... Let's Play of a TV series. Kind of unique, very entertaining, lots of intelligent discussion by a number of people interspersed with some wonderful fanart.

*** Try [[http://page2rss.com/0ff8bb3c441dc586101d6ed6c068feb8][this]] feed. It's how I noticed this update. It detects every addition, including the ones not by Pusakuronu, but it's a far nicer system than checking the page intermittently IMO

*** In order of asking: after a few fight scenes. Because she's a teenage girl from an entirely different world who would rather not spend eternity alone with imps for company if there is another way. Because some of them become important characters later on.

Rational actor, irrational world.

*** Any time a character behaves seemingly irrationally in predictable ways and doesn't seem put out by it, I try out the hypothesis "she /is/ efficiently optimizing her own utility function; her utility function is just /weird/." In this case, Ami's gets utilons from being nice-to-a-fault and trying-to-be-nice-even-when-trying-doesn't-achieve-anything. I'm not sure whether that's /rational/, but it's not /incoherent/.
