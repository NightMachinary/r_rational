I recently read and quite enjoyed the kinda short web novel [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24066/graven][Graven]], a kind of mid-apocalyptic story that mixes superheroes with some nice cosmic horror aspects. One thing I liked about it was the really inventive use of superpowers that are very complex. The story doesn't have that big a cast, unlike some superhero serials, so there's a whole lot more time spent on each individual character, and some of the characters have powers that feel to me a lot like what rational fiction is famous for--specific rules that are taken to their extremes and used in creative ways to solve "puzzles" (win fights). The first POV character Max-Out in particular made me think of this.

However, I'm not incredibly versed in rational fiction, so I'm not sure whether Graven actually qualifies as much as I think. Has anyone else read it to know?


** It really isn't.

Sure, the powers are interesting and creative, and we see a lot of them (although some of the most interesting are barely seen at all), but the entire plot hinges on coincidence at every turn. The team stumbles it's way to success, significant battles are not planned for but are a rock-scissors-paper powerset line-up that just happens to favor the heroes in most instances, and major plot points that most ratfics would spend whole scenes and even chapters with the characters planning out are brushed aside by there always happening to be a new character with just the right powers on hand to instant-fix a problem. The author even attempts to lampshade that he has no actual good reason for that specific team to form, other than "some random guy's power told me to find you all" and somehow that magically makes everything fall into place.

It's a creative story with some emotional punch at parts, and I thought the reveals of the lore were quite clever. Rational, though? Not by a long shot.
