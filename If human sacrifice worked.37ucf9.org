If Aztec style human sacrifice actually fed some gods and produced magic would it be the rationalist choice to sacrifice a few individuals to prevent the greater suffering a drought could cause or rejuvenate a king to prevent a succession crisis. How much utility does a human sacrifice need to be the rational option. How much rain over how much area for how long do you think an individual human sacrifice must produce to become a rational option for ending droughts or the routine method for irrigating deserts in the ancient world. Or if human sacrifice could of produced portal that could be taken to distant cities to link them it would be a great boon to economic growth and trade.


** Being a rationalist doesn't tell you what ends to value, it just demands that you go after those ends in ways that make sense. You can hold the opinion [Every human life is so valuable murder is always wrong] or you can hold the opinion [I matter the most, followed by my family, followed by the filthy crowd]. These two people would react very differently to finding out that the gods could be bribed with sacrifices. If you're on a scale between the two extremes, you'll decide to go for the sacrifice at different points of necessity/convenience. Most people would sacrifice the innocent child to save the world. Most rationalists would sacrifice the innocent child to find a (magically) perfect vaccine against some horrible disease. Not so many of us would use prisoners for medical research,, even though that would definitely save lives in the long run. With sacrifices to the gods, I similarly expect most of us would not sacrifice people whenever it seemed convenient, but would wait until the utility function looked /very/ clear.

It does a bit of both, lots of ends are valued because of irrational thinking.

For example, here, suppose 1 sacrifice can save 2 lives. If you don't sacrifice someone then, according to you valuing human life, you probably value 2 lives you are not personally ending more than 1 life you personally are ending.

This maths kills lots of people. There are people opposed to robot cars because they could kill people, and not opposed to cars which kill more people.

What about sacrificing normal civilians for medical research? I have no objection to killing some number of them for medical research. Suppose it took five deaths on average to bring a cancer drug to market. Suppose Chalchiuhtotolin promised that for just one sacrifice he'd reduce the impact of the disease by a comparable amount to the drug. I'd like those odds.

**** I suppose I was trying to portray rationalists who are not necessarily Consequentialist Utilitarians. I'm a little more inclined in that direction than most, and from your comment you seem to be so too. But someone who /sincerely/ believes in a god given moral system where certain actions are bad regardless of their outcome can still be a rationalist or Utilitarian within those confines. Another extreme position would be more Voldemorty: I don't have cancer, and sacrificing people will make me look callous, which would be bad PR. My good reputation is more valuable than the lives I could save. Therefore, no sacrifices.

Also, there's a real utilitarian argument to be made against killing people whenever it's convenient: People don't like the idea of anyone they know being sacrificed, and the looming risk, however small, would decrease their happiness. Say you could save a few hundred people, but the cost is that the US population becomes slightly less happy because they all worry the evil guberment might break into their home and sacrifice their family members to Shub Niggurath. You could optimize in various ways, like keeping the truth secret, and mainly sacrificing people 'no one will miss', but even among people who agree that the sacrifices could be justified, there are real discussions to be had about the details that don't have obvious answers.

Maybe you can have these moralities but then, if you're being truthful, you can't really say every life is valuable in certain ways. You're not willing to kill one person to stop, say, a dozen other people being raped and murdered. As such, your morality and god's will is more valuable than the dozen people who were raped and murdered. Sure, maybe that's a rational or utilitarian decision to make under certain priors, but then if you claim that every life is precious to you I'm not going to believe you. You only have one king to sacrifice on your board, and clearly human life is not that piece.

Unlikely. More likely he's going to say "Annoyingly, the public gets pissed at me when I make necessary sacrifices for their own good. To what degree can I bypass that with proxies and secrecy, and what risk is there of me being found out?" And then only do it when it fulfils his values, such as a valuable ally having cancer.

We already do this to black males. It takes a lot of random killings to have a major effect though. The US is certainly trying their best.

And if you kill the right people the effect is reversed- lots of people are very happy about the US's policy to kill lots of muslims, or shoot black males.

Since the issue is already rather complicated and swamped killing a couple hundred people is likely to have little effect on net happiness.

I disagree with the second point, actually - establishing a norm that prisoners can be used for medical research /may well/ end up doing more harm than the difference to the best prisoner-free research option.

Strong commitments to human rights are actually a utilitarian position, even when this seems counterproductive, if humans are as bad at moral tradeoffs as we actually are.

I hear this description a lot. It's correct, but there's an unstated point in there - the means affect the ends. People like to illustrate 'the ends justify the means' by allowing horrible things to be done in the name of good outcomes, but the truth is that doing horrible things causes the people doing them to change - this change /must/ be counted among the outcomes being evaluated in any kind of /rational/ utilitarian calculations.

I personally think that utilitarianism is useless as a personal philosophy exactly because of the cumulative effects of these mechanism-focused internal changes - you don't just need to consider the effects of the means on the actors, but the effect on the society's moral fabric and norms, the effect on the rule of law, the effect on all witnesses, the effects of the fact that hiding information from those involved can improve utility (knowing that would cause a rational person to be less trusting).. the list goes on basically forever. It's like trying to solve the N-body problem when your forces are all unquantifiable and cannot be directly calculated or observed.

***** We can express this more simply; most people don't want to live in a society where x happens, therefore x carries negative utility. Killing all handicapped people saves money for other social projects, but most people don't like the prospect of anyone who gets injured getting executed, so the shadow of that possibility would weigh over them and lower their happiness. The choice to not kill handicapped people therefore saves a lot of negative utility even among the healthy population. The problem of Utilitarianism isn't that it always only looks one step ahead, but that people imagine it does.

But what you are talking about quantifies /one effect/ of a single policy decision (and probably the most numerically observable), not all of them. It would take massive resources to characterize the effects of a single major decision with very little accuracy; the idea of trying to do that kind of research for even the top 20 dilemmas individuals are likely to encounter is ludicrous.

You can say vague things about the potential bad consequences of an action about anything. Despite my above rewording of your post you'll still probably post reddit posts, and people will continue to sacrifice people to various causes.

Practically, people are going to die, our actions and choices and dilemmas are going to cause people to die. If we don't make good estimates about how many people die from our actions more people are likely to die.

So practically we should make estimates from limited data about how bad the consequences of our actions are. Theoretically, sacrificing someone to cthulhu is going to have some absurdly complicated negative effect, but practically, we have extensive experience with killing people for causes, we can guess and estimate how positive or negative it will be. Based on past experience, what boundary do I have on how bad it's likely to be?

** Bearing in mind that rationality doesn't /determine/ your goals - a paperclipper or psychopath would obviously have no problem sacrificing tons of people, which is a bit of a problem when it means they'll be vastly more powerful than everyone else - but assuming human goals:

From an economic perspective, people seem to "value" their lives at about $5 million, IIRC. So something that prevented $5 of inconvenience to a city of a million people would be "worth" the bargain from the market's perspective. (Look at cars, for example.) That's debateably rational or ethical, though.

In our world, [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/malaria][Giving What We Can]] tells me it costs around $3500 to save a life from malaria. Someone /donating all the proceeds to charity/ could definitely argue that a human sacrifice for something the can sell for more than that is worth it. (Maybe even less, in a setting where you can save lives for less - which is probably true in most low-fantasy medievalesque settings.)

Preventing some large disaster, like a volcano erupting in a populated area, seems like an obvious one. Appeasing the gods to prevent them chucking asteroids or plagues at you seems pretty ethical, although it raises the question of whether you could kill them instead.

Droughts and famines can have pretty large death tolls, but that's seperate from the question of when it's /more efficient/ to sacrifice people than use conventional irrigation. Which ... God, I don't know. You could fiddle around with QALYs, or use the $5M rule if you're just worldbuilding a reasonably ethical civilization, but that would take work.

The US sees a few hundred people die from storms and heatwaves and the like, even now. [[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats.shtml][Like this chart]]. So fixing the weather for a large empire would pretty clearly be worth it, even with modern technology. (Again, this goes up the lower the tech level of your setting.)

You could also look into the economic effects of slavery in the US, which I'd imagine would have an analogue at least /somewhere/ in this world. And from a military perspective, sacrificing enemy soldiers for a tactical benefit is a lot like torturing your captives (i.e. probably common when the two enemies can't see eye-to-eye, since it costs your side nothing, but with a lot of treaties banning it in "civilized" cultures.)

EDIT: Oh! Some people have also suggested that some sort of immortality ritual would be worth it, if the target lived significantly longer than they + the sacrifice would combined.

He tossed his blankets off and walked into the bathroom where his lowly slaves cleaned and dressed him. In this manner, the slave effectively and efficiently cleaned him. The slave followed him as K'iche' walked to the kitchens for his breakfast. The slave held up his history textbook while K'iche' ate.

K'iche' focused on memorizing the dates for the fall of the European Cultures and the obvious reasoning behind why their preaching that all sentient beings are equal was clearly false. After all the Great Ones clearly protected everyone important by favoring those who gave them blood sacrifice regularly. Hm....the liver particularly tasted stringy today.

That reminded him, he needed to get to school soon. K'iche' dismissed his personal slave and walked to the back of the house. Outside was a large barn. Inside were stables with humans inside. These were humans collected from all over the country as prisoners of war, children of slaves, and other inferiors.

K'iche' took down one of the daggers hanging on the walls and expertly and quickly prepped the standard ritual to slice out the tendons on one slave's leg. K'iche' noted down on a nearby notebook the condition of the slave and what further rituals the slave was still eligible for.

As the magic blazed up around him, K'iche' tore out the slave's tendons and teleported a mile to his school.

First we would have far less empathy for strangers and racism would be an acceptable part of everyday life. Note that I delibrately avoided any mention of the slave's gender because to K'iche' the slaves don't even qualify as a person.

Secondly, cultures which lead to today's modern understanding of ethics and morality wouldn't have been able to develop as their less-empathic neighbors were more successful. I don't have a very god knowledge of the history behind the development of ethics and philosophy, but I think the modern understanding was mainly developed during the Renaissance in Europe.

Without the cultures mentioned above, this leads to the possibility of cannibalism since in ancient culture and some today, cannibalism was considered an important part of society and even sacred. This it would likely flourish along aside human sacrifice.

This leads to all sorts of casual tortures and sacrifices accomplished by hurting the 'inferiors' in hourly worship of the Great Ones (imagined or real gods, all powerful God-Kings, or shadowy tyrants) for the most mundane usage such as not walking the distance to school.

All of the above is just within the first five minutes of considering the consequences of a world with working human sacrifice. It's a Crapsack World for anyone not on the winning side of the sacrificers.

K'iche' was meant as a reference to a Mayan civilization, but it might be a bad one to make, because I doubt that particular civilization had anything similar to the world I made up.
