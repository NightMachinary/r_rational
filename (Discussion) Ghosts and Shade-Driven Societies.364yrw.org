So, how do you use this to make a society?

Ghosts are real. You die, you're a ghost. However, from the moment of death, mental faculties degrade until you are able to do nothing but follow a script no longer than 20-59 instructions; the 50th percentile is 24. Ghosts know their ARN (Action Retention Number) instinctively, and gain mild compulsions involving said number.

As an aside, the ghosts of those without knowledge of a number system will still gravitate towards objects in quantities equal to that number.

Ghosts that have degraded entirely are known as shades.

The relationship between years that the ghost/shade physically persists and ARN is approximately modelled by the equation t = 1 / ( ARN^{2.87} ) * 10^{7}

At the end of physical persistence, the ghost simply disappears. This can occur even before they become a shade.

As soon as they degrade into a shade, the ghost will begin carrying out the commands.

The degradation process takes precisely as long as your lifetime was, and varies from person to person. It exhibits many of the same qualities as Alzheimer's disease, lengthened and slowed over the course of a lifetime.

In order for a shade to work, the ghost must be able to understand the instructions when they are set. Ghosts have full control the instructions they leave for their shades.

Instructions may not be more complex than "if (simple stimulus), then do (command, duration), else do (command, duration)"

Ghosts and shades need no fuel.

They operate within the frame of reference of the nearest mass larger than 73% of the moon.

They may apply acceleration of up to 2.1 metres per second per second to themselves, and have the approximate total mass of an electron.

They may apply acceleration of 13.34 metres per second per second per kilogram to any mass overlapping their form.

They glow with 8 watts per second of electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 393 to 802 nm. They may concentrate this in an area no smaller than a sphere of 0.93 cubic centimetres, or spread throughout the volume of their bodies.

Ghosts and shades can sense solid shapes overlapping their volume, as well as details such as colour, texture, heat, and chemical composition.

The retinas of ghosts absorb some of the light passing through them, allowing them to see, but shades have transparent eyes and can only respond to stimuli that overlap their volume. As a ghost ages towards shadehood, their eyes grow more and more transparent, leading to functional blindness partway through the process.

Ghosts and shades all take the form of their naked bodies at the moment of death, though that form is invisible unless they choose to illuminate it. Because it's a volume, not a surface, they can alter their appearance as long as it fits within that volume.

Some thoughts: Dying while happy will leave you happy until your mind fades away. Dying from an overdose of recreational drugs is going to result in an interesting few decades, to say the least. Dying while medicated to be extremely suggestible means that it will be much easier to convince you to program your shade as desired. Dying in a medically induced sleep or unconscious state means you're stuck there for ghosthood and can't be programmed as a shade - your death is as final as they come. Perhaps you dream before oblivion. Hope that they aren't nightmares. Dying while terrified, screaming and begging, visceral fear like a hundred tiny maggots chewing at your ribs-

So they can accelerate heavy objects faster? I think you either meant 13.34 metres per second per second (limited acceleration) or 13.34 kilogram metres per second per second or just 13.34 newtons for short (limited force).

I think you just meant 8 watts (8 joules per second). 8 watts per second would imply that the power is increasing.

******** Well, it's basically like Beetlejuice and Ghost together. You play as ghosts in the Shadowlands, a cast off husk of reality, trying to figure out why you haven't passed on.

The only things that transfer from life into the world of spectres are things with emotion. So you can find say, a gun, but no one loves bullets. This makes arming yourself against the darker nightmare creatures in the Shadowlands difficult, as you only have random things that people once had strong emotions for.

Some ghosts have decided to form an empire. They use a money system with small coins and they roam the land looking for new ghosts to either draft into their armies or enslave into chains. But funny thing is, there's not a lot of coins or chains. Some of the ghosts have the ability to shape the bodies of other ghosts. So if you don't obey the empire, they pound you into chains and coins to be used by the empire. So every coin you earn and spend is likely some [[http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Obolus][poor bastard that's been folded down for currency.]]

In fact, it's hinted that the great city spires that their architects have erected may be partially constructed from shaped souls, and their entire economy and system is based on slavery and a torturous fate worse than death.

I just thought to mention that in context of your above post and interactions. Even in death, we can imagine greed and power abuse as a malevolent cruelty that churns for eternity.

There's nothing here about a frame of reference. You bounded their acceleration, not their top speed. Although their acceleration is significantly smaller than gravity, so I guess they're accelerating compared to the ground. But it's not like the whole planet is accelerating in that direction.

I suspect people would always carry around some kind of drug they can take if they're about to die that won't make them spend the afterlife terrified.

*** I misspoke. What I meant is that they "latch on" to the nearest mass that size or larger, gaining angular momentum related to that object's rotation and location. When a ghost is created, they've already got momentum from the earth enabling them to begin at rest - the thing is, as soon as they move within range of something else, that momentum is abruptly replaced.

***** Because otherwise, ghosts can just fly for Alpha Centauri until they hit relativistic speeds and tell their shades to take samples. Ghosts don't obey the normal laws of physics, but they've still got to work through complicated interactions.

****** What's wrong with letting shades take samples of Alpha Centauri? They could send rockets to Alpha Centauri, which seems like more of a munchkin thing, but if you're doing that you could tell the shade to glow so you can shoot it with a railgun to lead it back to a ship. Or you could just use a ghost and shine a light at it.

I'm also not entirely clear on how this latching on works. Can they move faster than light if they latch on to a far away spinning body? Do they end up with the momentum they had compared to the old body, but now it's compared to the new one? What happens if the reference frame from each body pushes them towards the other body?

** Ghosts and shades could presumably carry sensors into hazardous environments. Ghosts could also be used to search for survivors in earthquake or war areas.

Come to think of it, shades could be used to carry levitate weaponry and fire it at detectable targets in a given area. Essentially, be floating long-range patrolling mines. Or they could carry signaling hardware and act as targets for heavier ranged weaponry once they detect and lock onto a designated opponent.

How complex are atomic commands allowed to be? Could a shade be commanded to copy an artist's style? Solve a mathematical puzzle/equation? Summarize data? Perform research on whatever subject they were handed? Remember everything they ever sensed in perfect detail? Request data from other shades?

Can shades tell where they are, relevant to the planetary surface they're on, even if blind? Could they thus be given commands such as "Go to the lobby of the Empire State Building" or "Go to 13 degrees north by 65 degrees west", regardless of where they were currently located?
