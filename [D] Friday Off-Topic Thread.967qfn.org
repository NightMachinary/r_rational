Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I've been working on a game in Unity. It's gotten to the point that I've actually bothered to set up a git repo and a backlog for it. It's been really surprising how quickly it's come together. I've got a basic drag and drop slot inventory, which allows you to actually place items in the world in a sane manner (I'm looking at you Skyrim), Skyrim/Dark Souls style combat with rolling/comboes/hitboxes/blocking and everything, a pretty well architected magic system that supports a whole variety of spells, and an AI that's now bordering on not totally retarded, and is capable of using melee weapons, telling friend from foe, running away when injured, minion style following, and also standing still and firing spells off with no regard for friendly fire. It still looks terrible because I've put basically zero effort into the art side of things and I'm using mostly placeholder models, but it's already rather fun to play. I'm really excited to see how far I can take this, my original inspiration was to try to combine the replayability of ARPGs like PoE and Diablo with the enjoyable (For me at least) combat of games like Dark Souls, Skryim, and Darkfall. I'll try to record a video next week.

I've only really gotten serious the last three weeks though, since then I've been putting in 2-6 hours a day of coding. Probably ~150 hours total, but that's for someone who had no Unity experience, but plenty of professional experience with C# programming as well as 3D/Animation.

** I'm currently considering two very different Pokemon SI/OCs. Neither are /explicitly/ rational, but of course I consider myself a rationalist and try to make decisions according to my enlightened self interest. Meanwhile, I'm aware of the fact that other people aren't cardboard cutouts and have their own internal motivations.

Can I get a simple vote for which once seems more interesting?

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17SoWtyyzqwM_Y-lhmyNfTv81AapgkNglf6Nh-O4c-Vs/edit?usp=drivesdk][Number 1]] (placeholder name: With or Despite Him) is an SI-into-pokeworld where the OC SI "reincarnates" into a Riolu, and about his (and his trainer's) journey to beat the pokemon league. Or at least, that's the impression I intend to give until the last few paragraphs of chapter 1. This is intended to be your "typical" pokemon story with trainer battles and catching pokemon and all that good stuff. It would be dark, but not pointlessly so.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/18OjZ3yGCyZlI5JO4GO-PNwZiehtb263olkmSyZG0cyw/edit?usp=drivesdk][Number 2]] (placeholder name: Things Happen for a Reason (And Other Lies we Tell Ourselves)). The premise for this one is pretty simple: everyone turns into pokemon. Obviously, this has implications for just about every aspect of society, culture, and politics. This is more social sci-fi-ish; another installment in my quest to write a story about modern society encountering "magic" and going nuts all at once. The narrative wouldn't be explicitly dark, but messed up stuff would be going on in the background.

Incidentally, I got some feedback for Number 1 that the pre-reader wasn't invested in any of the characters, which I think is a fair criticism. Does anyone have any advice about that? Both for these stories specifically, and writing in general. And not just for the main character, but the side characters.

*** A few things I noticed:

- Both stories seem to be about exploring a fundamental societal change, but Number 1 seems to be character-driven in equal portion. That may be good or bad, easier or harder to make work, I can't really tell.
- Sapient Pokemon in Number 1 can't be left unexplored. We saw the SI communicate with a keyboard, at the very least other Pokemon should be doing that too. This means you also have to consider the societal implications of a world where Pokemon can in fact speak for themselves with total clarity.
- People seem really nonchalant in Number 2. Like, /really/ nonchalant. Our MC shrugs it off after a couple minutes with only confused panic and little to no body horror, existential terror, or shattered worldview. His roommate doesn't even care, and the next person we meet seems to be just having fun. It's almost uncanny how little anyone actually cares what happened to them.

I'm not an experienced writer to be able to say which one is a better or easier story to write. I feel like Number 2 would by nature focus more on the worldbuilding with the protagonist as a viewpoint and commentary on the world, while Number 1 would be a character-driven (even if not grand in scale) story, and that some writers might find one easier to write than the other.

I can't say I really have a preference between the two stories: I'm not invested in any characters after all of one chapter, and while Number 2's premise is a touch more interesting the execution is a bit uncanny as I mentioned earlier, while Number 1 is a bit less interesting of a premise but had a more solid impact so came across better.

I've been having the MC's viewpoint gloss over the people who /are/ freaking out because angst isn't the point of the story (and honestly I'm a pretty self-absorbed person anyways), but you're right in that I should have at least some focus put on them.

Is this just a factor of you not getting attached to characters quickly, or are there stories where you /did/ get attached to the characters within a chapter that I should be trying to replicate? I feel like I have trouble laying out a "hook" to the story separate from just having a cool premise.

***** A little more than glossing over the people who do freak out, I expect very very few people would not freak out in a 'I understand what's going on here but it's really freaking me out' sort of way. Personally, I would have sat on my bed for at least two minutes just processing the wrecking ball this turn of events took to my worldview, and then a couple more wondering what parts of my life suddenly became extremely difficult, and a last bout about just how badly the rest of society is going to take this. By the time I stood up I would be shaken, mentally overwhelmed, and emotionally vulnerable. I'm more introspective than most, but I figure pretty much everyone who's not literally on fire would go through something similar.

As for your characters... I don't think I ever became /really/ attached to any characters within one chapter, but looking at your stories I don't see much personality standing out. It's a little too close to 'blank slate protagonist who has no initiative and just reacts to things' for my liking. I've heard that shonen protagonists (who to a fault have a large force of personality one way or another) are even more excessive at the beginning because it impresses on the viewer that's what they're like. If these are to be SIs, I'd consider taking the most stand-out parts of your personality and phrasing the situation so that you can show off more than usual what makes your character worth paying attention to (standard writing rules apply, show don't tell, act instead of just react, etc.).

***** I think the premise of Idea 2 is great, but I think you need a hook. If you don't want to tell the story of society adjusting in the immediate aftermath, then I'd start it, say, six months later: everyone's still adjusting, but people have made peace with themselves being machamps or whatever.

It'd make a good starting sentence, "/We all remember where we were on October 2nd, 2017, when we first woke up in our new pokemon bodies/", or "/It's now been a year since we all became pokemon, and things are finally looking up for this savvy young zoroark/"

I don't know the /story/ you're trying to tell, beyond the premise, though. I think that would inform my feedback a lot.

Civilization is saved, and nobody notices.

Amidst the sirens and alarms, the blinking lights and blaring klaxons, Nuclear armageddon is barely averted by the barest happenstance. One ICBM operator turns his key. The other, turned into a Meowstic, a feline barely two feet tall, cannot reach the keyhole.

By the time he figures out how to use his psychic powers to telekinetically manipulate the key, the alarms have stopped blaring, and the order to stand down has come through secure channels.

And related to that, should I just drop the third paragraph?

I'd like to tell a story about the immediate aftermath of the event, happening over the three months after it or so (not-so-coincidentally matching up to summer break for college students.)

How do the literal neonazis take it: now that you can't tell what colour someone used to be, what form does their racism take?

Children starving in war-torn parts of Mauritania suddenly turning into a plant creature that lives on sunlight. People you see on World Vision ads who have to walk 10km each way to get a jug of water having a Blastoise in their village. Victims of sex trafficking escaping - or getting their revenge.

The furries are obvious lowhanging fruit, but I want to know about the rest of the world: how do kinky people and sex workers deal with the change? Do they think of new services? I'm imagining a dominatrix turning into a bulbasaur and incorporating bondage.

On the topic of racism, what form does humanity's prejudice start to take now all the skin colours are different?

Pokemon all speak Pokemon-ese. So is there now a universal language, or are the pokemon speaking their native languages somehow with their pokemon bodies? They can shoot fire out of their mouths so I'm able to believe they can have human-like larynxes.

Sport. What happens with sport? MMA fighters would lose their livelihood overnight, or have to come up with new techniques and rules. Good luck getting a machamp into an arm bar, and if Daniel Cormier turned into a Sunkern, well, there's no hope for him anymore.

What jobs become redundant? What jobs are formed? That's a further time horizon than 3 months, though.

I think that the Average American College Student is about the /least/ interesting person in this world for me to read about. I can put myself in that mindset and think about what I'd do. I want to know what people with different situations than me, more weaknesses, more grudges, what /they/ do.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

Long time no update!  But unlike the last few gaps of communication, this is not due to lack of work being done but lack of things that I felt were meaningful to present here.  As you might imagine after an intro like that, I've now hit a milestone that merits presentation, so here we go.

Last time I commented I [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/453401451465539606/command_line_grid.gif][posted this gif]], which is of a prototype I wrote that roughly showcases how I want the movement logic to feel: smooth and intuitive using WASD, in spite of adhering to a quantized hex model. This prototype was originally set up to explore separating logic between a client and server, but did so in a manner that's faking it, really.  

[[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/477357351557660682/client_server.gif][Here is what that prototype looks like now]]

As you can see, the logic is now /actually/ divided out in two completely separate executables that communicate with one another over the network (this recording was done on my local machine, but it has actually been tested going cross-continent over the internet).  The vast majority of the work done over the past two months was in either A: reorganizing XGEF's structure as the abstract became more concrete, or B: fleshing out the networking and event systems which are now the backbone of the client/server divide.

--------------

The networking part of the code is implemented as a set of wrappers for the C# port of the Netcode.IO library, which is built from [[https://gafferongames.com/categories/building-a-game-network-protocol][this truly enlightening blog post series]] about building a UDP game network protocol.  If you're interested at all in the nitty-gritty details related to networking programming, I can /highly/ recommend this series, as well as [[https://gafferongames.com/categories/networked-physics][this series on networked physics]] by the same author (this second series in particular is more visual, with easy-to-understand gifs and should be accessible to even non-technical readers).  

[[https://github.com/KillaMaaki/Netcode.IO.NET][Netcode.IO.NET is here]].  I also utilized a compatible library called [[https://github.com/KillaMaaki/ReliableNetcode.NET][ReliableNetcode.NET]] which takes the UDP-based networking of Netcode.IO and adds support for optional guaranteed packet ordering and other such benefits.  

--------------

#+begin_quote
  But wait, I thought I remembered you saying this wasn't going to be multiplayer!
#+end_quote

Well remembered!  It won't be. However there's significant benefit to enforcing the separation between input/presentation/rendering (client) and world simulation/logic (server) from an organizational standpoint, which was always my primary motivation behind this particular set of goals.  This simply enforces that division and makes it literally impossible to mess up that design pattern.

(But, yes, now any future modders who might want to do a multiplayer overhaul will find that undertaking merely herculean, rather than outright impossible as it would have been otherwise.)

#+begin_quote
  Then if this is going to be single-player, isn't that inefficient to be sending all sorts of network traffic between two separate local programs?
#+end_quote

All the major operating systems are actually smart enough to recognize a network instruction that binds to the localhost address (127.0.0.1, or the network equivalent of saying “myself”) and automatically intercept it and transform it to use pipes instead, which are the standard means of communicating between local programs anyway.  

So rather than muck about with that myself, I'll stick to using a context that I'm more familiar with and let the OS worry about the low-level implementation.  Plus, this permits behavior such as hosting the simulation on a beefier computer and connecting to it using the client out-of-the-box (as well as opening the door to an eventual multiplayer overhaul, as mentioned).

--------------

There's still a lot of polish to be done to these systems, and in particular I'm not pleased with the current unit test coverage (tho there's only so much to be done for that; by splitting the logic so completely it actually forces tests to cross the line from unit tests to integration tests, and those are slightly more complex).  

However, all the groundwork is now laid for me to actually start working on the combat system, so maybe here by the end of the year I'll actually have something that's even recognizably game-like, gasp.  

Took me long enough.

I've been thinking about my planned battle school fic in this context, and have been trying to narrow rules weirdness down a bit. Generally speaking, I think that separating it into "well, I guess no one said you couldn't" and "unintended consequence of existing rules" works well as a starting point.

Naturally, a work about game rules, their consequences, abuses, and expected outcomes can work as a microcosm of wider societal issues that stem from societal rules and/or laws.

*** On a similar topic, I recommend looking up the concept of an "oral consitution" or "uncodified law". Such rule sets are significantly smaller and more flexible precisely because they can shift as necessary to avoid exactly the awkward situations Weird Rules is about. They can genuinely deal with disputes on a case-by-case basis.

They also /must/ deal with disputes on a case-by-case basis, making them slower and more contentious and requiring regular judicial action in a way written constitutions solve with bloated sub-paragraph infrastructure.

"I guess you win because it's not against the rules" becomes "No, that's ridiculous and the judges agree you're cheating." In the former case, a new and more specific rule is written to eliminate the option. In the latter, the interpretation stands as "case law" (or just "tradition") but can be readdressed again at a later date.

** While reading TwentySided today, I learned about this webcomic named Dominic Deegan, that was apparently kind of /the/ typical early 2000s webcomic (lackluster drawing, fragmented gimmicky story), and had a fandom that... apparently collectively decided they hated the story and its author over the span of a year.

Instead of just moving on to something else, they formed a hatedom type of group, with a level of vitriol and dedication you'd expect from the audience of something like /Game of Thrones/ (as opposed to an obscure poorly-drawn webcomic nobody had any reason to care about).

Looking at a [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?285193-Dominic-Deegan-Mk-L-The-Snark(ie][GitP thread of this hatedom]]-Alive-Death-Actually-Is-Zombies&s=373b393f21013c47bdb6bb84448c0b3f), all I can say is “Holy shit this is so toxic, how have the GitP moderators not shut that monstrosity down?”

  But just because Mookie is done with Dominic Deegan, that doesn't mean we're done with Mookie. Check out Star Power for more of Mookie's writing.

And you know, this feels kind of personal, because it's pretty close to the kind of reaction I had to a few online works (mostly Worm and Drowtales), mostly when I felt like the story with its bleakness was trying to send me a message I didn't like.

Leaving aside how unhealthy this is, most forums have rules against harassment and bullying, which this is somewhat close to and encourages; and there are probably borderline cases buried in there where a poster goes "OMG this last chapter is so dumb! I don't get how nobody is telling the author the 20'000 ways this is stupid" which isn't an explicit call to harassment, but is likely to engender some.

If I were the BDFL of a GitP-like forum, I think I could make a decent case that the forum is dedicated to fandoms on enjoying works, not repeated teardowns of work you don't like.

tldr: photos have to make you look interesting / fun; you need to not look like a jerkwad; compatible with my personal requirements (in my case, polyamory/rationalist/vegan-friendly); whether their profile makes me want to ask them a question.

my number one piece of advice which you'll probably see below: in hetero online dating, women should filter their messages ("don't message me if you don't bleed Mavericks blue"; "if you're under 6 foot don't bother"; "if you are just going to tell me I'm pretty don't bother"; "make sure you ask me a question about my profile"), men should try to keep their options wide open (i.e. not put anything at all controversial in their profiles). I get the feeling men see all these "standoffish" profiles and think that they should emulate them: they shouldn't, they are playing a different game than the profiles they look at.

#+end_quote

sounds depressing: i don't want to date someone who is miserable in their life. inject a little more positivity or at least tell us what the job you dislike is. Tell us what you're doing to become a [profession] - are oyu in night school? or do you just wistfully watch [related movies]? You're 30 you're "meant to have your shit together" - assuming you're looking for wife material, that means you have to look like husband material. replace "[profession]" with "literally a rock star" and you sound like a loser, right? But if the "literally a rock star" guy also says he's in a band, he's touring, doing session time, whatever, then he suddenly looks like a better catch. Does that make sense? So you gotta make it look like you have your shit together in this [profession] goal of yours.

examples:

"I work at a job I dislike (seriously, I put ferret poop through seives in a lab - don't ask) and am blah blah"

"I'm currently a data scientist but I've realised my real passion is [profession], so I'm saving up to start my [profession] degree next semester" / "and I've started doing an online [profession] course" / etc

--------------

my golden rule for straight male profiles: your profile is to get women you message to write you responses. it is not to get you new messages (those are bonuses). It is purely for "retention".

A big "don't" in a lot of profiles that you haven't done is saying something like, "if you can't handle long conversations about philosophy, don't message me" or other things designed to filter people /out/. The online dating marketplace supply-demand curve means straight men should be trying to capture as much as they can, and not try to filter anything until after messages are being exchanged. (I suspect that even women who love long conversations about philosophy would be turned off by such a disclaimer more than they'd be turned on; and a woman who was otherwise perfect but maybe only tolerates long conversations about philosophy rather than likes them might be scared off altogether). Anyway, you aren't doing that at the moment, so good job! Just keep an eye out for things you might want to add, and make sure they are not aimed deterring messages.

other golden rule: life sucks but people are shallow. you want a good photo. your current main photo doesn't work well on the screen because it's dark. none of your photos are particularly good and may be your main problem: you don't seem to be smiling or having fun in any of them, and none of them are super flattering. With 8 photos, I'd expect there to be one group photo of you and friends, so the fact there isn't feels odd.

Are there some candid shots friends have taken with you as the primary focus that could work?

Photo recommendation: I'd put them all on tinder, swipe around a bit (don't swipe all left or all right, there's some optimal ratio), and then let tinder's algorithm tell you which photo is best.

--------------

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Don't answer the really obvious profile questions: none of the "what is bigger, the earth or the sun?" type questions. Anything you think is really obvious, don't answer. High-probability hits will only cause you to have an artificially high match percentage with anyone with half a brain, when you want to try and target people with more specific things in common with you. The questions that hint at rationality will automatically weed out the people who think the earth is bigger than the sun anyhow. If that makes sense?

--------------

Photos are tricky. Tinder will automatically move your "best" photo to the front of your profile, so for no other reason you might just want to upload some candidate photos to tinder and swipe a little bit every day and it'll tell you which photos are best.

#+begin_quote
  Could you expand what you mean when my profile says I don't look interesting? What do you think I should write?
#+end_quote

It's hard; it's a je ne sais quoi, you know? Looking at your profile, it's like, you're listing solitary stuff: computer games, books, some popular TV shows. It doesn't give me much of an idea about the sort of person you are. If we went on a date, would we go to a trendy wine bar you know and eat tapas, or would we drink a milkshake out of a jar at a hipster place where the furniture is made out of milk crates? What are you like? Are you funny? Are you a know-it-all? Are you warm and friendly or cold and reserved? Do you like spicy Indian food or will you only eat cheese pizza?

Basically I don't feel personality in your words and I know that's probably infuriatingly vague of me.

Few general points:

- You talk about video games a lot more than is probably necessary. It makes it look like that's a major area of interest for you - if that's true then leave it but if it's not true and you're just interested in video games about as much as any other man in his early 20s (which is quite a bit) then I'd just cut it to having a section on your favourites in the "favourites" section. If you focus too much on video games it makes you look like a "lives in mum's basement" stereotype.

- Good at section: "programming" - back into the "what would we do on a date?" question I was asking myself earlier, I'd recommend keeping the programming (if you want) but adding something social. Are you good at bowling? Are you good at guessing peoples' star signs (ha)? Do you never spill a drink when you're clubbing? Preferably something unique and quirky that says something about you as a person rather than something like "programming" that applies to hundreds of people. It doesn't have to be something you're best at.

- Typical Friday night: include one friday night activity that your date would be able to accompany you on. Doesn't have to be a literal Friday night, could also be Saturday. (Some people seem really married to the idea of it being a Friday and say "working because I work Fridays" the question is basically "what do you do at night for fun?" so keep it in that spirit)

- potentially might help: make a blank female profile and answer about 10 or 20 match questions in the way you'd prefer. Browse the guys on the site and see what their profiles look like. Figure what's better than yours and what's worse.

- Remember your profile is for the women who you message to look at, not for you to use to get a woman to message you. Harsh but true. Send lots of women messages, and make sure they're good.

***** It's hard to give fully generic advice without taking goals into account -- someone interested in casual, physical intimacy would do better to cast the widest net at their disposal, to appeal to the largest cross section of their intended audience that they might maximize their total number of encounters. Someone with precisely known preferences intending to find a long-term partner might do best by giving their profile much more targeted filters, that they might sooner exclude those with insurmountable incompatibility.

Otherwise I think I'd largely agree with [[/u/whywhisperwhy]]'s and [[/u/MagicWeasel]]'s advice, and additionally emphasize that it's best to show, rather than tell. Self-description is cheap, and explicitly attributing to yourself various desiderata sends something even worse than a (very) easy-to-fake signal -- it suggests that you can't actually manage the genuine article. Any man who must say, "I am an awesome and kind and smart lover of adventure", is no true member of that group at all.

I also think it's important to reflect on what sort of picture each statement you write paints in your readers' minds, and make sure each picture contributes something valuable -- omit needless words, since the large selection means your audience's attentions are fleeting. The profile is less a tool to convey direct biographical information and more something to capture the interests of those viewing it, (usually) that you might deepen that interest via instant messaging and secure a face-to-face meeting, where you evaluate each other further.

(and as a general disclaimer I'm making all of this up and only used OkC for about a week 5 years ago and only met a single person from there. Also, I had to reactivate my profile to see OP's, so [[https://www.okcupid.com/profile/DerBerggeist][here]] it is, fwiw. It's not the best and not at all fitting for my current position and place in life, though for a 20/21 year old fresh out of college I think it served me well. At least for what little I put into it. My wife /did/ describe it a few months into our relationship as pretentious and confusing, but interesting -- and tbf that's not far off from who I am, so in that sense it did it's job)

edit: also, if your goal is to get lots of unsolicited messages, having plenty of "easy" hooks is good. I think most of the messages I got quoted some Whitman at me, or asked what I currently had written on my arm or if I liked kissing any other animals, or made dinosaur noises, etc.

I think depending on your intentions and the intentions of your would-be advisors, you might run into a paradox where those with the most experience are ~least~ qualified to give you advice, because they've managed to survive on the market for so long without pairing off. Of course, if both are interested primarily and casual sex then age on the market (with accompanying experience) could well indicate competence.

Of course, I only really used OkC for around a week before meeting my wife, so ofc I would fashion a framework that makes myself look best. ;] And advice I would give would probably regress extensively to the mean regardless.

Copyright terms should be based on economists' analyses of the creation inspired by the promise of temporary monopoly vs. the public benefit gained from free use.

- Copyright is an infringement of creators on the natural, moral right of all people to share in the fruits of any person's work, and should be abolished. Anyone who advocates the creation or extension of copyright terms is a greedy, entitled sociopath who wants to extort people for the use of what should be free for the benefit of all.

*** I think copyright is a pretty arbitrary solution to a complex problem. But that the curent "life of creator +70 Years unless Disney gets it extended again" is a self contradictory implementation of that solution.

The core problem that copyright is intended to solve is that it is easier to plagerise somone else's work than to create your own in artistic fields like literature or music, and that creates a disincentive to create new art but society benefits from having new art.

The basis of the deal with curent copyright law is that you have to publish your work to get it protected but in exchange you hold sole legal right to make copies of it for some time. The advantage of this system is that it expends the body of art availabe over time, and it doesn't disadvantage artists who only ever produce one really good work (compared to patronage where you need enough of a rep to get people to pay you for future work in advance). The disadvantages are that it is difficult to enforce, and it interacts weirdly with works that are collaborative in nature. (Also "life of the creator plus arbitrary period is a stupid duration, and extending the period in responce to specific influential copyright holder's copyrights being about to expire is clear corruption).

I think now that crowdfunding is a thing it might be possible to restructure copyright to instead of focusing on the right to make copies focus on the right to claim authorship. This would mean that creators can sue anyone trying to build a competing reputation on plagiarism which would still protect business models like "I worked for big companies to prove my skills but now I'm doing my own thing" and "If my kickstarter is funded I'll publish a PDF anyone can downlaod/share/have printed, etc" However this would still have some down sides. Most notably you can't ever make money on your first success. That may well discourage a lot of artists from starting down the path of publishing their work. And it's only real upsides are that it solves the term issue (a work never needs to be reaccredited to s new creator) it scales better with collaborative works (as crediting multiple people for their specific contribution is pretty easy), the former of which could alternately be solved by changing the term to something not-stupid (say 50 years, or "life of the creator") and the later is a pretty minor problem in practice.

[edit] IMO "life of the creator" is a sensible term for copyright, as the first installment of a series entering the public domain has a pretty serious impact on ability to control copycats, and the lifespan of a modern work can easily involve several re-imaginings in different media, sequels, spin-offs etc. which require their own creative effort over longe periods of time (think book -> movie -> TV spinoff -> novel series spinoff -> Video game based on the TV series, etc.) which can make setting a fixed term difficult to do fairly.

But extending past the life of the creator is dumb as the point was to ensure the creator didn't get screwed by plagiarism but if they're dead they can't really "get screwed" anymore.

No, plagiarism is a /trademark//fraud issue. The point of copyright is to make creation profitable by giving a monopoly on distribution to the creator and labeling unauthorized distributors as perpetrators of piracy. Pirates are rarely plagiarists---they generally don't try to pass off pirated creations as their own.

***** If it bothers you you can replace "plagiarism" with "fast follower problem". However I think that is stupidly pedantic as in practice most cases of piracy are also cases of stolen work they're just a bit more meta. Like, the works the editor took refining the manuscript, that the publishing house spent publicizing the work, or the risk on the initial run, the redit for sponsiring the work financially, etc. Take a pirated TV episode. If you remove the commercials then upload it to pirate bay you have expunged the fact that the company that payed for the ads ultimately sponsored the original airing that you recorded. That's not all that far removed from republishing a scientific paper with the name of a co-author you don't approve of removed.

However you're wrong about trademark. Trademark doesn't relate to plagiarism much at all. Especially not as you've defined it. If I make a purse that looks identical to a famous fashion designer's new line but put my own tag with my own logo on it instead of theirs I have plagiarized their design passing it off as my own but have not infringed on their trademark. The reason there exist "knock offs" with look-alike-but-legally-distinct or forged logos is because as a result of trademark law marketing has convinced people the trademark is required to make the item fashionable, as there is no equivalent to copyright for clothing.

Similarly overt plagiarism is rare in media that have copyright protection because it is trivially prosecuted under copyright law. If for example I reproduce the text of a popular novel and publish it under my name with my publishing houses trademarks taking care to avoid any issues like the title font that may also be part of a tardemark I'm still guilty of copyright infringement for reproducing the text and putting my name on it just makes proving i did it in court trivial.

*** A hundred years ago, when the internet didn't make copying any work instantaneous and trivial, I would have gone with stance two. Now I go with stance three. The ideal copyright term would probably be five to seven years: enough for the creator to make a sequel if they hadn't already. I think a creator should be entitled to the money they ask for to create their work and nothing else - in the era of digital transactions and instantaneous communication, that suggests a patron model rather than a publishing one. Copyright was created in response to a need that doesn't exist now, which is the need for the ability to stop rival publishers from printing identical manuscripts without the additional overhead of supporting the creator. Nowadays the creator can distribute the work themselves with a small enough amount of money as to be unnoticeable, and make up the rest with patreon style donations. Any further extension of copyright isn't just harmful, it's intervention in the free market to protect an establishment (big publishers and conglomerates like Disney) from dying off once they've outlived their usefulness. Yes I understand that without copyright we wouldn't have the economies of scale Disney offers, but I feel like that's a small problem that will be overcome with technology in astonishingly little time.

I know you didn't mention trademarks, but I'll say that I'm against them anyway. We don't need a logo to identify a product when a computer can; we definitely don't need trademarks based on fictional characters to determine whether or not a work of fiction is genuinely created by the original author. And "ruining the brand" is bullshit - in any world where it's legal to draw Mickey Mouse being fucked by a rhinoceros or somethig else sick, it's already been done to every other character on the planet, so nobody would care, just like only nutcases care about the existence of rule 34 art right now. Fiction isn't snake oil, or a dangerous machine assembled in a sweatshop, and we haven't found any /real/ memetic hazards yet, so any law that restricts the output of fiction for no other reason than "consumer protection" is absurd. And it's fair for an author to compete in a market like that because if they were capable of it, they would do it themselves, and if they weren't going to do it themselves, then it's unused economic /and/ artistic potential laying around.

I'm pretty sure copyrights at present are far too long in the US especially; however, I haven't done any sort of survey of the literature to even start to see what sorts of terms would maximize the public good. The current state of affairs, where Disney keeps pressuring US legislators to extend copyright every time their fucking cartoon mouse looks like it will enter the public domain, so that nothing will ever enter the public domain in the US again without dramatic and far-reaching reforms of the entire system of government lobbying is ... pretty sub-optimal.

***** I'm not convinced that Hollywood wouldn't wait out copyrights. Of the 40 movies I saw in theaters in the last year, 25 were based on existing properties. A quick survey of the adaptations of more recent works shows that they were usually about three or four years (ex. /Love, Simon/ was a 2018 adaptation of a 2015 book, /Annihilation/ was a 2018 adaptation of a 2014 book, /Molly's Game/ was a 2017 adaptation of a 2014 book).

From that, three years seems like it's probably the lower bound for how long it takes a movie to be made, backed up by [[https://stephenfollows.com/how-long-the-average-hollywood-movie-take-to-make/][this]]. So how much does Hollywood pay the average rights holder, and how much does it cost them to simply delay another year or two? If X > Y, then they'll wait. Add to that it takes some time for a work to "make it", and factor in that a five year claim means that rights are essentially worthless if not sold in the first year or two, depreciating rapidly as you get to the point where the movie would already have been started for the rights to matter.

Now, granted, most movies will hire on the author as a consultant, or give them a hand in writing or revising the script, and the author's goodwill is worth a fair amount. I don't think most authors get paid too much for the rights to their films, and mostly the impact would be at the top 0.0001% or something like that ... but maybe those dreams are what are pushing some writers or artists.

A million is a rounding error if you are making the martian, and the monetary value of the free pr from making a movie of a book which is fresh in peoples minds is not a small sum.

**** Flip side: a young nearly homeless JK Rowling writes a little book named /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, it gets good reviews and a little bit of traction, and before you know it a big corporation (say, Disney) swoops in with their power and influence and sells exact printed copies all across the globe. Young Ms Rowling has no way of challenging this and perhaps might not even have the resources to /know/ about how extensive it is, and years later Disney's total profit has crept into the eight digit range and Rowling has had to take on more hours as a waitress to make ends meet, and the series is never finished.

I agree that the current status quo is not great, and that Disney in particular is completely unjustified, but copyright does play at least a small part in protecting content-creating individuals from unscrupulous megacorps. Disney /can't/ just keep their finger on the pulse and pump-and-dump every halfway popular piece of media that someone else made that gets traction, and that's a /good/ thing.

***** Well obviously. Harry Potter isn't /just/ "boarding school plus magic." It's a specific combination of hundreds of individual elements. Specific combinations of plot/story and character traits and setting/worldbuilding ought to be protected, you can't just copy a work wholesale and pass it off as your own. On the flip side, you can't just plant a flag in the idea of "a young hero is the Chosen One who restores peace to the world by defeating his fated enemy" and then declare that no one is allowed to use that specific idea ever again.

****** Who does that? Copycats spring up all the time, the sheer number of magical school stories floating around can attest to that. It sounds like you're arguing against a form of copyright that doesn't exist.

******* I very well might be. It might also be that my "young hero saves world and defeats bad guy" example didn't illustrate my point very well. If /Bendy and the Ink Machine/ had cast the titular "Bendy" as a mouse, do you think Disney would've tried to take action against Joey Drew Studios?

**** I think that's a rather reductionist viewpoint of Everything is a Remix. I've watched it several times because it's such a well done video essay, but the main point he makes about copyright is not strictly that /copyright law/ is damaging to the creative process, but that indefinite copyright /is/. The difference being that the initial time period of a product or idea being copyrighted allows the creator to recoup the costs of developing the idea in the first place as opposed to the act of synthesizing ideas somehow giving you complete control over it.

That being said, there is a lot that is currently wrong with the American system of copyright law that is pretty evident in the way that corporations have been able to lobby against allowing their old intellectual property into the common domain. The obvious example of that being Disney.

I think I tend more towards the middle viewpoint that ToaKraka presented in that I think copyright is a necessary evil that is needed to allow creators to recoup the cost of gambling on new ideas, or inventors to recoup the time sunk into developing a new product.

***** I never said the idea of copyright should be outright abolished or that some form of copyright isn't necessary or that any form of copyright would be damaging to the creative process. I didn't even claim anything about Everything is a Remix itself, I simply invoked one of its ideas.

*** My stance is somewhere between (2) and (3). Copyright is troublesome in a number of ways (mainly, I feel, when applied to software); but, at the same time, encouraging a very temporary monopoly to a first mover can encourage innovation, thus improving society. On the other hand, leave copyright too long, and it stifles rather than encourages innovation.

So I can see a good argument for copyright in lengths of up to a year, or two at the most. Beyond that is, I think, too much.

**** Nominally, both the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly adhere to option 2. (Read Justice Breyer's dissent in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft][/Eldred/ v. /Ashcroft/]] for details.) The history of creativity in those countries before they vastly extended their copyright terms (edging toward option 1) can be taken as evidence regarding option 2.
