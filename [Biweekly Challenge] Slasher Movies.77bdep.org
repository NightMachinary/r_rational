[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/749k9r/biweekly_challenge_scp/][Last time]], the prompt was "SCP". Our winner is [[/u/vi_fi]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/749k9r/biweekly_challenge_scp/dnwk8w9/]["Uncanny Abyss"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/vi_fi]] for their fourth win in a row, which leaves one win more for to join the illustrious club of the super winners!

This time, the challenge will be *Slasher Movies*. The general formula for a slasher is that there's a nigh-unstoppable menace, or perhaps just a psychopath, who goes around murdering either teenagers or young adults one-by-one. Classics include the Nightmare on Elm Street series, the Friday the 13th series, and the Halloween series. Deconstructions include the Scream series (less so in the later installments) and to some extent Cabin in the Woods (though that one was more horror in general). Feel free to go in whatever direction you'd like with the prompt, but let us know if you're using an established universe, unless it's important to the story that we don't know. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, November 1st.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:

Next time, the challenge will be *Worm*. [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]] is a completed superhero web serial by Wildbow; I would expect spoilers in the challenge, and maybe avoid it if you care about those. Worm fanfiction is quite popular, and the work itself is very popular within this community, so hopefully that won't be a very large barrier to entry. As always, prompts are to inspire, not to limit, so if you want to write your story about some obscure side character, an original character within the world, or even outside the canon of the serial, feel free to do that. This challenge is at least partly due to the start of sequel to Worm, due soon.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/1.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77biwk/challenge_companion_slasher_movies/][is available here]].

*** Interesting. From the timing (Edit: and how well [[#s][]]), I'm assuming that [[#s][]].

**** That's some interesting speculation.

This would necessitate Ai communicating with the asteroid quite some time before the protagonist reaches it, as it is silent when they arrive. Of course, transmitting at light speed would enable that...

Whoopsie. Originally, I intended for [[#s][]] to be quite separate ([[#s][]]). I mean, given your theory as stated above, it would make sense for both to be related, and I generally think it elegant if all themes of a story spring from a single idea, especially in the case of short stories...

... I'm never quite sure whether to be happy or sad when a reader's headcanon is better than canon.

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

Not sure about that one. The prediction Dave makes is rather small in scale, and "profit" from a single prediction would therefore often be something far, far smaller than [[#s][]]

Thank you for sharing your thoughts! That gave me some much-needed motivation to go back to writing /Worm/ fanfics for the next challenge...

***** Thank you for your feedback on my thoughts!

[[#s][]]

The [[#s][]] matter doesn't have anything else backing it up, just that I enjoy imagining it that way. I suppose [[#s][]].

I'm happy that my thoughts were thought-provoking!

I had assumed the silence was another lie/detection failure by the AI. Totally plausible that it communicated with them and was totally aware of the situation, but chose not to tell him to engineer its goal. Afterall all his information is seemingly mediated by the AI....
