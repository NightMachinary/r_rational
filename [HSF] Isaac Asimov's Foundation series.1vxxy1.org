** It's on my list but I haven't read it yet. When I researched this series I came across the discussion of reading order. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Asimov/wiki/seriesguide][This seems reasonable]], maybe someone has some experience with this?

*** I actually think Asimov's short stories tend to be 'rationalist' literature far more than his longer books - his short stories are frequently basically puzzles to solve via use of character resources, and are fairly interesting. I really recommend reading basically any of his short fiction collections.

His ideas about AI were sort of hilariously outdated by modern science - see his three laws of robotics for example.

**** I'm not sure that even Asimov ever expected the Three Laws to be literally implemented. That said, they /do/ raise important points about real world AI, because they illustrate quite vividly how easy it is for an AI to behave in unexpected / undesirable ways even when it's bound far more tightly than any real AI could be.

***** Above and beyond all difficulties of implementation, I agree with Terry Pratchett's cynicism about the literal implementation of the three laws, as described in Going Postal:

/‘Hey! No! What?' Moist waved his hands wildly and knocked game pieces tumbling. ‘Wait! Wait! There's a rule! A golem mustn't harm a human being or allow a human being to come to harm!'/

/Lord Vetinari raised a finger. ‘Just wait one moment, please, Mr Pump. Very well, Mr Lipwig, can you remember the next bit?'/

/‘The next bit? What next bit?' said Moist. ‘There isn't a next bit!'/

/Lord Vetinari raised an eyebrow. ‘Mr Pump?' he said./

/‘“ . . . Unless Ordered To Do So By Duly Constituted Authority”,' said the golem./

/‘I've never heard that bit before!' said Moist./

/‘Haven't you?' said Lord Vetinari, in apparent surprise. ‘I can't imagine who would fail to include it...'/

**** Completely agree. But then, the closure of the series indicates Asimov himself was aware of the flaws.

*** I'm a huge sucker for chronological reading, but, in this case, I'd agree with [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Asimov/wiki/seriesguide#wiki_algernon_asimov.27s_personal_recommended_order_.28hybrid.29][Algernon_Asimov's personal recommended order]]. Not that I've read all of the books in all three series, but still.
