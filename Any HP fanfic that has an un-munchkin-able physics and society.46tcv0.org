ie. one where the magic system and the laws and customs are such that an intelligent person can't simply abuse the system.


** Harry Potter fanfic but not abusable? No, there isn't. The HP magic system is completely broken, and trying to fix it would require so many patches it would be not-HP before you were done.

The general answer to this question is also probably "it depends on your definition of abuse." When does it stop being sensible use and start being abuse?

The equivalent would be, say, a really shoddily-coded website, put up on the public Internet, but with a perfect, magical Intrusion Detection System in front of it that triggers a satellite laser to blow up a hacker's house the moment they get in.

I think that that is not Harry Potter, but is the only way you could keep something that looks like HP remotely in check. It's also the system I used in [[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][The Two Year Emperor]] because it's the only way I see to keep the D&D magic system anything like sane.

I think most munchkinish fics I've seen interpret the rules in ways that are biased toward munchkinry that could easily have been interpreted otherwise. Free energy is the main trivial path to victory in HP that I see.

Everyone in here is taking it for granted that canon HP is trivially munchkinable, without any discussion at all of specifics. This sends up alarms.

Conjuration seems limited utility. AK seems powerful but not so powerful that it needs to be changed. Unicorn blood is not worth the cost. Unbreakable Vows are the only important thing you've mentioned, in my opinion. Given their consequences, it's reasonable that almost no one would ever be willing to enter one. I think the fandom exaggerates the brokenness of canon often.

So why doesn't Dumbledore transfigure grey goo or botulism or anything else? Why in combat doesn't he transfigure his opponents robes into metal or his own into Kevlar or unicorn hair? That's assuming you can't transfigure your opponents, say, hair, or bones, or heart...

Why doesn't any given maniac spam AK downward through the earth, or at Hogwarts or the ministry? Even in canon no shield blocks it.

******* We don't know anything about how the Fidelius works. It might be extremely difficult to use, and might not work in public places. It's only used twice in canon, and is mentioned as an extremely rare and difficult piece of magic.

Dumbledore noticeably struggles to lift and shape a large ball of water. I don't think it's fair to assume that it would be trivial to transfigure grey goo or poisons. Your point about transfiguring robes is interesting. I think it would be a trivial patch to say that robes are enchanted to be spell resistant, however. Even if you didn't choose this option, allowing people to use transfigurations like that in combat does not seem horribly overpowered to me.

The AK stops when it comes into contact with stone, or walls. Remember when Harry hides behind gravestones in book 4?

The Philosopher's Stone was created only once ever. The Elder Wand is OP, but if you put it in the hands of the bad guys rather than the good guys then it causes your story few problems.

There are some ways in which canon could be exploited, but it's not as trivial as we're discussing here. In book six, Fudge says to the other minister that "the trouble is, the other side has magic too", which is something that people who are overeager to munchkin HP's magic system often forget.

********* True, but on the other hand, water is simple, grey goo is complex. Animals could be copying extant diagrams.

it's entirely possible the wizarding world is /less/ munchkinable than it looks, or at the very least some of the clever ideas, like the accio one eaglejarl proposed, wouldn't work, though certain items are straightforward game-breakers, or at least highly potent:

-Time turners (pretend they don't exist, if possible) -any food/water transfiguration, if it doesn't take nutrients from you. Gamp's law implies it gets them from somewhere, but it could well be consuming nearby rocks, granting general starvation immunity in most locales. -Feliz Felicitis, which is either common enough, or, more likely, slughorn has the money to not need to sell it, that it can be offered as a class prize. There being limitations still make sense, though- note horace only took it twice. Presumably, taking too much is harmful. Still OP, but it's hard to get your hands on and has drawbacks, so low-level, not high level, gamebreaker relative to its plausible costs. note that this didn't end the war, so it's clearly capped, and lower than you'd think. -Free energy spells. OFC, this is only large-scale broken.

********** I forgot to write down this argument earlier, but Felix Felicis is strong but not necessarily OP. If it were as strong as some people think, then Harry would have wandered off campus and accidentally destroyed Voldemort and all his Horcruxes midway through book six.

I think it's interesting, although probably not very accurate, if we choose to interpret the apparent strength of Felix Felicis as the result of Harry being a biased narrator. Although he felt as though he were magically guided to persuade Slughorn in a foolproof way, perhaps he had the beginnings of a similar plan already in his mind, or benefited from a more conventional form of luck in addition to the benefits of the potion. If the feeling of omnipotence he experienced after consuming the potion was unjustified, then it's easier to see why the potion might be considered dangerous and not worth using by many.

********* Your point about the economy is valid and very important. Remus Lupin struggles to find wearable clothes, and yet it seems like he could easily make his own if he had a spare afternoon. The Weasleys struggle to afford even crucial school supplies, even though it seems like those are very cheap and valuable investment that they presumably are prioritizing. That puts them at near subsistence farming income levels.

Maybe we can postulate that the economy is highly specialized and learning how to sew one's own robes, grow one's own food, etc. is beyond anyone's capability. Adding strict intellectual property laws or cultures of secrecy surrounding knowledge would also be helpful. Other frictions on proper market operation are the intense bigotry of their society, the Statute of Secrecy, and possibly the goblin control of currency. If using magic is extremely difficult, it makes more sense that poverty exists despite it. Even all of this seems inadequate to entirely explain away the story's economic problems, however.

So, in the sense that its economics are absurd, I agree that the HP universe is highly munchkinable. Good argument, thank you for it. I was missing your point earlier, and thinking mainly about combat.

Aguamenti creates water, meaning that it creates hydroelectric power.

Accio] can summon (apparently) absolutely anything. How about writing down 'P=NP' and 'P != NP' on two sheets of paper and then saying "Accio piece of paper with true statement on it!"

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Felix_Felicis][Felix Felicitis]] gives you incredible luck. From the wiki: "Horace Slughorn claimed that he used the potion twice in his life: once when he was 24 years old, and again when he was 57, each resulting in a perfect day." Okay, how about running some very difficult scientific experiment while under the influence? Or brute-forcing a code -- the one password that you happen to guess will be the right one.

Avis creates living animals (birds). Infinite food.

Confringo: Causes explosions. Free energy.

I put this list together in about two minutes, and I only made it to 'C' in the spell list.

I explored all this in more detail in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11107471/1/Squiring-the-Phoenix][Squiring the Phoenix]] if you have interest.

It seems to have a fairly local effect: it's not going to drag Voldemort to you, but if Voldemort is already there, the day's not going to end well for him. So it's all a matter of giving yourself the maximum amount of leverage before you drink the potion.

Sure, like most munchkinry.

A rational world where Felix Felicis exists should look something like what the /Mistborn/ series does with Atium. A huge part of the power game is to control production and distribution. And to find the right moments to use it, while tricking your enemies into wasting their reserves.

You can try to "kill" yourself in a way that propagates back to the beginning of the loop. Alternatively if the malevolent entity forbids that, you can memory charm away the past so as to end the subjective torture.

** I strongly suspect that to make that setting non-munchkinable, you'd pretty much have to have some sort of godlike entity working behind the scenes to keep it from being munchkined. You could maybe pull it off if you have the entire setting be the product of an especially weird singularity gone wrong, but that's probably not the type of story you are looking for.

Alternatively, maybe it would work for either the capability to perform magic, or exposure to it, to have an impact on brain function that makes someone in a position to munchkin it most likely incapable of doing so?That might explain quite a bit about the setting, actually.
