What the title says, really. Unfortunately, most stories never receive the treatment they deserve to create enjoyable longstanding reads/watches/plays, due to budget cuts, author conflicts or dozens of other potential problems. Transformative works are an excellent way to +"rationalize"+ "fix" their issues and expand the best parts, exemplified by /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ (I think we can all agree that that fic is the gold standard for Rational!Fanfiction).

A while ago there was [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1qdi45/my_potential_rationalist_fic_which_i_probably/][a thread]] in [[/r/HPMOR]] about a potential rewrite for /His Dark Materials/ (warning: link contains spoilers) and it generated plenty of healthy discussion.

These wouldn't be purely negative critique threads, but breakdowns and evaulations and "It would be super cool if /this/ had happened!"

What I want is to break all the restrictions stories seem to presuppose on themselves. Love it or hate it, /Worm/ executed this really, really well. It took its premise and went as far as it possibly could, never lacking for creativity or logical exlpanations.

We need more of that. We need stories that go to the logical extremes and /don't stop/. The stories where the hero takes the logic of the world, whatever it is, and makes it work for them, and achieves as much as possible, never mind the challenge or even merely reaching their original goal.

But not everyone is Eliezer Yudkowsky, so it might take more than one mind to fully exploit the potential of every story. Thus: Brainstorm threads. Think it'll work?

Edit: typos


** Anybody feel up to attempting a rational Romeo and Juliet?

It kind of inverts the original story, but I think the result should be a workable story in its own right, especially since the original tends to get read backwards. Instead of a couple who do everything wrong ultimately leading to both their deathes with a feud as backdrop, it could be a couple who work together to end a feud with a really healthy relationship as backdrop.

The title couple should show off things like clear communication, frontal override without sacrificing enjoyment, outside view, trust, concern for eachother's happiness... basically all the elements of a really healthy relationship. The idea would be to teach readers how to love the same way HPMoR teaches them to think. Because it isn't obvious, and the selection of fictional role models is terrible.

Bonus points if you can write it in iambic pentameter without getting in the way of the story.

***** That's why I proposed moving the feud and its closure into the foreground. For all that the relationship is the point, it doesn't provide enough conflict to drive the story. But as the heroic couple manipulates matters to stop the killing, with both sets of parents as antagonists and no one to trust but eachother, there should be some excitement.

Because healthy couples /don't/ spend all their time staring into eachothers' eyes and feeling love. They go out into the world and make a difference. Much as HJPEV doesn't sit around just thinking.

You appear to be describing stories that engage in Serial Escalation or try to go Beyond The Impossible. I SUPPORT THIS VERY MUCH AND SUGGEST VIEWING LOTS OF GAINAX OR TRIGGER ANIME AS PREPARATION.

Now, as to desired rationalfics:

- /Assassin's Creed/ done with a whole lot more idealism, as a way of teaching meta-ethics. Just to make it ambiguous who "deserves to win", the Templars are attempting a Phlebotinum Singularity using Bostrom's idea of a Singleton (ie: have only one decision-maker in control to prevent existentially-risky wars), while the Assassins show a better understanding of real human values but favor a more anarchist politics (needless to say, they refuse to use the Pieces of Eden on people and treat them as /highly dangerous/) even if this means violence is more common. This gets back to the conflict from the first game about how one defines ideals like "peace" or "freedom" in a complex world of multiple, conflicting ideologies.

- Tengen Toppa Gurren Rationality. Absolutely nothing is changed from the original, since the characters' hotbloodedness really is the best way to use Spiral Power. Tutorial in so-called Fun Theory. In fact, just go watch all of the following to learn about Fun: FLCL, Evangelion, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Little Witch Academia, Kill la Kill.

- Rational /Attack on Titan/. Instead of being a tutorial in blindly aggressive fascism, the story focuses on Armin and Mikasa more, and steadily becomes a portrait of what it actually means to live in a world constantly on the brink of existential risk. Hopefully someone manages to cover the "life worth living" point that x-risk guys sometimes miss.

** I have, on occasion, floated the idea of Rational!Animorphs. What I really like about the idea is that you don't necessarily need to upgrade your main characters /that much/, because you can spread the power across the five (or six) of them.

- Jake becomes much better at actual tactics. He reads up on military history so that he has something to fall back on when things get really hard. He's very good at instrumental rationality: using what he can to win more and making sure the blade cuts the enemy.

- Marco is the designated skeptic and science-guy. He's also the one keeping the bigger picture in mind, something the others sometimes forget and tends to question the alien's motives more than the others. He's also the one who thinks things through the furthest, looking at all aspects of the battleplan (before initial combat, after that it's Jake's call) and munchkin's their power the hardest. He's also (together with Rachel) one of the main consequentialists of the group.

- Cassie is great at psychology. She understands people and their biases, but also knows how to use the dark arts and manipulate them. She's also the one who has the easiest time seeing the aliens as persons and looking at their different values. Furthermore, her knowledge of animals gets a major upgrade, which aids the rest of the group in using their powers optimally.

- Rachel is the one who goes furthest in order to win, who is willing to sacrifice the most. Her values differ somewhat from the others, in that she doesn't mind all the fighting and even enjoys it. After Jake, she's the best at snap decision making and getting the job done. (To be honest, I'm not quite sure what rationality upgrade to give her. She's mainly characterized by being freakishly good at fighting.)

- Tobias, apart from being a bird, is a good all-rounder. He's able to lead, is smart and can be willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. His main upgrade would be a strong adherence to the truth. He can't stand falsehoods and helps others see what's really out there.

- Ax's main role would be "token alien", but he's also the one with very different values from the rest of the team. I'd need to do some figuring out how this shows exactly, but Andalites should definitely think differently than humans.

The story would be quite similar in the beginning, but escalate quickly. The animal forms allow for excellent stealth missions and they'd resort to sneaking in explosives into the Yeerk pools. Open confrontations would be avoided but probably still happen frequently (no plan survives enemy contact, after all). In response, the Yeerks (and especially Visser Three) would escalate as retaliation, which would lead to open war a lot quicker. The Yeerks would also be better at infesting key persons, giving them more power to cover up these escalations.

Like... why are the yeerks focused on a single town? Six guerrilla fighters ruining your small-scale invasion? You have the resources to run more than one small-scale invasion concurrently.

Or why are they so bad at security? No ability to seal the exits? No guards at entrances? No snipers? No video recording? No identification? No passwords? No strict scheduling? No two hour waiting periods in isolation?

Plus they suck at actually invading. Why not infest /the rest/ of familes ("I think we should eat at McDonalds...")? Why not take over a hotel and then waltz into rooms every night and infest the guests (to be fair, they did take over a hospital but /only one/)? What about the bathrooms at conventions?

Instead, they spend their time backstabbing the fuck out of each other and instituting feudal regimes we moderns would consider cripplingly, idiotically reactionary and backwards.

Well /that/ was deliberate. Their two universal religious taboos are: never make a mutant/transhuman that's completely divergent and biologically separate from the human species, in the sense of being unable to breed with a human, and, never make a machine that can think. (And on the other hand, if the transhumans are made in lines with what humans want, won't they be /mostly/ human by default? Humans don't, by default, come up with Completely Alien Person Designs.)

I choose to accept that much of their backwardness is because they threw away technology after the Butlerian Jihad, which I now /choose to interpret/ as a full-scale interplanetary/interstellar war against a full-scale UFAI. Nuclear weapons may have been used to the point of destroying whole planets and stars.

Basically, they're trying to avoid UFAI and Unfriendly Transhumans as much as possible. This results in human civilization stagnating like hell.

Material resources being limited? Strangely enough, for such a backwards civilization they're generally portrayed as quite wealthy, by our standards.

One element would be a more complex understanding of the arachnid enemies, who in the original book are a human level technological society. My idea being that they are hyper specialised but still human level intelligence, think a whole breed of savants in a particular field, but with virtually no ability to change skills.

I would then contrast with the human society, and try to give a more realistic account of how a society where citizenship is dependent on military service would work. There may also be opportunities for game theory style discussion of how the relationships between the different species work.

Only problem is I have a lot of background info dump material but not really a plot in mind...

I'm aware that Yudkowsky calls his own story an Author Tract, but that doesn't mean he's right to do so. When I think of Author Tract, I think of books like The Elementary Particles, or authors like Ayn Rand and Terry Goodkind. Not HPMOR.

There's a clear distinction between ideas that people fashion a story around and stories that people put their ideas into. HPMOR is the latter, and thus while it at times clearly reflects the values of its author, it doesn't sacrifice the story for them.

At the end of the day, anvilicious writing is to some degree relative. But along the spectrum, it strikes me as odd that someone would desribe HPMOR as so. I've never read a single chapter in HPMOR that took me out of the story: even the most monologuey sections still fit the characters and context.

The same cannot be said for true author tract "stories." Anyone who has read The Sword of Truth can name the moments when the author clearly sacrificed his story and characters' integrity for the sake of soapboxing. Even when agreeing with that particular soapbox, it's annoying and obvious author-tracting.

I think the big reason that people don't want to classify HPMOR as an author tract is the negative connotations of that label. The label has negative connotations because so often it's done poorly, and this is basically the argument that Yudkowsky makes when he says that HPMOR is an author tract.

This goes to the general misuse of what "soapboxing" even means... it's not "has an opinion on something and goes into detail as to why." It's also not just a matter of disagreement on some moral issue (meaning, if you think it's judgmental to call a society where an elite nobility feels entitled to get away with whatever they do to lower classes "backwards," calling someone making such a judgement out for "soapboxing" is equally incorrect).

Right, and because the topic at hand is "magic," it seems really odd to me that people bring this up. By definition, any rule of magic works in a story because the author ultimately decides that's how it will work. It's not like the belief contradicts anything else in the HP world, and it's internally consistent. So what's the issue?

JK Rowling wrote in a spell that worked based on the Power of Love to shield someone from an "unblockable curse," and the implications of that were never even mentioned again. Compared to that, Patronus 2.0 is probably the most rational form of magic in the series.

  I think the big reason that people don't want to classify HPMOR as an author tract is the negative connotations of that label... It's not a negative thing to have a work of fiction that quite explicitly expresses the author's viewpoints in great detail, but it's poorly done most of the time.

Which is why I distinguished making a story to push an idea vs using a story as a medium for communicating ideas. HPMOR is the latter, and regardless of connotations, referring to HPMOR as an Author Tract fails to distinguish it from the former. Which means now we need a new word for those type of stories, which seems silly and unnecessary to me, when we could instead just recognize their differences and stop calling it that.

Edit:

As a counterexample of "true soapboxing," there is a scene in one of the last Sword of Truth novels where a teenage girl, having just turned a magic trap around on her would-be-killer, then proceeds to lecture them for two pages about the nature of evil and good, the differences between them, and basically an all-around reiteration of the author's beliefs on the topic, while the villain is slowly crushed to death. Keep in mind that none of this was new at this point: he'd been doing similar things for at least half a dozen books now. But apparently he felt the need to put yet another monologue into yet another action packed scene and turn yet another of his characters into a mouthpiece for his ideals, thus extinguishing their individuality from the other protagonists, who by this point had virtually all already joined the hive-mind.

The context is the most damning aspect: behind enemy lines, just barely having escaped from death, it takes an Author Tract of truly onerous proportions to have a character decide this was a good time to give such a lecture... to someone who's about to die anyway, no less.

****** I'm not sure how I feel about the Patronus 2.0. When I first read it, it was a Crowning Moment of Awesome. When I found out Harry was going to obsess over defeating Death, I was kinda disappointed, because that's not how Death works in the real world anyway. I also felt that Rowling's original idea of Dementors equaling clinical depression was being thrown aside.

When I found out Yudkowsky is preachy about his transhumanism, the scene started to make me /deeply/ uncomfortable. In fact, transhumanism in general, taken as an ideology rather than an idea, scares me a good bit: Yudkowsky and his Extropians are some of the best of the bunch, but the general majority of transhumanists often come off like really creepy, greedy, domineering people.

******* I understand the impulse to read into a story based on knowledge of the author, but I try to discourage people from doing that with novels whenever possible. ("Literature professors hate him!")

Barring revolutions in medicine or computers, ultimately the author will one day be dead and gone, and their work is what will remain. The story should be taken on its own merits: authors are entitled to speak about what's important to them, but we should only judge them for doing so when they sacrifice the story to do so, and I don't believe Yudkowsky has so far.

As for the Dementors, I feel like it's an acceptable shift, especially the way it was framed: creatures that suck out the hope of everyone around them and instill despair can do so for a variety of reasons, and when trying to rationalize them it seems to me you have two options:

1) Make them the avatars of "Despair," which is rather silly if you understand what depression is from a biochemical standpoint (Do they just go around in a magic field that zaps serotonin/dopamine?)

Or

2) Make them the avatars of a concept that in itself naturally evokes depression.

And "Death" serves pretty nicely as a universally hard-wired cause of despair and fear. Fits the animal theme of the Patronus fantastically too: animals certainly can get depressed, but fear of Death is a human thing.
