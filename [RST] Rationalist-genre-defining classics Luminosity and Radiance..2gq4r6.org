** /Radiance/ was, I thought, a lot better than /Luminosity/. You could see the author getting better as she went, I thought. One of the cool things that the original series of Twilight books did was having different character possess extra powers that were unique to them, and /Luminosity/ carried it much further than the original series did, and took it in some unique directions.

*** /Radiance/ is a lot better written, I'll give it that. Better /overall/ plotting, too.

Agree about canon being picked up and run with well in /Luminosity/.

Not sure about how strong the characterizations were in /Radiance/ itself, though...

*** I know I'm late, but I just got done reading both fics and wanted to throw my thoughts down. I liked /Luminosity/ a lot more - perhaps I was just caught up in the novelty of it all, but I loved following Bella through the whole 'there are vampires now what' stuff. Watching her analyze all the information as it came in was the highlight of my readings. I think that's why I liked HPMoR so much too - it was really interesting reading about these novel decision-making techniques, me being new to this whole 'rational' thing.

/Luminosity/ and /Radiance/ took a turn for the worse, IMO, when the grimdark never-ending troubles hit. I wasn't interested in reading about vampires duking it out for power, however creative they got with their powers (which wasn't very, again IMO). I wasn't attached to Elspeth like I was Bella, and I wasn't very fond of her ability to develop plot powers as was convenient (Bella began to suffer from that too). I finished /Radiance/ to finish it. Like someone else said, you can see the ending coming miles away, and it kind of slogs on its way there.

I've never read Twilight or even seen the movies, though, so that was kind of nice. I like that this is my only exposure. I'm almost tempted to put myself through the movies just to see, heh. All in all, I enjoyed both /Luminosity/ and /Radiance/, I just liked /Luminosity/ a lot more. It all comes down to personal preference, I guess?

** Probably more influential in defining rationalist fiction than even /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, and notable as fanfiction widely acclaimed as better than the original - if you haven't read them yet, you should!

#+begin_quote
  My favorite three questions are, /What do I want?, What do I have?/, and /How can I best use the latter to get the former?/

  Actually, I'm also fond of /What kind of person am I?/, but that one isn't often directly relevant to decision making on a day-to-day basis.
#+end_quote

/Luminosity/ takes us through /Twilight/ with Bella as an introspective rationalist instead of a doormat, and beautifully showcases both the inner and outer changes that result. By the end, the canon saga is thoroughly off the rails, and /Radiance/ has to be read to be believed...

I don't know...I think /Radiance/ had some serious, serious problems, even after the rough start. I completely stalled out in it, something that didn't happen even in the probably-too-long /Luminosity/.

I think you can only jerk the reader and the characters around so much without losing them. /[[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Pact]]/ has a similar issue of trying to be dangerous and edgy, but it just ends up just being a rollercoaster full of violent jerks without any payoff. I've stopped reading it entirely at this point.

All three stories seem to have been made with a certain type of (I hate to say it) juvenile character abuse porn in mind, and it doesn't seem to ever allow anyone to accomplish anything. /Luminosity/ didn't start that way, which if you know its history is telling.

The start of /Luminosity/ is some of the best rationalist fanfic ever written. The rest is very average.

Along with /Worm/, these are at the vanguard of a wave of rational and rationalist fiction that seems to demand constant maximum worst results in the pursuit of "realism", with not even a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding][earn your happy ending]] in sight.

If the protagonist makes a sandwich in chapter 6, someone will try to murder them because of it by the end of chapter 10. If people aren't naked, alone, and bleeding, just wait until the next arc.

Cheap drama from constant danger isn't good writing. But these are also very popular stories.

So, I'd like to hope that some day they /don't/ define the genre of rationalist fiction, but I can't really argue that they haven't so far.

**** I get it with Pact, but not the others. In Worm it reads to me as problems proportionate to the power of the main character, /Luminosity/ and /Radiance/ has a pacing issue with the majority of conflict concentrated in the second book but it's more about concentration than overall levels of awfulness. I prefer the intensity of /Radiance/ to the sort of easygoing feel of /Luminosity/. /Luminosity/ has more of that typical fanfic feel of nothing really going wrong.

**** I mostly agree with this. I stopped reading Pact because it was too grim and gritty without many spots of hope - it felt suffocating (and it's weird, because Wildbow has said that he realized Worm needed more hope and more breathers, but I felt like if anything, he made Pact worse). I very nearly stopped reading Worm for the same reason, but I tend to stick things out once I've started, and the use of powers was at least novel enough that I stuck with it.

**** Huh. You put it a lot better than I did in my review of Luminosity. I'll put it here (warning: spoilers) for comparison.

#+begin_quote
  I think this is the best Twilight fic there is. Thank you very much for your wrighting! HPMOR still beats it, but that's a different universe, and I think Twilight is a much more difficult one to rationalize. For example, your reimagining inherited some of the inherent contradictions, such as Aro saying he doesn't know why Edward doesn't simply eat Bella, even though it's common knowledge among vampires that mates come first, always. There may be several singers providing momentary pleasure, but there is only one mate. That's an incredibly silly thing to say for a millenia-year-old vampire with thousands of millenia of memories stored in his head.

  One complaint I do have is that a little too many of the major plot points are based on highly improbable events, even in this highly improbable universe. I'm not speaking of the one event that made all Bella's plans go askew at the end of Luminosity, although it does irk me; that's plausible, and only a little improbable, but once is okay. But when this happens over and over again... A friendly pack of werewolves being in the neighbourhood just in time for Elspeth to stumble into after she runs from another, not so friendly pack of werewolves? Cody defecting right after he finds out about Bella being alive, not a week earlier, not a week later? The highly improbable coincidence that Petra is Bella's singer? And this is just the beginning of the second book.

  All these coincidences mean that the plot develops in an entirely unpredictable, illogical way, subject only to the author's fancy. You can't predict the people in the universe; when you're reading the novel, you are forced to try to predict the author, instead, and that just detracts from the enjoyment. Where such coincidences were acceptable for the not entirely serious, adolescently romantic canon, this fic presumes to be serious and rational, and expecting readers to suspend their disbelief just isn't very compatible with this style of writing.

  I think the reason you had to use coincidences is because you made too few changes in the universe. You made Bella smarter and more rational, but everything else, as I see it, is the same. There was no other way to make life more difficult for the heroes without some major bad luck. I think it would have been better if you altered the universe to be a harder challenge for Bella's wit; made the Volturi smarter, changed some of the laws, introduced new elements - whatever.

  But, again, Twilight is a very difficult universe to make sensible, and a lot of effort was obviously made towards that end. I enjoyed the fic very much, I agree with Bella's thinking in the first book a lot, and I find the end result very satisfactory.

  Thanks again for writing.

One of Worm's warnings is that it is not a story that you should read if you are the type of person who requires trigger warnings. I am the type of person who requires trigger warnings. If trauma becomes a major defining point of rationalist fanfiction, I will be very sad because I cannot read stories which engage in more than a certain density of character trauma. (Oddly, I am fine with depictions of the /aftermath/ of that trauma.)

**** I can't speak about Luminosity and Radiance, I got bored half into Radiance and stopped. But your gut felling of Worm is not unusual or even rare in this sub.

There was a previous thread some time ago where someone else made a comment on how Worm is rational, and maybe even rationalist, I got upset (and I still do every time this happens), there was backlash and I made it as response and critique of Worm characters and world.

rot13 for spoilers btw [[http://pastebin.com/NNP2gXh3]]

Beware however that I was upset at the time and wrote this with a snide, condescending and mean attitude. It gets better as it goes on (I could be wrong) so don't be put out by my childish remarks.

***** I'm fairly certain it was [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1m7gta/good_stories/cc6i2ik][my recommendation]] that made EY and everyone else go read it. I said it was clever and emotional, but never rational, and certainly not rationalist. EY never said it was rationalist.

/Worm/ is not rationalist. It was never meant to be. It's a deconstruction of superhero tropes first and a smart web serial second, written at the speed of light. A fully rational /Worm/ looks like [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2crqh0/weaver_nine_worm_fanfic_au/][/Weaver Nine/]], but that rearranges the character roster and was a patched version anyway. I'm looking forward to the print edition.

Honestly I think you went in with some skewed/hyped expectations (can't blame you, looking back at that rec thread -- ugh), but I'm still going to hold to /Worm/ as a very special piece of fiction for the scale and speed of its run, considering the fact that the author probably hadn't have heard of true rationality when he'd started writing.

You said it yourself:

#+begin_quote
  It's okay to read about irrational things and stories written in emotion and silly stories. Because let's face it, writing hpmor took a lot of effort on EY, and it would take an even greater effort to write like that about a whole world which is being attacked by nigh invincible monsters that wage war on all of mankind.

The basic idea of this trope is that a cast of characters in a story go through a lot more hardship, anguish and grief than is really necessary. In the end, however, you see them get their happily-ever-after. While humans may act [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards][bad]] and the world may seem like it's a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld][crapsack]] , that doesn't mean that the worst villain is beyond [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn][redemption]] , or that things can't be improved with hard work or even [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove][The Power of Love]] .

Not to be confused with the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding][Golden Ending]] in video games, where players actually have to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRewards][earn]] their happy ending. It is possible for both tropes to be in play at the same time, however.

Compare [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding][Earn Your Bad Ending]] , the polar opposite.

**** You are probably right. With all of the stories I mentioned, the /idea/ behind the stories sounded great, but I couldn't get into any of them. It has been long enough that I can't recall any specific complaints, but because the premise of each story was so interesting, I've tried each story at least twice.

When discussing a story, no matter how much I enjoyed (or didn't enjoy) it, I always try to keep in mind both its merits and its flaws. What I am tired of is the (what seems to me) disproportionate amount of praise that these stories receive on this subreddit.

When I look at reviews of books and stories (and anything else for that matter) on Amazon, Goodreads, or FFN, I always look for well-written critical reviews first. These are the reviews that I enjoy reading the most--especially if it's a book that I really enjoyed. Critical reviews spark the most interesting debates--they point out flaws I may have glossed over, and as an author, they help me learn what isn't working in my writing. If it is a review of something I haven't read, they help me decide if I should give the book a chance--can I deal with the flaws that the reviewer has pointed out?

I understand that these reviews are harder to write, but I have had a hard time finding critical reviews of any of these stories (but especially Worm) anywhere on the web. I would enjoy reading a well-written review that points out both Worm's faults and merits, written by someone who enjoyed the story just enough to finish it. Maybe Worm's length is the problem.

I think you may be misremembering. There was a very dangerous window of opportunity there. That was clearly the most rational choice with the information available in that situation. She was in very real existential danger, beyond even that involved in normal, non-immortal life.

I obviously couldn't say if not getting those sorts of things affected your enjoyment of /Luminosity/, and other fics like it, but it can't have helped.
