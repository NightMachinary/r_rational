Actually, the more I think about it, I realize that WoC is doing something I've not seen before - one of the hallmarks of postmodernism is to be self reflective, but I've never seen a work that doesn't just point back to its own structure or genre, but explicitly points back to its own postmodernism. I'm sure other examples exist, and I'd love to compare them.

** I said it in a previous set of chapters and I'll say it again: The Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle and the necrolaborum exclusion zone are meant as a dark mirror of how Amaryllis purpose raised an entire Tuung population.

The clearing up of old quests did a decent job of balancing summarizing the important points while not dragging out trivial quests. They could have been a little longer because Alexanderwales' world building is always fun to read, but it wouldn't have advanced the plot or character development.

It looks like we are moving towards the end, with the way things wrapped up... but I recall the Gods were excluded from the worldbuilding side document to avoid spoiling them, so there is probably a significant arc for the God Botherer quest left.

*** Broadly speaking, I think the whole story's point is props for consequentialism, with this as a single elaboration on the theme.

Like, BitB is a monster for raising people to choose to sacrifice themselves for his ends. Mary is a hero for doing likewise. Juniper swooping down and slaughtering a few hundred frog cops in order to steal magic items from Bethel is heroic, because it might make him strong enough to stop people like the monstrous Onion, who kills far less people than that in duels.

This just keeps on happening, to the point that Perisev gets a whole 'this is why you suck' speech when she attacks Juniper because she's thinking too much about the narrative...one update before the team thinks a lot about the narrative and goes off to attack people.

You can handwave at the Second Empire comparison that keeps on coming up, if you like, where our crew repeats robotically to one another, over and over, how terrible the 2E folks were for wanting to take everything over, even as they strive desperately to become God and take everything over.

I don't think the point of all this is to make the characters great big hypocrites. My take is that the point is the other way round, it's Stephen R Donaldson's condemnation of innocence. If the party didn't do these things, they'd be helpless, frozen out of action because any action they take would be hypocritical/evil. The only way to actually affect the world is to take the risk that you are doing so in error, follow your moral intuitions where they take you and act in full knowledge that unbiased observers will cluck their tongues at you.

**** This is an interesting comment but I would be surprised to learn this is an author-intended explicit theme, and not just something implicit in all of the "rational" community's writings. I mean - its right there in the name, "rational" - a belief that people of great intellect are special enough that their attempts at consequentialist moral reasoning won't fail in the typical way. That's why theses stories are niche - and lose normal folks over their run - the protagonist's consequentialism comes off as a deep moral failing and there is an expectation of an eventual comeuppance that never arrives. I agree the author is very unlikely to be holding an ace up his sleeve making all this a deconstruction of the HPMOR-style protagonist, as such a deconstruction would leave the story no longer "rational."

The Second Empire is definitely an intentional deconstruction. If alexanderwales just wanted a bunch of bad guys he could have made them generic fantasy Nazis, but instead he emphasized how they had a mindset of scientifically brute forcing things that clashed against Aerb's logic. Juniper and friends failing to learn from its errors would be more surprising but not impossible, especially with the speculation about Postmodernist fiction which defies or subverts conventions.

Maybe. I feel like there's still a lot to be resolved, and this is accelerating too fast too suddenly to actually be the climax of the story? We haven't actually had any down time. This chapter is 'the calm' in the sense that nothing specific happened to move things definitively forward, but it was really tense for an actual downbeat period to be followed by rising action. I kind of feel that our heroes can only end being beat down by their attempt going forward. At the very least, it's hard to see how gold magic is just the fix to thei problems. It's not really thematically on point. We'll see, I guess.

I think we're going to see a lot more exclusions (some exploit of Gold Magic next) before we're done, to say nothing of the magics he hasn't even unlocked yet, like velocity. There's lots of fun to be had exploiting speedster powers. And lots of speedster pop culture lore to deconstruct.

Magics on his sheet, but not unlocked: Velocity, Revision, Rune, Plastic, Fire, Tree, and Wards.

I'll be really surprised if the story ends before we get to see Rune Magic. It's been flagged a number of times that he's got some clever ideas to exploit it. And if he triggers an exclusion of Rune Magic, the soul-extracting needles will stop working, condemning every single living person on Aerb to eventual Hell, if they don't exploit Valencia's power to "solve" the problem of Hell.

*** This is entirely speculation, based on what I would do if I were the author.

Fairly early in this batch of chapters, there's some rumination on whether Joon would want to go back to Earth, if he had the opportunity. And his conclusion was, no, he's not going back. In fact, it's such a foregone conclusion that he states it before he gives the reasons why. I think something is doing to happen to change that resolution, and it's going to happen when he meets Arthur.

The biggest thing that wasn't mentioned when he considered whether or not to go back to Earth is his friends. We've met Aerb-Reimer, and he wasn't quite the same person Joon remembered. Now, Valencia has insisted that Joon go talk to his Aerb-father and Aerb-Tiff, before finally going to meet his own Arthur, the first encounter with anyone /really/ from his previous life since he got there.

The purpose, I think, of all of this, is to make the choice of Earth vs. Aerb a lot more difficult than Joon thinks it will be. The inconsistencies you mention would serve as foreshadowing. Someone - maybe Arthur, but more likely Amaryllis - could point out that, for all his insistence that he's more suited to Aerb, Earth is where his friends and biological family are, where his culture is, and the fact that he can't even acclimate himself to the standard terminology of Aerb. Probably because he doesn't truly believe it's real.

So, that would be my guess: this is trying to build up the idea, in advance, that Joon isn't quite so confident that he'd choose life on Aerb over Earth as he thinks he is, with the intention of having him make that choice at some point in the near future.

Again, this is just a shot in the dark, but if I were setting something like this up, that's the climactic moment I'd be setting it up towards.

Yes, I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist as described.

I'm more agnostic about the existence of some form of afterlife, and I imagine that I would be more willing to entertain the concept if there were evidence, as Joon has, than magic exists and interacts with our world. But Hell as a place where people's souls are tortured by demons and devils (i.e. a Hell in the same sense as an Aerbian one)? That seems to have been made up out of whole cloth by early Christian writers.

And, even if it weren't, a Hell that could be avoided by following a few hundred simple rules like "don't murder people," "don't eat seafood," and "don't do any work on Saturdays" (or the even easier Christian rules of "Love God" and "Love your neighbour"), rather than one where if you die and can't be spiked, then sorry, you're damned... I still think I'd make that trade in a heartbeat.

Hell, even if the choices were between Aerb, with afterlife being "oblivion if you're spiked and Hell if you're not," or Earth, with afterlife being one of (you don't know which) "oblivion, no matter what," or "a utopian afterlife if you deserve it, or Aerb-style Hell if you don't," I still think the choice to move to Earth is a clear one.

Keep in mind that some of those rules are calls to positive actions that should be considered evil:

- If you are a man, stone your son to death if he doesn't obey you [Deu 21:18-21]
- If you are a man, participate in stoning to death the son of any rebellious son in your community [ibid]
- If you are a woman who is raped by a man, you must marry your rapist (more literally, /he/ must marry /you/, but marriage is commutative) [Deu 22:28-29]
- Kill all gay men [Lev 20:13]
- Beat your children with a rod when they misbehave [Prov 23:13-14]

And some are things that you've probably done at some point:

- Do not paint realistic pictures, sculpt realistic sculptures, or take photographs because that would be making for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. (NB: The command not to worship these images is separate.) [Ex 20:4-6]
- Hope that none of your parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents did anything to piss god off, because he will punish down to the third or fourth generation [ibid]

Then add in the fact that:

- At least for some versions of the Biblical god, some of the things that get you sent to Hell are thoughtcrimes. For example, you thought that barista was really hot, or you ever watched porn, or you ever got excited by a sex scene in a movie? Oops, you just committed adultery in your heart, it's hell for you.\\
- God visits punishment on the third or fourth generation

Short version: If you're Christian, it's almost unavoidable that you are going to hell.

EDIT:

Now, sure, there are a lot of apologetics for all of these things. Pastors, priests, ministers, etc basically make a living cleaning up the nastier parts of the Bible and explaining why a plain reading of the modern English text is not actually correct, despite Psalm 12:7 saying that God will preserve His words. Oh, wait...a plain reading of the KJV says that. A plain reading of the NIV says that god will preserve his people. Oops. That's a pretty significant difference in God's message...which should you believe?

KJV: "6 The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 7 Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever."

NIV: "6 And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible, like gold[c] refined seven times. 7 You, Lord, will keep the needy safe and will protect us forever from the wicked [...]"

********** Matthew 5:18, KJV: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."

There are multiple interpretations of this passage and yes, you're right that one of them is "Hey, all that stuff I said before? I'm taking backsies. Don't worry about it." That's a minority opinion and all of the other interpretations I'm aware of say that yes, Christians are still bound by Mosaic law.

Still, I'll roll with it. Let's allow the Christians to keep the Torah (aka Old Testament) as part of their holy book but not be bound by any of it. You're still stuck with the part about a moment of lust for a woman sending you to hell, because you have committed adultery with her in your heart. You also have the problem that if you've ever prayed in church (or anywhere that isn't your closet) then you have broken God's command, because Matthew 6:6 says "But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."

Rejecting the Old Testament doesn't get you anywhere. The New Testament has just as many commands in it that make it virtually impossible to avoid hell. It's also far more immoral than the Old Testament -- the Old Testament God would turn you into salt, or blow up your city, or tell his people to dash your brains against the rocks while you were still an infant, but he let it go at death. The New Testament God will have you killed and will then keep you conscious so he can burn you forever.

If I were going to believe either, it seems obvious it would have to be the latter; the very existence of a choice of which to believe disproves the former, or at least makes it mostly pointless since the words technically being preserved is of no use if there's no way of knowing which words are the right ones. To believe the former would thus require accepting that you're probably not believing the correct version, which is obviously self-defeating.

The only thing that Joon can offer to justify staying, if he were "the average Aerbian, or some version of [himself] that had a parallel to what [he] would have been on Earth," is this:

#+begin_quote
  Aerb had big towers that no one had an explanation for. It had rivers that sometimes ran backwards, fish that exploded if the light of a full moon touched them, metals that turned soft like putty when you sang to them, billions of tiny little things to seek out and understand, to soak in and enjoy. Earth had that too, it did, but the scale on Aerb was so much different, so much larger.

As for why on a literal level: maybe that's just it's personality. Or /alternatively/:

Gold mages are likely ephemeral - once you have a certain amount of gold you can retire as a gold mage and still live a life of luxury. So investing past that point is useless. So /more broadly/, without relying on one particular gold mage, what does it need for someone to break into the plane of gold?

Well, you need a fuckton of gold all in one spot.

So, if you have a ton of gold mages all gradually concentrating gold in their possession (and it really needs to be /all in one spot/ and /securely/ in their possession, to avoid them being lied to - which nicely matches up to observed requirements for gold mages), then it makes the job of /future/ gold mages easier. Retired gold mages can trade their gold to other gold mages in exchange for non-gold wealth, so retirees are now just a worn out tool rather than any sort of catastrophe for the long-term plan.

Sooner or later, all you'll need is one single uber-powerful (due to being uber-rich) gold mage who can get to the plane of gold and unleash the goldbug. Like Joon. Oops.

If Joon already had enough gold to the gold plane, then goldbug would have pushed him to go there already, so we can assume that Joon isn't able to do so with his current amount of gold.

So, suppose Joon retires and an equally-powerful gold mage replaces him: first thing goldbug says is "go to moon, mark gold" (easy power boost) and second thing it says is "bring your existing gold and stash it here".

If this keeps happening then eventually, there's enough gold on the moon to get to the gold plane.

If you're worried about gold on Aerb becoming more scarce and hurting novice gold mages: keep in mind, more gold is still being mined and put into the system (plus, gold being more valuable incentivises mining more of it).

Thinking about it more though, I think goldbug represents stockholders (not capitalism in general) and becoming a gold mage is like IPOing or something.

obviously corn is ubiquitous throughout the midwest, and there are logistical issues with this theory, but from a Doylist point of view I'm struggling to see why AW would pick corn specifically for the patch if not to draw a link to Joon's home. Maybe it's a red herring, or maybe it's no deeper than "look, an Earth thing!", or maybe it belongs to someone other than Craig. I'd note that Craig and Tom are the only players who haven't had an Aerb analogue appear in some form or another yet. And of course, if Arthur and Joon can both have their turn with the game system, in "stories" that reflect them as individuals...

Either as a straight up jokey squadron name (Maze Fight becomes the dumbest synonyms for each word) OR it is a Craig/Joon reference to some specific maze based argument they had in the group about long stairs, since squabble is defined as

  The gold hadn't ended up staying in Darili Irid, though Juniper had made plenty of offers to let it stay there, either because he thought he needed to, or because he believed that the gold was, ultimately, immaterial. Juniper had said, repeatedly, that in his games the “loot” didn't matter much, that he would adjust the challenges to the party as they gained abilities and could spend more money. It was hard to tell with Juniper how much of what he said was hollow words, how much was simply motivated by the game, and how much he really meant. In this case, he was saying that it was no true hardship, because money would come to them all the same. ‘Gold sinks', he kept saying. It was slightly uncomfortable, to hear that the money didn't matter either way. Grak had deferred to Amaryllis; the money wouldn't bring anyone back. It wouldn't actually provide absolution. He had always known that.

Honestly I think I skimmed that one, the conversation with rosemallow doesn't flow as well as most of AWales stuff, i think it got kinda confusing with juniper dipping into rosemallows memories and riffling around, even now i had to reread the first half of the chapter twice to make sure i knew who was saying what and talking to who.

** It might be because the chapters are always so tightly paced, but I wonder when this is a book if some editing might be in order to not have stuff so tightly on the nose

Like talking about Earth being real, literally next chapter having the same conversation about the matrix. Then again maybe I'm missing a ton of interchapterblock themes which does do that

But as is a theme of the book so much meta talk requires you to then consider the text itself, like all the postmodern talk and you see the ways where this book isn't very postmodern at least in the sense that almost everything has some meaning, and all the dialogue follows so tightly both for the reader and within the narrative yet are all pretty closely linked, how lucky. [perhaps there's a word I'm looking for that isn't postmodern but I'm not educated enough to know the jargon] Like the Lucky Stairs stuff, but of course we know that from Juniper's perspective it's not that weird because he's the protag but from our perspective it's weirder, at least he had a 4 hour gap between conversations (though perhaps that makes them even more obviously linked). I'm still waiting for a really postmodernist take where a void gun hits him or there's a chapter about something completely unrelated, but I think and maybe I'm willing to bet that no one would write this much and end it like that. Most postmodernist stories (like the Willy Wonka one or Slime God thing) are quite obvious from the get go (and rather short), and the annoyance by dissatisfying most readers mean it'll also be a minority.

If this story ends in failure it will be fantastic, but I might take up a bet that it will not, lampshading it probably isn't meaningful (even statistically, stories that talk about the chance of failure at the end are probably no more or less likely to wrap up neatly). Probably bittersweet if I had to guess. Certainly not godhood and the eventual succumbing that would be to turning the universe into densely packed bliss bacteria

Great stuff anyway, so nice for the text to do some thinking.

What system could not have this unless Juniper wants to kill those with congenial defects or just outside some STD

What outcome is he hoping for exactly? Do more people work menial jobs that they don't enjoy when given the choice or when not? Also it's a bit rich for the protag to say that.

** I only check the sub around 3 times every 2 weeks. I'm stepping up my coding game primarily so that I can find a way to notify myself whenever cuthulurayjepsen posts a Worth the Candle update.

I'm happy whenever there is an update, but I'm less happy with this particular update. It feels like our author is very conscious that everyone else is conscious of the endgame of WTC. To bke honest though, I think that's just a part of me being a part of the ride, of this serial novel. I don't think I would be complaining if I were reading this as a complete work.

Whether Homer, or Dostoyevsky, or our dear author-- I think that whatever we were waiting for (as an audience) is going to be both more and less than were expecting.

Personally, I trust the author who has brought us up to this point.

*** Full spoilers ahead:

After wrapping up Anglecynn, which involved going through a marriage inspection and getting their hands on a boatload of entads, they went back to Poran (though Mary left a bunch of clones behind to handle politics).

Next they decided to tackle the dragon imposed quest of killing Captain Blue in The Bottle. Turns out he wasn't so easy to find in his Zone, so they had to detour to the Doris Finch exclusion to negotiate for her tracking abilities (the DFEZ is one of my favorite parts of the story so far, by the way).

Side quest done, they went back to Blue, where it turns out defeating him is trivial, but dealing with the fallout is going to be a clusterfuck. They trap him in a ward for the time being and before they have time for anything more, the dragon shows up asking if it's done. Juniper says it's not so simple, they might need more time before killing him, and being a very reasonable dragon she tries to roast them. So after a handful of dragon fighting, Essentialism is excluded, Juniper is a Gold Mage and the two dragons are dead.

Then we come to the current batch where not a lot happens in terms of plot, it was mostly dealing with the mess of Blue in the Bottle and the demands of Gold Magic, which included one-shoting a couple of exclusions.
