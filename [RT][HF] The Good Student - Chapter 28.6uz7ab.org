** Usually I can understand the meta of the story at this point. The reader have figured out what the demon should have been etc.

But in this story I'm in total darkness as much as the main character. I don't know if magic arrived with 1 demon, when multiple demons were around and how they were able to get back? Does being cose to demon gives you raw arcanum?
