There's wordpress, and if that's good enough for everyone's purposes then I'll leave this project as-is, but I'm thinking features like:

- Version control

- Various pricing options (subscriptions, patreon-like systems, free samples + purchase, donations, etc.)

- Merchandising (i.e. quotes on mugs, t-shirts, posters, etc. Perhaps help connecting users with designers for other stuff like icons and logos?)

- PDF, epub, and mobi downloads

- Genre tags

- Recommendation systems

- Updates via email (and other channels?)

- RSS feeds

- Custom CSS

- Custom domain names

- Author's notes

And anything else you can think of. It's just an idea at the moment, and mainly a way to see if there's demand. Cheers.


** A number of us have been demanding the creation of a LessWrongFiction site for a good while. It would centralize our craving for stories about hyper-intellectual nerds like ourselves.

** I would, as long as it was selective to high quality rational fiction. Like an online magazine of rationality. Eagle and Alexander, selected other high quality authors.

** If you have the time and skills for a project such as this one, maybe you could contribute to (or fork, I guess) efiction.org and add the features you feel are lacking. It's already widely used by fiction archives, and it's also well-known by ebook managing tools such as Calibre (by way of the FFDL plugin).

** Archive of Our Own is pretty great. It's only for fanfiction but the code is [[https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive][open source]].

** sounds like one element would be well served by a content engine that at least internally use something like pandoc johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ (ignoring the community management and ecommerce elements)

** I think any demand for this that exists is satisfied by Fictionpress.com and Faniction.net right now. They don't have all of those features, but they do have a lot of users and stories already.

*** Yes, although they also have horrible interfaces. I would like to be able to edit a document and then click "update chapter" (or just have it update automatically) instead of having to:

- go to publish options
- go to Manage Stories
- go to relevant story
- go to Content/Chapters
- go to Replace/Update chapter
- select chapter in drop list
- select document in drop list
- click submit
- wait for full page refresh
- wait up to 30 mins for change to be applied

Other things

- The ability to respond to reviews, in threaded format
- The ability to search PMs or look for all messages from a given user
- The ability to review a chapter multiple times, for when I reread
- The ability to f'ing copy/paste from a story, for when I want to include a snippet in a review / PM. If they're worried about copyright / people stealing other people's work, it's not like they can prevent it -- turn off JavaScript, download page, view source -- lots of ways.
- Their goddamn link mangler has got to bloody go. There is no possible way that it provides more value than irritation.

In point of fact, FFN is a seriously craptastic platform. It just happens to be one of the best known and probably largest
