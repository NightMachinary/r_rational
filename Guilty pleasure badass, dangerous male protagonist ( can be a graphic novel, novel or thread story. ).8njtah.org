I really enjoy reading about badass, smart and over powered MC's who take their worlds by storm. Looking for new books as I've been through most of the more often recommended ones like:

Prince of thorns, kingkiller, dresden, first law, nightside, forgotten conqueror, Conan,fimbulwinter, gemmel, kings dark tidings, demon cycle, e.t.c.

So i would really appreciate something new, don't even mind self promotion as far it's in line with what am looking for, thanks in advance!

Ps: please no harems, 99% of the time they turn out to be utter nonsense.


** Does it have to be a male protagonist? Because when I think of works I've found on this sub that meet the criteria "badass, smart, OP protagonist takes world by storm," I think Worm and Practical Guide to Evil. Although in both of those cases there's a lengthy ramp-up before the OPness and the taking-the-world-by-storm, they're pretty intense once they reach that point. Both protagonists are vicious and deadly when they come into their own, and they set their aims high.

That said, I'm not sure whether you prefer the protagonist to face challenges proportional to their own skill and power, or whether the guilty pleasure is in watching them steamroll everything. Both legitimate preferences, but the works I mentioned are in the first category. The more powerful the protagonists get, the higher the stakes and the more dangerous their opponents.

** If you're looking for something seriously badass (though perhaps not the strongest re: rationality...) you should check out Feng Shen Ji.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/FengShenJi?from=Manga.FengShenJi]]

It's a chinese graphic novel. The premise is that in a fantasy world in which vaguely Buddhism-inspired gods rule mortals with an iron fist a king dares rise against them. In the first chapter he clashes fiercely with an army of thousands against them out of the doors of his city... and loses. This isn't his story - it's the story of his /son/, who sets on a long and tortuous path to power in order to be able to finally avenge his father and accomplish his dream - that humans might live free from the rule of the cruel, capricious Gods.

It's amazing. Seriously, seriously badass, full of page spreads that will leave you gaping in awe at the spectacle and of incredibly awesome fighting scene. You want a spectacular fantasy epic in graphic novel form with an original setting (at least if you're used to the western-type ones), it doesn't get much better than that.

** The Acts of Caine by Matt Stover. Contains everything you asked for, is very well written and has plenty of rational aspects plus an intriguing premise: â€˜actors' from earth make their living playing roles when they're sent to a parallel realm that is a fantasy world with conventional fantasy â€˜physics' and have their internal experience both recorded and â€˜live-streamed' to viewers. The protagonist could be straight out of most of the series you mentioned except with more depth.

Of the series you mentioned I would place it slightly above Joe Abercrombie's First law, which I would place a tier above all the others mentioned.

Chronically underrated series. Ignore the awful cover!

** Have you read Dune? Paul (and later Leto II) Atreides get super-OP.

The Elenium/Tamuli series by David and Leigh Eddings would probably suit you better than the Belgariad, given your description of the protagonist.

Sandman Slim is pulpy but a lot of fun -- of all the recommendations on my list, I think match what you're looking for the best.

I'm not sure if Earthsea quite matches your description, but it's close enough that I'd feel bad leaving it out.

And yeah, as someone else mentioned, Zelazny's Amber and Bryant's Jhereg series (and the related Khaavren Romances, which are based on the D'Artagnan Romances, but with magic).

The main character is a clone of the greatest hero ever, and while he isn't as strong as his predecessor yet, he's still badass enough to take on Houston's Hero, and fight off a bunch of gang members in a hallway. He can convert heat into kinetic energy, which packs one hell of a wallop, and during the first arc he becomes the talk of Houston.
