[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ftk0q/biweekly_challenge_sherlock_holmes/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Sherlock Holmes". The winner was [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ftk0q/biweekly_challenge_sherlock_holmes/daouktg/?sort=confidence][A Holmes Away From Home]].

This time, the challenge will be *The Gamer*. Your protagonist (or antagonist, or at least one of the characters in your story) has some or all of the abilities of a character from a video game or possibly board game. [[http://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-gamer/ep-1/viewer?title_no=88&episode_no=1][This manhwa]] is where the phrase comes from, though the concept predates it. The most popular take on it is probably [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/][The Games We Play]], a now-complete crossover with RWBY. Feel free to completely ignore those examples and go in your own direction. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, December 28th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Next Time

   :END:
Next time, our challenge will be *The Heist*. TvTropes would call this [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper][a Caper]], but the basic premise is that people are stealing something from somewhere. /Mistborn/ was a fantasy take on the trope, while /Inception/ was a high-concept science fiction version of it. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit; your inspiration in this case should be something like Ocean's 11 or The Italian Job.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/28.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ie7gf/challenge_companion_the_gamer/][is available here.]]

*** Oh my god. That was amazing. I know I probably shouldn't, as a fellow entrant, but I'm upvoting the hell out of you. This was a really good story. I liked the ending conversation between your MC and pilot. It felt very powerful. Good job!

*** A really well done short story, and a good opening to other possible stories in the same universe too. Thank you for writing it.

--------------

(spoilers)

What the Chooser failed to notice though was that the prevalent “protags save the world” stories were appealing mostly to those of the humans who weren't hungry for power to begin with. The power-hungry ones went into politics and ignored the manifestations of the human magic on the world (the RPGs, etc) because before the Awakening those manifestations were simply not any good for climbing up the power ladder and putting your boot on the world's throat.

And now that it has become good enough for them, those types of people will start influencing the “default” narrative patterns much more, and likely make the human-made RPG much more ruthless.

Hell, if Chooser just ended up in China instead of Japan and had her introduction to human story-telling from a xianxia reader, she might've even deciding to support the decision of nuking the whole thing from orbit.

**** If the magic has its own will, and that will is well-expressed in FF7, it won't /let/ the power-hungry humans win. Not permanently, anyway. Maybe it will let them become strong enough to serve as worthy antagonists for good, noble people to struggle against.

***** /disclaimer: this is not intended to be a discouraging piece of criticism, rather a constructive one/

--------------

Maybe it won't if that's the case. The problem is that Chooser's deduction chain:

#+begin_quote
  RPG mechanics existed in RPG games before human magic enforced them on reality. → Human magic must've enforced them in RPG games prior to manifesting in a more global scale. → RPG mechanics must have a will of its own, which can be gauged by analysing which tropes have been the most popular in RPG games.
#+end_quote

seems like an example of faulty Aristotelian reasoning to me. For example, what if human magic /does/ enforce a unique kind of reality warping (the RPG mechanics), but that's as far as its influence goes on its own (i.e. without human agents to further shape it through their personality traits, moral principles, etc)? What if it somehow made human societies create games with RPG elements, but all the rest of the content in RPG games\videogames\etc was decided by basic demand and supply (i.e., in supporting the videogame industry were mainly interested videogame players, and since they were regular citizens, they also liked seeing justice being served in the games they played)?

I agree that Pilot's decision of nuking Earth from orbit ASAP was rushed. But even if they were in a losing battle against the other reality-warping race, going to humans right away and briefing them on the whole alien metaverse was not the right decision either --- at least not until they had a valid proof through their observations that their hypothesis regarding the nature of human magic was the correct one.

So Pilot rushing with his plan of destruction without cunsulting with anybody was the first [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot][WhatAnIdiot]] case in the story, Chooser deciding to haphazardly bring the whole human race into the loop was the second one (admittedly, she was in a zeitnot), and the inter-dimensional counsel not having foreseen a possibility of an enforcer going rogue (like Pilot did) and not preparing any fail-safes against such a scenario was the third one.

*** I didn't expect much from this story especially since I found the beginning pretty weird and difficult to get invested in the characters, but man oh man did it end up being awesome. You didn't just take the Gamer idea in a completely non-traditional direction, but you really managed to get to the heart of what RPG mechanics are really supposed to make us feel and why that's so important to us.

You should repost this on the subreddit after the challenge is over so more people will see it. I don't usually read challenge entries even after the winners are announced, but this was fantastic. I want to see more of this world and what happens next. I personally found this cast of characters to be kind of boring, except for their moral conflict, but I adore high concept adventure and you've got the creativity for it.
