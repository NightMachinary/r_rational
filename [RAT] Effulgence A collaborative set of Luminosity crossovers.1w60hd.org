** I truly don't think I've ever seen anything like this. /Effulgence/ expands on the universe of [[http://luminous.elcenia.com][/Luminosity/]], but it expands in several different directions and crosses over with multiple different other works of fiction and AUs of those works of fiction. But what really does it is that it's a roleplay at the same time -- it's more-or-less written line-by-line by a couple people ... including Alicorn, the original author of /Luminosity/. And at the same time, it's /long/; I'm not going to count them, but there are probably several hundred threads in the index I linked to.

This is bizarre -- good-bizarre, but bizarre nonetheless -- and totally unlike anything I've ever seen before. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I hope to.

*** There's only two authors of Effulgence - me, and Pyth, my kappabeta. Also, linking to [[http://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html][How To Read Effulgence]] rather than the index is preferable. Thanks for the link!

**** Holy cow! You replied! I'm a huge fan. This is pretty cool.

Anyway, I apologize for the problem about what to link to; the index was how someone else (EY, actually, iirc) linked me to it, and since there was a link to the how-to-read right up top... Well, I'll not make excuses, but it's awesome that you're here and you know this sub exists and posted in it and have a reddit account etc etc. Awsome.

***** I don't frequent the sub, but I watch my inbound links for my website like a hawk. Someone clicked your link to Luminosity :)

The index and the how-to do link to each other, but I feel like the how-to link is easy to miss? Maybe I'm wrong about how it looks to someone who doesn't see the page every day.

Excellent! I'm doing some good then. Did I already say I'm a big fan? Yeah, I did. Well, I'm a big fan. Love your work!

It was pretty obvious to me, but maybe I'm not average or something, being primarily an iPad user. I hope I don't cause any problems.

***** I have a bunch of beta readers who get a first look at things I write in exchange for their editorial feedback. I designate them by Greek letter, from alphabeta (the first person to take this job) to upsilonbeta (the most recent). Kappabeta is the kappa'th person to become a beta.

  Because of reddit's ranking algorithm, there's no way for users to bump old posts to the front page. For this reason, reposts are not only allowed but explicitly encouraged!
