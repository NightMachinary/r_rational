I found and lost two stories. Maybe someone here can help me find them?

- First one: it's on Ao3, Overwatch fanfic. Winston is the main character, and the plot centers around Angela Ziegler aka Mercy doing shady things with using Nanotech to take super-accurate brain scans of her team mates in order to be able to revive them.

- Second one: It's an original sci-fi novella, about an arkship which receives a message from Earth that everyone is dead and everything has been destroyed, and that they will transmit the brain scans of /everyone/ to the arkship. The awakened pilot and captain must then scramble to figure out some way to receive the signal, and because the Captain cannot shut up and multiply, they end up crashing the ship and humanity as a whole is lost.


** Not sure about the second, but [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149][here's]] the first one.

****** No, I mean an argument based on reality. Let me show you.

The pilot says that there are two hundred billion lives on the line. Even if she has only a one in a thousand chance of success, making the attempt is equivalent of saving two hundred million lives, and well worth it, right? Especially compared to the mere three thousand people on board.

But the Captain points out that those three thousand people are all that's left of humanity. The Captain isn't just counting the three thousand in their hold; she's also counting all their /descendants/, throughout time. If those three thousand die, there will be no more humanity ever; if they live, you could have a whole lot more than two hundred billion people given time. The pilot sees a one in a thousand chance of saving two hundred billion people; the Captain sees a nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thousand chance of losing the /last/ of humanity.

******** Ah, so if I understand you correctly, you're saying the Captain was wrong because she was the first to attempt to resort to lethal force?

But the Pilot started out with an action that had well over a 50% chance of outright killing three thousand people. That's a lot more lethal than the Captain's knife.

********* I'm partial to siding with pilots because they always hold the life of the ship in their hands.

The argument that the colony cannot survive on its own is very significant: if true, then the balance isn't 200 000 000 × 0.001 vs 3 000 × (1−ε), but 200 000 000 × 1:999 vs loss of all humanity forever.

Is the captain right? Could the colony survive on its own? Or is the pilot right? That's the question.

The captain should have overruled the pilot immediately, as proper captains do, or should have not interfered at all. In killing the pilot after the maneuver was begun, the captain doomed the ship.

Shoot first, or don't shoot at all.

It's extremely significant if true. If true, it completely knocks the legs out from under the Captain's argument.

But is it true?

#+end_quote

She tried, and the Pilot promptly rejected her authority. But yes, proper discipline between the two of them would have increased the probability of a successful outcome. (The ability to seal off an empty fuel tank and then cut a hole in the side would also have allowed them to bypass pretty much the entire problem and save /everyone/).

Both Captain and Pilot had extremely poor problem-solving methodologies, which were made distinctly worse by the interference of each other.

This reasoning is terrible. At least in context of dealing with actual humans you don't feel like actively feuding with.

*********** It was meant in the context of the situation: the pilot was going to attempt to do something which demanded scarce resources. Either shoot her before she does, or let her finish. Shooting her partway through doomed them for sure.

************ I briefly considered you meant it in context; wasn't certain though. I think it was the way that statement had its own line thst made me think you were making a general statement. My apologies.

Also I think I side with the Captain here. We can't know the odds but she IS gambling against humanity's survival. And the argument that the colony can't survive without the resources of Earth (assuming the planet they're going to is sufficiently Earth-like) is bad reasoning. We survived and grew with nothing but ourselves and tools crafted out of sticks. I'm sure the thousands of people with future age tech can manage.

Edit: obviously some will die. But if even a quarter of the remaining populace lives to a reproductive age, we can hope. And actually, in hindsight, if they have enough tech to create new bodies for the 250 billion, there should be enough tech to do that for anyone who's current body is too sickly.

** That second one is familiar and I think it was definitely posted here but by Google Fu is weak this morning. But I did find [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/n2huyv4pale3of2/Starwhisp.pdf?dl=0]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41kfyt/contact_1955_rt/]] which I missed when they were first posted so at least I've got something new to read!
