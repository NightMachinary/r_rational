** Isn't that just like Fate, poking his nose into a nice groundhog day loop. No wonder nobody invites him to parties.

** This seems extremely familiar to me somehow, where have I seen. . .

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Aha!]]

Reading through this story felt like a re-telling of the first three chapters I linked, only with the serial numbers filed off. It hits all the same notes:

1. Protagonist with time-powers arrives back in his home with headache, check.

2. Protagonist effortlessly disarms hidden bodyguard, amazing them and promising to explain it all later, check.

3. Protagonist saves a beautiful woman from certain death using his fore-knowledge, then is surprised by sword-wielding plot twists, check.

Is this the same author or something? These beginnings are practically identical. It's even got the same setting, with wand-wielding wizards and werewolves and such.

  She smelled like soap, and jasmine. I loved that scent. I would never tire of it.

Pretty sure these two are the same people. Same phrasing he used to describe fleur. Madeline has the same job, etc.

**** OP Here. I'll admit Wastelands gave me a lot of inspiration. I'd just finished reading it, and I loved the idea. I knew I had drawn heavily on his ideas but I didn't realize that I was basically plagiarizing him. I looked over what I had written and realized a lot of what I had already written was very similar to the first few chapters of wastelands. I was not aiming to do that. I wanted to use a few of his ideas, but not copy his plot outright. I'm probably going to take this down and heavily re-write it.

***** Cool. I think this is a lot better written if it's any consolation.

***** I look forward to reading the edited version! I did quite enjoy this first chapter, hopefully you don't lose too much momentum re-writing it.

****** I may just keep my work so far and use it as a jumping off point if you will. I haven't decided yet. I'm at work right now and I won't be doing anything with it until I get home later tonight.

*** I had the exact same idea, but couldn't remember which one it was from! Thanks for finding it.

** [Third edit: Sorry, parts which shouldn't be here have now been deleted; thank you both for your guidance and suggestions!]

A little interesting so far, with my main curiosity in regards to the various world-shaking eldritch things alluded to (and hoping that the protagonist wises up in regards to cat-noticing etc.). The occasional broken sentence threw me off my stride when reading, so an extra quality-check pass could help.

**** OP here. Thanks for the advice, but that was another redditor offering me grammar help.

*** Markdown. Click formatting help on the bottom right. Generally it's best just to use the standard formatting. If we wanted "proper paragraph breaks" we could do that in css for all comments. But it's probably easier to read how it is now.

If you want a bigger break, you can use this

#+begin_example
  ---
#+end_example

and get this

--------------

as an example.
