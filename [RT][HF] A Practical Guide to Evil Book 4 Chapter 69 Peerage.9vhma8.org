  Sure, odds were good that every single member of my Peerage -- even Ivah -- would turn on me in a heartbeat if their oaths allowed for it, but for all that there was a simplicity to the proceedings that I enjoyed.
#+end_quote

This just reinforces how vulnerable this whole Drow system is. Take out the oaths and the Drow turn on Cat, which she probably will not survive. And she doesn't think that this critical point is going to fail at the worst possible moment? If not here, then the moment she faces heroic opposition.

#+begin_quote
  I was dealing with other warlords, and even before I'd stolen Crepuscular from Akua's mind
#+end_quote

Speaking of, I feel like there lots of useful skills and knowledge to take from Akua. Magic, history, diplomacy, and so on. All of the blind spots that she's complaining about here that Akua had tutors to instruct her in.

#+begin_quote
  Most of those had come from Great Lotow, reluctantly bending the knee after wandering around the outskirts of Arcadia for a while and finding no way out save the one I'd offered. Slaus and Sagas had been the first to fold, remaining where I'd left them and taking the oaths after a single day. The others trickled into my service over the following week as my sigil settled our other affairs in the city. Nodoi and Vasyl had held out for three and five days, respectively, finding no trouble living off the land but no way back to the Everdark either. By then I'd already bullied Losle and Zarkan into oath-taking after a few demonstrations of how dangerous living in places with only one entrance and exit could be when that space could be closed off by gate. Kanya and Soln had refused the longest, the full seven days, and they'd only changed their minds after Mighty Orelik vanished without a trace.
#+end_quote

Wait, what?

These seven demigods wandered around Arcadia for anywhere from a single day to a single week, couldn't find an easy way out, and so /sold themselves into slavery/?

Huh?

What was even dangerous to them? The cold? The fae? Will spent six months running from the Wild Hunt back in Arcadia back in book one, then left under his own power. Black was using this for fast travel in book 2, before again leaving under his own power. These guys could crush a dozen Wills or Blacks without even noticing. Did the Drow get homesick?

Seriously, we jump from chapter 66 when these guys are vowing that they will never bow down, that they will kill Cat for what she's done... and then 24 hours later they're signing away their autonomy so they can fight and die in Cat's slave army?

I notice that I am confused.

For one, you're making assumptions about what went down with Orelik, when the sum total we know about it is one throwaway line.

For another, Mighty were surrendering well before that Orelik vanished. Slaus and Sagas gave in within a single day, deciding to sign away their eternal lives to Cat's slave army. Note that theire immediate reaction to being transported to Arcadia by an unknown power wasn't fear or dread, but a resounding "fuck you".

Those permanent gates that William used were in the Waning Woods, which are supposed to be uniquely connected to the fae. They form Callow's southern border and are apparently the cause of some bizarre weather patterns:

'The lands between Helike and Atalante were known for the occasional bouts of week-long rain and storms, blown south from the Waning Woods and the madness that passed for nature over there. The Fae toyed with the winds and the sky the way men did with their clothes, and the farms beneath them paid the price.'

-Prologue Book 3.

“There must be several gates, then, spread across the Waning Woods,” Masego replied, tone enthusiastic. “Few of them have the ability to actually cross from Arcadia into Creation.”

That place sucks, it's about to be overrun with dwarves, and it means joining Cat's slave army where they're constantly under the threat of death and are about to fight their way to Sve Noc herself. Arcadia, on the other hand, is full of Fae to harvest, doesn't have dwarves or Dead Kings, and lets them keep their autonomy.

I never thought of this but you're right, why wouldn't they use Arcadia to travel to another part of Calernia and harvest Night without having to go through the Kingdom of the Dead, the Golden Bloom or the Chain of Hunger? Adding to the Night is a sacred task after all.

In reality of course they'd be killed by heroes in short order. Ancient monsters escaped from their underground realm feasting on innocents? That's one strong story especially if the Heavenly Light is as effective as I think it will be against the Night. But they wouldn't know that and even if they did they'd probably be arrogant enough to try it anyway.

I think this has to do with culture shock. The vast majority of Drow have never left the Underdark. The outside is where the /weak/ go. They couldn't "find a way out" because they have have no frame of reference to. Additionally these are not people who /learn/ things, they /take secrets/. You've expecting them to act like scientific-rational!Drow, but harvesting Night is the be-all-end-all of society and it is extremely anti-intellectual. To misquote the philosopher Homer "[Night], the solution to and cause of all of life's problems".

You're totally misunderstanding how the Night works. Growing the Night simply means adding more knowledge/experience to it, and you can do this by fighting just like everyone else. But to grow significantly stronger quickly you have to actually take the Night, and that's possible only if the opponent has Nights to take.

************ I'm going to need a source on... literally all of that.

Here, I'll run you through the Night as it was explained to us.

Here's literally the first conversation we have on the night, and the only explicit discussion on the interactions between Night and non-Drow:

#+begin_quote
  “Killing cattle,” I said. “Taking it. What does it do for you?”

  “The Night grows,” Ivah smiled. “To do such sacred act would redeem any disgrace.”

  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

  I sucked at my lip.

  “Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

  The drow paled.

  “Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

  “It does, doesn't it,” I said. “The necromancy that keeps its army walking, you can claim it for the Night.”

  “I say no more,” Ivah insisted. “It sees all. It hears all.”
#+end_quote

With me so far? Killing non-Drow grows the Night. They can (almost certainly) take the necromancy of undead and convert that to Night.

Not convinced? How about some practical examples. When we met Ivah and its crew, they'd been sent out of the Everdark for one last opportunity to redeem themselves - by harvesting Night from non-Drow

Or we can jump to the very origin of Night. Sve Noc turned the Twilight Sages into the first of the Night. The Night is very explicitly something that can be added to by converting the power of beings without Night ino Night.

Yes, but it also doesn't apply here?

A 'Race to the Bottom' implies states compete with each other by cutting taxes / business lowering prices /wahteer in order to attract people towards them, but at the cost of lowering living standards/product quality/working conditions/etc. and making everyone worse off.

Even if you take the logic of the situation at face value this isn't a race to the bottom, because this isn't a competition trying to attract individuals with positive qualities. This is Cat trying to enslave 7 demigods by dropping them in the wilderness, and then a day later they go "fiiine, I'll sign whatever you want" without actually looking around for a way out.

How do you relate the 'race to the bottom' with the drow only looking around for a day before deciding that escape is impossible and they want to sign onto be Cat's slaves?

This is a function of their power, not their worth. Mighty aren't cattle either, but they can be harvested just fine. If there's some exception to the fae for night purposes, then it's not explained or hinted at anywhere in the text.

And it's still not an issue? Do you think the Drow said "Oh no, even after I casually kill fae, I can't harvest Night - I'd better sell myself into eternal slavery where I can't harvest Night freely anyway".

The Duke of Violent Squalls was called a lesser god. Masego told Cat that if he crossed into Creation in his full power he could quite possibly conquer Callow single handed. Every fae noble killed by the Woe and the Legions was either in Creation (and had surrendered most of their power to cross the boundary) or fighting a Named with a strong narrative advantage in Arcadia, where stories are much more important than anything else.

The Mighty, for all their strengths, are not Named. They lack the advantages that come with a Name. They lack narrative weight, unnatural instincts and the way powerful Named warp the people and the world around them. Against fae their only tool would be the Night, which is formidable, but the fae would be able to wield their full power against them within Arcadia.

The Mighty are behind the times on the current situation of greater Calernia, owing to their long, long isolation, but narratives and stories are quite literally a concept older than Creation itself, as is Arcadia. the physics engine of the universe is hardly some great secret, and seems exactly like the sort of knowledge that would still be floating around in the Night as an /actual/ secret.

Plus, Cat is currently checking a lot of story boxes that fall into Classic Evil, with monologues and death traps she walked away from and truce-breaking and ultimatums about joining her and obvious failure points and so on. By all rights, the story should be about to punish her for that

Fair enough, I phrased that badly. My point was that, not being Named, narrative doesn't apply to their conflicts. Therefore they have no need to develop the skills and knowledge of stories that Black and Catherine have. It's long been established that narrative effects only apply to Named and on the scale of nations across centuries.

'Arcadia was, in a lot of ways, rawer than Creation proper. In Creation stories bound only the Named, but in Arcadia everything was a story. It was why everything was so changeable. I was standing in front of an enemy clearly winning against me, at his mercy, and had just prompted him to gloat and reveal his plans. So he had. Even if he didn't want to.' -Chapter 7 Elaboration.

  Again, these guys a threat to the faerie queen. A single guy explicitly called out as their lessor has capabilities far above anything the Duke of Violent Squalls demonstrated, going by their respective fights. This whole plan came about because Cat, Queen of Air and Darkness, couldn't take these guys in a fight. Are you telling me some random fae at the edge of Winter took one of them in a fight offscreen
#+end_quote

They're a threat to Cat after she's gotten sloppy and arrogant, assuming that nothing in the Everdark can threaten her, not to mention we've never seen her use the full power of her mantle. She always uses her power as shallowly as possible to avoid the influence of Winter overtaking her rational thought. Plus her understanding of her own power is fairly poor, whereas the fae have been wielding their mantles since before Creation existed. The difference in skill level is vast.

Do you mean the one back in Chapter 50? If so, first of all she was fairly low ranking. Second, it's rather unclear how much power the Hunt has in Creation. Being part of the Hunt and sworn to a semi-mortal queen probably does allow them to keep more of their power than if they stepped through on their own but still. Masego noted back in Interlude: Heretics that the Wild Hunt are somehow different from other fae:

'He could be picking at the minds of the Wild Hunt to understand what set them apart from the other fae'

Third, and most importantly, the Hunt are sworn to Catherine's service. That almost certainly restricts how they can use their mantles against her.

Like, are you suggesting that within 24 hours they ran into fae that made them do a 180 and agree to a life of slavery in an army heading towards Sve Noc?

When we met these guys they represented perhaps the strongest force we'd seen in a room for all of Guide. If there were things roaming around Arcadia that could threaten them, then Cat wouldn't be considering using Arcadia to shuttle armies around.

Something utterly flipping the attitudes of the sigil-holders around in 24 hours and convincing them to put themselves in what's frankly a pretty situation seems at odds to me with everything that was built up about both them and Arcadia.

(Hi again-we talked last chapter)

This quote helps explain some of the disagreement we were having. I don't believe that we have seen anything like the capacity for either of these two characters. Cat instigated the story of a long-lost daughter killing her father. She manipulated the fight by literally publishing propaganda and publicizing the new narrative. Her standing wrt combat is still firmly below the King of Winter, and arguably Larat as well. Her own power has been grossly misused - the “principle alienation” stops her from using the power freely. She's more of a bucket for Winter's power than a conduit.

This translates to a lot of uncertainty in the “power rankings” but Guideverse has been very explicit about how a>b>c logic fails; success in combat is not a transitive property. When the drow are in their element they have some neat cantrips that interfere with Cat. But on the home turf of the Fae there's no reason to over-hype the low-versatility of Night users.

#+end_quote

"Low-versatility of Night users". We're talking abut the /same/ Night users, right? Urulan, on his own, in the space of about 2 minutes, pulled out a list of powers that looks something like this:

Dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode.

That's more powers than we've seen from just about any other character. And there were 7 of these guys, all of whom had more Night (and thus more Secrets) than Mighty Urulan.

And you say "neat cantrips that interfere with Cat", like the net outcome of Cat having super-healing, and the Drow being able to slighty interfere with said super healing, was somehow a net positive for the Drow. No. Take that out of the equation and the fight would have been over after the opening exchange. Cat only won because Urulan thought he'd killed her - and if she'd been a regular human, or a regular /fae/, he would have.

Right, but the measuring stick in this instance is not "The former Queen of Summer" or "Cat at her theoretical maximum in a hundred years". What we're looking at is what could have caused the Drow to flip around and decide that, actually, we'd like to sign away our free will, have your power constantly be threatening us with death, and fight and die for your causes against Sve Noc and then outside in service of the "Liesse accords".

So what threatened them? It wasn't a Duke/Duchess, we've seen the powers on display there. And there's not much above that. Is there some leviathan in Arcadia that has never been hinted at, who's sole purpose is to intimidate Drow demigods who wind up in Arcadia off-screen?

If this is the case, it's a little better, but very poorly communicated. And it also doesn't make much difference - the Drow still have no upside to signing up with Cat.

Even with that she can beat one of the sigil-holder of Lotow. The other sigil holder cannot be stronger by too much otherwise they would already have taken over the weaker sigils. This means any prince/princess significantly outclasses the sigil-holder.

As for random fae taking them down, we've been shown time and time again that a large number of mooks can overpower a champion. The most recent example is just 2 chapters ago, and Arcadia has plenty of fae nobles in addition to mooks.

We've got a good idea of the power level associated with a Duchy, with the Duke of Violent Squalls and our very own (former) Duchess of Moonless Nights, and it seems pretty clear that any one of the seven Mighty could have won such a fight alone. And if they'd run into such a fae, well, that's their ride home. That's how Black and Warlock got in and out of Arcadia back in book 2.

Hell, why did they even want to go back to the Everdark? That place sucks, it's about to be overrun with dwarves, and it means joining Cat's slave army and fighting their way to Sve Noc herself.

You built a lot of arguments around a faulty understanding of what is in the text.

If the Night is as you interpret then there is literally nothing that could have stopped the Drow and their place as a backwater ruin dismissed by all and cowering from the greater world makes absolutely no sense.

But if the Drow are as we interpret their position makes perfect sense.

They can /harvest/ Night from each other to grow their own personal power, or "grow the Night" by preying on outsiders. The difference is not elaborated on but the text is clear that there /is/ a difference. I speculate that "growing the Night" empowers either Sve Noc itself or all Drow who hold Night, but by the tiniest fraction.

Their culture is built exclusively around the pursuit of personal power, yet exile to "grow the night" via surface raids is a suicide mission reserved for failures and outcasts while the more successful a Drow is the closer they stay to central Drow territory. Again, this makes no sense with your interpretation of the Night mechanics but perfect sense with our interpretation.

All good haha. Happens to the best of us.

#+begin_quote
  They can harvest Night from each other to grow their own personal power, or "grow the Night" by preying on outsiders. The difference is not elaborated on but the text is clear that there is a difference. I speculate that "growing the Night" empowers either Sve Noc itself or all Drow who hold Night, but by the tiniest fraction.
#+end_quote

The problem with this argument is the Ivah conodrum. Ivah was sent out of the Gloom to gain night by killing non-Drow, with the expectation that it would die, but the possibility of gaining Night.

If you want a quote, have this:

#+begin_quote
  “I return bereft of Night, failing the terms of my exile.”
#+end_quote

Which is to say, it's possible to get Night outside the Everdark, and have that Night added to your personal power.

This makes sense, because the nature of the Night is that it's /always/ been something that was stolen and converted. The first of the Night was taken from the Twilight Sages. We had an explicit conversation as to how the Drow can steal the necromantic magic of the undead.

#+begin_quote
  Again, this makes no sense with your interpretation of the Night mechanics but perfect sense with our interpretation.
#+end_quote

The issue with your interpretation is that it's not supported by any of the explanation of Night we've received, or any of the examples we've seen.

I agree that it means we need a stronger explanation of why Drow haven't left the Everdark... but we kind of need that anyway?

Your interpretation still incentivizes Sve/whoever benefits from "growing the Night" to send out powerful Drow to grow the Night.

#+begin_quote
  This just comes down to a misinterpretation. Perhaps the author should have been more clear or should reword things.
#+end_quote

I thought it was pretty clear, but yeah, obviously there's some contention around the issue.

#+end_quote

Or, Ivah was sent out of the Gloom to grow the collective Night/Sve Noc's stores of Night, with the expectation that it would die but the possibility of growing the Night first.

After all, if the /expectation/ is that Ivah will die then how can Ivah bring Night to the Drow? It is essentially throwing lives away on the slim chance that the group not only succeeds but chooses to return at the exact right time. They have to somehow kill enough to gain Night worth bring back but know when to cut their losses and return in time to avoid dying and leaving all that Night on the surface. The odds of this paying off for the drow/Sve are ridiculous.

Under my interpretation, the Night is grown regardless of whether or not Ivah's party manages to return. If they kill seven humans or whatever before being brought down they have still grown the night. The odds of this paying off for the drow/Sve are incredibly high.

He does not say "I forgot to pick up some Night from the store." He says "I return bereft of night." While yes, this can totally be interpreted as "I did not gain any Night." It can also mean "I return as the same status I was." Remember that Night determines rank, so opening with how much Night you have makes sense. "Failing the terms of my exile" is an even broader statement that can easily be seen as saying he failed to grow the Night under my interpretation.

I think this is increasingly coming down to Ivah's ass-about manner of speech.

Nah, it makes perfect sense. The more powerful a drow is, the less they should be sent to the surface. If a drow dies on the surface it's body can easily become unrecoverable. The night is then either lost or removed from circulation, weakening all drow and Sve Noc itself. So you send the worst failures and fuckups who will hopefully rack up a few kills.

************ This requires a large twisting of all the facts involved, and for there to be a double meanings that were hugely glossed over.

Remember we got a definition where "to grow the night" included: learning how to forge weapons, harvest from non-Drow, and steal the necromancy of the undead.

It doesn't make sense for one of these to increase the individuals personal power, and the others to... interact with some other mechanism that has never been mentioned or hinted at?

Tbf mate, you've made your own loaded statements. If you want to get upset at me for making them, avoid doing it yourself.

But the big issue with your interpretation is that it requires a whole lot of additional detail to be added to the text that was never mentioned. Like a weird back channel were the Night grows, but the individuals who grow it don't actually get more Night. Or for Ivah's exile to have a whole set of additional clauses that were never brought up.

#+begin_quote
  Consistent with the other interpretation.
#+end_quote

Not really? If you're suggesting that one method grows an individual's power, and the other does not grow their power, but instead "grows the Night" in some vauge, nebulous way that's completely undefined and unexplained, and you think these two things are the /same/ then I don't know what to tell you.

#+begin_quote
  Where was this said?
#+end_quote

I've literally quoted this above.

But whatever. It's in the same conversation. Ivah was talking about harvesting the Night, then Cat asked about alternate ways to increase power, first inquiring as to advancing their own skills would work, and second whether killing non-Drow would work similarly to killing Drow.

If there was a topic change, it was not signaled in any way. The only evidence is that the word "grow" was used, which isn't evidence at all.

"Growing" the night implies, believe it or not, increasing the Night. Which implies that after they kill non-Drow cattle, there is more Night. So a Drow killing non-Drow gets them more Night, unless there's a pretty huge addendum to be added on here that there's no textual evidence for.

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't supposed to be, buddy.
#+end_quote

Then what was the point? I'm going to be honest here, I don't find the failures of your memory to be hugely relevant.

Seriously, Cat froze a city once, and that was before ascending. The higher ranked Fae routinely pulped mountains and torched armies. The Mighty? The dwarves hunt them with ballistae ffs.

I talked about an execption for the King and Queen, yes, and you can lump Sulia in there too if you want. But I find it unlikely that they're prowling around waiting for an opportunity to do Cat a solid.

And if you jump down a tier, you get to the Dukes. We saw Cat with the full power of a Duchess for a while, and it was markedly less impressive than Urulan on his own.

But what's that? Cat wasn't using her power optimally? Well, let's look at the Duke of Violent Squalls, who Cat fought in an almost straight fight in Arcadia, at the fullness of his power. Her story manipulations amounted to this:

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't handing me the victory in a handbasket -- the fake prophecy hadn't been well-crafted enough for that -- but I'd touched the story just enough I could twist it. That there was a chance for me to win.
#+end_quote

Which is to say that Cat's victory was by no means assured, and it came down to a contest of skill and power, which Cat then won. Cat, who was still just the squire with two aspects to her name.

Any one of these guys is so much more powerful than what Cat was then that it's not even funny. And there were seven of them. See where I'm going with this? The locals aren't a threat, they're food.

#+begin_quote
  The Mighty? The dwarves hunt them with ballistae ffs.
#+end_quote

These were the far, far outskirts of the Everdark and have little to no power. Somehow I think the Dwarves will need a different tactic when they start fighting Drow that are actually dangerous. Much like Cat did.

And again, we've seen a whole lot of the far. Point to something out of the top royalty that's impressive when compared to the Mighty Urulan fight scene.

And the we have to consider what it was that broke the Drow. Even if we assume that they're "just" somewhat comparable to a Duke... they're still near the top of the Arcadia food chain?
