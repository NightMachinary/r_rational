** An excellent parable, and a good thing to post here.

That said... I'm not sure what the appropriate tag would be!

- =[RT]= doesn't seem quite right to me, since the setting and characters are clearly designed to convey a particular message rather than interact realistically. That might be more the style though, and it's not wrong.

- It has the flavor of a rationalist story, but by instruction rather than by example. What does that make it?

- Is it SF? Fantasy? A genre deconstruction (of reality?)?

Discuss!

Personally I'd go for [DC] and [EDU]. It may not be strictly deconstructive but it has the same feeling of a story used to point out the flaws in something. In this case the something is our world rather than a story world. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

In any case it is a great story I fully support placing it on here.

***** Assuming that it was distributed uniformly across the population, sure. But life extension won't be like that - it's going to come to the rich first, and probably in fits and starts as we eat away at the long tail. We're not going to conquer death in an afternoon, and not in a few decades either. Given that, there's no reason that we can't work on multiple problems simultaneously - the elimination of death being one of those.

****** Well, we're both making unwarranted assumptions. I'm assuming worst-case because I'm trying to make a cautionary point, you're assuming best case because you want to move ahead with research. Yes, conquering /all/ forms of death up to and including pianos falling on heads isn't going to happen anytime soon, but a general anagathic would trigger 95% of the economic issues associated with my doomsday fear, and we have no idea what that might look like.

Also, many of the issues don't need the technology to be /available/, they just need it to be /plausible/. Take pensions, for example. As soon as a working anagathic within a decade or two starts to look as if it has any chance of happening, annuity rates go to zero everywhere, and stay there forever.

You might think implementing a UBI or similar scheme should be a trivial problem compared to conquering death. You might be right. You might think the same about healthcare provision, but look at the US. You might think the same about housing, but look at the UK. Never underestimate how determinedly elites - elites who by that time may have no reliance on the general population either economically or militarily - can do the wrong thing when they aren't the ones suffering consequences.

I also think you're severely underestimating the likely resistance to a state veto on reproduction. Even the Chinese had a tough time with that; how do you think the Catholics are going to react?

******* Even if we had an antiageing drug right now wouldn't it take around a century just to test it? And ageing, and the human body in general, is so poorly understood that I highly doubt that any treatment will be available for at least another century, which means at least two hundred years until it's distributed to even just the rich people. The human population is already set to plateau at around 2050, and might even decrease after that as standards of living improve in India and China. Higher standards of living are probably more likely to put a strain on the environment than population growth. Not to mention agricultural problems related to climate change, scarcity of fresh water, overfishing, etc. which might result in famines and many millions of people dying before then and possible societal collapse. So I think the risk posed by getting an antiageing drug too soon is relatively low.

******* That helps too, but if people have baby fever then it's likely to be more of a problem. Contraceptives can be evaded.

We can't eliminate the issue without going a bit crazy but it'd be good if wanting a baby was voluntary. Would reduce the pregnancy rate.

From googling it might not be hormonal. Whatever. There may be some genetic cure instead. Something like that would be good so that women could choose when they wanted a baby based on their intellect more easily.

*** No, you are not the only one, because population growth doom fears are a perennial fallacy dating back ages. That part is almost certainly just wrong, because curing old age instantly kills two of the major factors motivating people to have kids (legacy, someone to keep things going in your old age)\\
And heck, thanks to the wonders of math, even given true "My mind is backed up onto the cloud, my home harddrive daily, and weekly onto memory diamondstored in the repurposed yucca mountain dig" immortality every couple could have one kid and that would still be fine (Generation sizes halving: End result slightly less than a doubling of population over infinite time)

Old farts hanging on to all the wealth and all the power for ever? Uhm. Ever so slightly more of a problem. Already a problem even with them dying on their own.

***** It's very unlikely to be a problem, based on all we know of factors effecting birthrates.

People dying of old age is 100% certainly a problem. A mortal one. For everyone that do not manage to get killed by something else. Thus, this is not a difficult question. It's a problem worth paying some attention to /after/ old age is no longer a concern. At which point society will suddenly have a vast increase in the available labor force to throw at all problems - including in this case, "how to increasing the carrying capacity of planet earth". And there a bunch of obvious attack vectors on that problem. It's not, however anywhere near the top of the list of issues to fix because it will almost certainly just not arise.

"The Koch's brothers sticking around forever" is much higher on the list of problems to address.

*** Past history suggests strongly that people really do adapt to incentives where expectation of health is concerned; higher success rates of raising children to adulthood takes only about a generation to result in lower attempt rates. This gives good reason to be optimistic that long-term population control is a comparatively easy problem.

Wealth distribution, on the other hand, it says nothing about.

**** Lower attempt rates only slow the problem. Even if success were 100% and people only tried to raise 1 child apiece - pure replacement - population would still grow at 1 generation per generation if there were no offsetting deaths. Plus, we have no idea how human psychology would respond to vastly lengthened fertility windows. We know about "empty nest syndrome". What if it turns out that many people will naturally have kids every 20 years or so if given the opportunity?

***** I don't know what would happen, but as mentioned, past experiences suggest that society adapts fairly quickly to new norms about lifespan. If the birthrate dropped to a tiny fraction of what it currently is, that would mitigate the problem to something very manageable, where we could construct habitat (in space, in arcologies, maybe just seasteading) fast enough to keep up with demand.

Also, remember that a century ago, the term 'teenager' didn't exist, because it wasn't useful. If people live longer, it's very likely that they will live with family longer, and we'll have some new term for not-quite-adults at a higher age.
