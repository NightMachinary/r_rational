** .... I'm a bit confused

Why is sohu there before they fall in love?

#+begin_quote
  Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
#+end_quote

.... the comet king had children before falling in love and his "best" child came form a different mother then the one he loved most?

This isn't ending well is it?

*** Yeah - he fathered 4 children, then stopped when he learned the prophecy.

**** I meant robin isn't ending well; which well isn't saying much, archer and everything, but I think her "jealousy unyielding as the grave" with how the comet kings other children turn out may be the messy end of their relationship.

I kinda assumed that sohu was robins dauther, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all.

*** He had all four of his children more or less at once, learned of the prophecy and had no more. All of that was before he'd even met Robin.

I think you must have missed some chapter. We already know the circumstances in which he fathered his four children, and we know that love had nothing to do with it.

*** The Comet King just said in the chapter that it will take more than a generation before he can take down Hell. Considering how rare it is for anyone to go to heaven, then all Thamiel needs to do is to simply wait and he'll get Robin sooner or later.

The question is whether or not the Comet King uses Robin as a pawn in his plan as a Trojan horse in Hell somehow.

***** Thamiel explicitly states so in the Broadcast, and if we knew anything to the contrary than Aaron would have said so in his account of watching it.

That's all he says, which means anywhere between "most people go to hell" and "not that many people go to hell" is applicable.

** I'm picking up on a bit of a theme here: rational utilitarians violating their principles because of love.

First the Comet King threatening to tear down the world to avenge Sohu; then Aaron selling out the world for Ana despite being genre-savvy enough to know it's wrong (although nothing seems to have come of that); and now Robin and the Comet King's romance despite them both knowing it's a bad idea.

Unlike the other two, though, this one actually bites them in the arse.

** Having never read the series, I'm confused by the title. Is it supposed to be the opposite of a song? Like antimatter neutralizing matter and both disappearing, so therefore the unsong is something that neutralizes a song? Or is there a typo in the title and it should actually be "Unsung", as in, something that has never been sung before?

*** Not a typo. The name's explained in chapters 2 and 5. It's not an exhaustive explanation, but it's not like such things exist in this universe.

And before you point it out, 'Untied States' isn't a typo either.
