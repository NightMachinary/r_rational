** Hey, this is my fic! Thanks for promoting it! I I didn't explicitly set out to write Hachiman as a rationalist for this fic, so I agree that it doesn't deserve the RF tag, but I'm happy that you thought enough of it to say something about it.

** It'd be a big stretch to call this rational, so while I son't Neccesarily think highly of that in general tagging this story with the munchkinry tag and avoiding the RT tag was the right choicr ; certainly, it isn't more rational than OreGairu proper, and both that work and this rely heavily on story elements - to say nothing of MHA. Still, considering Practical Guide is posted here despite not being remotely rational anymore, it fits well enough, and I can't say I didn't highly enjoy this fic. Even as the work isn't rational, Hikigaya Hachiman is here believably, genuinely smart, and at the same time very much a real person. Whether it's from personal experience or artistic skill letting them copy the voices of canon when appropriate, the people here act, like, well, people, not plot devices. I can't say there's no contrivances, but it's done rather well and doesn't detract from the story being told in any serious way.

Seconding this rec, as it were, just with the added notice that the lack of RT in the title is for reason.

**** It's frankly amazing to me that PGtE still gets so much love here when it's neither rational nor well-written. I was interested in the premise at first, slogged through the first 25 or so chapters before giving it up. Seems like a mediocre high fantasy story that kind of got grandfathered into this sub.

***** PGtE is rational mostly in the same way /Pact/ is, in that it turns the genre-savviness of the average fantasy story up to eleven. It notably lacks scenes where the main characters make the /first or second/ mistake that would be dramatic in any other stories, and instead has them plotting around plots. I think it also counts in the worldbuilding department (actual maps and consideration of terrain and travel time!) as well as the "creative application of their resources" criteria. There's a scene in the second book where the main character uses her ability to pilot the undead as a way to create undead goat suicide bombers, and that comes up as a Chekhov's gun at the very end of the third book, in a way I won't spoil.

I won't call it mainstream rational fiction - its use of subjectiveness and tropes probably puts it closer to UNSONG than to HPMOR - but I do think it's deserving of being posted here, especially if people enjoy it.

** I couldn't get past the first few chapters because of the blatant signs of wish fulfillment coming in. This hachiman feels more like a self insert rather than a true representation of hachiman. I felt like this hachiman is rather too much in the limelight because my opinion of hachiman is that hes suppose to be the unimportant unassuming snarky side character that rational deconstructs everything around him. I am also a little biased because my favorite fic of all time is a danmachi/hachiman crossover called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/][My trans dimensional overpowered protaganist.]] and I am quite unfairly comparinng the both of them.

He even explicitly says he tried to insert himself into (what he thinks is) Danmachi's plot as a mentor character, which is hardly unimportant, and succeeds beyond his wildest imagination.

** The main thing that winds me up about this fic is how inconistent all of the power intraction are. Like after geting the ooze quirk he can use 2 quirks at the same time, the ooze quirk and a diffrent quirk. but the story just ignores this and lets him use any 2 quirks. The fact that OfA works diffrently to how it dose in the manga and even in this fic when All might is useing it. Other than that it is ok i guess but that kinda stuff ruins the story for me.

He starts of with one Quirk at a time. Useing the Ooze exploit he can now use another quirk, so now he can use two quirks at a time. If what you are suggesting is correct then he should be useing Three quirks (Ooze + two others) and should have said that is "but that was two more quirks than I was able to use at once before."

Now I think about it, it is probaly just suposed to work like you said and the author just forgot that he was useing Ooze as well as the other two quirks.

*** I have to strike a balance writing the fic. If I go too in-depth into the mechanics of how everything works, the story suffers; on the other hand if I don't explain enough then it'll bother people like you and me.

Uraraka's quirk is particularly problematic because her 'zero gravity' abilities can reduce the velocity of falling objects to zero (as seen when she saves Izuku from falling) can let her quickly accelerate extremely massive objects (as seen when she swings a support pillar like a baseball bat) and can also negate the impact of gravitational forces on objects (when she throws a softball into space.)

Also, she has a weight limit, a quasi-time limit, and a effect that could be diminished. If I recall correctly, I arrived at the 10-15% number by diminishing the quirk along each axis by the cube root of 108 - but explaining all of that in story would have been incredibly tedious, so I didn't. I hope that explains how that happened!

Some quotes

#+begin_quote
  During the Ball Throw, the standout was obviously Uraraka, who was much nicer about letting me copy her quirk than Todoroki had been. Although she called it Zero Gravity, it didn't quite nullify gravity precisely, it just made objects float. The precise mechanism of how it worked was a little strange to me - if I understood as much science as Yaoyorozu then I might have been able to explain it - but the upshot was that where Uraraka could float up to three tons, I could handle a max of three hundred kilos, and where Uraraka could make things actually float, I could make them about 10-15% lighter. Before I could see how useful that would actually be, though, there was another big surprise: Midoriya.

  Focusing on the ball, I channeled Uraraka's Zero Gravity quirk into it, wound up, and threw the ball as hard as my miniscule piece of Stockpile could send it. I didn't quite crack the sound barrier like Midoriya had, but it probably wasn't that far off, and with Uraraka's Float active I still managed to eke out a win over his throw - and, by extension, Bakugo's.
#+end_quote

So 10-15% is mentioned immediately after copying the power without mentioning stockpile in connection with that 10-15%. Soon after, stockpile is mentioned as 'miniscule' (although which stockpile is ambiguous, but I think it might refer to the gravity stockpile, which would make sense to be miniscule since he just copied that power).

  the most useful power I had copied that day wasn't All Might's

  the most useful power I had in my entire collection of 108 skills... was the one that I had gotten from that slimy pile of ooze
#+end_quote

copyOfOoze allows for 2 quirks to be used at once, so roughly a doubling of power.

However, if copyOfAllMight were a 'permanent passive buff' then in order for 'copying of floating objects' to 'reduce weight by 10%' that would require that copyOfAllMight to have the effect of 10x.

***** The other option is that objects are simply lifted by a maximum force of their weight times x, and hachiman's weakened x turns out to equal 15 %. It's not complicated mathematically. It also makes sense for the maximum force to be higher than the weight of the object, as otherwise making it rise is not possible.

***** Also consider if the limiter is on force, acceleration, mass or a combination of the three. The equivalence principle in general relativity would normally suggest acceleration, if the power works based on gravity, but then there must be a limit on the force as well (a limit on the force would be equivalent to a limit on the mass in this case).
