#+end_quote

Basically at the end of the chapter, Red thinks someone sabotaged the experiment. Daniel is the obvious subject, but he's also suspicious of Rei who may have arranged for Tetsuo to replace Daniel as a confederate of hers.

Rei may have sabotaged the experiment to see how the people involved react in order to get more information on their connections to Sabrina. Simply put, if people know their first thoughts will get spread out to the other minds when they merge with the exeggcute, then they might be unintentionally thinking of their secrets when they first merge with the exeggcute in future experiments.

If anyone drops out of the experiment after that session, then it's a potential clue.

But how would Rei know beforehand that merging would broadcast a thought into everyone? I mean, it's not implausible, but it seems like many things could go wrong with that plan.

Also, cookies? It seems like a very random thing to be thinking while trying to merge with a seed. I guess that is evidence that whoever did the broadcasting was purposeful.

I guess my main issue is that they were supposedly doing something new and untested, and thus I have a hard time imagining that someone could have micromanaged the environment in order to get specific results. (Unless they already knew what would happen and were feigning ignorance, but that hypothesis seems way too complex to consider.)

***** I don't think Rei planned it ahead of time, but rather was the first one to merge and quickly came up with the idea of pushing a thought into other people's mind. Cookies was an innocuous thought with minimal issue if anything went wrong.

Also I'm not saying that I think Rei may have sabotaged the experiment, but rather that I think Red is suspicious of Rei doing so. He's both worried about his secrets leaking and worried about someone sabotaging his proposed experiment, either Daniel or Rei.

**** I was confused at the ending but I think I gained a better understanding after reading your explanation, so thanks for that, first.

But I don't think, if someone did sabotage the experiment on purpose, that it was Rei who did so. This kind of ploy is rather blunt and obvious, and she risked drawing Tetsuo's suspicion for what seems to be very little gain. If Tetsuo didn't want to risk any secrets in his head from being leaked out, he could just call off the experiment or bow out of it for fairly justifiable reasons, being the Gym Second. Even if he did participate in the experiment a second time with no significant changes to its process, he's guaranteed to get suspicious if the same event happened again and would immediately know someone's digging for secrets about Sabrina, if that's what Rei tried to fish for. Finally, I don't think Red would be so nervous if he suspects it was Rei trying to fish for info about Sabrina, because he already knew about that.

I think it's more likely Tetsuo was testing the waters instead. Of course I don't know for sure the details of what exactly he knew beforehand, but it would explain Red's sudden nervousness about having a certain someone trying to see what secrets he's holding (Rei's "curiosity" about Sabrina), and anyone else trying to bow out would be a bit more suspicious if Tetsuo's the one who revised the experiment and claimed that it's safer now.

But seriously great chapter, as our esteemed author is a therapist the deep psych delves always have a ton of detail and work that goes into the internal growth that is generally underspecified in other stories.

**** Haha, well I was exaggerating for comedic effect but I do think a lot of people's experiences with therapy or medication are "i might be doing better, its hard to say" and thats probably the best they can aspire to. Thats not an aspersion at the discipline at all, just the nature of mental health - I imagine we could start linking meta-analyses all day to debate it, but probably not the venue!

I haven't tried focusing in a formal setting though (it has a lot of parallels to some meditation practices that I have done), so that is good to know that it can be unusually quick-acting! Def something to add to the toolbox.

Personally I think it should be an aspersion against those who practice the discipline in general :) In the fun game of "what profession hates incompetent others in the same profession most," I think therapists are probably top 5 at least. It's gotten to the point where I actually add a bunch of caveats whenever I recommend anyone start therapy or go to a psychiatrists, and am thinking of writing up a guide for how to spot a bad therapist.

As for how this will impact Red, it seems like you are trying to get to an end-game where he has tulpas of his own (I'm guessing one for battling and another for socializing?). Pretty suspicious this came out just after Mewtwo explaining the uses of having multiple mental states. hmmmmm

If anything, those scenes in this work are the /most/ heavily dramatized and streamlined to fit them into the narrative, and the seriousness with which Red approaches his issues with himself carries very smoothly from his analytical attitude toward everything else.

Perhaps unlike many other readers, I didn't start reading this story because I was a part of the rationalist subreddit many of these rationalist fanfictions seem to come from. Rather, I was looking for good Pokemon fanfiction and this happened to be one of the best I could find. I enjoy the story for what it is, and while I admit I'm not super interested in the aspects of the story where Pokemon just don't really come up at all such as Red's therapy sessions, I wouldn't go so far as to say they're unnecessary or bad. They serve as an important look into the psychological state of the protagonists and serves to help us understand how they are growing as people over time. Obviously I'd rather read about Red having a traditional Pokemon related adventure, but saying that the exploration of his psyche is unneeded or even bad at all would be missing the point.

*** I have to agree. This fanfic has been slowly losing me since the Zapdos arc.

The therapy sessions could have been lifted straight out of a soap opera rat- fic or a case-study textbook, and seem out of place in a work about Pokemon. One of the strengths of HPMOR (imo) was its ability to largely incorporate its rationalist/scientific perspective /in the context of/ the Wizarding World (temporal concepts are explored in with Time-Turners, quantum physics with partial transfiguration, etc...). In contrast, the therapy sessions do not really tap into the rich resources of this "alternative universe". It is telling that the majority of the comments are directed at the exeggcute scene.

At the risk of prejudging, these therapy sessions seem to be incorporated for the sake of exposition on the topic, rather than any meaningful plot development. Either way, the therapy sessions still felt like a drag to read.

That being said, I remain grateful to the author for the work he has put into this fanfic.

I considered making Red's therapist a psychic, or utilizing pokemon more in the sessions, but this is in fact the one area where I feel like anything that makes the process different or easier than it would be in the real world would be doing the issues addressed a disservice.

The pokemon world already has so many of our problems solved by magic or magitech, it felt like there needed to still be parts of the human experience that remain "unsolved" to not make it too unrelatable. Even Red's psychic abilities and partition are at risk of being too convenient, in my view. Of course it's possible to utilize psychic abilities more directly in therapy without just insta-solving people's mental health problems, but that would still largely erode the reader's ability to learn how actual mental health and good therapy work in the real world, which (for obvious reasons) I find more valuable than making every single scene feel like it's fundamentally tied to the pokemon world.

To put it another way, there are still plumbers and programmers and politicians and teachers in the pokemon world, and outside of certain very rare catastrophes, none of their jobs are meaningfully altered by the fact that they live in it rather than ours. Maybe outside their professions, yes, but their day to day job is still the same in both worlds, and none of them are relevant to the plot (not yet anyway) so none of them are being covered, but therapy is one of the jobs I imagine would be the same in both worlds (especially with non-sapient pokemon) and happens to be plot relevant, so I'm presenting it the way it would be in our world.

You and [[/u/ClaireBear1123]] 's points about the tone change or it being too text-bookish are valid reasons to not like these scenes, and may be something I can address through better writing. But I would challenge the idea that a protagonist dealing with trauma or grief or an ended friendship don't constitute meaningful plot development, or that any part of any story in the pokemon world must be intrinsically identifiable as taking place within it.
