*** Correct link is [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/69/Mother-of-Learning]] - they left the www off.

Not sure why they posted a link to an old chapter though.

** This chapter went up over a week ago, and there is already a pretty active [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69udy7/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_69_ruin/?st=j2w1f5j6&sh=5e4cf8f2][discussion thread]]. Unless I'm missing something, I don't think there's any reason for this post?
