In film, who you are just sort of inherently doesn't matter, since you're pretending to be someone else.

Instead, he's treating her as a thing that he can view in different poses, and he's not doing a good enough job pretending to value her as a person to learn her name.

***** If you're in the mood for reading, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/4vj/a_rationalists_account_of_objectification/][this]] is what I want to tell you.

Sorry it's long, I can't think of a shorter way to say that which isn't easily misunderstood. But if you agree with the link, then my reply is "it really does not matter if he views the representation on the screen as a thing in different poses, as long as he doesn't systematically pigeonhole people into a stereotype during interpersonal interactions, and while That type of objectification might be loosely related to This type of pigeonholing, the two are not nearly closely related enough to justify you policing the very notion of watching a TV show in whole or part because you think one or more of the characters are attractive."

In fact, as the very first comment quoting M. Monroe in that article illustrates, knowing her name wouldn't have helped a thing. There's no indication that thinking an actress is attractive and thinking nothing else of note about her will make you treat her as an object /after you meet her/ - that's an important /but sufficiently unrelated/ issue to how you see any works she performed, sufficiently unrelated in that you don't get to judge people by the way they experience the works.

(That is to say - some people thought Monroe was a sex symbol and treated her like an object when they met her. Some people thought Monroe was a sex symbol and treated her like a person when they met her. Some people saw her as something /more/ than a sex symbol, and /still/ treated her like an object in the sense that they just saw her as a famous person commodity type thing. And so on. Related but still Pretty Separate issues.)

I trust lukeprog on some things, but not on feminism and objectification.

One thing that makes this example of objectification problematic is the fact that Karen Gillan probably didn't set out to show off her body and use acting as a means. She probably set off to be a good actor and got her role as a result of hard work and skill. Reducing her efforts to bodily objectification is a violation of that preference. It's especially vexing because women's worth (as perceived by society) tends to be no more than how easily people can objectify them. And doubly so because there are plenty of women in the porn industry who explicitly decide that they want people to objectify them like this.

I don't disagree with the ideals you're outlining here - that it would be nice if there /existed/ a form of art which incorporated acting without incorporating the artist's physicality - but the practical reality is that it's film. It's about appearance and skill in roughly equal parts - both are necessary, but neither is sufficient. I say this as a person with family in acting - the very first thing they ask from a new actor is a photograph. Every aspiring actor and actress understands that when they set out in the career. It is an inherently physical medium.

No one wants to be treated as an object within interpersonal interactions, but within the context of media I feel like it's a bit taboo to start dictating what viewers are /supposed/ to get from it. It's the artist's job to convey what they wish to convey, not the viewers job to receive the correct message.

****** The author is emulating problematic behavior for amusement, you say? How does that help anyone? I suppose it helps him justify his behavior to himself. He can sleep better at night. But in terms of the effects on others, it'd be better if he hadn't said that in the first place rather than saying it and then letting people whisper "It was a joke, he actually admires Karen Gillan's acting." (An assertion, I might add, that has absolutely no evidence behind it.)

This is, of course, completely incorrect. Since the shooting of poor black people is /normal/, we're inured to it. A joke about police shooting rich white people would be /supremely/ offensive, since it would confront the privileged classes with the pain, horror, and despair we put ever so much effort into ignoring.
