tl;dr: How do you take a pile of perfectly rigid objects and use them to build a machine that will send messages through time?

/EDIT: Stripped out a lot of what the power could do based on the discussion below. Thanks, guys! You not only saved me from having to deal with temporal signalling, but closed off the majority of abuses, which will make the power more interesting./

I'm currently working on a novel called "Induction", which is the third piece in my Change Storms series. This series is like Worm in that it explores the question "what if superpowers were real?" It is different from Worm in that I'm working forward, not backward; as a result, no one wears spandex and no one has [[#s][]] making them carry idiot and conflict balls.

Elly Larkin, the protagonist, has the power to straighten threads, and I would like the wisdom of Reddit to see if this can be parleyed into temporal communication. [EDIT: I'm hoping the answer is "no, it can't"!] Specifically, her powers:

- Affect only +things+ threads made of plant fibers (cotton, linen, hemp...) /(By 'threads' I mean strands below a certain diameter.)/
- +Affect only thread-like and woven-from-thread things. Thread, yarn, string, rope, gauze, cloth, etc.+
- Threads +Linear elements (threads etc)+ become perfectly straight. The fibers do not unweave.
- +A cloth swatch becomes perfectly flat.+
- +Cloth that's been stitched into a closed form (e.g. a sock or shirt) using straightenable fibers inflates into that form. In other words, your T-shirt suddenly looks like it's been stretched tight over a mannequin.+
- Things that have been straightened are absolutely invulnerable. Cannot be bent, broken, burned, or deformed in any way.
- She has a range of about 50 feet.
- Things stay straight as long as she concentrates on them.
- If she wants, she can mentally 'squeeze' them so that they will stay straight when she stops concentrating.\\
- If she squeezes as hard as possible they'll stay straight for about 10 minutes; she can do shorter time frames, but she can't hit an exact duration anymore than a normal person can hit an exact number of newtons when physically squeezing something.\\
- It takes a finite but extremely small amount of time for an object to go from normal to straightened. She can slow it down if she wants, so that it takes up to 1 second. She cannot straighten part of something, nor maintain straightness of part of something.
- Probably not relevant, but any straightened object that hits her with a force above a certain threshold will bounce off. Specifically, the direction component of its velocity will be instantly flipped 180 degrees. This is a Required Secondary Power intended to keep her from getting hurt if she straightens something too near her body and it slams into her.

The "can't be deformed" part is interesting. Given a perfectly rigid object, you can send an FTL signal by moving the object -- when the person at point A moves the rod, the person at point B would see it move before the light arrived from point A. Light takes 50 nanoseconds to travel 50', but in theory you could have one straightened fiber cause another to move, thereby getting you an extra 50 ns.

I'm trying to picture a machine that could be built under these constraints that would send a signal back a useful amount of time. Any thoughts?

--------------

Hopefully boring legal bit:

When I gave 2YE away before publishing it, this was an issue for some people, so let me be clear: This novel is for publication. My plan is to post each chapter for free as I write it and, when it's done, I'll put it all together, do final edits, and publish the novel. My Patreon backers will get each chapter (and the final novel) in multiple ebook/pdf formats. The final book will almost certainly be posted to Amazon, although it may go to other services as well. Once it's published it may or may not cease to be available online, depending on the TOS of the places I publish it. All of this is my current plan, but it could change. Finally -- and I apologize for saying this because it sounds rude, but I feel that it's necessary: when I gave 2YE away before publishing it, it became clear that at least a few people on the board don't understand how copyright works: copyright belongs to the person who writes the book, not to people who help with brainstorming. Helping me brainstorm this will get you my gratitude and maybe a reference on the 'thank you' page in the book, but it won't get you legal or moral rights in what I do with the book.

** Threads have an infinite speed of sound? Alright. I'll go with the standard ladder "paradox", which I prefer to conceptualize as a train going through a train-length tunnel with doors on both ends. When the train is in the tunnel, Elly, standing in the middle with threads going both ways, closes and reopens both doors at the same time. The train is going so fast that it is length contracted, so it fits in the tunnel and everything is fine.

From the train's perspective, the tunnel is contracted, and the train /doesn't/ fit. If the doors closed at the same time in this reference frame, the train will get damaged, and two reference frames can't disagree on whether that's happened! So, the train sees the front door close and reopen when it gets to it, then it passes through the tunnel, then the back door closes and reopens later. The conductor and Elly disagree on whether the doors were simultaneous, but they agree on all other observations.

Clever Elly ties a thread to the train. Using a hook or something, the train uses this thread to close the back door as soon as it sees the front door close in front of it. Since the train sees the tunnel as shorter than itself, this damages the caboose.

From Elly's perspective, the train (which does fit in the tunnel) is coming, then before it is completely inside, the back door damages it, pulling on her thread to the back door. She was going to wait for the train to be completely inside, so she receives this pull before she sends the pull to close the front door that the train is responding to.

How far back she can send a signal is limited only to how far she can munchkin her threads to go (maximum of 20 lightminutes if she doesn't affect a single thread beyond her range, arbitrarily far if she does) and how fast she can get them moving.

A bullet going at 1200 m/s over 30 meters can send a signal back 4*10^{-13} seconds. Even if you made a big square of 8100 guns, that's still just a few nanoseconds. Elly would have to munchkin up another ten orders of magnitude to make it really useful. So she's at least not going to break Time in a weekend.

The 20 lightminute figure probably comes from misreading the rules. If she squeezes an object so she doesn't have to concentrate on it, and it leaves her range, does the effect still hold? If so, she can throw out the ends of a thread to get up to that far. But on rereading, I think that's not what you intended.

****** Here's how a physicist who hasn't forgotten their basic thermodynamics might react to something perfectly rigid.

Something perfectly rigid is something that has degrees of freedom (ways it can have energy) limited to the modes of macroscopic motion. That is, its energy can only be from moving (three [quadratic] degrees of freedom) or from rotating (three more degrees of freedom). It's just like a water molecule at room temperature. It's not going to be at absolute zero: temperature is defined in equilibrium (that means, when everything has been left alone and let to settle down) by the amount of energy per degree of freedom. Since this thing has six perfectly good degrees of freedom, it's going to have a well-defined temperature. As soon as you pick it up and wave it around, it's not in equilibrium anymore and so different notions of temperature will give different answers (some of which will be "undefined") but the same thing would happen for a water molecule. What's special is that this object will have an incredibly low thermal mass (how much heat it takes to warm up when cold, or how much heat it radiates before cooling down when hot) - the same thermal mass as one water molecule!

What's interesting about this object is that it's still the same color. Color, as you know, comes from absorbing part of white light. And absorbing light is a way that something can have energy - it means there's still some degrees of freedom here! They're just locked out at high energy (or magic has happened). Assuming that this rigid object is kept rigid by some finite potential (in accordance with it not changing color), it should be possible to determine the strength of this potential b thermodynamic measurements, spectroscopy, or mechanical measurement. If that's not possible, then /that/'s magic.

Well, it's going to be a very good insulator (though not quite perfect). You should be able to put one end anywhere you like, and have the other end still be safe to hold. As for whether it would burn - well, it absorbs light, so it should still undergo chemical reactions - they're basically the same thing :P

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

In classical thermodynamics, every degree of freedom is equally important (insert disclaimer about quadratic potentials you don't need to understand). Imagine a tiny ball sitting at the bottom of a teaspoon. Along the long direction of the spoon, the ball can roll farther because the slope is gentler. Along the short direction of the spoon it can't roll as far. But the ball will roll equally /high/ along both directions - all degrees of freedom will store the same amount of energy. In quantum mechanics, this is not necessarily true.

Imagine a water molecule as three balls, connected by two springs (the springs being electromagnetism). You can store energy in the motion of the water molecule, or its rotation, but you can also store energy in the vibration of the springs. If the water molecule was classical, rather than quantum mechanical, we'd therefore expect 9 degrees of freedom.

But in the real world, at room temperature, water molecules actually do not vibrate! (Well, much.) This is because in quantum mechanics, states can be discrete. They can have energy gaps in between them. And if the energy gap is big relative to the average thermal energy per degree of freedom, that state can be "frozen out."

All of which is to say, if you take a piece of string and you confine it in a strong enough potential, you can make it behave like it's a perfectly rigid single body. This is this minimally magic approach, and so it's the first thing one might try to test. And you can test it because if you heat it up enough, or shine on light with a short enough wavelength, you can access those states that were previously frozen out. The fact that the string doesn't change in color when straightened implies that visible light is sufficient to do this - the energy gap for small electronic excitations is less than 1 eV.

********** (Many of these measurements require smaller sample sizes - a half-centimeter square of cloth would be good for most.)

The most important would be spectroscopy - the practice of shining electromagnetic waves at something, and seeing what gets absorbed (or scattered, or whatever). If there's a big gap between the "rigid" state and the first excitation, there should be "missing" absorption compared to normal clothesline at low energies (NMR, microwave, infrared). There might also be "extra" absorption at energies big enough to unfreeze those modes. If there's nothing fishy in the spectrum, this is either magic, or it means the stiffening-magic is letting the molecules move almost normally, and only operating at a macroscopic scale.

This could be tested with thermodynamic measurements - the practice of heating something up and seeing how much energy that took. A perfectly rigid body is extremely easy to heat up, as we've sort of gone over - but if the molecules are still moving around on a microscopic scale, it would behave more like ordinary string.

Either way, it's probably worth sending samples off to some microscopy labs to try and move microscopic pieces of it around, either by jamming a microscopic tip into it (AFM, nanoindenting, STM [may require special sample]) or by bombarding it with ions or high energy electrons (FIB, SEM, TEM [may require special sample]). If it has a normal heat capacity, I'd expect it to be be possible to move molecules around, if it has an anomalously low heat capacity, it will be impossible.

If spectroscopy shows a gap, this would imply that there's some corresponding stiffness - if it's measurable, you can try and bend this thread and measure its deflection. Okay, now we definitely need a 10' clothesline, at least.

Oh, and if she can do this with conducting thread (cloth of gold?), and it still stays shiny, shininess means mobile electrons! Definitely want to test the electronic properties. Or magnetic thread (cloth of... magnetite?) and magnetic properties.

*********** It's interesting to imagine how a body can be 'absolutely invulnerable' on microscopic scale.

Can charged particles still exchange photons? Do chemical bonds that make up the lattice still make sense? If the material does not become intangible, then it must still interact electrodynamically, right? If so, then there must be a boatload of internal degrees of freedom and all the thermodynamics that comes with them. What happens if you add an 'extra' electron to an absolutely invulnerable semiconductor? Can you tear an electron away from an invulnerable material? Can you tear away all the electrons? If the object retains the colour upon transformation, then it must still absorb photons, so where does the energy go when it does? If it goes to the particles making up the material, then what happens when you heat it up enough for the fusion/fission to start?

Yep. Unless you're a top-drawer physicist, it's very difficult to write superpowers that work in any other way, and very few top-drawer physicists are good fiction authors. For that matter, I'm not certain that it's /possible/ to write mathematically-defined superpowers, since once you start breaking a single piece of physics everything else falls apart. I sure wish I could write -- or at least read -- that story though. It would be fascinating.

A power that changes a fine-structure constant in a volume between two cross-sections (the coordinates of the cut determined by the user) of light-cone from the reference point somewhere around the user's head. It's still a tad underspecified, but can be improved until there is almost no ambiguity (except the actual interaction that changes the constant, naturally).

The important thing here is that the power does not mess with the laws, but tweaks the parameters, so one can examine the consequences within the existing framework, instead of inventing physics anew.

************** That's a good example of something that's simply defined, but it leaves a lot of problems for use in fiction. Leaving aside all the definitional questions (what happens at the boundaries, is the change instantaneous, etc), you have these two fundamental issues:

- What, /exactly/, does it do when he uses it?
- More importantly: how do you explain it to the reader?

[[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law]] is "your ability to solve problems with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands the magic." This cuts both ways -- if I say that my character can "make strings be straight", the reader knows what that means and I can get on with the story. If I say my character "can alter the fine structure constant" then I have to have a discussion like this:

Bob: So, what can you do?

Al: I can alter the fine structure constant!

Bob: Uh...cool? I guess?

Al: It's a constant in physics that defines the strength of electromagnetic interactions between elementary particles.

Bob: Oh. Uh...okay. So, what can it actually /do/? Can you energy blast the bad guys, cut through the wall, become intangible, turn invisible, what?

I actually have a character in my character bank whose power is "within a defined volume, one physics equation is inverted." So, for example, =F = 1/ma=. He then blows on someone very gently and it creates a large force. Actually using him is problematic, as mentioned above -- unless the reader has a good background in physics, they won't understand how he's doing what he's doing and his powers will look like a series of massive hat-pulls. It's a power that's incredible useful for munchkining but that, paradoxically, I /can't/ munchkin because the audience wouldn't get it. It's frustrating, but I keep him around anyway; he was a Champions character of mine in college, and I love the idea.

*************** I see your point. Still, the fact that most readers would not understand the implications of such a power can be used to make the story more engaging. The reader can find out about the power at the same pace as protagonist does. Imagine the protagonist running experiments trying to determine what the hell the power actually does, well that's some educational rationalist fiction just waiting to happen.

As for what the power will do, one can always crowdsource it on the internet, if one's physics-fu is weak. My example is actually pretty interesting as far as I can see:

- Significantly reducing fine-structure constant would pretty much make the matter disintegrate into plasma of electrons and bare atomic nuclei. The nuclei should then begin fusing.

- Significantly increasing it would make it impossible for nuclei to remain stable and they would split into lighter ones. This would probably result in everything exploding and eventually cooling down into a cloud of hydrogen.

- The most interesting one: slightly tweaking it. This would shift the energy levels in atoms and subtly affect chemistry without everything exploding immediately.

You should probably ask an actually qualified person like su3su2u1 if you ever decide to try doing this, since I'm just an engineer and not that good of a physicist. Anyway, I think there is a good rational story to be had with such superpowers. Sure, it's a bit more involved than controlling bugs, but that can be a good thing.

** I thought about this issue when reading Vinge's /Bobble/ series. If time stops in the bobble, the bobble is perfectly rigid. A bobble, or a chain of bobbles, could be used to send a message faster than light.

Or, if they're not perfectly rigid, then you can create an upper bound to how slow time passes inside the bobble.

In the process of trying to figure that out, I thought about time travel. The problem, I thought, is that to get time travel out of FTL signalling you need to be able to send the signals from an object traveling at a significant velocity with respect to the receiver. This practically rules out signalling through rigid bodies.

It depends on what reference frame "can't be deformed" is declared in. If it's in some privileged reference frame, e.g. Elly's, no information can travel backwards in Elly's time.

If it's the wire's own reference frame, I think I have one:

Take two sets of electrically charged, fortified pieces of fiber string. Send them in opposite directions through a synchrotron at relativistic velocities, keeping the distance between fibers less than the length of the fibers.

If you push one fiber at the front, it'll move instantaneously according to its own reference frame at the back, which is slightly in the laboratory frame's past. Use a ridiculously fast mechanism to push the front side of a fiber moving in the opposite direction iff the backside of an earlier fiber is pushed. This pushes the back of the fiber, further in the laboratory frame's past. Use the same mechanism on that end to push the previous fiber, and you can send back messages arbitrarily far with as much data as the resolution of the mechanism.

So setting it to Elly's frame is probably best. And not that atrocious, since the effect does have a distance limit.

Further thoughts:

A line can be declared straight if it follows the trajectory of a photon.

How are knots or braids resolved?

When is a bundle of fibers declared a single, larger rope?

how strong are the forces applied in straightening? Can it cut through water? Syrup? Custard? Fat? Muscle? Bone? Wood? Steel? ...

To describe the chosen definition we invent a massless non-interacting particle, whose hypothetical worldline represents our 'straight line'.

Although, I'm realizing something...she's only immune to forces imparted by a straightened object, not to secondary interactions. If one of her strings hits her in the face it's no big deal -- it just bounces off. On the other hand, if it hits her /sleeve/...well, it's the cloth of her sleeve that is imparting the force to her, not the string itself. She'd still end up injured in that case.

She could make shoes out of cloth, straighten them, and get bouncepads that way. The protection only activates when she takes enough force to cause injury, so she'd be able to walk normally, but if she jumped off a three story building she'd hit the ground and bounce safely as long as the soles of her shoes were what made contact.

** I can see how you'd get FTL out of it, but I'm not sure about time travel. While the two tend to be casually linked in popular culture, being able to travel FTL doesn't necessarily mean you'd be able to send a message from A to B back to A and have it arrive before it was sent.

I'd also want to see how the 'perfectly straight' designation applied to deformed space, because straightness depends on what framework you're measuring it by.

For example, one current thought about the universe is that it's spherical (with a twist) in four spacial dimensions, meaning that there is a finite volume but no edge (similar to how the Earth has a finite surface area but you can't fall off the edge of the world). Would a straightened object of sufficient length start to disappear from the universe the way it would appear to lift away from the Earth's surface (which is curved)? Or would it conform to the spacetime curve of the universe, appearing absolutely straight at any non-interplanetary lengths but being able to be bent by supermassive objects in the same way as light (ie the thread would always remain parallel to a laser beam, even if the beam got bent around a star or black hole - both would remain /optically/ straight and straight according to local spacetime)?

I'd recommend using "straight according to spacetime", as it allows objects to appear perfectly straight at all normal day-to-day lengths while breaking far fewer physical laws.

(Note that this would probably mean it was only perfectly rigid within a lightspeed cone, too - so no FTL messaging, although lightspeed messaging is pretty good for daily superpower use.)

In the real world, the rod is not perfectly rigid -- the force Alice applies causes the rod to flex slightly and then the elasticity of the rod brings it back into form. Because of this flexion, the far end of the rod moves up slightly after the near end moves down; the "signal" travels down the rod at sub-light speed.

Do the same with a 50' rod that is perfectly rigid: the far end moves up at exactly the same time that the near end moves down. That means that Bob sees his end move up at exactly the instant that Alice pushes down.\\
It takes light 50 ns to travel from one end of the rod to the other, which means that the signal has propagated down the rod at FTL speed.

The reason I ask is because testing the boundaries and definitions of "threads" would be among the first experiments I would do, if I had her power (rather than test the physics to see if a "light-year long thread could defy relativity")

Implications for plant derived bio molecules means that more complex polymers like industrial plastics are out.

The invulnerable small linear segments might shatter like a bomb from the release of energy.

The fact that the cellulose threads are longer than a few nanometers means that they are still woven together to some degree by the squeezing effect. I don't know how that's helpful, unless she actually bonds them all together into one long contiguous string. In that case, she's actually catalyzing the polymerizing reaction and she can use it to "unspool" a very long string (but not a light-year long) given enough raw material... basically converting a shirt into the equivalent length of thread as thin as her powers allow her to make it -- and when she concentrates, she makes it straight and invulnerable, perhaps getting dangerously close to nano-fiber cutting power.

She's already pretty powerful from the "absolutely invulnerable" and "nigh-unstoppable straightening" aspects, so I'm leery of going farther. Let me think on it.

You mean "what qualifies as"? Usually when I hear 'materials science implications' I think of things that can be done with the material, but I don't think that's what you meant...?

****** Thread is a simple fibrous material, but she has the ability to give it the properties of stiffness, straightness, thinness, cohesiveness... etc, through her will.

She's turned the simple material into something with unique properties, that's what I am trying to say.

Does a strand of thread turn from a collection of woven fibers into one contiguous long thread if she squeezes it for long enough? Do these effects persist after she's done concentrating?

Could she take a coiled rope with ash/coal in its core and make carbon buckytubes by squeezing it? This is similar to the knot idea you referred to before, but she's applying a great deal more pressure across the thread's entire length.

******* Sorry, I've been ambiguous -- the "squeezing" is metaphoric, it's a term for telling her power to become temporarily self-sustaining.

The idea of making diamonds or buckytubes by using the threads to squeeze carbon...that is brilliant. I am definitely using that. PM me what name you'd like on the acknowledgment page.
