** Hey, this is the mostly unedited audio from a project on rational fiction I did for AP Language and Composition a few months back. Thought people would be interested in hearing some of the thoughts of a prominent rational fiction author. The reason I went with the raw recording is due to not wanting to accidentally misconstrue anything as well as remove bloat added due to it being a school assignment.

** Oh my gosh, thank you both for doing this project. I'm so excited to listen to this; I've been reading Worth the Candle, and ever since the stuff with Mome Rath, I've been looking into info about the Author who created this world. I'm so looking forward to this :D

*** Your post made notice that Arthur/Uther sounds rather similar to "author". Coincidence? ʘ‿ʘ

** Am I the only one who prefers not to know ANYTHING about the authors of my favorite books? I can't really explain why but somehow it ruins my immersion in the story.

*** I'm able to have this sort of partition between an author and their works while reading. Despite having learned more about him I can still separate my idea of Wales from the works he has put out that I enjoy.
