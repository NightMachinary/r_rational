I have read [[http://www.sirlin.net/posts/interstellar-and-coherence][this review]], which claims [[http://www.coherencethemovie.com/][Coherence]] is better than Interstellar. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to watch outside the US?


** Seems like a pretty good character study, where everyone can blame their irrationality on a comet. The claim that it "does for quantum physics what /Looper/ did for time travel" throws me off, since there's nothing particularly quantum in the trailer. But hey, the reviews are good, and I'm a big fan of those /Blair Witch Project/ style natural-script stories, so I'd certainly be interested in watching it. Needless to say, I'll be monitoring this thread.

ETA: Skimming the review. Tired of scrolling past pages of unoriginal /Interstellar/ critiques. I *liked* that movie, dammit. If you're worried about the science so much, [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Science-Interstellar-Kip-Thorne/dp/0393351378][there's literally a book about that]], and it's quite good at justifying the film. And no, love didn't actually matter, like, at all, that was just Nolan putting themes on top of it. As a story, it's great; as hard science fiction, it falls a bit short. But it wasn't meant to be judged as hard science fiction! So don't.

Also, that soundtrack was objectively amazing, no matter what he says.

I wonder how he's gonna 180Â° into applauding a story whose premise seems to be that a comet causes parallel universes to run into each other ...

*** I also liked Interstellar, additional assertions of brotherhood and commonality. The music, though, I didn't like at all. Sweeping, dramatic orchestral scores are fine, but there's a time for them, and when the sweeping orchestral scores are literally so loud that I can't hear plot-relevant dialogue, You're Doing It Wrong.

I didn't know what Coherence was and clicked this thread from curiosity. Having seen the trailer now, I will continue my disinterest. Internet Guy Away!

It's available on [[https://popcorntime.io/][pirate netflix]] though.
