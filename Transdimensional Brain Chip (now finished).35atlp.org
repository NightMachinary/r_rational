** If possible, you might want to change the link so it goes to the first page, not the last. Hadn't read it for a few months, kinda got spoiled there.

*** Actually, I think I'll just delete the link and re-add it. Can't risk other people being spoiled.

*** Ah, sorry! I didn't realise it was pointing at the most recent page. I just chopped off the end of the URL without checking.

No, Reddit doesn't let me change the link to point somewhere else, for obvious reasons.

** I've submitted this once before, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ouxcm/xrisktransdimensional_brain_chip/][here]]. People seemed divided about it - there's a lot of good ideas, but it's badly-drawn and written in the author's second language.

Well, it's finished, so you can read it at your leisure now.

*** Is it just me, or is there a serious problem with the pages taking forever and a day to load up?
