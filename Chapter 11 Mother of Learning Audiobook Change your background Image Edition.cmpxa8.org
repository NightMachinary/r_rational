*** I am a professional narrator on audible. I contacted the author and we discussed the production of a free podcast of me narrating Mother of Learning. He agreed and we have progressed from there.

**** And after listening to the first ten chapters, I /really/ appreciate your work, it's a really really good performance and an excellent new way to introduce the story to friends who don't often find the time or willingness to read but greatly enjoys podcasts.

******* I'm very lucky and naturally have a British BBC accent (hammered into me by my mother). Enunciation can be helped by speaking slowly. This has actually taken a few books worth of practice to get.

**** If you need something with the same dimensions, [[https://i.imgur.com/TX724ZP.jpg][this]] would do. Not super high quality, but at least related to the story.
