** /Of course/ I start reading this right when the latest chapter ends on a big fat cliffhanger. This always seems to happen to me.

**** Lol! I like to lean on the fourth wall occasionally, but I don't think I'd go quite that far.

** First exposure to this. Very readable. A bit worried at the new development, in regards to keeping all these plot balls in the air.

**** I get that, and I've been there (ex creative writing bachelors grad), but I meant something else. I wasn't clear; I have no reason to believe you can't "handle" a complex story. I'm looking forward to it!

What I meant is that the chapter made me feel like a "Where Taylor's powers come from" style twist might have been revealed too early. I'd like to have been misdirected! I hope that this ends up building naturally toward your final goals.

** I was not expecting a Peggy Sue. Interesting.

*** [[#s][-Spoiler if Peggy Sues worry you, otherwise just wait-]]

Mostly it's just because I felt compelled to /justify/ my divergence from canon. Which many people have told me isn't necessary (lots even said just make Tonks a Seventh Year like EY did), but I'm a fan of both continuity and "Hard Fantasy", if you will.

**** Hey, Peggy Sue's can be interesting. [[http://otherhistory.proboards.com/thread/431/shall-reap-whirlwind][And They Shall Reap the Whirlwind]] is a long, and occasionally very bizarre, Peggy Sue involving an actual historical figure whose mind gets fed to and replaced by the mind of a 21st-century historian whose career was studying that specific person. (Arthur Harris, commander in chief of the British bomber command in WW2)

The story is amusing in places because almost none of the replacement's attempts to peggy sue the shit out of everything actually work. Failures range from frustrating to horrifying, but nothing is really easy for the protagonist in spite of having been dropped into a situation where they can potentially do the most good. It's a long story, and it does kinda lose the plot from time to time, but it's a good study of how foreknowledge is not an instant-win.

Your structure as written has a lot of potential, especially if you keep the perspective centered where it is, making the interloper essentially unknowable and separate. I think you could be onto something if you plot out everything from the interloper's perspective and only show us things from the current POV.

** Twist! Or maybe it's just because I haven't read this story for a while. Great to see an update either way. The plot thickens!
