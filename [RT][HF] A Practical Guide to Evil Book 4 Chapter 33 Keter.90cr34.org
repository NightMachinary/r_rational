** You know, Keter doesn't sound half bad. It's designed by a very talented architect with exquisite tastes, kept tidy by the most dilligent police out there (which is also stylish) and is ruled by a monarch that masterfully balances caring for his people with avoiding internal strife. There's that slight problem about free will and stuff but by the standards of Evil dictatorships kept together by dark magic, it's beautiful.

All those haters are probably just jealous, because it makes the rest of Calernia look like a bunch of failed states. Which it is, for the most part.

What's the easiest way to avoid rebellion and Hero creation among your subjects? Simple, just engineer your society to believe servitude is the most important cultural value, outside world is horrible and you're the only thing protecting /us/ from /them/.

The crazy thing is, much like Black didn't lie to Cat, I think the Dead King fulfills his end of the deal too. Keter is peaceful, doesn't suffer from disease or lack of resources and actually seems like a meritocracy. Why lie when the truth serves just as well and doesn't bite you in the ass later on?

** Can someone remind me why we're letting Akua out of her cage all the time now? From my perspective Cat just lost against the AI in a +box+ cloak. She's obviously manipulative, and in Thief's conversation with her we learned that there can be multiple layers to her manipulations. They're catching them now, but how long can they keep that up? Cat is already finding her likable.

Obviously she's a resource, but why don't they just allow her out when they need her? Is there something I'm missing, an advantage to having her out permanently or a limitation to storing and retrieving her from the cloak?

** I'm wondering what the limit is of the Dead King's power to control undead. I mean, with thousands of years to grow and learn, would his actual capacity just keep growing as well? Because if he can control limitless undead he's basically a god now. He doesn't even need to cull his human herds, he just needs to sit back and wait because they'll die eventually and then serve him in death. I suppose the same effect can be done through rituals and whatnot, but if he can do it all by his own will... whoa. That's definitely god-tier.

(Slight spoilers for The Gods Are Bastards): it reminds me of how the gods in TGAB are kept strong by the souls of the dead. "The afterlife" is basically just a big battery that captures souls when people die, which is then used to power divine magic and the gods. The gods hardly need to lift a finger, because everyone dies eventually so their power source keeps getting replenished automatically. The Dead King is basically doing the same thing here, but using dead bodies rather than souls. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if The Dead King is keeping their souls too - we already know that a gestalt can be created, and frankly it would be a pretty big oversight if TDK didn't set up one of his own. Especially since his information is seemingly so strong, I bet he's known for ages about how The Watch is powered.

And while it's obviously horrific that TDK set up a dystopian society that will serve him willingly for eternity, I can't really say that it's any worse than what the actual Gods are doing/have done. They set society up the same way, just globally rather than in a hell. Humanity is stuck in their cosmic game, specifically designed to have limited life spans (after the Gods realized the Fae were a failure and a possible danger), and societies have taught people that this is Good or just the way things are so long that none but a few such as Black even question it. In a weird way, TDK is kind of commendable when you compare his hell to Calernia. In both people are trapped by higher powers and brainwashed by society to act as their (mostly) unseen masters desire, but at least in "Serenity" people are happy, healthy, and at peace. Despite being just as trapped, you can't say the same about Creation!

*** Uuh, where is the souls = divine magic thing come from in TGAB? I really don't recall that. I thought it was just magical energy from the Infinite Order gods that were no longer around, that the current pantheon merged into something they could use (like fae magic is Naiya's, infernal is Scyllith's, and arcane is whichever other hidden old god).

Do you have a chapter that backs that up?

**** Hmmm, I might actually be remembering incorrectly. I believe I made the assumption based on Scion 4:

#+begin_quote
  “The afterlife,” the valkyrie began, “is a dimensional plane like the prime material plane upon which you were born. The Elder Gods set it aside for the purpose of...well, power. You know, I'm sure, that magic requires a sapience to be initiated?”

  “She's one of the best theoretical arcanists of her era,” Tellwyrn said. “You can skip the review.”

  Evaine made a wry face at her before turning back to Cyria. “Very well. That, doctor, is the reason the Elders began harvesting and storing souls. In the suspended state which is normal there, they have no will as such. They can be used to create magical workings on a scale no mortal caster could even dream. And now, that vast soul battery is under the control of the Pantheon.”

  “Why,” Aradidjad asked faintly, “is every new thing I learn more horrific than the last?”
#+end_quote

But that chapter says that the soul battery, while still up and running, isn't being used by the Pantheon. Divine magic was formed from the energy released by the Old Gods when they were destroyed (14-11), which I took to mean was the magic they had harvested from the souls of the dead. But you're right, it doesn't say that directly, so it's definitely an assumption on my part.

***** Yeah, it's not stated directly, but there's still enough there that it's not totally implausible that magic comes from souls. The Pantheon may have just repurposed the existing stock of souls from the old gods who were killed.

Guess we're gonna have to wait to know for sure, if it's ever addressed more thoroughly.

** Anyone else think that Cat and Neshamah are gonna have a /thing/?

She's had impressive necromantic control from very early on as just part of her Name, without any particular aspect. She's used it repeatedly, and most notably did things with it that Masego said should not be possible even before she mixed Winter into everything.

She's one of the only other villains out there who have given themselves a form of immortality without having an Aspected name.

Cat has always thrived on chaos. Neshamah is about order, long plans that have no exploitable points of failure.

Taken together, Cat is similar enough to Neshamah to be familiar, but different enough to be useful or interesting.

Cat is currently /romantically unattached./ The fanbase has also noted she can have trouble keeping it in her pants.

All of this together suggests strongly to me that the Dead King and the Black Queen are gonna bump unliving uglies.
