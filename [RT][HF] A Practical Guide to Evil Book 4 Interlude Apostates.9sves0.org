** Warlock's theory is interesting, but Masego's argument is correct, people change all the time. Second Liesse was a traumatic event for Catherine and even now she regrets not being able to stop it, and it's obvious that such an event would change a person. Masego's doubts can be attributed to either winter influence or Cat just being more cautious after losing so much, or even part of the burden of Queenship. It will be interesting to see how she plans to transfer her mantle though.

*** I think both Warlock and Tikoloshe incorrectly assume the Mantle has completely replaced Catherine when there's evidence to it simply covering up her human being. When the Saint of Swords damaged Cat's domain, she temporarily returned to her human body. The cases they bring up are the Dead King and the Revenant, whose original bodies were killed in order to achieve apotheosis. This is not the case here and if the mantle was ever usurped or destroyed, I think Cat would go back to being a human rather than being vanquished.

  Diabolist's binding found me but there was no purchase, because Winter was no longer a thing tamed. It ran wild through my veins, through my Name, and a scream ripped its way out of me. My blood was red ice, my bones snapped and beyond it all my heart beat once -- and ceased. There was a world within that I owned, and it was bereft of stars and moon because in the depths of that darkness even those had been smothered by frost. It did not kill me. No, in a way that would have been a mercy and my mantle knew no such thing. What I had of life was a last gasp, the desperate clawing of death's rattle as the whole world was buried around me. Bleak. That was the word, and now I understood the meaning of it in full. Winter had taken it all and left nothing behind that would warm me, no refuge to reassure me that I was still Catherine Foundling. Even my Name was stripped bare, its power dimmed and dull. I had no aspect left but one, and that one was gone far beyond what an aspect should be. Squire, I thought, but the name rang hollow. Tied to me only by the barest thread. Transition loomed ahead, patiently awaiting the right fulcrum.

** I understand the Warlock's point, and think that generally people are underestimating two things:

1. The potential of an imperfect copy. At what level of fidelity is a copy no longer the same thing? This isn't quite the same thing as the ship of Theseus question, because it would be like if the ship got a redesign every time a new part was added.
2. That different physical forms may have different effects on thought processes. The way we store information in our brain and act on it may be quantum, and thus impossible for a normal computer replicate let alone magic or elemental fae powers.

​

However, we have evidence that this is not the case for Cat. When the Saint of Swords cut Winter, her body changed into a human again. This implies that Winter is a layer running on top of her thoughts and body, and something of her true self remains.

*** My answer to both these points would be "Who cares?" It's like the teleporter problem all over again.

Even if current!Catherine has fundamentally different thought processes from past!Catherine, saying that "Catherine is dead" still feels extremely inaccurate by pragmatic metrics. Maybe she's been irreversibly altered by the mantle, but then again she's also been irreversibly altered by letting 10'000s of her countrymen die, becoming Queen, etc.

If the responsibility of Queenship can make her a radically different person (and it does, she's nothing like Book 1 Cat), but doesn't count as "being dead", then her becoming an imprint on the Winter mantle shouldn't count as "being dead" either, quantum brains or not.

** In our world, "is a copy the same as the original" is academic and complicated

In PGtE, it's simple, because /souls exist/.

Catherine is still Catherine because Winter is grafted to the same soul she had in the beginning.

In a world where immortal souls demonstrably exist, I'm confused about how there's even a dispute about whether the same soul transplanted into a different body is the same person. The soul /is/ the person: that's what a soul /is/.

In our world, where souls (probably) don't exist, sure, there's an argument to be made that an identical copy of you isn't you. I don't buy the argument, but I recognize it has some validity. In PGtE, though, whatever entity has Cat's soul /is/ Cat, and SnowCat still qualifies.

"Who Catherine is" is not just a function of what she's been through and what she thinks about it, it's also a function of how much ice magic she's currently throwing around.

The thing Warlock is worried about is Catherine and Masego's /personality/ - he believes that his son would act like a different person as a result of becoming immortal, even if the label on his soul still technically said "Masego's soul."

As an analogy, if someone hacks your Reddit account and starts posting angry screeds about Scottish independence, then your posts are still made by "Nimelennar," but they clearly have a different personality. Even if you say "Nimelennar, by definition, is the person who has this account," that doesn't answer the question of if the account has a different personality in it now.

He'd have to find something else to be obsessive over, or become less obsessive, either of which would constitute a huge change.

I don't think that hacking is an apt analogy, because an account is not a person - it's a credential. The "Nimelennar" account would be like the Royal Seal of Callow: there's a presumption that that which you're reading has come from Cat or a trusted hand, but the Seal is not the person.

A better analogy would be an injury, or other trauma, changing the person. And life is all about enduring trauma. People in my life have died: that changed me, profoundly. I've lost my religion, which was a touchstone in my youth: that changed me, also. My selection of books expanded in adulthood, and I lost a lot of my preconceptions about what a good person is.

My personality is, in many ways, /very/ different from who I was as a teenager (I was /such/ an asshole, in retrospect), but I'd say I'm the same person, with a few more miles on my body and a few more stories in my mind.

And that's not even taking into account the fact that I'm not always the same person. When I'm on the ski hill, I'm energetic and daring; when I'm sleep-deprived, I'm a hermit who stares at a phone screen for hours on end; when I'm in a state of limerance, I delve into poetry and other writing.

The things that remain constant are: this is my mind; this is my body; these are my memories; these are my values; these are my skills; these are the things that stress me, and the things that relieve stress. These are the people I love, and those I've loved in the past. And even each of those lists wax and wane as the years pass.

If I were to say that I had a soul, I'd say that all of the things I've just listed (save the body) are part of it. Everything non-physical that I identify as "me" is bound up in it. And if 17-year-old me, who had a different mind, a younger body, fewer memories, more religiously-influenced values, fewer skills, different stressors and relaxants, and, outside of family, very few of the same people in my life... If he was me --- in some ways, still /is/ me --- then he shares the same soul, despite our differences.

I see no reason why the artificial alterations on Cat's soul are any different. And certainly no reason why Second Liesse would have been the moment of transition between being Cat and being not-Cat.

** So we've got the first half of the chapter from Warlock's side, which is filled with a lot of magical jargon.

I'm not a huge fan of that, because a lot of what's said just comes off as noise and doesn't really help enumerate the limits of our characters. Although there were some interesting pieces amongst all this, like how wards cannot be placed over water, the focuses of Ashuran sorcery,some history, and a lot of detail about how Thalassina's defences function (after nearly 2000 words of that, I'm assuming that this city is going to be important moving forward).

Then there's Masego's half, which is dominated by talks about secrets and apotheosis.

I feel like Tikoloshe and Wekesa had a pretty damn good reason for keeping the secret they did (if they were telling the truth, which we have to question because Praesi), namely preventing Masego from turning himself into an undead zombie and suffering (what they consider to be) personality death. Like, Masego talks about how much he's grown since leaving his parents, but what he doesn't mention is how much room he had to grow. You couldn't reasonably say that the Apprentice when we first met him was someone who could be trusted to be responsible with some of the most dangerous knowledge around. He was a kid, and it was his parents job to protect him as best they knew how.

As to Cat and the ego death, I thought that was an interesting twist. There's been something different about Cat this book, which has been frustrating me a little, so an explanation for that is appreciated. For whether she's "gone" or not I figure people are going to have different definitions of personhood, and thus different answers to this question, but my take on it is that Cat is no longer Cat. She's something very close, sure, but if she has different values, is making different choices, and can't grow or change in the same way then she's not the same person on a static or dynamic measure.

*** Interesting analysis. I agree with most of it (though I like the jargon); but the talk between Masego & his parents is interesting in multiple ways:

1) It displays a struggle between autonomy(of Masego) and (benevolent) guardianship(of his parents towards Masego)

2) It displays the expectations Masego still has towards his parents; he expects them to act in a certain way

(IF you raised me to fear nothing but ignorance, THEN you shouldn't act against this value you have instilled in me; e.g. you should never keep secrets from me that I want to learn)

3) Masego still fails to understand both the motivations of his parents and their freedom to choose and act contrary to his expectations of them -> this is why is is feeling "betrayed" and hurt

4) Tikoloshe & Wekesa, however, have underestimated Masego's desire to learn and strength of character; the Time spent with Cat & the Woe have given Masego the strength to stand up for himself even against his parents (He also has never encountered "limits" from their parenting before, which is why this matter is a BIG DEAL to him)

Finally, the chapter ends with "Arc words" from Masego - just as Black's *I do not kneel*, Catherine's *Justifications matter only to the just*, Masego has found his voice: *I do not flinch*.

The time before that was chapter 1, where Hakram threw it back at her, and she rejected it there as well. The last time she invoked the words and meant them was book 2, which is how many hundred thousand words ago?

Cat first said it in Book One, right after fulling embracing her role as a villain and deciding she was okay with being on the side of Evil. It was meant to be an answer to Will's question ("how can you possibly justify working for these Tyrants?"), and it was an answer strong enough for her name, which had left her at the time, to come back out to play.

The next time she mentioned it was her deciding it didn't matter whether she was morally right after committing murder.

Then we get to the big one (and the last time the words aren't subverted), where the Heavens themselves demand contrition and justification for her actions, and when she tells them "justifications only matter to the just", they flinch.

Saying that this whole time the phrase meant precisely the opposite of what Cat meant kind of robs this events of their weight. And they had a huge weight, these words carried her through pivotal events.

But that's not what they are. The Gods Above are no more just than the Gods Below, and the Choir of Contrition /know/ that. When Cat says justifications only matter to the just, she's /mocking/ them. "Oh, you want me to justify myself? Is that right? Well, if you want my justifications, I'll have yours first!" They flinched because they had no answer to that. Justice is an alien concept to them, just as love, and hope, and "not brainwashing everyone in a 49 mile radius just by existing for a few seconds" are. Even the Choir of Justice is arguably unjust, as it creates monsters who kill whenever a coin comes up tails and who tolerate monsters like Tariq.

The concept of justice appears, in the Guideverse, to be entirely manmade. Neither Above nor Below really champion it. That is the true meaning of Cat's motto, it seems. If justice only comes from humanity, then the Gods must be defied no matter the costs.

Take, say, food shortages in Callow. This is a problem that's we've been building up to for a long while. Can Masego solve it, help in a limited way, or is he powerless here? We have no real idea where he falls on the spectrum here. Cat thought about asking him help with the devastation of southern Callow's farmlands, but we never saw that conversation or what resulted from it.

Can he help out? How much can he help out? What would the costs of that help look like (if any)? Does he have things he could do that he hasn't mentioned because he doesn't really care about people starving? How concerned should we be about this situation, if the magical demigod can potentially pull a solution out of nowhere?

There are so many questions here, and no real way of knowing what the answers are short of waiting for an answer to be given after the fact. And this is just one example.

******* The entire magical tradition of Praes going back to the creation of the Wasteland has tried to come up with solutions to their food shortage. Their only solutions have been mass human sacrifice for marginal, temporary fertility, and making war upon Callow. Heirophant is powerful, but it seems apparent that magical power does not aid in that regard. Perhaps certain heroic Named mages could do sacrifice-free fertility rituals, but the Gods Below are unlikely to give such power to those they patronize.

***** How so? One could argue that every time you go to sleep there is a break in consciousness, and as such the person who wakes up is fundamentally different. Following your chain of logic, going to sleep would be equivalent to killing ones-self, which in my opinion is ludicrous.

By definition, if two things are identical, they are the same. I guess a counter argument would be that the difference comes from their /position/ (referencing how electrons are all fundamentally the same, yet we know that there is more than one electron in the universe), but that ultimately feeds into the initial point I made. If you get drugged and moved 20 miles while you sleep, and wake up in a different position than you normally would be, you're still you.

There's an argument to be made if there's more than one /you/ existing at a time, but even then I'd argue that they are both you, just different instances. (Again, electrons). These "yous" can go on to do and be different things, while still fundamentally being you.

************* Except that the word original is a label which can only be placed from the outside looking in. In this scenario, there are two instances of a person which both have the right to claim that label because everything about them is identical. They are literally one person, just running concurrently. They will diverge over time, but in that moment? The copy has all the memories of being old, and the exact same right to claim them as its own. You can't say that they "didn't really happen" to the copy, or that they are any less valid, because the only way anyone knows what has happened to them is through the physical storage of memories. This physical storage is a subset of what was copied to make the additional instance of the person, so there is nothing to discriminate between.

Think about it this way. You go to get a duplicate made, for whatever reason. Both halves of the machine look identical, because the process can also be reversed to merge two instances of a person who both want to have the memories of both of them. Furthermore, the process requires soft anesthesia which prevents memory formation while you're inside the machine, and you don't get in unless they're sure it's working. Blah blah forming memories while having them scanned causes corruption in the data, or whatever. Point being, you won't remember which half of the machine you got in (this procedure is also to prevent discrimination against copies, with all the negative implications of all forms of irrational discrimination)(also, if you have ever had dental surgery, you have had this done to you, it isn't some massive ethical concern).

Once you're out, /both/ of you will be exactly identical, and you won't have any conflicting memories. Neither of you could claim, with any certainty greater than 50%, that you were the one who physically walked in the door that day and asked to be duplicated. If you planned to have "your copy" go and do something crazy then report back later, you won't be able to carry out that plan because you won't know which is which. You'll have to flip a coin instead. And, no matter what, if the one who "loses" the flip winds up dying for some reason, the only instance of you remaining will be the one who remembers winning. If you repeat that process a thousand times, the only remaining you would be the one who remembers winning a thousand times.

Your contention will be that the "copy" and the "original" should, ethically, be known, and that the process shouldn't be carried out unless this information can be known, but this contention isn't actually due to ethics on your part. You just have a firmly-rooted belief that the third-person singular pronoun should only ever refer to one consciousness running on one physically contiguous medium. With significant help, I've realized, given that our universe doesn't actually work that way, and given that we already know language is always at best a rough approximation of reality, this belief is irrational. Just because "I" and "you" have always only ever referred to the same physical instance, it doesn't mean they must always. The map is not the territory. Reality will one day disagree with the way our language is structured. It is, therefore, the language which needs to change.

A copy of you made right now has the exact same right to call itself the original as the singular you which currently exists because the universe cannot tell the difference. To say otherwise is to say that the specific arrangement of atoms which currently contains you is somehow unique from all of the other possible arrangements which could do so. This would imply that you cease to exist every planck-second as particles shift and waveforms collapse.

You can't have it both ways. You cannot self-consistently say that all past versions of you are you, and also that the existence of a second you implies that one of them is not you. All past versions are exactly like copies of you, made in a different place, and reacting in different ways, to the way you would right now. They're even /less/ like you than what we propose, even. The copy would be exactly as you are now, while no past version of you can claim the same.

Ultimately, you are not your body or your brain. You are a pattern which is currently supported on those media. If you aren't, it implies that the bundle of matter which currently contains you has some unique, uncopiable you-ness about it. Saying that a copy of you is not you implies that you believe in souls. It implies that something metaphysical confers you-ness upon the universe, rather than you-ness being contained entirely within the material realm. Perhaps you are not a materialist. That would allow you to continue to believe as you do. But be warned: rejecting a hypothesis which has thus far been confirmed by every single test ever devised requires something more than logic.

Anesthesia, on the other hand, induces a state where all the parts of the brain that are supposed to fire in unison instead fire in a slow, seconds-long wave moving from the front of the brain to the back. It is utterly unlike anything you find in normal operation. Furthermore, people under anesthesia often report going to sleep and then immediately waking in recovery with no percieved time gap.

Or to frame it another way, we are different from one instance to the next, changed from experience and environment.
