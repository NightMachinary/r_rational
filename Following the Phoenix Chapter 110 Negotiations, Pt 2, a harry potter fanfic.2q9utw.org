** Avada Kedavra is a great equaliser. Unblockable, easy to cast, not getting any better no matter if you're level 10 or 1000.

There are at least 2 people capable of casting Avada Kedavra at Tom, both of them are telepathicaly commanded by Harry and unable to disobey him.

Why are they even talking with Tom?

*** Thinking about AK made me remember something. In HPMOR ch86, Moody says:

#+begin_quote
  The first is that the Killing Curse strikes directly at the soul, and it'll just keep going until it hits one. Straight through shields. Straight through walls.
#+end_quote

As I recall, in canon the curse is stopped by inanimate objects (such as walls). For example, the centaur statue that Dumbledore used to block Voldemort's curse in the Ministry battle. Did EY get it wrong / change it for his AU, or is there something that I've forgotten about the books?

**** Pretty sure it does get blocked several times in canon by random objects. Presumably, EY changed it to remove the obvious block of "Conjure random inanimate object", as that makes calling it an unblockable curse far less impressive

**** I think that EY changed it with intent, but I can't be sure - there was a good stretch of time when he hadn't read all the books, and it might be that he misread the wiki.

You could call that a plot hole. Or the author can write in the next chapter that Tom has traps or dead-man switches on his person set to cause quite a lot of damage in the case that he dies.

EDIT: I mean, /I/ would go in there with a dead-man's switch. It's just obvious.

**** Can Dumbledore actually cast AK? I think I remember it being said somewhere that he isn't able to, if that's right then there's only the 2 adults capable and Lucius can be influenced by Tom as we see in Negotiations 3. Also Tom's proven to be an accomplished duelist so having him dodge is in no way a stretch.

Hmm on the note of interesting ways to counter AK, would transfiguring an object into an animal, say a brick into a cloud of gnats would they block AK?

Gnats probably don't have souls.

****** Except we see in the Rowling books that AK works on an insect of some description when 'Mad Eye Moody' is the defense teacher. It's also used on various other animals in the series including a fox and an owl.

This could come down to the MoR changes to magic. There's not really a mention of what AK does in ToS other than killing without leaving a mark.

** Minor typo: I think "dunked" should be "dumped".

Fun chapter -- Harry comes up with very sensible proposals and knows how to present them: "I surrender. Here's a list of suggestions on ways to keep my surrender from collapsing your economy and ruining your country. Just suggestions, mind you -- I'm happy to do it however you like. Still, might be a good idea to take them."

I like the fact that you remembered the "sense of doom" thing; I had forgotten about that. Seems to me that Dumbledore is in over his head on this one; I don't see how he can stand up to Quirriddlemort and simultaneously protect everyone else.

Also, what was the /Catena Magnus/ spell that Hermione cast?

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom]]

The word 'written' isn't actually used, so I assume she's referring to the above.

***** Hard for me to imagine any Brit referring to a constitution in that context, laws would seem more appropriate.

Must've remembered it wrong

Also I believe the author is female.

** So how did people feel about Harry's speech?

I wasn't too happy with it myself, some of the things he was saying and how he was saying them didn't fit too well.
