*** Yeah, this is a rough road ahead for Zorian, but when I read this segment I ended up sympathizing with Xvim a bit as well. Xvim just sold out his whole contact list to save the life of his student. Decades of friendships and acquaintances. An Archmage's rolodex. It can't be easy inviting someone to invade their minds. I can only assume Xvim is doing this only because he understands the magnitude of the task Zorian and Zach have in front of them.

True enough.

It could also be a test of whether Zorian is telling the truth about the loop. His willingness to do it, at what would otherwise be great risks - and his possession of their knowledge in future restarts - would be strong evidence.

Of course, it will also get more uncomfortable in future restarts when Zorian tells him, "I've been breaking into the minds of mages to steal their secrets, and oh, I just happen to know all about your contacts and the secret information you've collected about lots of important people - but I haven't been breaking into /your/ mind, honest!"

This seems extremely interesting, and might allow us to finally learn more about why Kana is the way she is. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if Fria actually transferred parts of her own memories, or of Namira's memories, to Kana, which could partly explain her behaviour. Of course, simply having the memories of someone older wouldn't mean that she wouldn't act as a child regardless, but it could explain her intelligence.

So, who knows? Hopefully, Silverlake comes back at some point in the future. Meeting Zorian's grandmother could also be interesting.

My basic theory is that, at one point, Red Robe was working together with Zach (under false pretenses) to collect the key. Zach might have assumed it was so they could more sufficiently control the time loop, but Red Robe's real plan was to obtain the powers over the time loop for himself. After obtaining the five pieces of the key (one from Oganj, who Zach is probably the only person who could take him down by himself), Red Robe quickly took Zach down using mind magic and wiped his memory of everything that had happened.

Zorian's plans look interesting too. It's about time he started recruiting other (human) mages and checking out enhancement potions (especially since they seem to have long-lasting effects). I was wondering when Nirthak (the combat instructor who blacklisted Zorian) was going to come up.

Re: Xvim:

Does this mean that Xvim has given his explicit consent to be completely mind magicked (it can't be mind rape if he says "yes")

If Zorian doesn't ask Xvim to be the first good/neutral arch-Mage he mentally interrogates, then I will be disappointed, since Xvim is the only person Zorian can really feel comfortable breaking to such a degree since he offered it as the strategy leading up to the final plan.

Re: Grey Hunter potions

Here's my guess of how what is to come... Zach will be the tempting bait and Zorian will just sneak into the spiders lair and steal some eggs. Then they use the potions and troll Xvim's most unsavory Rolodex contacts for power-leveling.

So that's more my thinking, except he makes the comment about the spiders so ehh...

With the rolodex, I can't help but think Xvim has sent him other mages who are ALSO mind mages or that he suspects to have some research into that area. I mean if I were xvim they'd be the first names to go on that list. Get zorian the knowledge about his strongest play.

That and Xvim is good but there have to be people who are better, hell I'd be willing to bet there are a few contacts in there with contacts with the spiders.

The risks are massively increased.

I agree that most people won't be at Zorian's level but I doubt all of them are pushovers.

My wager is because the aranea have traded or kidnapped mages in the past. I doubt they've ever tried to interact with the taboo of mind magic and closing off of the web but there are always weirdos like the witch.

If anything I'd argue the reverse could also be applied here. Yes, he can act as he pleases because he knows the reset will fix things, and can't once he leaves. In another sense, the only attempt that matters is the one outside. The invasion, the primordial summoning, the mansion, everything that could go wrong matters a magnitude more because there will be actual consequences.

I do most of my browsing on a desktop. When on mobile, I use Firefox on Android, and have yet to come across a /single/ website where the mobile version is preferable to the desktop.

While the fictionpress/fanfiction mobile site is nowhere near as bad as most, I nonetheless, find it almost unusable because the text is so large as to make it extremely uncomfortable to read. As far as I can tell, it entirely disregards browser text size preferences. I do not know enough about modern HTML and CSS to say whether this is the fault of the browser or the site. On desktop, shortcuts to change the text size (i.e. Ctrl-scroll) work fine on the mobile site, so I'm not sure why this is.

So on mobile I use Firefox's "reader view" which essentially just extracts the text and displays it without formatting. It also provides the means to adjust the text size to something far more comfortable, and works equally well on the mobile or desktop versions.

Before I discovered "reader view" I used the desktop site on my phone. I had to zoom in so that the margins fell off-screen, but at that point it was comfortably readable and far superior to the mobile site.

On desktop the mobile site works fine if the browser is narrowed to a reasonable width, but is otherwise essentially unreadable. It /does/ scale better to narrower widths, but having such a size-constrained screen on a desktop is virtually unheard-of.

*** I /really/ like Zorian's rationale for not behaving like the loop is his personal playground, though. The consequences to his own character are the only ones that will remain in effect, and they could be severe. He's being selfish, but in a good way.

With every step down the slope of morality, you find yourself more willing to take more steps. Precommitment would be useful here, but I certainly wouldn't be confident in myself being able to remain true to it.

Oooooh. Remember how Zorian talked about advanced mindmagic techniques that could be used /for that exact purpose/ a while ago?

  But it was effective -- his ability to interpret aranean memories was growing by leaps and bounds, and he had even identified what the high-ranking aranea were doing with their own minds.

  They were manipulating their own thoughts, doing things like filtering distractions out of their senses, blunting inconvenient emotional highs and placing compulsions on their own behavior. It seemed to be a way to increase productivity and ensure better decision making.

*** Thankfully you can't. It doesn't matter if they will die anyway afterwards, since it's not about them but himself. Ignore those moral alarm bells too often and he'd end up a very different person than he wanted to be when the loop ends. It's a slippery slope and you're suggesting hurling himself off at full speed.

** Question: I read MoL back when it was much shorter. I can't remember the exact chapter number but our plucky MC had only recently started venturing out of the academy for his loops.

To all of you that are fully caught up: how close do you think we are to the story's conclusion? I plan to pick it back up and read it straight from beginning to end.

  Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  A: The story basically has 3 arcs, and I finished two as of chapter 54. So I'm about 2/3 of the way done.

I can't see Alanic just tamely following along and agreeing to be kept in the dark. Maybe the Mesalian Order is a sect that was dedicated to time research and was wiped out by the gods as punishment, or something.
