Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Why do people always assume being a jerk is equivalent to be being smart?

I see this a lot when reading comments about Rick and Morty (and in the show itself), where people seem to buy pretty hard in the idea that Rick being selfish and arrogant is directly related to how smart he is.

I... don't get it? Maybe it's because I've been exposed to a lot of smart, charismatic kind people, so the idea of a smart charismatic asshole doesn't appeal to me, but... yeah, this bothers me.

*** I've started to think of this as a narrative necessity more than anything.

When you build a character, they need strengths and weaknesses to really feel "real" or be interesting. They need flaws, even if that flaw is tied to their strength or virtue.

If you have a character whose primary virtue or strength is their combat prowess, or empathy, or bravery, or whatever, then making them of "average" intelligence is an easy flaw to give them. Not just because it makes the writer's job easier, both for the bar it sets in conflict complexity and for easy conflict generation, but also because it makes it easy for them to make mistakes. It also makes them easier to empathize with as soon as you put a "smart" character into the mix to spout techno/magic babble and have them be exasperated or confused.

So if intelligence is such a valuable and easy flaw to put into a character, what happens if you make it their primary strength?

Well, you've got to weaken some other part of them. Take away their combat prowess or bravery and they quickly cease to be a hero. Take away their competence in whatever field is important and their intelligence starts to feel suspect.

But oh, hey, if you take away their empathy or charisma, now you have a "realistic" character with flaws and strengths! Sure, they'll tend to be a bit socially clueless or weird, but that makes them quirky and amusing! Sure, they might become a bit of an asshole or arrogant, but that gives them a flaw for all the other characters to point out! Hell, now the reader can even feel a bit smug: sure, they might not be able to play five games of chess from memory simultaneously, or whatever passes for intelligence in most fiction, but they're at least people-smart enough to know not to be an asshole to their friends or family, or so socially clueless that they embarrass themselves constantly!

There's likely more to it than just this, some high profile real world examples probably influence the public zeitgeist, but in regards to fiction? It's hard to really write a character that's smart AND charismatic AND brave AND empathetic AND everything else they need to be relatable and a hero, without having a Mary Sue on your hands. So social skills and/or empathy are generally the easiest things to cut.

**** I agree, but I frame the situation differently. I personally don't find Rick or characters like him to be interesting, relatable, or "realistic" by any measure. So the explanation I have for why he's written that way is to generate additional conflict. Rick is so powerful that the narrative conforms to his whims, and a way to keep that narrative moving in interesting directions to to have him constantly be at odds with everyone around him.

Rick doesn't like people and they don't like him, even though the plot always forces them together, so it's interesting to see how they interact and react to the situations he gets them into. He's also callous for the sake of dark comedy and meta-commentary on the genres being parodied, but if I'm judging the show just as a soft sci-fi adventure then I think the writers made Rick an asshole so they had a way to keep the plot moving in unexpected directions.

****** I'm not a fan of the terms "flaw" and "weakness" when used to describe a character's personality. I prefer thinking of their traits in terms of their role in the narrative, like how TV Tropes [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/MakeInterestingCharacters][How to Make Interesting Characters]] refers to the dichotomy as "Admirable" and "Accessible". The former makes you wish you were like that character and the latter makes you feel like you are that character.

I think it's also important to think about characters in terms of their qualities that create conflicts vs the ones that resolve conflicts rather than call them strengths and weaknesses. Though I may be biased on this point because I fanatically believe that "realism", as an ideal to reach for in storytelling, is pointlessly restrictive when the rules of a narrative are always subjective to the artist's desires and worldview.

**** Yeah, that works well for why antagonists or side characters are often written as smart and cruel. For protagonists, I also think seeing someone socially dominate others can be particularly cathartic if the "enemy" is considered deserving by the author/audience.

I don't know if Dan Harmon considers smarts an undeserved form of status, but being able to embody his more misanthropic characteristics and puppet Rick around [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOBoKxEcVAA][calling out the "idiocy" of the world around him]] is probably enjoyable to him as well as his audience, even if he does it with self-awareness.

*** "Rick is an asshole because he's smart" is, I think, the surface level reading that the show puts forward, and that's where most people stop. The deeper level of the character is "Rick justifies being an asshole as being because he's better than other people due to how smart he is", which is what I kind of think that the show is going for.

I /especially/ think that because Dan Harmon is both smart and a self-confessed asshole, and has said on numerous occasions that he uses his virtues as an excuse for his faults, like, "I'm an asshole, but it's only because I'm so talented and artistically pure, only because I actually care about the thing that I'm making". Which he then says he /knows/ is kind of just an excuse for being shitty.

And I know a fair number of smart people who are assholes, and this doesn't seem to be an isolated thing; if you're smart /and/ an asshole, then it's easy to say "well my faults are only because I'm so virtuous" as a way of not taking responsibility for (or making corrections for) those faults. Similarly you hear a fair amount of "being smart is a curse" from people who think that they're smart, for the same reasons. It's not that much different from someone saying, "All my problems are because I'm pretty!"

**** I didn't really want to rant about the show on the Monday thread, but I'll consider this an excuse >:P

I think the show is more or less self-aware about the "smart = asshole" thing, depending on the episode. The therapist episode addresses it head on, with the therapist telling Rick he's in denial, and doesn't want to admit he's in control of the harm he causes.

Then you have other episodes, and tendencies, which push in the other direction. Simple Rick (and Fake Flashback Rick) is a loving father, and he renounced Science. Dumdum Rick is kind and respectful of Jerry. Healthy Rick is kind of a dumbass. Morty becomes both smarter and more aggressive / manipulative as time goes on.

I do think the ultimate point of the show is as you say, but it's not completely consistent, so it's not just "people miss the real point".

**** The show even calls Rick out on this and says that there's no causal link between his intelligence and his assholishness in the therapist episode with the "You use intelligence to justify sickness" speech.

Personally I think Rick's deal, as presented by the show, is that he's smart enough to get a proper look at the bigger picture - where there are infinite universes and we are just tiny insignificant specks that don't really matter in that bigger picture - but he hasn't taken the next step to reconcile that perspective with his humanity. He just kind of shrugs his shoulders and uses it to justify all of his terrible actions as inconsequenital in the grand scheme of things, even though it's clearly fucked up when you zoom in and look at all the individuals involved.

1. Stupid people inherently are worth less than smart people, and therefore deserve less consideration.\\
2. People who think at different paces naturally get annoyed at having to slow down or speed up to match each other.\\
3. The contrast is, not only =smart vs. stupid=, but also =knowledgeable vs. ignorant=. To a person who is both smart and knowledgeable, a person who is both stupid and ignorant seems to have wasted what little talent he had. While a lack of intelligence cannot be remedied and may deserve more pity than disdain, the latter person seems to have /willfully/ compounded his inborn disability by not even bothering to educate himself.

  Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition associated with elevated frequency of clinical co-morbidities and cognitive impairment. The neurobiology of bipolar disorder is not completely understood. Recent evidence has implicated immune dysfunction in its physiopathology. Here, we review several data supporting the presence of immunological dysfunction in bipolar disorder: (i) increased frequency of autoimmune diseases; (ii) distinct immune cells profile; (iii) altered/ release of cytokines by stimulated mononuclear cells; (iv) elevated levels of circulating immune markers; and (vi) inflammatory changes in the central nervous system. We also discussed the interplay between immunological dysfunction and neuroprogression in bipolar disorder.

**** What I found really interesting was:

- The "brain"-level disorder and the "body"-level disorders feed back on each-other, so even once you've "treated" the brain-level bipolarity, the autoimmune problems and hormone abnormalities don't necessarily stop aggravating the brain. You can't treat the brain alone, because the body will keep spurring it into episodes.

- On the other hand, you might be able to find a /very/ clear immune marker for the disorder, more accurate and precise than you'd get from an assessment of symptoms a la the DSM. This will help a /lot/, since there are /tons/ of ambiguous diagnoses of bipolar, since it has a long tail of atypical symptomatic profiles.
