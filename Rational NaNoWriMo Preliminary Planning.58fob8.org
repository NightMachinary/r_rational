*PLANNING THREAD*

National November Writing Month is almost here with only ten days left!

While there was already a planning thread a [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53ns0s][month]] ago, this is for any new ideas now that we're closer to the start date.

- Figure out your characters!

- What is the goal or conflict you want to write?

- How will everyone interact with each other?

- When will event A happen versus B in your plot!

- What will you show to your readers?

It's strongly advised that you talk about what you're having trouble with and to only give brief details on your overall structure of the story rather than share everything. Otherwise you will be less motivated to write the story after spending your excitement and energy sharing every detail of your ideas. Brainstorming can make writing the story seem boring, since once you go over a scene multiple times in excruciating detail during the planning stage, you'll have to do it again when you actually write it.

Here's the [[https://campnanowrimo.org/sign_in][NaNoWriMo]] site.

Here's the link to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/nanowrimo][wiki page]].

Happy RaNoWriMo!


** I finished nano last year but the plot was kind of full of holes, so this year I'm doing actual planning. So far I have:

- A world which is like our own with one difference, a very few people get reborn as their younger selves (mental time travel) - so you are five years old but with all the memories you had when you 'died'

- A semi-plausible but untestable explanation of why that might be - so it's not just done by magic or gods, at least.

- A handwavy 'invisible hand' that keeps history almost exactly the same - which is probably the least rational bit that I can't easily fix.

- A protagonist who is born in 1955 and lives into the near future. No, I haven't fixed what the near future is going to be like yet, and yes, that makes the story easily outdated. That's kind of a problem, but I need to do it cos I DON'T want to write anyone older who lives through WWII (too many terrible tropes)

- An antagonist mentor, sort of. I have been interrogating them in the bath (when I'm in the bath, I mean, I talk to my characters when I'm bathing for some reason) so I know their aims and why they think they are a good person trying to do the right thing. Some terrible tropes averted - I hope.

- A character and family background for my protagonist (working on antagonist.)

- Not enough other characters - how many is enough? I know my last book had too many, so maybe starting with too few is good?

- Zero love interest (don't know if I want one, probably not.)

- More subplots than I have room for, in terms of ways to munchkin your foreknowledge, ways to survive doing childhood AGAIN etc.

- A couple of bits of actually worked out foreshadowing.

- Not enough of an idea on what order I will show things to the reader

- Unanswered questions: like how many reborn are there? What do they have in common? And any other unanswered questions I get from here

- I'm still a bit fuzzy on the ending, but I do have a couple of ideas, either of which could lead into a sequel, but hopefully not in an obviously unfinished looking way...

And I only have ten days before it starts - no idea if I can finish planning by then. /is scared/

You could use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)][Isaac Asimov's Psychohistory]] as an explanation. If you limit the number of people that are reborn, then in the greater scheme of things, events are usually bound to happen. For instance, there is a real list of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries][multiple independent discoveries]] that you can lean on.

For example, even if someone goes back and kills Hitler, the German people still had at least a civil war coming due to the socio-economic pressures after World War 1. Events and inventions rarely happen in isolation.

I am going to assume room temp fusion is a no go, so there will be a belated push for cutting energy use, plus renewables and a subculture of some people wanting to go back to the land.

That's the one I probably take the most issue with. There doesn't seem to be any real reason for that to exist, especially assuming battery tech doesn't get a lot better and AR exists.

I'd expect that to be a gimmick that generally doesn't do too well. For people who want always-on computing, carrying AR specs will work better. For people who don't, are they going to accept the battery trade-off implied by a flexible screen?

** Arrggh, I only just started posting my giant Naruto fanfic and then you mentioned this, and now I have a great new idea for a totally different story that I can't get out of my head:

It's a Worm-esque setting where young people across the world suddenly develop powers, only instead of the powers being super useful and convenient they're terrifying because A) the users get no feedback whatsoever and so they don't know what they're doing (teleportation without knowing where you will teleport to, let's say) and B) you only gets powers if you have a certain extreme personality type, and the crazier you are the more powerful you get. So the whole world quickly goes to hell as a result, and our (slightly less crazy) protagonists have to (maybe?) save the day.

The powers I have in mind, depending on craziness:\\
1. Asperger/introverted: Telekinesis, mental type power\\
2. sociopathy/dissociative disorder: Bending space/time/reality\\
3. chaotic/manic/borderline types: Energy manipulation, i.e. nuke everything\\
4. Some sort of life/mind/body manipulation power?

What do you guys think? Sound interesting or not? I'll probably finish NTBS first before I write any of it regardless, just to be on the safe side...

**** The plot pretty much writes itself: Rational protagonist experiences trauma, awakens superpower, is thrown into a world gone crazy where superpowered gangs fight eachother for domination, joins up with other superpower users and tries to stop everything from going to hell...

Actually that sounds a /lot/ like worm now that I think about it. More focus on the mystical aspects of the magic and its effect on society though, and less about giant monsters destroying everything. Still... hm.

*** What do you want to describe the magic energy as? As a liquid roiling through the body? As a tank of energy/MP bar? As solid particles instead of liquids or more of a fluid-like description? Go for /how/ you plan on describing the magic energy and how it will be used. Knowing the desired wording which will be associated with it can help to influence a name. You can decide on harsh /k/ syllables, smoother /m/ syllables, long and grandiose names, short and catchy name, and other qualities of the word you want before coming up with examples.

** I'm flip flopping between a story where two people with different time-travel abilities are in conflict like I [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53ns0s/rational_nanowrimo/d7uo6pm][mentioned]] before or to just write a story about the RPG-style scientific experiments of someone investigating the self-consistent time-travel power with no antagonists interfering.

The first one is more material I can write and is easier to structure a plot around, but there's a lot of work and world-building I still have to do ahead of time. The second one is better and might help me plan the first story as a 'sequel' of sorts. It's also easier to write with minimal preplanning. I only need the rules for one power and don't even need any world-building (it'll be something I can write as part of the story as I progress rather than something I do in the background). It'd be an extensive manual or guide to explain how Stable Time Loops works under many scenarios. I might even write about multiple Stable Time Loops with varying algorithms selecting from several potential stable loops.

I'll probably do the second story and use it as a 'manual' where I act as a GM after NaNoWriMo for the folks here investigating a strange time travel device. It'll be fun to do. I did something [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/32m6di/experimenting_with_time_travel/][similar]] a year ago and botched that one, so I'd like to try it again with better planning and a weekly hypothesis testing.

Eh, I'll just write about both and count the two of them towards my total word count.

*** I see some common themes in our two stories :-)

I'm curious to know how your protagonist discovers they have this power, since so little information is carried back, but once they're learnt to iterate it can be seriously useful.

I love mostly world building stories myself, almost to the point of finding plot a nuisance sometimes, but I think you do need a conflict to hang your first scenario on. Maybe you have this in hand already.

For me if I can learn to get things right by iteration I could certainly win at life FSVO, but there is a downside, or at least a cost.

Do I age as I do multiple time loops, or is it mental time travel only? I won't get Groundhog style bored if you don't remember the loops, but I will get bored of sticking to my planning and pre-commitment routine, so I'd need a good reason to go to the trouble, which will be more gripping if it's not just getting rich and winning the partner of my choice or whatever.

And at what point do I give up. I mean if I've worked out that I reset this loop eleventy times and it still goes wrong, do I accept that?

In both cases, they are genius physicists who managed to invent their respective machines. It's the main reason for them meeting up in the first scenario, because they know each other vaguely as respected names in the required background fields to invent their technology. Also it's strikingly common to have multiple people invent/discover scientific devices/principles simultaneously throughout history, so this is another instance. I might even sneak in foreknowledge warnings to force a meeting as well.

I don't really, which is why I'm having so much trouble with the first scenario. What's a Good vs Good conflict I can involve the two in which doesn't lead to them cooperating once they meet or have one of them be a psychopath? They need to be intelligent and emotionally competent individuals. I'm actually hoping for a moral conflict like in Three Worlds Collide between the SuperHappy Aliens and Fun Humans. A future disaster where they think the other person is the initiating cause? Their devices both operate off of (seemingly) incompatible theories and they argue over it? I like the last one, but I have no idea how to resolve the conflict since the two time-travel abilities *are* incompatible, and have bizarre interactions.

For the reset power, it's only receiving a single bit of information from the future to indicate a reset with no memories attached. Planning and precommitments are /mandatory/, for the optimal use of it. I'll be focusing on multiple users with the power interacting once I finish going through all of the exploits with a single user and the hilarious failures when you don't precommit. Situations where you need multiple uses with very little time to plan things out would also be interesting. For the stable time loop power, only messages are passed back with no memories sent back and are self-consistent.

#+begin_quote
  And at what point do I give up. I mean if I've worked out that I reset this loop eleventy times and it still goes wrong, do I accept that?
#+end_quote

There's a small time delay from loop to loop. If you reset once, you need to wait a few seconds before you can get a signal from the future to indicate a second reset (remember you don't keep your memories so you can't know how many times you have reset if you don't precommit to only reset once per savepoint). So given enough loops, you'll run out of time before you face the dangerous situation.

** Here are Mette Ivie Harrison's 12 questions you should ask yourself about your system of magic.

1.  How is it learned and executed?

2.  How is it accessed?

3.  Does it have a will of its own?

4.  Is it restricted in space and time?

5.  What does available magic do?

6.  How does it relate to the character, plot and theme of the book?

7.  What is the cost of magic?

8.  What can it not do?

9.  How long does it last?

10. Who can use it?

11. How do others react to it?

12. Why haven't people with this power taken over the world?

If you want a more in-depth discussion on magic, I highly recommend Brandon Sanderson's 3 laws of magic. He discusses how limiting magic can increase the way it can be used by the characters instead of having them wave their hand and solve all their problems without effort.

** I want to write the schlockiest schlock that ever schlocked that's a sort of mix between XCOM and the X-Files, where the villain is a eldritch cult transplanting humans to other planets and dimensions for...reasons.

One of the two viewpoint characters is going to have been a baby sacrifice meant for an interrupted ritual twenty years ago, and work as both a stand in to get the audience up to speed and as a McGuffin for the rest of the cast. He'll get thrown into generic fantasy world and be seperate from the rest of events as he figures out the mechanics of some of the paranormal stuff mostly for the readers benefit.

The other viewpoint character is a new member of the XCOM wannabees, recruited for his natural resistance against the sanity warping effects of the cult and other supernatural stuff.

How do I write schlock that's fun to read, without being too eye rolling? How do I make it sound intentionally over the top and not just bad?
