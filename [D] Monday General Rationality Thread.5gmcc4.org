Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/70u/rationality_lessons_learned_from_irrational/][So, this is one of the funniest things]] ever written on Less Wrong in terms of how much I laughed when I read it:

#+begin_quote
  So I broke up with Alice over a long conversation that included an hour-long primer on evolutionary psychology in which I explained how natural selection had built me to be attracted to certain features that she lacked. I thought she would appreciate this because she had previously expressed admiration for detailed honesty. Now I realize that there's hardly a /more/ damaging way to break up with someone. She asked that I kindly never speak to her again, and I can't blame her.
#+end_quote

But later on I began to think about this in light of my own break-up experiences, especially the detailed honesty thing, since I'm a firm believer in honesty, especially in romantic relationships.

It's not the detailed honesty that was bad, it was the way Luke did it. It has to be done with good intentions. When you give honest critique of someone, it has to be about something important and you have to make sure that the other person really benefits from it. This is why it's often advised when giving critique that you pepper it with good things about the person or what the person did as to make sure that you don't devastate the other person and she gets the feeling that you still accept her as a person.

By â€˜certain features' Luke probably meant her body, and there are many things about our bodies that we cannot really change. So, talking detailedly for an hour (hours?) about something she can't change feels incredibly cruel to me, and it's not really even useful for her. (Note, this was about 10 years ago, Luke is probably much wiser now.)

On the other hand, I was really glad that when we broke up with my last girlfriend, she told me honestly and even detailedly what she thought were the reasons for this break-up. There were several things: I couldn't keep things that were supposed to stay between us from going to other people, she felt that sometimes we didn't really understand each other and I sometimes hurt her about things she was sensitive about. We and I tried to foster an environment of honesty in our relationship, even about critique. All the time we talked about why we should break up, I was really glad she talked about it so honestly because these are the kind of things I could change and have since changed about my behavior when interacting with potential partners and friends later on. And of course it was also due to the way she did it, which is totally opposite from how Luke did it.

This is what I believe even though I also believe that when we describe why we feel the way we do, those descriptions don't usually capture the whole picture or the real reason for those feelings. [[http://www.people.virginia.edu/%7Etdw/wilson,advances.1989.pdf][See this study.]] In the case of our break-up, I think the real reason was something like I wasn't accustomed enough to behave like people behaved in her social sphere and I wasn't confident or high status enough at the end of our relationship -- not literally, but something along those lines. Still, that doesn't change the fact that her critique benefited me.

Second, I've done that (or something quite similar) before, and it went about as well as you'd expect. I had the best of intentions: I just wanted to show how our relationship had become toxic to both us and our friend group, but in hindsight it was a bad move. Finally, I took this into account on this very day, as a friend confessed to fancying me (though, to be fair, I had long since worked it out).

Basically, all this to say, I enjoyed the read and found it quite relevant to my current situation.

/That said/, if you had some proper solution to naturalized induction (building in naturalist reductionism as an /a priori/ mode of thought for the AI rather than an /a posteriori/ conclusion given certain data), it would still be potentially dangerous to train your agent in that kind of environment. Maybe? I can imagine ways it would be, and I would not want to try it without lots of safety assurances.

Personally, while I see the arguments for it, I'm against it (barring any sort of medical life-or-death scenario where the life of the child must be weighed against the life of the mother). Not being sure where to classify life beginning, I think it makes sense to take the safest route and say at conception, given that at that point the zygote has the capacity to grow into a fully independent human. And ending a human's life for no reason other than convenience's sake seems wrong to me.

**** Um... your argument has a severe problem.

Consider, by analogy, the death penalty. Sometimes people are ordered to be killed by a court for some offense (such as murder). So, the court needs to calculate the risk of someone staying alive in some manner.

And yes, the court's system of adjudicating who gets to live and who gets to die will, on occasion, lead to some fairly drastic mistakes (and has done so in the past). But the solution is /not/ to give the victim of any crime a gun and ten consequence-free minutes alone with the accused, because that will lead to even /more/ mistakes being made.

Similarly, just giving abortions to anyone who asks is certain to lead to /more/ mistakes than actually making the attempt to decide who does or does not get to abort. No system of decision will be perfect, but it's not hard to be better than not having a system at all.

***** You made my argument better than I did. My point was that there is a tradeoff, like in the death penalty you might let some criminals live to prevent wrongly convicted innocents from dying, or vice-versa, depending on your values. If you value the lives of innocents more than retribution to criminals (like we do) then death penalty will be either not allowed or be severely restricted.

The relative value of a woman's life vs an unborn's life is less clear, because they are both very valuable depending on who you ask. If you ask me the woman is more valuable and it's better that 10 safe unborn die rather from abortion than 1 woman die from some complication caused by a pregnancy wrongly considered safe.

*** I think that abortion should be completely legal during the first trimester, and strongly discouraged though perhaps not entirely criminalized afterward (with emphasis on adoption if a late-term baby is no longer desired). With some late-term exceptions for life of the mother and extreme or fatal fetal defects.

My criteria include the mental development of the fetus and the value of the future person. In the early stages, a fetus is a potential person but without mental life, and I don't think unconscious potential people automatically have the right to be instantiated. Later on, the fetus acquires more and more mental attributes, and these should be considered valuable. Even though we slaughter animals all the time which are probably even more conscious, there is still an argument to be made that a proto-human should be valued more strongly than an animal due to the person it could grow up to be (whereas an animal will not exceed a certain limited capacity of mind). Since I don't believe in infanticide, and I don't believe in making arbitrary distinctions between a fully-formed baby inside and outside the womb, I am forced to conclude that late-term abortions are just as wrong as killing babies. (Whereas early term abortions are just as wrong as using contraceptives, that is, not at all).

Regardless of the other issues, I think all abortions are unaesthetic and should be generally discouraged, especially through contraception, although we should also try our hardest to not stigmatize women who have had abortions. Doing both of these things at the same time seems difficult, however.

#+end_quote

But it doesn't really have that potential at that point. It's just a cluster of cells, a human still has to incubate and nurture this cluster of cells for months on end before it even gets a heartbeat, and then a human has to invest years more teaching them how to human.

Now, conception is by far the safest place to say that a human life starts, since that's the point that they begin existing as a genetically unique entity, however, every bug is also a genetically unique entity and genetic uniqueness isn't really something I consider an important trait for defining a cluster of cells as a person or not.

The problem really stems from the fact that there's no discrete point where the brain 'turns on.' If there was, you could just point to that point and say 'and now they're a person' but brain development isn't polar, it's a gradual bootstrapping up from first principles that continue in the form of learning even after birth, so that's not useful either. We eat pigs and have no problem with that, yet pigs have the intelligence of three-year-olds^{[[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/opinion/thinking-about-pigs-before-theyre-food.html][[1]]].} Obviously, the idea of eating three-year-olds is utterly abhorrent, but the fact we consider it abhorrent really is just neural programming on our part, since our species uses K-pattern selection.

But given the pig thing, we're being pretty hypocritical in the way we treat other species versus ourselves, and we don't ever really think about it. We eat creatures that are more aware, more conscious, more capable of feeling pain, and more capable of emotions, that do have the mental capacity developed to code for long-term memories, than any of the fetuses we're aborting, and yet abortions are this huge horrible thing simply because the fetus /could/ someday be more of a person than the animals we eat.

But you know? Fine, I get that. We're humans, scope insensitivity is a thing and if humans experience less empathy for people of other ethnic groups than the ones they grew up exposed to, they most certainly feel less empathy for animals than they're capable of feeling towards humans. Maybe it is hypocritical, but its also sort of a required survival trait of any species that they put their own survival first.

I do think the question of abortion is one of autonomy, not one about the fetus at all. It's really a question of whether we should force women who get pregnant to be baby incubators for 9 months, followed by caring for a child for 18 years until society has decided they're an adult. When I talk about this with conservative people, is that this is usually the part of the conversation we're having that they tell me that pregnancy is the result of sex, and sex has consequences, and if you didn't want to get pregnant you shouldn't be going around having sex. I really hate that argument because it flies completely in the face of billions of successive years of evolution telling us to go fuck each other, and all the powerful biochemical and neurological signals that have been honed by thousands of generations of natural selection to put a powerful urge in us to do just that. It's also really annoying because if those people really want to reduce the number of abortions, the best way to do that would be with safe sex education and easier access to contraceptives. But instead, the same people who are against abortions are also against birth control, which really shows to me that the majority of them aren't coming from a desire to prevent death, or improve the world, but instead to punish women who deviate from the cultural values. They tell women they can't get abortions, make it harder, closer clinics, regardless of whether they can take care of the child after they're born or not, and then when they end up having the child, those same people are working to cut funding from WIC and other programs designed to help poor families. Planned Parenthood may be the largest abortion provider in the country, but they're also the largest abortion /preventer/ in the country. If you don't get pregnant in the first place, you don't need an abortion. For people who want to reduce abortions, they're spending a lot of time attacking Planned Parenthood and contraceptive access.

But Sage, you say, this is the rationalist community and we /do/ care about those things. We /do/ want to prevent death and improve the world. Right now, given that, supporting pro-choice policies is, at least from my perspective, the best way to go about minimizing harm. The thing about abortions is that they happen whether they are legal or not, safe or not. In Texas in the last year, there were between 100,000 and 250,000 home abortions performed after conservative lawmakers forced over half the Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas to close^{[[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/100000-texas-women-have-tried-to-self-induce-abortion/][[2]]].} How many of those pregnancies would have just never happened in the first place if those Planned Parenthoods had stayed open to provide access to contraceptives? To add to that, home abortions are much more dangerous to the life of the women since they have no medical supervision and are in many cases just buying pills offline and hoping for the best, or drinking a fuckton and hoping they'll miscarry, or any number of things like that. As long as the question is 'which is more important, the fetus XOR the autonomy of the woman?' The answer should always be the person who exists right now, not the distant potential for personhood.

But that might not always be the question. Right now, there is a certain range of premature births that can be survived using equipment like incubators. We can also generate zygotes outside of the body in the first place. So there are just a certain range months that currently require a human to be the incubator, and that range is shrinking. In fifty more years, if we manage to shrink that range to zero, and have full blown womb tanks, then the act of producing a child won't require a human incubator at all. Once that shift happens, it's not a XOR statement, and you can have autonomy for the woman, and life for the fetus. When the tech shift allows it, I expect cultural attitudes to swing back towards considering abortion to be a bad thing, if for no other reason than that I suspect our neural hardware would compel us to behave in that manner.

In ethics, he says you should care about people.

I like it for three main reasons:

1. A one week old baby, to me, is less of a sentient being than a fully grown cow is. A dairy cow will mourn her calf when it gets taken away; a week old baby really seems to be food-in-poop-out.

2. It bites the bullet that although a zygote is /human/, it's not yet a /person/.

3. It says abortion is OK because infanticide is OK.

Now, this doesn't mean that I can go to visit a newborn baby in hospital and snap her neck and that's ethical; her parents would no doubt be distraught by this, and her parents are people who should have their preference for not having their baby murdered satisfied. So you can't just go murdering babies left and right, but that's because of the /parents/ rather than the babies themselves.

But say me and my husband have a baby and we find out upon birth that it has a rare condition that will result in it being confined to a bed for its short life. So we think long and hard about it and are making a considered, rational decision, can't we make the decision to give this baby (humane) euthanasia rather than let it live such a life?

As for where to draw the line, I'm not sure. I'm not a baby-ologist and it's never going to come up as I don't see infanticide legalised any time soon. I would say two years old is *definitely* old enough to be safe from my infanticidal ways. Probably the line would be somewhere around 1-6 months, but leave that for the babyologists.

I feel it would be remiss of me not to add that, by the way, I'm a woman with a functional uterus as I suspect the vast majority of people in this already very crowded thread cannot say the same thing.

If they don't, their arguments for being anti-abortion is mostly just faith-based beliefs and virtue signalling rather than a thought-out, careful examination of the data and ethics involved.

The reason arguments about the sanctity of life don't apply to potential people, aka fetuses, for me, is that people who make such arguments rarely ever seem to consider the potential-potential people that abortions bring into being.

Maybe because it seems too abstract for most, but for me it's anything but. My mom had two pregnancies before my older brother and I were born. If those two pregnancies had gone to term, my brother and I wouldn't exist. My parents wanted two kids, and they got two kids.

Sometimes I wonder about my potential siblings, and sure, in a perfect world all four of us would exist and live our lives together and no one would go hungry or struggle to pay the bills as a result of having 4 kids when you could barely afford 2, but in the real world I'm pretty happy with being alive and think it was sensible for my parents to wait until they could afford kids.

If contraceptives were an unambiguous good, I'd promote them, and I don't flatly object to them, but in the context of preventing unwanted pregnancies among those who might otherwise abort, I see them as incentivising a behavior that /remains quite risky/.

If there's anything that decades of abstinence-only education in the most religious states has shown, it's that casual sex is going to happen anyway. Whether it increases or decreases by some minor amount doesn't really interest me.

What does is the notion that somehow the introduction of sex-ed and contraception /increases/ the rates of pregnancy and STD spread, when the best evidence I've seen says the opposite. Some quick googling:

[[https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/access-to-free-birth-control-reduces-abortion-rates/]]

There's tons more out there. As far as I'm aware there's no evidence that doesn't come from blatantly religious sources that doesn't show a reduction in pregnancies and STDs due to improved access to contraception and sex-ed, not just in the USA but in every country where they've been introduced.

On the other hand, those long-acting contraceptives don't give any protection at all against STDs, not even the limited protection of a condom (which will stop HIV, but not, for example, chlamydia).

So my above point about contraceptives incentivising risky behavior stands, with the nature of the risk being determined by the nature of the contraceptive.

Judging by how many young religious people marry early for reasons like lust and infatuation just to regret it afterwards I'd say that that's a plus against abstinence as well. In fact I think it is downright irresponsible for two people to marry if they aren't already sharing a household, and how often do couples sharing a household still stay abstinent?

And beyond that there is the case of sexual incompatibility. So even if they could share a household but not be sexually active that still ends wrongly too often for comfort. Which means that marrying someone you haven't had sex with is only a smart idea if you're both asexual or asexual-adjacent.

From what I read all of those cases were due to human error. Do you believe that someone who usually uses a condom but is okay with "just this once" foregoing it would not have any sex if there hadn't been any condoms available in the first place? I mean they have already proven themselves to be okay with condomless sex.

Then there is something the studies don't explore, which is stable or even married couples that don't want children (yet or ever) and are willing to abort a pregnancy for that reason. What are the chances that with the copious amounts of sex that young adult couples have they wouldn't have been pregnant many times over if not for contraceptives?

The idea that contraceptives and abortions have a negative effect on relationships seems wrong to me even just on an anecdotal level. My family definitely wouldn't have been better off if I had a bunch of siblings instead of just one sister. Neither would my parents have stayed together for very long if they had foregone most sex in order to prevent having more children.

IUDs are incontroversially good at decreasing abortion rates. The question of STDs, however, is of course a completely separate point to the abortion one.

  Advocates for Youth undertook exhaustive reviews of existing programs to compile a list of programs that have been proven effective by rigorous evaluation. Twenty-six effective programs were identified, twenty-three of which included comprehensive sex education as at least one component of the program. The other programs were early childhood interventions. Of the 23 effective, comprehensive sex education programs:

  Fourteen programs demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the timing of first sex.

  13 programs showed statistically significant declines in teen pregnancy, HIV, or other STIs.

Most people don't believe they're being hypocritical, in general :P I'm not trying to attack you or your life choices, just your beliefs about "what's best for society" and maybe your epistemology, if it's based on deontological ethics rather than ethics that look at the data and care about the consequences.

I believe that you believe that advocating sex-after-permanent-commitment is a better option, but as I've shown, all the most comprehensive research has consistently shown that to be untrue for decades, if our goals are to unwanted reduce pregnancy/abortion and STDs.

From my own personal life and perspective, I'm the last person to advocate for casual sex, and obviously if people actually reduce casual sex and confine themselves to sex with long term, serious partners, STDs and unwanted pregnancies would go down. But that's the world as we want it to be. The reality we live in is that people are going to have sex even if they're told not to, and in that reality the most effective ways to reduce the negatives associated with it seem to be to educate them about safe sex and promote protection from STDs and pregnancy.

If you oppose abortion and contraception and ignore the evidence that contraception is effective at reducing abortion rates because you dislike the the implications of increased contraception use, then you're not necessarily being hypocritical, but you aren't being fully honest about what you value, whether to yourself or to others.

Meaning if it's more important to you that people aren't encouraged to have casual sex, even if it's safe, than it is to reduce the negatives of people having casual sex, then there's the answer to what you really value.

**** Even though it is illegal to force people to donate blood or organs, and even though it's the smartest policy to have, I'm not certain it's the most ethical outcome.

If some omniscient benevolent agent told me that I had to donate blood or someone would die, that there was no third option, and I said no with no particular counterargument, I think it would actually be ethical for that agent to forcibly extract blood from me in order to save the life. However, when talking about governments and companies and anyone else who might be interested in managing such a process, we know they're not omniscient and benevolent. It's awfully dangerous to give someone the institutional power to violate your bodily autonomy if you aren't very sure that they won't abuse it.

With abortion, the situation is significantly different. At least, if you're considering the particular fetus a person it's significantly different. When the procedure is all about ending the life of the fetus, the odds that forcing a woman to carry the fetus to term saves a life exactly equals the odds that the fetus would survive through birth. As for benevolence, that's solved by the nature of the situation. If a malicious entity had the power to force people to donate organs, they could abuse that to target people they don't like and force them to undergo surgery and loss of an organ. Regarding pregnant women, the only entity who can potentially decide who has to undergo the pregnancy is the father, so there's no risk of the government or another such entity choosing a woman and forcing a pregnancy on her.

All in all, the reasons why it should be illegal to force organ donations don't hold up when aborting a fetus considered a person. Instead, the ethical situation would indeed boil down to whether one person's right to bodily autonomy overrides the other's right to live at all. Personally, though, I'm hoping that this will only be a question for a short while, until we have the technology to grow a fetus to sustainability inside an incubator so that instead of aborting the fetus the woman can just get it taken out of her and given up for adoption when it reaches the age it can survive at.

Abortion opponents say that fetuses can feel pain. I don't doubt that, but so do cows, and you'd be hard pressed to find a vegetarian pro-lifer. Cows even seem to have complex feelings and personalities, and I still don't feel too bad about eating them because my neurology isn't designed to feel bad about eating nonhuman things. If your threshold for sufficiently human is "feels pain," then you can't in good conscience use mousetraps.

They say that things which have the potential to be human are human. You can say that, but then you're saying that the rights of potential people in the future are more important than the rights of actual people now, and that really quickly spirals down a logical rabbit hole ending in enslaving the entire human population to construct a utopian future because a greater number of people will enjoy it than be harmed in the process.

Other, less rigorous arguments such as keying humanity off having human DNA are even more spurious. Cancer cells have human DNA. Chimpanzees are 98% human, genetically, does that mean they should have 98% of the rights? Or are you arbitrarily cutting it off somewhere? What about people with chromosomal disorders, whose genetic code is actually different from most humans?

There just isn't a non-arbitrary means of defining when something goes from non-human and not deserving of human rights to fully human. There's obviously a point where it /should/ happen, but it's a philosophical problem and not a scientific one. So the easiest thing to do is just keep doing what we've been doing forever and define human as having been born. Much easier, doesn't create awful corner cases like pregnant cancer patients dying for lack of chemotherapy, is what we would instinctually do anyway.

That's my ultimate issue with this whole thing, actually.

Since we can't get it right every time, we have to write laws which are either sufficiently lax as to provide human leeway in situations where they obviously (to human eyes) should, or to write laws which are strict, but narrow enough to avoid terrible outcomes most of the time.

That's where abortion legislation comes in. If you write a law that says 'no abortions past 28 weeks ever,' that has obvious problems. But if you write a law that says 'no abortion past 28 weeks unless the life of the mother is in danger, or the mother was raped/incested, or the baby is malformed and is dead/will die or have serious problems,' such a law could /still/ have serious terrible corner case potential, and we won't know about those corner cases until some poor girl commits suicide or something else awful happens which the writers of the law didn't foresee.

So. You have to make laws which are really lax, which give both doctors and patients the tools necessary to make the right decisions for everyone involved (including hypothetical future people), and you just can't do that by agreeing to the draconian terms set by evangelicals. Because they believe in souls and that blastocysts have them, which is not a position you can argue them out of.

And besides, in the US the vast majority of abortions are performed before the 20 week mark anyway, well before any scientist would tell you that the fetus was meaningfully sapient. The vast majority of the ones performed after that mark are done for medical reasons, which no reasonable person would argue against either. The whole 'woman at 30 weeks doesn't like being fat any more' situation just doesn't happen at any significant rate, and doctors basically everywhere are empowered to refuse such requests when they do come up.

Much of criminal law has terrible corner cases. Should those corner cases outweigh the harm prevented in the vast majority of normal cases. Does that pregnant girl committing suicide negate all the "unborn yet feeling babies" (named for the sake of argument) saved by preventing a non-trivial amount of women from deciding to have a late abortion?

The argument in favor of legalizing late term abortions must be a stronger one than just "what if something very specific happens to a single person". Especially in any system that uses jury trials.

They could, and they might also be more sentient than a human being who is comatose, or severely mentally handicapped. And in the latter case, the human being is probably not going to recover and reach a regular level of sentience, either. So from a purely utilitarian standpoint, I suppose that his/her life may have no more value than that of a cow.

However, if you're going to have /any/ deontological rule, I think "thou shalt not kill" is a pretty good one. Don't pick and choose which human lives have value; humans have the right to live, period.

That only applies if they are so severely mentally handicapped that they can't signal that they would rather live when asked.

People have been aborting pregnancies since before recorded history. It doesn't matter the culture or what taboos are in place, it happens. You don't get a choice in that matter. The only choice you get to make is whether the people who seek this can do it legitimately in regulated medical facilities. And if you would say that you think they should be forced underground to do something that they absolutely will do either way, I have no words to describe how completely wrong that feels to me.

Now. Maybe you think it should be legal but don't support it yourself. That's fine. Try to convince people not to get one, do whatever you want on that front. But there are fetuses which effectively start dead because their carriers don't want or can't support them for whatever reason, and you cannot change that.

So. Either believe something which is unprovable which causes you personal and unpreventable mental agony, or believe something equally unprovable which does not.

Just think about all the stories of people having children they didn't want. Then there's also the factor that by making it legal and not "demonizing" it, fewer people will believe it to be ethically wrong and thus more and more people will go through with abortions for reasons as simple as "it currently fits my lifestyle better". And zero limits on abortion also lead to things like selective abortions where you get rid of fetuses that don't have your preferred characteristics.

I personally am completely in favor of abortions but if one believes that a fetus has human or near-human moral weight then it does make a certain amount of sense to at least restrict abortions as much as is possible without empowering the black market too much.

What you say about the demand for not having a baby strongly resembles the concepts behind prohibition and the war on drugs. Specifically, when you ban alcohol or drugs, the demand for alcohol and drugs is supplied by black market suppliers instead, and the whole situation becomes more deadly and hostile to everyone involved. Much better, in the end, to just let them get their alcohol or drugs legally and provide support for people struggling with them.

But again, abortion isn't the same. With alcohol and drugs, partaking in them does no one any harm. With abortion, getting one risks killing a person. If 90% of women who get abortions still go and get illegal abortions, that's still 10%, hundreds of thousands of lives, in the balance. I also suspect that 90% of women continuing to abort is a rather high percentage, and that even more fetuses are in question here. The situation would get worse for the women, but since we can't say with confidence that the fetuses aren't people, we're again weighing lives against things that are not lives.

In fact, the answer here, since we /don't know/ if our actions are murder on an enormous scale or not, should be to try and minimize the total number of attempted abortions. Campaigns to promote the /idea/ that fetuses are people, in order to hopefully sway some women to carry the child to term and put it up for adoption. Again I stress, it would be incredibly irresponsible to ignore the very real odds that human people are being murdered by the millions just because it's more convenient to do nothing. The fact that we can't know which is true, whether a fetus is a person or isn't, doesn't mean we get to pick whichever one's nicer to believe. It means we have to assume either can be true, and act in such a way to minimize the tragedy of each one.

Overpopulation.

The fact of the matter is that many experts in relevant fields will tell you that Very Bad Things will begin happening once there are too many humans on the planet for current technology to support, and that with the threat of climate change we have possibly already overshot that mark by a billion or so. Sure, technology might improve and increase that mark, and we might become a multiplanetary species fast enough to mitigate the effects, but both of those eventualities are as hypothetical as the idea that 20 week or less old fetuses are sapient (which is when or before the majority of abortions are performed anyway).

Obviously, the best way to combat that is with proper sex ed and free access to birth control, but birth control does fail some small percentage of the time and unwanted babies are always going to be a problem, which leaves legal abortion as the ironically third least obviously immoral means of controlling population growth, followed by codified population controls like China's defunct one child policy. (Aside: an argument could be made that increasing national standards of living generally decreases birth rates dramatically as well, but since the problem with overpopulation is resource expenditure and increased standards of living increase resource expenditure, this doesn't actually solve anything)

Once hard limiters on the number of humans who can exist are lifted one way or another, this is a much more reasonable conversation to be having. Before then, though, we risk the possible deaths of /billions/ in nuclear powered resource wars between developed countries starved by massive populations, which is a much more important thing to be worrying about, IMO, than whether the few million fetuses being terminated globally each year might possibly be sapient enough to warrant full personhood rights.

And that assumes the resource wars would happen like that. China did its one child policy, I wouldn't be opposed to something similar if overpopulation does become an issue. Overall, I think that resource wars are an unlikely thing to happen, and that the more likely alternative is for these resources to begin to cost more as alternative but more expensive sources become needed (think fresh water from desalination) and the cost of living goes up, quality of life goes down, but nothing apocalyptic, and most likely nothing worth throwing aside any and all ethical considerations of abortion for a tiny chance that the change in birth rate would matter.

Similarly, there's a part of me that feels bad even that /microbes/ have to die, but the value of a rhinovirus is not so great that I won't fight a cold, even though colds won't kill me, just be bothersome. In other words, on one side of the scale there's "value of life" and other side, "value of convenience," and these can be balanced against each other. Some things, because of the complexity of their minds, are so valuable that I doubt that any realistic amount of convenience would be worth their deaths, but that cutoff point is closer to "dogs" than "pre-conscious fetuses."

The appropriate response is to provide the needed support. Does a prospective single mother need housing? An income? Safety from the father, from her family, or from someone else?

Instead of saying a fetus is worth 0% of a human and has no rights and then once it's born it instantly jumps to 100%, we could say that at conception it starts at 0% (or some small constant like 5%) and then its value gradually increases until it reaches 100% either at birth or even several years later if you want. The details aren't important, the point is that it makes no sense for it to discontinuously jump from 0% to 100% all of a sudden, and that if it's morally wrong to kill newborn babies, it should be morally wrong to kill them immediately beforehand.

A sliding scale would still force us to answer questions about "how much value does autonomy have versus human life?" If a 2 month baby is given 20% value does that outweigh a woman's desire to not be pregnant for 7 more months? Or in other words, would it be justifiable to allow 5 women that freedom if an adult had to be killed for it? I don't know, if not then maybe we need to change the values around, but at least we can start asking and measuring.

**** Let me throw a controversial opinion by continuing your argument is a newborn baby worth 100% of a young adult? After all it's not really useful yet, it's hardly much more intelligent than a pig. While parents will grieve if their baby die they tend to grieve less over a one year old dying than over a teenage kid. By your argument a newborn baby is only worth something because of the potential of the human being it will become.

I think looking at percentages is the wrong way to look at it because there actually are discontinuities. There's, for example, the time the baby starts interacting the environment by hearing from the womb (which has been proven conclusively in week 24 since the baby reacts to noise but is estimated to start happening at week 16). Likewise the first kick happens around week 16. Before that, the unborn baby doesn't actually have any interaction with the outside world. So an argument could be made to allow abortion up till then since before that there's no interaction between the unborn baby and the outside world.

Another discontinuity would be the development of the brain with the first synapses developing around week 8. Can an unborn baby without synapses be considered a human being? Before that, it doesn't think.

One argument is that the unborn baby has value because of it's potential to be a fully developed human being. If we say that it must absolutely be preserved because of that potential, then why shouldn't we go on to say that the sperms and eggs need to be preserved because of their potential of becoming a human being. By that logic, contraceptives are murder (we prevent the creation of a human being), masturbating for men would be murder too (wasting sperms) and not procreating as often as possible would be murder since the sperm is renewed every 3 days. It doesn't really make sense in the end.

So, I don't think that talking about the potential of being a human being makes any sense and I think that allowing abortion until a certain date defined by our current knowledge of the development of the fetus makes the most sense. I'm not sure where to place the limit. We can place it when the baby first develop synapses, or when it first starts hearing or when a baby is first capable of making choices which would be after it's born. Placing the line is a matter for debate.

I do think that any abortion is a suboptimal solution and that contraceptives make much more sense but I think that from a society point of view abortion is a good thing because it reduces the number of children that will be born in families that cannot give them the support they need.

I never said this. What I meant is that all humans have inherent value. We're not trying to maximize "amount of money humans can earn" or "stuff humans can produce" or "amount a human can bring happiness to other humans" for their own sake. but rather, we're trying to maximize the amount of happiness/prosperity/health etc of each human. Thus a person doesn't just have value conditional on them being able to contribute to society. They themselves are part of group we're trying to maximize, they have some part of the utility pie.

If all humans were simultaneously and painlessly murdered, nobody would be sad, nobody would suffer, nobody would care that the economy doesn't exist anymore, but I think most people can agree that this would be absolutely terrible and something that we don't want to happen. Because someone dying has a negative value on the utility function.

Additionally, if you murder someone and then have an extra child to replace them, I think most people will agree that this doesn't cancel it out. Killing someone isn't bad just because it reduces the amount of people in the world, but because it is bad. The utility function has a negative weight attached to death.

I think a utility function which only seeks to maximize value for adult humans is fundamentally flawed and open to all sorts of dystopian exploitations.

It's not about potential human, it's about that they are now. You can try to argue that fetuses aren't entirely human because they don't have all of the same features, but I think it's much much harder to argue that they aren't human at all even when they have many of the same features. Thus as at least partial humans they deserve some nonzero weight in the utility function.

*** I think it's very dangerous for us to make a firm judgement call about when humanity begins, which makes abortion a big risk. If the unborn have human DNA and are steadily growing into human beings, then the default assumption should be that they are human, and to decide otherwise runs the risk of destroying human lives - in the millions.

If we assume that human rights start at conception, when there isn't really any need for that, what happens? Potentially more babies are born to unprepared mothers. There are options available - social security, adoption, etc.

Conversely, if we decide that humanity begins at birth, and if that's actually a mistake, what happens? Slaughter on a larger scale than the Holocaust, millions upon millions.

If there is even a 10% chance that future science will prove the unborn to be fully deserving of human rights, then that should be compelling. Do we have such irrefutable evidence of their /non/-humanity that we should assign a lower probability than that?

(And if you examine the statistics, the situation may even be more complex than that; permitting abortion may actually encourage risky sexual behavior and thus lead to /more/ unwanted pregnancies.)

You are against the use of Abortion in ways that contradict your view of things. You're not against it as a thing.

I am against treating people differently for race. I am for treating people differently for circumstances. If 100% of people from a race are need that treatment, that's okay too, as long as every other race has the same access if needed. That's a blanket I am against something. I don't think there's any loopholes or ifs, or buts, or maybes, or excepts there. Race should not be used to define what access some people have to help or so on.

Anyway, now my example is over. you've seen why I think you're not actually against Abortion, just the use of it.

As to Abortion? I think it's a wonderful thing. It reduces the amount of child abuse, it reduces rape, it reduces a bunch of crap that can be inflicted on children in bad situations.

I think the vast majority of people who complain about abortion do not research it enough to have an opinion on it. And those that do and still complain are generally very emotional about it. the only real group who can say anything on the subject are Vegans. Not vegetarians cause they eat Eggs, but Vegans.

*** My thoughts?

Before conception, the baby is two packets of separate genetic material (one in the father, one in the mother). It is not yet a person.

At birth, the baby is a person, and should be treated as having basic human rights, particularly the right to life.

Between those two times it's a bit more tricky. There isn't a simple, binary switch from not-a-person to a person. It's a bit like a painting - you start out with a blank canvas, which is not a painting, and after a lot of effort from the artist, you end up with a painting, but there's no particular stroke of the brush which makes it suddenly jump from 0% Painting to 100% Painting.

So. For nine months, the baby is a... /fractional/ person, I think is the best way to put it. With that fraction monotonically increasing. There might, one day, with better medical science, be a way to quantify that function exactly, but until that time I tend to assume it's more or less linear. (That's not quite right. Babies born a month early can still survive, so they're already full people. But it's a vague approximation which can be built on).

So. Under what circumstances is it moral to end a /fractional/ life? There's a good argument to be made when there's some medical complication that threatens the (non-fractional) life of the mother; ending the life of a fractional human to save the life of a full human. But, given that it's pretty much impossible for the baby to do anything that would earn the death penalty in any court, I don't think that it's really worthwhile in other circumstances.

Try to stay safe and sane. Keep an eye out for the degradation of social and legal norms that protect us common citizens from authoritarian leaders and mob hatred. Resist the degradation of those norms. Try to agitate, educate, and organize the ordinary people around you: we need a more active civil society and activist corps now than ever.

I was looking at New Zealand's immigration website last night and saw that they offer some visa options for youngish, educated software and hardware engineers.

Hate and fear are negative emotions: they signal to our brains, /get away from this state and causal trajectory/, or /destroy that influence over your causal trajectory/. As such, they don't give precise information: we already know to avoid this situation, but we're here nonetheless. Figure out a positive program for your life, something that puts you on a safer, more dignified causal trajectory, and work towards that, both personally and politically. Positive programs are more statistically precise, and even angry, afraid people on "the other side" like to talk about them. Remember, for instance, that the same Rust Belt communities who supported Donald Trump also supported Bernie Sanders.

*** I think rather than nonhuman, it's probably more healthy to at the very least think of people who aren't as smart as you as childlike. Imagine that stupidity or irrationality is some sort of disease that causes children to stop growing mentally and get stuck with the same level of intellectual and/or emotional maturity. Their bodies get older and they end up getting jobs and responsibilities that perhaps they shouldn't, but people can't read their minds so for the most part can't tell the difference, they can't read other peoples' minds so they can't tell the difference either. So they go around pretending to be adults and they often succeed, but sometimes they don't. Some people make it all the way to adulthood, or "rationality", some people get closer than others.

The point is it's not really their fault. It's not anyone's fault. That's just how they are. It sucks when their condition ends up harming or inconveniencing other people, but it also sucks that a bunch of tax money goes towards modifying structures or paying for healthcare for disabled people. But we don't hate them for it.

**** That doesn't work. Even if I was comfortable with having such a dim view of people I'm supposed to treat as equal, it encourages me to think of them as mentally deficient and incapable of making good decisions for themselves. I may disagree with what they believe and think they made bad decisions, but to think of them as inherently stupid is not just disrespectful, it's discriminatory.

** Over a month ago, I made a post where I played Devil's advocate with the subject of long-term immortality.

In this post, I'd like to instead raise some more practical questions about the subject. People in this community just seem to take it as a given that immortality is a good idea, and while I agree in principle, there are still some major problems that need to be addressed.

I'll assume here that it is highly likely that we will achieve effective immortality within the next 100-200 years, /conditional/ on the development of friendly AI within that time frame. This implies that we will become immortal long before we have a large presence elsewhere in the solar system, and very long before we finish terraforming Mars and start going to other stars.

*The Problem of Having Children*

You cannot have a planet full of immortals all having immortal children without some plan for avoiding the Malthusian cycle that this will inevitably cause. Assuming that moving many people off-planet will not be feasible for at least a couple of hundred years, you will essentially have to prohibit immortal people from raising families. You cannot both have a right to life and a right to your own biological children. One way of implementing this would be to require that everyone who becomes immortal must also be sterilized (or gay). I expect that such a solution would not sit well with most ordinary people.

Now, you might say, "Wait a minute. If everyone is immortal, they have all the time in the universe. Just have people wait to have children until moving off-planet is feasible." This is not as good of a solution as it sounds. I expect that due to the inhospitableness of outer space and other planets, the quality of life on a space station or on Mars will not match the quality of life on earth for a very long time (thousands of years at least, until terraforming is effective). People who are born on earth will argue that they have a right to live where they are born, and that they have a right not to be forcibly deported to a place with a lower quality of life. So if you allow too many immortal people to have immortal families, you may still have a problem even if it is feasible to move off-planet. Perhaps you could cycle people around so that everyone gets to spend some time on earth - but the more people there are, the less time each person gets to spend on earth.

It seems that whatever happens, you will have to modify people's values so that they have less desire to have children, and also so that they are better adapted to less hospitable environments.

*The Problem of Ethical Paths to Immortality*

To raise a completely different issue: how exactly do you do the necessary science to achieve immortality in an /ethical/ way? There must inevitably be /lots/ of dangerous human experimentation, of the sort that is entirely prohibited today. Theory can only get you so far - you have to eventually do experiments building real immortal people, and some of these will go horribly wrong, either killing or maiming their subjects, and perhaps doing irreversible mental damage. For example, suppose you insert a chromosome that stops aging, but after 200 years it turns out that this causes people's brains to stop forming new memories and enter a permanent state of semi-dementia. You could back up everyone's mind to a computer, maybe, but this process is likely to kill or damage the first so many people who try it.

The best bet is probably to experiment on terminally ill volunteers (assuming the problem of disease hasn't yet been solved!). But as per the above example, you might not notice bad effects for decades, and people will not want to wait that long.

So: any thoughts on these questions?

*** *The Problem of Having Children*

As soon as we have strong friendly AI (plus travel time), we should be able to have a large presence elsewhere in the solar system and the galaxy. Definitely much sooner than the timeframe of filling up the Earth with children.

I think you're underestimating the strength of an AI that can make humans immortal.

*The Problem of Ethical Paths to Immortality*

Assuming utilitarianism, the calculation of lost life years versus gained life years from immortality is pretty simply in favor of immortality.

It's a bit more difficult to show in other morality systems.

**** If you assume the first argument to be valid (i.e. AI is very powerful), doesn't that also serve as an argument for an Ethical Path to immortality? If AI is so powerful, it shouldn't need to resort to unethical research in the first place.

You can turn this around: if AI isn't powerful enough to ethically research human immortality, maybe it wouldn't be powerful enough to quickly colonise the solar system.

*** The Problem of Having Children

Well, assuming that I'm the All-Powerful God King of Everything and can enforce this, you could mandate sterilization as part of the immortality process. Worst-case scenario is non-exponential growth as each generation has exactly one batch of children and then becomes immortal, leading to somewhere between three and twenty billion more people per year. I'm confident that our technology would increase fast enough to keep up with the expansion, especially if (as we would if I were God-Emperor) we abolished parking lots, minimum floor spaces for dwellings, and about nine-tenths of our zoning regulations.

The Problem of Ethical Paths to Immortality

Absent moralizers making everything unnecessarily complicated, economics would solve this problem. For example, if you allowed people to take debts with their lives as collateral, I'm confident we'd have plenty of (admittedly short-sighted) volunteers in short order. Unfortunately, we're far too quick to take away fundamental freedoms in the pursuit of coating everything on Earth in metaphorical bubble-wrap, so instead we'll have to rely on dumb luck or black swan technologies.

I'm also fine, in this scenario, with switching out tax breaks for children with additional tax burdens for children. I'm not totally sure how well it would work, since nobody has ever done such a thing, but increasing taxes on e.g. cigarettes leads to decreased consumption.

*** I think you are *vastly* overestimating how much of a resource cost humans would present for a singularity AI.\\
First off I think you might want to discourage biological humans from reproducing, or the superintelligence would just use super persuasiveness to convince them that biological life is a staggering waste of resources, because once everybody's digitized things become simpler and more efficient.

If a SI is using all the resources in it's future light cone, then simply by denying the few entities who wanted to reproduce at an insane rate to create offspring that would also reproduce at such a rate. You can avoid any kind of problem, because the resource cost of simulated human population expansion, can't /begin/ to keep up with the rate of resource acquisition of a singularity AI.

However if all that is wrong and FGAI ends up being vastly less powerful than this, then yeah I think you want to sterilize everybody. Only allowing a small number of extremely qualified people to reproduce, in order to match the rate of resource acquisition and the occasional suicide. I think the majority of people would even agree to this once they understood that the alternative is going to lead to staggering suffering for them and their offspring.

** *Red Eyes At Night, Sleeper's Delight?*

It's said that cutting down on the amount of blue light your eyes see before you try to fall asleep can help you get to sleep faster. I've been using an [[http://www.dx.com/p/marsing-r3-e27-3w-200lm-cob-led-rgb-bulb-w-remote-control-white-90-260v-331312][RGB light bulb]] set to 'red' and the [[http://jonls.dk/redshift/][Redshift app]] on my computer; and just today in the mail, I received my brand-new pair of [[http://www.zennioptical.com/550011-metal-alloy-full-rim-frame-with-spring-hinge][prescription glasses]] with reddish-tinted lenses ($10 for the frames, $5 for the tinting, $10 for shipping a half-dozen different pairs).

In other words - in order to sleep more soundly, I'm literally looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses.

There's some evidence that using blue-tinted lenses can have interesting effects on the brain, including the potential for reducing migraines and accelerating recovery from them. I've had migraines, on occasion, and they suck, so if wearing odd-coloured lenses can fend them off, I'm willing to set my schedule to have a blue shift by day, and red shift by night.
