Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I've been spending some time recently thinking about the different sub-groups in our little rational community, and I think there are at least two distinct groups with similar, but tangibly different preferences. I think of them as the MinMaxers and the Story Purists.

MinMaxers are the people for whom the point of the story is all about the world-building and system of the work of fiction. These are the people who enjoy, say, quests or LitRPGs because all the abilities are very well quantified, and the judge a work of fiction by the coherence of it's systems and the munchkinery of the characters living in that system. They also are the ones who most appreciate Fair-play whodunnit, or other stories in which it is possible to reason your way into figuring out a character's actions before they occur.

Story Purists are the people for whom the story is the point, and the rational trappings are just means to a better story. They focus on rational aspects like the examination of goals and motives and intellectual pay-off, because they are inherently more narratively satisfying than a deus ex machina ending. They don't necessarily want stories that are categorically different from works outside the rational community (the way MinMaxers might), they just want fewer characters holding the idiot ball.

I would place myself firmly in the Story Purist camp. I've long since given up keeping track of things like Juniper's ability interactions (or even his base ability categories) in Worth the Candle, but I keep reading it because the characters interact intelligently and the story is engaging. By the same token, I really enjoy the abilities in Practical Guide to Evil, because they are well defined enough that I feel like i have a sense of what can and can't happen, but I don't have to worry about little details like how much mass Cat can lift with her shadow powers or small details things like that.

Where do you feel like you fall? Or would you say you're somewhere in the middle? Or does the dichotomy not ring true at all?

*** I don't know about applying a dichotomy to individuals; I can enjoy different things for different reasons and I'm not a freaky mutant. I don't particularly expect to see all the things I enjoy in the same story, though that's cool when it happens. Some of the big ones:

- Characters with internality - people act like there are people inside of them. They have reasons for being the way they are, they have an internal inertia to how they think and feel about things, the writer could write a monologue of their thoughts whenever they're on screen (even if they never do). I kind of think anything that doesn't have this is sort of... literary junk food? It can still be good, but there's a limit. Wildbow's works are all great at internality.

- Characters with epistemology - people have a specific way of integrating new information, which is different from character to character. Harry Potter And The Natural 20 does the best job of this, as a joke. I'd really like to see more of it.

- Self-consistent world - sort of table stakes for any sort of munchkinry, it can also undermine plot and character development if the world is too unstable. But you can be like PGTE and never give a hard number to anything while still being pretty self-consistent. Part of self-consistency is that the components interact correctly with each other, which means that munchkinry to me is just a way of revealing a form of consistency.

- Constant drip of new ideas - not really high art but it can make for compelling light reading. If all the new stuff interact correctly with the self-consistent world so far then that's really quite nice. Revealing a new interaction is as good as revealing an entirely new element, which again lets munchkin stories do some cool things.

- Believable stakes - the stakes are the bad things that might happen to your characters that I actually believe the author is willing to do to them. Life and death situations are rarely stakes, because I can see how much more book there is. Risk of long-term injuries and mental trauma (hi Wildbow) or failure to achieve personal goals (P:TOS) are much better stakes.

It occurs to me that Pokemon: The Origin Of Species is really doing a great job of all of these.

*** This reminds me of an exchange I had with someone here a while back. They said they preferred the protagonists in stories they read to have as few morals as possible, simply because it let them do more "cool things" with the magic/sci-fi of the setting.

As a Story Purist myself, it felt like I was talking to an alien. I found this eye opening, and it's my go-to reference for just how subjective art can be.

I was a stay-at-home dad anyway, so not much has changed except that we can't go to all the fun places that we used to go to, and preschool is cancelled for what I assume is going to be the rest of the school year.

I've been cooking and cleaning, both things that I normally do.

Our D&D group is going to (try to) go digital, so we'll see how that works. IME it's not as fun and there are always technical issues, but I'm dusting off an old campaign and giving it a shot, which will be my first time DMing in about two years.

******* Scheduling is definitely easier. I think for the most part it's fine, though the rules assume more people, which means some on-the-fly adjustments, and to get all the expected roles covered means either using a DMPC, running multiple characters, or having a powerful +entad+ magic item that can cover some functionality. It's mostly been good, it keeps time between turns down in combat (which can be rough with a larger group) and helps to focus the campaign a bit more.

I think my ideal size is three players, but I don't want to bring someone in just for the sake of having a third.

Our group had our first online session this afternoon, using roll20. It was a pretty smooth experience, no technical issues at all. In fact, having tools like a ruler and color coded drawings was a great help.

People zoning out during other's turns was never a problem, though it is indeed much easier to have that happen when you're effectively sitting there on your own.

*** Trying to convert the boardgame group to a videogame group. It's a bit tricky. It's paradoxically much easier to get people to commit to /going to a place/ than to /be online and willing to play/ at a given time. But it's early days, I'm sure people will get used to it.

***** Because I'm a stereotypical aspie, I made a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OgyskrfPLl0_c8eNuHbiczNPCFo0EpVn3Q_Gw_5_BDk/edit?usp=sharing][detailed list]]. But so far we haven't managed to get more than two people together at the same time, which cuts down on options.

+We have a Blood Bowl 2 league. It's a decent (if a bit dated, in how punishing the RNG can be) 2 player tactics game, each match takes ~45 min and your team's scores and progress is tracked within the league.+ You know, I've played it again tonight and decided I don't like it after all. 45min is an optimistic length, it can easily go twice that, so what fun it has to offer is stretched too thin.

There's been a couple of Tabletop Simulator games organised (War of Whispers). I'm not a huge fan of boardgaming on PC, especially on games without automatic rules enforcement it's the worst of both worlds, but obviously coming from a boardgame group it's an easier sell.

I've played Overcooked yesterday with Steam's Remote Play Together (sharing my keyboard). It's an excellent co-op party game. I'm looking forward to the absolute chaos that 4-player should be, though we may have to use Overcooked 2 instead as Remote Play with four requires at least two people to use controllers.

*** I already work from home so it's less of an adjustment for me. The two biggest things for me are maintaining a consistent work/exercise/sleep schedule, and making an effort to stay in touch with people on a regular basis.

For exercise I converted notes I got from the gym coach at my old job into an app. [[http://noisyowl.com/robologan/][I've uploaded that]] for general use due to the quarantine, if you need it. I'm pretty strict about my schedule, especially sleep schedule. I use melatonin during the winter to manage that, but that might last later in the year if I spend so much time inside.

I also made myself an app for keeping track of how long it's been since I've seen everyone, but it'll take longer to convert that from what's usable by me personally to something that I can share with the world^{*}. It grew out of a spreadsheet of names, how often you want to talk to them (days between), and last time contacted, which you can make for yourself quickly enough if you want one.

^{*} Turns out that manually adding JSON to the source code is easier than writing and using a form UI. That doesn't work for other people.

*** I started writing this as a response to [[/u/alexanderwales]], but I've decided to just post it as its own comment because... well, just because. It's a nice spring day, I may have taken a little bit of some something something to help welcome the sun back into our lives, and instead of going out into nature like I had planned I accidentally started typing. C'est la vie, y'know?

For context, his comment mentioned taking his D&D group online due to social distancing, a term I'm sorry to not feel like I need to define due to it having gone from obscurity to relative ubiquity for unfortunate reasons.

There's VR options that allow you to play D&D (and lots of other social multiplayer experiences where you can trick your brain into feeling like you're interacting socially with the other humans in the same physical space), things like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj6nLdbbRE][AltspaceVR]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eddmp3JybCM][VRChat]] and [[https://www.pcgamer.com/we-played-dd-in-tabletop-simulator-and-it-worked-surprisingly-well/][Tabletop Simulator]].

There's also a dedicated app called [[https://taverntalesgame.com/?i=1][Tavern Tales]] that looks like it's probably finished development and just waiting on approval from Oculus to get into the app store. Tavern Tales looks to be by far the most polished.

I have absolutely zero confidence in predicting what sort of timeframe the social distancing stuff will be going on (probably negative confidence, actually, like I'm confident that if I made any prediction one way or the other it'd be as wrong as physically possible) but maybe now's as good a time as any to start looking into VR.

The Oculus Quest is probably the best headset to buy in the immediate future because within 36 months (I would've said 18 months before the coronavirus but a lot of the manufacturing pipeline for bigger things like Apple products and the PS5 and the Xbox 7 (that's a joke because their namiNg schema since the Xbox 360 has revolved around not looking like they're one generation behind PlayStation) is being affected so the next generation of VR hardware is probably going to be postponed as well)... anyways, [[https://youtu.be/7YIGT13bdXw?t=559][unimaginably more impressive headsets will be released]] probably within the next 36 to 48 months, and marginally more impressive headsets will probably still be released within 18 months.

That's too soon to bother investing in a PC headset when there's better stuff in the relatively nearish future, especially if you don't already have a gaming PC.

However (and this is the main reason why I turned this reply into its own comment), you can actually finance a really good PC for a really low monthly payment, especially if your credit's decent, like [[https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/legion-desktops/legion-c-series-cubes/Lenovo-Legion-C730-Cube/p/99LE9700309][this Lenovo PC can be had right now for only like thirty bucks a month]] and it's already better than (or at the very least just as good as) the next gen PlayStation and Xbox that are still more than a year away from being released (though the payment is only that low if you're making the minimum payment - if you want to pay it off within a year and not pay any interest you've gotta pay like $130 per month, and your personal credit score might mean your personal minimum payment is higher than thirty bucks a month).

The Quest is $400 and self-contained, and if you /do/ have access to a gaming PC (or plan to get one in the future) you can plug the Quest in via USB-C (so it's basically like buying a standalone mobile headset and getting a second PC headset for free (or for the cost of a USB-C cable)). The "Oculus Link" experience is said to be comparable to or slightly better than the first gen Rift and Vive. The new headsets like the Rift S and Valve Index and Vive Cosmos, they all use LCD displays with an RGB stripe arrangement with 3 subpixels per pixel as opposed to an OLED display with a pentile arrangement and only 2 subpixels per pixel. Basically, using LCD reduces the "screen door effect" because there's technically more subpixels /and/ less space between them which both add up to noticeable reduction of the SDE, but the colors on LCD panels are more washed out and the blacks all look grey, where the OLED displays have crisp/sharp blacks and brighter more vibrant color. There's tradeoffs either way, but the Quest uses two 1600x1440 OLED displays, so it's not going to be noticeably inferior to the Rift S which is the same price but can't be used wirelessly.

So that was my little rant evangelizing on behalf of VR. "Blah blah blah, VR, whatever, call me when the headsets get smaller than a one-pound brick strapped to the front of your face." That's fine, fair enough, but what /you/ can get out of this comment if you're not interested in VR is that you can get yourself a very capable PC that can handle Triple-A games for less money per month than I used to spend on cigarettes biweekly, and which I'm sure at least some of you spend on your morning coffee per week.

If you're quarantined or just taking the "social distancing" thing extra seriously as a precaution, or maybe you anticipate that the worst is yet to come and think we all might be a little more isolated than we'd like for longer than might be comfortable, you have the option of getting a PC for a relatively low monthly price, and might be able to convince your peergroup to do the same and just set up a Minecraft server so instead of hanging out IRL you could all hang out together in Minecraft all working together to perform simple tasks like building a house or farming potatoes while you talk about stuff since you can't get together to talk about stuff IRL.

Hell, I've never thought about it before but there's really no reason that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] couldn't have a Minecraft server where people log-on on Fridays and just hang out as a way to have more organic conversations than you can have through text.

Anyways, I'm sure that at least some people here are already subscribed to Kurzgesagt on YouTube, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtN-goy9VOY][their very recent coronavirus video]] was / still is on Trending, but instead of just generically telling you to wash your hands, they had a great - thing, no do words good, it's not an analogy or a metaphor - what they said is "wash your hands as if you've literally just now finished cutting some jalapenos and now you need to put in your contact lenses."

Like, don't just "wash" your hands, /wash/ your hands.

Maybe instead of a top level comment I'll post this as a reply to [[/u/somerando11]] since that seems to be where the discussion of things to do in isolation is... isolated.

I'm going for a walk :)
