Not much to say here. The Dragon Prince was announced [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HWcff0YEPM][a few months ago]], and came out on Netflix this month. Its selling points are an intricate-yet-straightforward fantasy world, beautiful toon-shaded animation, and some of /The Last Airbender/'s best writers.

I've watched the first two episodes, and I'm pretty hooked. (some minor scene spoilers ahead)

The writing so far is great; I'd say it's way better than even ATLA was in some ways. Some highlights:

- In the first episode, the king learns a party of unstoppable assassins is coming for him. His son overhears the news, and puts two and two together when the kinds decides to send his children away for improvised vacations. The king summons him to give him a scroll, and tells him "you'll know when to open it". While the son was so far characterized as a bit of a goof, he replies "when you die". It's a very awkward, yet blunt conversation that tells you lots about these characters, with very few words. I love that the son says "you know what, I'll just give you the scroll next week", like he's trying to make himself believe it.

- Later, a hunting party is sent to catch the assassins before they reach the peak of their power. The prince, despite being shown earlier to be kinda lame at fighting, shows up and asks to participate. The captain of the guard, which is somewhere between his teacher and his rival, makes fun of him, and points out the armor he's wearing is ceremonial.

- The royal magician comes up with an ingenious plan to use dark magic to basically body swap the king with some brave volunteer who would get killed by the assassins for him. The king refuses, for fairly obvious reasons. I love one line in particular: the magician points at nearby guards, and says "Any of these brave them would happily lay down their lives for you!"; and the guards all kinda look at each other. It's very quiet and understated, they're not making dramatic scared faces or anything, but you get an impression of "I mean, I'm not going to say /no/, but I really don't want to say yes" from these short looks.

Overall, I really like the writing so far. It has a way to convey a lot of backstory and personality with very few words, while at the same time the characters are very blunt and don't dance around uncomfortable truths. The humor is in the same style, very light and quiet, the writer clearly isn't afraid that you'll miss a joke or an emotion if they don't amp it up to eleven; basically the opposite of an anime (I think this is a benefit from being a Netflix series). I'll definitely be binging this series in the next days.

EDIT: After watching the full season, I'm rescinding my endorsement. The story has a lot of potential, but also a lot of structural flaws that make it Not Rational, and also pretty frustrating to watch (if you're the kind of person that keeps thinking "Why aren't you idiots doing X?" or "This isn't how espionage works!").


** I love the show, though occasionally I feel like the tone jumps from wildly clever to almost ridiculously ... not.

Case in point, spoilers ahead:

The mage is talking to his daughter and says basically, if you knew what I was about to do, you'd try to stop me. To which her response is, knowing that, shouldn't I just do that anyway?

which is great. And unfortunately the dramatics of characters is almost never commented on in such a direct and logical way.

BUT...

The same character is talking with her brother in the season finale and basically asks, hey, did dad tell you anything weird? And he's like no, to which she ostentatiously exclaims, me neither. In the most obvious, I'm lying scene ever. And she's not called on it. It is almost like watching a d and d game where the rolls are wildly unlikely, in either direction.

To be fair, the brother isn't presented as an intellectual giant, the sister is presented as socially awkward, and the brother has motivation to not talk about the subject. I can easily imagine that the brother is avoiding dwelling on the morality of their dad's request to such an extent that he ignores or doesn't notice his sister's obvious lie. It probably could have been handled better though.

Besides the story is set in a medievalesque time period, we shouldn't expect 21st century morals from the characters or the world building.

They have every right to dislike new things they don't understand, and to respond to it an a way you'd expect from people on that time period.

** I enjoyed the series - binged it a few weekends ago, but it did have a few issues in my opinion. The animation was by far the most jarring point; individual shots look AMAZING, but the janky animation style was something that I never grew accustomed to even by the end of the series. The fighting scenes in general were really well-done, but outside of those the animation flow could take a sharp nosedive at times.

Then some of the narrative slacks off a bit, or seemed trimmed for time. Despite the Moonshadow assassins being hyped as unbeatable during a full moon, all of them were killed (except Runaan, at least at first). That lends the impression that they actually are able to be beaten, which means not hiding or protecting the king better was a pisspoor risk. Heck, they knew the assassins were coming... why not hurry away before the moon came up? Evade them for a day or two and their power fades, no? And clearly they aren't supernaturally good trackers, because all five commit to attacking the king in the castle... but Ezran was also a target (a mandatory target, at that!), and was able to get away unnoticed. Besides that, Lujanne does her Gandalf impersonation in the final moments of the show, which seems like a poorly explained deus ex machina. If her giant bird isn't used to help the kids, I'm calling BS. And we better get an explanation for why an elf has been living in human lands; saying "she's close to the moon" doesn't explain anything! On that note, Illusion magic makes NO sense, and makes Ellis's backstory utterly ridiculous. If you'll recall, Ellis rescued her wolf and brought him home, but he lost a leg from a trap. Ellis's parents tell her that they can't afford another mouth to feed, and her response is to run away with her pup. She gets to the top of the mountain, meets Lujanne, and the wolf seems to regrow its leg, after which she returns home and lives happily. But... the problem wasn't that the wolf was crippled. It was that there wasn't enough food to go around. Regrowing a leg literally does nothing to help that situation! And lest we argue that now the wolf can hunt for itself... no, it can't, because it doesn't actually have its leg back, it just thinks it does (and so does everyone else). But all the tricks and agility it displays makes it seem like the leg really IS back... in which case, it isn't an illusion! Argh, that was such a poorly explained or planned plotline!

There are multiple characters who are introduced and seem like they might be important, but then aren't followed up on. Corvus would be the most obvious one. The guy is the best tracker Amaya has at her disposal, capable of even tracking down the legendary Moonshadow Elves, but one tumble down a hill and he never shows up again? Short of breaking something, that should have been only a 10 minute delay at most. Then the guy with the sunforged dagger seems like he would be around a bit, but he's used as only a plot device to discuss how Rayla's armband is uncuttable. I know ATLA used a lot of throwaway characters too, but here it felt like they could have had a bigger part, but budget ran low and they were cut.

Complaints aside, I did actually really enjoy the series and will definitely watch the next season when it's out. The character interactions and humor are really well done, and there are plenty of hooks to keep viewers speculating about what's happening and going to happen. But I sure hope they smooth out the animation and tighten up the plot decisions!

** I've watched it all. It's good.

Frame rate can get /very/ low at times, which is a bit of a drawback, but still not a deal breaker when the writing and voice acting is this good. Also, they know how to use the budget they've been given because those times when the frame rates dip are /never/ during a fight scene.

One other drawback is a single character we meet near the end of the first season. Without spoiling, this character is supposed to be a young child, despite the fact that she isn't written as one. You'll know it when you see it. For a show that otherwise writes it's young characters very well, this felt a bit jarring.

But anyway, those are minor gripes. The show is good. Go watch it.

** Copying my review from Spacebattles:

I've watched the whole season, and while the series has a lot of potential and I really want it to do great, what I've seen so far really doesn't inspire confidence; I'm 90% sure it's going to go the way of /The Legend of Korra/. On one side it's got great visuals (except for the framerate thing), great sound design and voice acting, and witty dialogues; on the other side, an incoherent, badly paced story.\\
The story has a lot of holes if you just take what it says at face value:

- Why do the special force commandos take an unbloodied rookie with them on a mission to avenge the Dragon King and Prince? You'd think they'd send her on a few lower-stakes missions first to make sure she's not going to panic in the first real fight she gets in.
- If it's safe to send the princes away on vacation (even though there's decent odds they'll be targets too), why doesn't the King go with them until the elves are captured? If nothing else, he's got a horse and the elves don't, he could just outrun them.
- Why does the captain of the royal guard, when given a magic item that can find the assassins after his king, abandon his mission at the first sign that the item doesn't work? He could have tried the moth again, searched the clearing for traces of a camp, or searched the surroundings. As it is, he doesn't look especially anxious that his critical mission failed and that he's going to have to fight full-power moonshadow elves that night.
- Why isn't Claudia stationed with her brother to defend the king? She even has magic that can outmatch the elves.
- Why do the Princes run away from the castle, and later from their aunt Amaya? Even if they want to give the egg back to the dragons, there's no reason for them to run away. Ezran is the heir, and could simply order the egg to be sent under escort, which would be faster (horses!) and safer (no "throwing the egg in frozen ice" shenanigans).
- What the hell is Viren's long-term plan? He knows that the Kingdom's institutions (symbolized by Amaya and the priest woman) are ready to throw him out at the first sign of treachery, and are already openly going against him. How the hell does he plan to stay in power once they learn he got the princes murdered? Assuming that his children actually execute his plan, which seems pretty unlikely? It's possible he's just deluded and ignoring how unstable his plans are, but that seems really unsatisfying.
- Who fed Elli's wolf while it was growing up? Did it hunt its own game, but still stay with Elli for some reason? How the hell did nobody notice it had a strong limp for all these years?

But honestly, you can ignore these questions or make up vaguely plausible answers for them. What makes this story extremely unsatisfying for me, and what I think is a major reason that people thought the season felt unfinished, is that the writers have no sense of importance and scale.

How big is Katolis? The website says it's "the largest human kingdom", which should make it at least as big as France, yet everyone is moving from one side to the other like they're /Game of Thrones/ pirate fleets. The winter lodge is apparently a morning's walk away from the royal castle, since they've reached it by the time Ezran gets thirsty. The exact distances they travel remain unclear, but there's nothing to give the sense that they're on an epic, urgent journey. They're content to sleep on the bare ground, and don't worry about finding tents and bedrolls before they die of exposure. They don't need to forage for food or go into villages, and their only supplies are a magic cubes and a bagful of stale bread. The gang, which includes a 10-yo child, gets through a mountain range (one high enough it's covered in ankle-deep snow) in an afternoon, on empty stomachs, while still in their summer clothes. When they do reach a village, nobody gets suspicious at the two kids wearing super-expensive clothes stained with dirt and grass.

The show is riddled with problems like that. Another big one, is the state of the war between the humans, and the elves and the dragons. I have a ton of questions there too:

- What are the events that led to the current conflict? The King mentions "wrongs on both sides", we know the elves mass-deported the humans 1000 years ago, we know the humans (probably) murdered the Dragon King and stole his egg a few years ago (a decade tops), and that's it. What happened in between? What made the King think that attacking the Dragon King was a good idea?
- Why do these two kingdoms hate each other so much if they're completely separated? It can't be just the mass-deportation, it happened 1000 years ago; it would like if the French were still mad at the English today for something that happened during the Hundred Years' War. As an aside, the story could have been a lot more visceral and interesting if it had taken place, say, 100 years after the deportation, while humans were still getting adjusted and there was a prevalent "let's get our lands back" sentiment.
- What's the balance of power between the human kingdoms and the magic kingdoms? Do elves bandits regularly perform raids across the border? Do humans? Did either kingdom try to invade the other at some point?
- For that matter, how do the humans defend the border again elf invasions? The elves have good enough special forces to kill the king in his seat of power, with advance warning, you'd think they'd make short work of any commander trying to defend the border; and that's without getting into the "fuck you, the ground is lava now" scale of fun the dragons bring to the table. Amaya acts like her being at the border is important because an attack could be imminent, but we've seen nothing to indicate that she could do anything to stop these kinds of threats.
- How close are the magic kingdoms to invading the human kingdoms? The characters tell us that bringing back the egg is essential to preventing/stopping the war, but until we see some hint of that war, their worries seem pretty abstract and far away. Are the elves gathering their armies? Or are they content to murder the king and call it even? Do they have enough forces to invade the human kingdoms? If so, do they intend occupy it, or genocide everyone, or what?

Not answering these questions means that the war with the elves, which should be the story's main drive, instead feel vague and unconcerning.

I don't think the story should have an entire chapter discussing the logistics and political structure of the Dragon Kingdom in the first season, mind you. But it would be nice if every so often, the show dropped some worldbuilding that's not "humans are racist" every so often. Something like "Elf raids along the border have been increasing lately. The people are asking us to send more troops there to defend them." or "Our spies are picking up more thousands more elves every week. There's no doubt anymore: they're preparing an invasion. We're going to need to start conscripting people if we want to stand a chance".

Anyway, that's my take on /The Dragon Prince/. A lot of potential, seriously botched execution.

** I watched the whole thing, but the frame rate issue really bothered me. On top of that, many dialogue scenes were a static image with only the speaking character's mouth moving. This may be the pattern in other media but I found it distracting here.

Since the plot is largely driven by the protagonists' refusal to tell the adults the details of the adventure, I'm not sure if this qualifies as Rational. On the other hand, I do like the setting a lot.

Avatar was better. But if you look just at the first ten episodes of both shows, the difference is less stark.

King lies to princes to keep them from getting scared causing them to almost get themselves killed. Prince lies about nonsense for no reason. Advisor lies about major serious stuff which is the entire reason that this conflict is happening in the first place when it all could have been avoided.

I really dislike pointless plots founded on stupid useless lies.

Also it irked me when knight dude didn't believe in magic for some reason despite seeing magic all around him all the time and therefore lets the elves escape.
