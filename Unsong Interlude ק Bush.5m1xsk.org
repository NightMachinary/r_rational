** A burning bush said to help hell

I don't know what to think about this

edit// wait, wait nevermind I think I figured it out; god was never a burning bush he caused a voice to come form a bush he set fire to, so dylan is the cause of both the voice and the fire it should be considered dylan is the one who said to "help hell" maybe he is the "wicked" messiah for the most wicked generation.

.... but what does that make our heros?

*** I actually can't decide whether we should take this literally. Like, maybe "helping Hell" is the key to it all.

** That was very clever of Dylan. Still, in a world where words can kill, one really shouldn't say out loud anything written by someone else. Or anything written, really. Just improvise your own speech.

*** Duh, I feel so stupid now... I remember thinking something like: "It must have been very easy for Alvarez to hack the teleprompter because it is probably not very well secured, at least compared to equipments that can kill people. But you've just reminded me that in this universe, it's probably common knowledge that a teleprompter can kill people, so it should be actually very well secured. So much that the president would probably only read aloud from written paper sheets typed/written by trusted people.

**** Is it something people actually think about, though? As far as we know, there's only one Name that actually kills the user, and everyone (or at least everyone important) would know what it is and know not to accidentally speak it...

... except Dylan hid it inside some fake person's name, so Bush did speak it. Oops. They'll be reading from actual paper next time.

EDIT: In short, it's common knowledge that you can die by saying the Mortal Name - but not yet common knowledge that you can be tricked into saying the Mortal Name while reading aloud.

  “We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose. Yet, his purpose is achieved in our duty. And our duty is fulfilled in service to one another. Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life. This work continues, the story goes on, and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.”

*** How "factual" the story actually goes, 3 or 4 layers would be a let down at this point with this level of build up but I can't see it being all the humanly possible to do so.

** That is the most terrifying assassination method I've ever heard of. Nothing you can really do to defend against it unless you constantly expect it to happen, and I would bet you there are a bevy of "jokes" that end with the victim saying the name.

*** I imagine there's a variety of programs to automatically remove words with those sounds from any text. Not that that would stop a hacker, but at least it could help prevent it from happening by accident.

You could decide to pronounce those syllables differently, although if you do that too much you might just end up with a klipot.

*** It's mentioned earlier in an interlude that the US fell apart, and the remainder of the original government only controls a small part of it. It might have been the Comet King who suggested the name change (I think it's in the interlude where TCK meets golem!Reagan, but I could be wrong).

But yeah. Between the weakness of the federal government, the Other King in Las Vegas, the Midwest coordinate system, and San Francisco, (on top of whatever else I'm forgetting), the United States aren't so united any more.
