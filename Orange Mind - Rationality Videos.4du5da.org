** Hey, everyone! I have been [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/492l86/qd_how_to_turn_abstract_rationalist_ideas_into/][talking]] about creating a series rationality videos, and now I finally made my first few episodes!!

I would really love to hear some feedback, so please let me know what you think =)

** Hey! I watched all of the videos and you seem to be on the right path. Continue making videos, watch other videos to get ideas, and watch some tutorials. Time and practice will take the rough edges.

*** Thanks a lot for the feedback! Yes, I'll definitely keep making videos and keep trying to improve them.

People seem to like my animation and the content, but hate the voice over. I guess I'll need to collaborate with a good voice actor to improve the audio.

**** If you want we could totally collaborate. Send me your email / skype so we can talk more. I bought a fancy mic hoping to make something but never did, so this could totally be my chance.
