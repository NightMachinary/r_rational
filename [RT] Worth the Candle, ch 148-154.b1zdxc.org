** Apologies for the delay on this one; this was probably the worst month and a half I've had, as far as sickness goes, particularly with a bout of norovirus going through my family, then a different cold a few days after that. (/Worth the Candle/ has been running for quite a while now, through weddings, family vacations, a number of times being sick, and two seasons worth of seasonal depression, but I'm usually better able to manage it.) This is also a pretty big batch of chapters, which is a contributing factor to the ~46 days between chapter releases.

***** He's still the Hero That Leaps Into Action though.

I tend to see the difference's between Joon and Uther as differences of genre. Like the difference between an English Tea Room mystery and Crime Noir as to how likely the protagonist is to get beaten to a Pulp.

Arther was always a participant in the Great Adventure, the typical Fantasy hero, working the story from the perspective of a player, never knowing how far the DM would go and so more willing to Sally Forth which meant that the DM had to hold back to keep the game going. Joon being from the other side of the cardboard wall, thinks that in the DM's place he wouldn't hold back which introduced a very different meta-tension and allows for threats to be applied in a different way.

Both of them fill the same role however, even if the genre is different, so the likelihood of them holding back is small.

And in any case, she believes in the Narrative from her own perspective, regardless of what Joon thinks, which makes it strange that she would invoke the challenge of the threat like that, unless she's deliberately playing a role to fulfill Narrative conventions and create a MetaImpetus for Joon to defeat it?

This is Mr Wales answering the question of whether Amaryllis tampered with Joon's soul.

And Bethel was the star of this batch for me, her POV was so much fun, right up there with the first Valencia POV chapter. AW does a great job with her internal narrative and 'voice'. Her plan to write an entire book listing all the ways she could kill someone, to give to people annoying her, was hilarious, as was her struggle not to declare war on the locus because it prevented her from spying within it.

  “Hrm,” said Bethel. She sighed and looked away from me.

**** It means that Amaryllis would have had to take upon herself all the risks associated with manipulating Joon's soul for the benefit of only one week of soul fucked Joon (he was always very likely to spend the second week in a 'coffin'), a week in which his schedule was mostly tied up at the athenaeum. There were many possibilities put forward regarding what Amaryllis hoped to gain and why such a risk would be justified. Those possibilities have been greatly reduced, especially the possibilities with the most benefit.

I think those still unconvinced would be mostly limited to Word of God at this point to have their minds changed but further evidence from the chapter was that the SOC superbeing Val spent time with Joon on two different occasions (and Amaryllis too) and noticed nothing awry. Circling back to the previous point, this limits Amaryllis to changes to Joon's soul that Val can not detect and requires a world in which Val can not read the treachery on Amaryllis' face.

Then from the doylist perspective, AW wrote Joon checking his soul with full knowledge of the soulfucking discussion. It was either intended to clarify that Amaryllis did not mess with Joon's soul or it was intended as a fake out. I guess people can decide for themselves if such a fake out would feel like a cheap trick or enhance the eventual reveal.

FWIW too, going forward there is no stronger evidence that can be given in future chapters than Joon having checked his own soul just under two weeks out and noting nothing amiss.

Vibration magic!

Interpersonal drama!

Confirmation that Amaryllis didn't soulfuck Joon and all that discussion was overreacting!

The burning dude is called Harold!

Really, just fantastic chapters all around. I'm glad that we didn't get 20k more words about Joon going to class, because that would have dragged on quite a bit. I wanted to see Joon actually using still and vibration magic, and he had a chance to use still magic, but I'm content to wait till next release. I'm also wondering if still and vibration magic will extend to people through symbiosis, which will again have to wait until next release.

I sure hope that Bethel stole some books on still and vibration magic from whatever library S&S has, because Joon has been hampered in the past from not knowing abilities that someone of his skill should easily be able to accomplish, as seen in this batch.

Valencia's loyalty up came because Joon had previously said that she shouldn't ever look at him with a devil in her or he would never speak to her again, and he implicitly gave her permission to do so again.

Maybe the Space Plate plus Warder's sight or just Bethel could recover Pallida's hat? Kinda doubt it though.

So Uther knew: Blood, Still, Star, Warding, Soul, Spirit, and probably Vibration magic. Possibly Flower magic as well.

I really wonder how Joon plans to fight something so enormously huge. Maybe there's some weakness only he knows about, some part of its nature that makes it easier for a single person to kill?

The Claret Spear should allow Joon to teleport longer distances with the Ring of the Broken World, if the spear counts as part of himself. That could allow some neat tricks.

A second leg joined it, seeming to come from the clouds themselves, this one piercing straight through Canis Building some distance away. The creature descended slowly, but with the slowness of immense weight, other legs coming down to join the first two, until finally its bulk descended down from the cloud cover. People around me were screaming and running, and all I could do was stare. It had hundreds of eyes, long legs like a water strider, and a coating of short hair that moved without regard for the wind. Its head swept from side to side, and its many-jawed mouth let out inhuman screams in a handful of different pitches.

  “No idea,” I said. “It was on the list that Uther had your father read to me. It sounded familiar, but I don't know if I was just thinking of the poem, or if it's extrapolation from the other stuff, or whether I thought up something and then forgot it.

Daniel111111222222's been diligently putting out more *chapter summaries,* rounding out Book I with chapters 11-14 ("[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/A_Winding_Course][A Winding Course]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Life_of_the_Party][Life of the Party]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Out][Time Out]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/ELEVATOR_facts][Elevator Facts]]"), starting on Book II with chapters 15-20 ("[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Whys_and_Wherefores][Whys and Wherefores]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Kindly_Bones][Kindly Bones]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Voting_Blocs][Voting Blocs]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Communal][Communal]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Montage!][Montage!]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_Course][Desert Course]]"), and skipping ahead to some more recent chapters ("[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Piece_of_Mind][Piece of Mind]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Commingling][Commingling]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Monty_Haul][Monty Haul]]").

And for the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Arches][Council of Arches]] - the organisation.

Wondering who [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Karen_Dowler][Karen Dowler]] and [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Lena_Kordrew][Lena Kordrew]] were? We sure weren't, but MiddleTwin and Daniel have made pages for them anyway. Some more important *characters* - [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Tiffany_Archer][Tiffany Archer]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Clint][Thomas Clint]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Craig][Craig]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Maddie][Maddie]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Larkspur_Prentiss][Larkspur Prentiss]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Heshnel_Elec][Heshnel Elec]] and the entirety of [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Fireteam_Blackheart][Fireteam Blackheart]] - have received pages courtesy of Makin. Newcomer Lumbjack has contributed a page for the biggest of bads - [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Fel_Seed][Fel Seed]]!

Some good headway's being made on the pages for *magic,* thanks to MiddleTwin's contributions of [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Magic][bone magic]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_magic][blood magic]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Essentialism][essentialism]] and an overview for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Magic][magic]] in general. They've also contributed a page for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Host][the Host]].

Makin's done a page on the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Dream-skewered][dream-skewered]], and Daniel's done a pretty comprehensive write-up for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Void][void]]. Together, they've finally tackled one of the big pages we've been putting off - the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Game_layer][game layer]]! You might also want to check out Makin's page for the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Party][party]], his [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Achievements][list of achievements]], and his [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Quests][list of quests]] too. I mentioned his [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_entads][list of entads]] last time, but it's had some significant edits since then.

Now, I won't say his name... but, after countless hours of research and the deaths of several D-Class personnel, [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf][the cannibal]] finally has a page of his own. Visit at your peril.

The Discord widget was made possible with the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:DiscordIntegrator][DiscordIntegrator]] *template,* which also lets us place the widget in the sidebar of every page. I've added a [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Speculation][speculation]] template for citation - please don't use it unless you have to! On the opposite end of the spectrum, you're encouraged to use the new [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Spoilers][spoilers]] template on every page that spoils the story's big twists. Oh, and there's a new template for formatting stuff in the scary red font used for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Gw][game warnings]].

Whew! It's been a busy couple of months, but we still need all the help we can get. As always, I'd like to point people to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorthTheCandle][the TVTropes page]] for the story - linking to that page from various trope pages can really help the story's audience grow. As for the wiki itself, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/al7z2v/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_147148_terrorsvibrations/efbnpat][it's now at the point where CRJ himself can start using it as a resource]]!

** Interesting deconstruction of the soul-battle thing. Normally it's depicted as either a pure battle of wills or as what Gaiman called, "the oldest game" in /The Sandman/. Here in WtC it's frantically destroying braided energy creeping towards June a la Space Invaders.

Also interesting to see just how much Lisi gets under the skin of the normally unflappable Amaryllis (and over the skin of Reimer, heh). I can't think of an interaction the Mary and Lisi had in this set of chapters where Mary didn't express some sort of frustration in the narration about it. She seems to react almost more emotionally to her than to Fallatehr trying to soul-rape her; although it has been a while since I read those chapters and might have glossed them in my memory.

** Thanks for the chapter! I've been really looking forward to this. :)

Three random thoughts:

1) It /really/ surprises me that they read Lisi and Reimer in so thoroughly. I was expecting them to recruit Lisi by saying something along the lines of "We run an island nation full of fish people with impossibly advanced technology, want to be on our good side Y/N", then have her pump Reimer on their behalf (I'm so sorry :) ). Being completely up-front with new, random assets who are not companions seems like a recipe for instant blowback.

2) Is Bethel trying to two-time Ropey, or are Bethel and Ropey trying to rope (heh) Juniper into a threesome?

3) I find it a little hard to believe that Amaryllis isn't aware that Juniper is head-over-heels for her. I know she's been shown to suck at interpersonal/selfish stuff before, but holy freaking crap- even the house and the bottle deer know that he's into her by this point.

** Exciting chapters as always. Thoughts:

- Seems like a lot of character development for Bethel. I wonder if Bethel's decision to help out at the end was driven by guilt over not being there to help when Fenn died and Amaryllis's talk about apologies not being enough. (Where she doesn't have a duty as a house, maybe she has a duty as a friend?)

- For some reason I just found the Juniper/Sonee/Valencia scene super adorable, even though they were all just lying the whole time. I want a spin-off now where Valencia and Juniper are roommate-buddies at college.

- If Juniper sees an exclusion zone occurring in person, it might strengthen his drive to solve the world's problems. (Especially if some of the people he's met get trapped in it.)

** New theory. Partially patternmatching on bad wordplay, partially on plot twists from Terry Pratchett's /Moving Pictures/. In that story, there was a magic sleeping person that the protagonists kept trying to prevent from awakening and it turned out that they were being actually counterproductive because the man awakening would act to restore order by stopping eldritch problems. His awakening was a response to solve the problem, not a symptom of problems and there was great dramatic irony when the reader realised the protagonists had ironically prevented a solution to their own problems.

What if Harold is radically misunderstood - instead of causing or being drawn to crises, instead he is trying to /prevent/ them, to stop them from arising or slow them when they escalate or limit the damage they can cause - which is why the incidents he precedes are always limited... Until now. To use a metaphor... there are two types of people you find running around near fires disproportionately often. One is an arsonist. *Harold could be a [[https://macysthanksgiving.fandom.com/wiki/Harold][fireman]]*. (no I don't think that link is indicative of anything - just amusing). I told you about the bad wordplay - the man made out of fire. Is a fire-man. A fireman. And juniper may have just killed the fireman in psychic combat.

  Hardened Skin: Lessens the toll that physical damage in combat takes on you. Slightly increases natural healing. Increases force required to break skin.

  Parry 20, Prescient Blade: You take half the normal penalty to parry bullets, arrows, or other missile weapons. These attacks still do damage to your blade as normal.

  Dodge 20, Thaumic Dodger: Eliminates the penalty for dodging magic, magical effects, entads, entad effects, and any supplemental physics which would appear magical to The Layman.

  Unarmed Combat 10, Hardened Knuckles: Lessens the toll that unarmed combat takes on you. Does not actually increase the hardness of your knuckles as measured by indentation or scratch tests.

  Six-Eyed: Any attempt to use any system in a non-standard way will be considered one degree more reasonable than it otherwise would be. Any existing virtues, entads, or effects that specify a degree of reasonableness are increased by one degree of reasonableness in your favor (calculated after all other effects). The Layman will look more favorably on your attempts to argue definition.

  Dual Wield 10, Ambidexterity: You no longer have a dominant hand. Removes the penalty for attacking with an off-hand, because you don't have an off-hand anymore. You have no natural preference for which hand to use.

** Random thought through the read:

- Valencia takes on HP seems clouded with Devil's point of view.
- I think that most Bethel's action as of late is influenced by Ropey
- Reimer is ... damn, Reimer-like if that's a word.
- Using magic to solve poop problem... hmm.... why this sounds familiar (just kidding, lol)

*The Burning Man*

So the mystery so far:

1. Murder in the temple: it's probably people who know the Burning Man existence when they meditated. But get killed in their way out because they haven't converted yet and know too much about it.
2. There might be other people who also know but keep themselves silent. Don't know if this is a valid assumption.
3. But if point 2 above true, this informant might tell this info to other group/people in secret, afraid of getting detected by the burning man.
4. The ethic instructor, Malus Lartin, might know this information too from other mouth, hence she refuse June's help worrying if that was a trap from the Burning Man, or telling them in the prison might leak the information to the Burning Man.
5. The group that know the burning man existence might also the one who saved her at the Demon-Blooded Festival

** Huh, there's been a conspicuous spike in 3rd person omniscient narration for the non-Joon characters in the last dozen or so chapters. It's really nice to get into the heads of the companions because I have the feeling we'll never see these sides of them if left to Joon's own devices and AW's narrative constraints on fitting in all the Joon-on-1 interaction combinations. However, like usual, fancy theory time! Besides the expository convenience, the increasing frequency in these short vignettes seems to coincide with Joon's own determination to be more empathetic to his companions (Pallida is an outlier here, wonder why) and, inversely, with a eerie reduction in the Earth DND vignettes. I'm guessing pronpinquity's at work again. But it also feels weird, because Joon is /not/ part of these interactions and he can't possibly know about them unless they recount it to him (IIRC the first secondary POV was Mary's during the Fallatehr arc and that was a recounting). Doesn't seem to be the case here, with how personal these episodes feel. And if we go full meta, the story's a self-insert - where's the meta-knowledge coming from, DM?!

Population density is a helluva lot lower in Aerb. If Earth pop is ~7 billion, napkin math shows that Earth is ~14x as dense in population (even more if the land:water ratio is higher on Aerb).

**** Honestly, having 14x lower population density sounds like it should make isolation even more common, not less. I'm not an anthropologist, but the Earth was pretty darn racially isolated for a long time, and even still is: you're not going to see very many black people or native americans walking around Moscow, and that's with us living in a pretty global society with cheap international travel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26623638][This]] says that the teleport network is basically their best travel system, which 1) has a planar cap of 54,000 per day 2) costs $10,000 per head.

And Aerb is /ten times bigger/. Slowly shifting tribal travel or small scale empires that lead to co-mingling, or even forced racial mixing via slavery systems, aren't going to have as much of an effect. They didn't have world-spanning empires before Arthur came around, and who knows how recent the teleportation keys were created. And according to the renacim, Aerb is only 30,000 years old, and I'm not even sure how advanced of a society they had before Arthur arrived.

I can't model the effects of increasing the area of earth by an order of magnitude, but given that the teleport network has already spread across the hex and that there's been several empires of unification efforts, I don't think it's that surprising to come across a larger diversity in cities (especially since Joon's been visiting athenaeums, which have the means to gather all sorts).
