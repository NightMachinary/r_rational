#+TITLE: r/rational in org-mode

This is an archive of all the posts in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/][r/rational]] subreddit in plain-text org-mode.

I personally use it to do fast, offline full-text searches on the whole subreddit.

Reddit does not map cleanly to org-mode, so I am open to ideas on changing the template used to create the org-mode files.

Github renders org headings as HTML headers, which doesn't work at all for these. Use an org-mode viewer to view the files or just open them as plain-text.
