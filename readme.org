#+TITLE: r/rational in org-mode

This is an archive of all the posts in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/][r/rational]] subreddit in plain-text org-mode.

I personally use it to do fast, offline full-text searches on the whole subreddit.

Reddit does not map cleanly to org-mode, so I am open to ideas on changing the template used to create the org-mode files.

Github renders org headings as HTML headers, which doesn't work at all for these. Use an org-mode viewer to view the files or just open them as plain-text.

** [[https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:indices/.*.org+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/NightMachinary/r_rational%24+&patternType=regexp][Online full-text search]] via Sourcegraph

This search engine was optimized for searching code, so it is not too suitable for our purposes, but it's still much better than Reddit's own search.

[[https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries][Here]] is Sourcegraph's query syntax. The important point is that it supports regular expressions and assumes the words are in the correct order, unless you use [[https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries#boolean-operators][boolean operators]] such as =japanese AND horror=.

Note that the link above searches in the =indices= directory, where each file contains only a single comment. This is usually what you want . (It's only drawback being that it's tedious to find the comments around the found results.) To search per submission (instead of per comment), use this [[https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:posts/.*.org+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/NightMachinary/r_rational%24+&patternType=regexp][link]], which searches the =posts= directory instead.

** Searching via =ugrep=

Install [[https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep][GitHub - Genivia/ugrep: üîçNEW ugrep v3.3: ultra fast grep with interactive que...]] by, e.g.,
#+begin_example zsh
brew install ugrep
#+end_example

Now paste this function into your shell:
#+begin_example zsh
ugc () {
    ugrep --heading --color=always --pretty --context=3 --recursive --bool --smart-case '--sort=best' --no-confirm --perl-regexp --hidden '--binary-files=without-match' "$@" | less -n
}
#+end_example

Now you can do:
#+begin_example zsh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NightMachinary/r_rational
cd r_rational/posts
#+end_example
#+begin_example zsh
ugc 'japanese horror'
#+end_example

[[file:readme.org_imgs/20210531_174125_jXIQ5n.png]]

=ugrep= also supports an interactive, incremental search mode:
#+begin_example zsh
function ugci {
    local r="${@[-1]}" opts=("${@[1,-2]}")

    ugrep --heading --color=always --pretty --context=3 --recursive --bool --smart-case '--sort=best' --no-confirm --perl-regexp --hidden '--binary-files=without-match' "$opts[@]" --query=1 --regexp="$r"
}
#+end_example

#+begin_example zsh
ugci 'japanese horror'
#+end_example

* FAQ
** Reduce storage costs by deleting =indices=
This directory saves each comment to a single file, which is very [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/62049/why-are-text-files-4kb][inefficient]] on modern OSes with a block size of 4KB. If you don't use these files, deleting them will reduce the size of this repo by a lot (as of this writing, the =posts= directory is only 163MB). You can also delete the =.git= directory, but then you would lose access to =git= features such as pulling new updates.

** Search excluding the authors' names
The easiest way to achieve this is to delete the authors' names from the data using a search-and-replace tool such as [[https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad][ms-jpq/sad]]:

#+begin_example zsh
fd . | sad '\s*:author:.*' ''

fd . | sad 'u/\S+' 'u/redacted'
#+end_example


* How was this repo made?
This repo was created using this [[https://github.com/NightMachinary/.shells/tree/master/scripts/python/reddit][script]], which needs some refactoring to be decoupled from my environment.

I plan to keep the repo up-to-date as new posts are added to the subreddit.
