** *Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

** It is still too early for me to give constructive commentary or start speculating about where this is going, but seeing how no one else has commented yet I want to at least say that this is intriguing and that I hope you wont stop writing.

Do you have an estimate on how many chapters it will take before we return to a viewpoint character for a second time?

*** Thank you for commenting. It really does mean a lot to me. >:]

We'll be returning to Simon in the next update. These first few chapters are a little tricky in having to balance the need to show certain characters and events with the need to actually have some of our main characters appear more than once. This is one of the reasons why I settled on two updates a week, since it means that we get a main character at least once a week.
