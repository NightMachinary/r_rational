** After almost four years, I'm finally closing the book on Orders of Magnitude, with a Christmas Day release of

- The rewritten final chapter (which had been inadvertently reverted to a previous, unfinished version)
- An epilogue
- 30 pages of Author's Notes to explain what the hell is going on.

** I binged this story in two days and I think it's an incredible story. Reading it gave me the same experience of reading /Significant Digits/ or HPMOR for the first time. And like those I will definitely come back and re-read it in the future.

I definitely look forwards to reading your other works, including /The Longest Day/ and anything you write in the future!

** Genuine question, how does this fit in the rest of the story? I understand it's a prequel, so can you give me some relatively non-spoilerish sense of how it can contribute to additional world building and plot, or if it's just someone else's story in the HPMOR world?

*** It addresses definitively the question of where Magic came from and how it works, along with what ends up happening to the majority of the main characters from HPMOR
