This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which starts November 1st; we'll have four or five of these posts throughout the month.

- Want to check in your some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

(This thread will be pinned after a day or so.)

** I'm still going strong on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]. I'm kind of amazed that I'm already up to 28,000 words, including 5800 words so far in today's binge. I expect my word-rate to drop sharply, though; I'm just about at the point where the story starts getting complicated, as some long-standing near-isolation falls away, and I expect I'm going to have to start keeping track of a lot more characters and won't be able to keep the plot as abstract as it's been.

*** I'm curious, what are all of the stories you've written? I think I know of all of them: SI, Extracts, Wierdtopia, Myou've Gotta be Kidding Me, LoadBear FAQ, and some stuff on Orion's Arm.

Has there been anything else written by you (the wonderful author) floating around on the Internet?

**** That's... actually a bit tricky to answer. Short answer: "Yes".

Example; I just did a big of digging, and found what may be my oldest surviving piece of fiction: "[[http://www.datapacrat.com/Art/Fiction/STORIES/REALITYS.TXT][Reality Slips]]", which I posted to a mailing list in [[http://www.datapacrat.com/Art/Fiction/STORIES/SLIPS.TXT][1996]] (which I'm still [[http://lists.integral.org/listinfo/tsa-talk][subscribed]] to :) ).

You'd need an account at the site to see the NSFW content, but most of the items posted to my gallery at [[https://www.furaffinity.net/user/datapacrat/][FurAffinity]] were written, or at least scripted, by me. I've been posting various pieces of original content there since 2011 (most of which were drawn by other people to my specifications); from about 5 to 2 years ago (when I started SI), I was focused on building a fairly-hard-SF(-but-furry) universe.

In the large time gap between, IIRC, most of my creative efforts went more towards role-playing games, particularly PBeMs for which no public record exists. But there could easily be some scattered items I've since forgotten.

** I've barely broken 2k, but at the very least I have managed to do something I've never done before. Written something!

The annoying part is that my antagonist is so much more interesting than the hero that they've switched roles. Jackie is the one I'm going into detail about and has massive amount of power compared to Alan who is shy and insists on being mysterious.

So I'm switching the two and instead of watching a rationalist out-think a very arrogant character, we're going to be watching an arrogant protagonist get beaten by a rationalist and hopefully learn something important from him. Note that neither are actually meant to be "evil" but one of them is more impulsive than the other.

The prologue is really short, but the exciting bits of scientific experimentation is about to start! I plan on actually detailing out how professional researchers actually hypothesize, test, and analyze experiments in a live lab setting.

** Just passed the 15k mark last night. Tomorrow I'll be flying from the west coast to the east coast, and thus losing 3 hours. Hopefully I'll be able to get all my writing finished on the plane, because there's no way I'm going to be up for it after the flight.

The story is /finally/ picking up - recently wrote a pivotal scene that I've had in my head since I started the story last year. I'm planning on continuing to write 2k words a day after NaNo finishes, until I finish Part Two. I want to have this book complete before the summer, revisions and all. Also need to learn how to write a query letter.

** I gave someone a magic item without knowing what that magic item does. /Ideally/ everything that the heroes gain along their journey gets used by the climax. The problem comes with creating a climax that uses all those Chekov's Guns that were placed earlier; I think I really need to sit down and figure out which guns I left lying around, though most are accounted for. That doesn't solve the problem of /this specific gun/, whose form is not yet known to me, and which I will have to try to slot into the quickly-approaching finale. Not sure whether it makes more sense to build the gun first, or the gun's target.

(Making sure that all setups have payoffs is another one of those things that tends to be easier to do /after/ all the writing is done.)

(The magic item was something done on a whim, probably good for the story, and /by itself/ offers a different kind of setup ... but a bracelet made from a river spirit needs to both set up a rule /and/ have its own payoff.)

*** Maybe it could let the wearer breathe underwater? There is a large quantity of gold in the sea by the capital, and gold is always useful, especially if there's a dark, powerhungry mentalist on the throne. If Henry knows the ritual for walking underwater, it's less useful, but if they become separated, or can't find a tooth that satisfies the strict requirements, it could be important.

*** It /could/ just be a token, with no magical powers whatsoever. Think of the leaf-clasps of Lorien - their only purpose is to signal that the bearer is favored by the gifter, and the only role they play later is as a dropped breadcrumb.

** Not doing a good job at hitting the word counts, but I have a few fun moments planned for this little story [[https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2016/11/12/genie-2/][here]]

Hoping to get some escalation, fun references / dialogue, and find some other weird ways of abusing severely limited magic abilities.

*** I've tried outlining everything in advance - and haven't gotten around to starting to write the actual story. I've tried winging most everything - and ended up with sprawling stories that I haven't ever finished. I've tried taking a dream and building a world around it - and [[http://www.datapacrat.com/weirdtopia/index.html][Living in Weirdtopia: Week One]] seems to have been generally positively received. I don't know that there's any useful advice that /can/ be given on this.

The prompt that I've found most appealing, though I haven't quite gotten the knack of sticking to it: "Write just the most awesome parts."

yeah, I think this is the advice I need to follow. go after what's exciting for me, and let the rest sort itself out. this helps with both motivation and keeping the story tight.

*** I'm not an /obsessive/ outliner, but I do think stories go better (if not faster) when I have points that I need to hit. Every scene remaining for NaNo has a one sentence description that says what the scene is; if I were better at outlining, I would probably include things like what the scene is meant to accomplish and how it ends (and ties into the next scene in the chapter).

But looking back on my original outline, now out of date by two years, I haven't stuck all that close to that original draft (which I think was a tighter story).

** I've realised that I have hardly any action scenes and all the sex is off stage. This kinda means I have 20 thousand words of conversation and exposition :-(

This is supposed to be a discouraging stage, right?

*** I have a couple dozen thousand words... mostly in the form of my protagonist talking to himself and being paranoid.

You might want to consider explicitly writing down what your goals are, the reason you're giving NaNoWriMo a try in the first place, and then measure how well you're doing against that criteria rather than worry about any vague discouragement. For example, my main goal is "get into the habit of writing daily"; and even when I tried to take a day off, I ended up writing a couple thousand words of worldbuilding, so I'm pleased, even if the novel I end up with is so abstruse that almost nobody else ever wants to read it.

** Hit the halfway point ahead of schedule by a few days, but behind my all-time NaNo pace (where I was at 30,000 today).

Finally, after two years, I'm pretty much at the bottom of the second act, when our characters are at their lowest. Though the story was actually plotted out using story circles, which puts me at around 5 or 6 (of 8). Step 5 is "Meeting the Goddess", Step 6 is "Meet Your Maker". S is /metaphorically/ at meeting the goddess, but /literally/ at meeting her maker ... I think the element of /choice/ comes in at confrontation with the V/M/C trio (who probably need another scene or two of fleshing out, but I can do that in post). Movement beyond the landing of the crown must be of the character's own volition.

In the original sketch of this story, the protagonists went down to the castle, got their asses kicked, regrouped, and then saved the kingdom together. I'm now sort of thinking that this is too much of a reversal of momentum so late in the book and I might be better served by just cutting out the "asses kicked, regrouped" part. But there were a lot of things that I wanted to write that would have led up to a final assault, which I think would maybe have to be done away with? I'm trying to find a way to have my cake and eat it too here.

(I don't think the actual ending is up in the air right now, but the implementation of it is. Which is kind of scary because I'm a day or two away from starting on the ending.)
