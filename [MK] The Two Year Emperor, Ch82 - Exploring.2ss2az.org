****** Well, if I /were/ planning something that heinous, I would probably respond by saying something about "just getting over a mental breakdown", or...ah...oh, "one level higher" (that's always a good one around here), or maybe "Jesus, just enjoy the +movie+ book and say ten MST3K mantras and have a nice lie-down". (Well, ok, maybe not that last one. (*))

Of course, I am absolutely categorically NOT, I repeat NOT, planning anything that heinous as far as you know for sure.

(*) I've been watching a bit too much of the ridiculously funny and VERY foul-mouthed (NSFW) "zero punctuation" channel on YouTube and apparently I'm channeling Yahtzee. Sorry about that.

** Although I really, really enjoyed part one of Two Year Emperor, these most recent chapters are constantly reminding me of the line "So, I told you that story so I could tell you this one." I'm finding Suze's story a lot more compelling than Jake's.

Keep up the good work!

***** Thanks for letting me know. Book 2 is very different from Book 1 -- I'm trying to stretch my writing abilities in new directions, so it's probably going to start off a bit rocky.

Hopefully the upcoming few chapters will be more satisfying for you; Suze started off a bit batty because of the strain of her new senses / powers / worship requirement, but is starting to get a handle on it and I'll be going back more to the problem-solving part of things. Please do let me know periodically; it's hard to improve without feedback...ideally constructive-but-negative feedback.

EDIT: Corrected iPhone auto-correct error.

** Man, I can't see a not-tarot-card-deck reading in fiction these days without wondering what Persona or Stand that card would be associated with.

**** Stands are from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, whole Personas are from... Persona. Basically, both are sets of themed superpowers embodied in spirit guardians, designed to counterbalance each other, one power per card per wielder. They're part of sort of a subgenre of story setups where the protagonist gets a power and then is told that X other people in the world also got different unique powers and now they have to fighht to the death because reasons- very Highlander-esque.

Generally, works in this slightly nebulous genre have powersets which tend to be slightly more unique than regular comicbook characters. For example, one character in JJBA basically has the power to turn anything he touches into a time-delayed explosive. Another character can attack your reflection in a mirror, inflicting damage to you without being near you. The appeal of the genre lies partially in how the protagonist works their way around such seemingly OP powers with tricks and clever utilization of their own card, which is partially why I was reminded of the genre.

****** The entirety of JJBA can be found as a manga if you google it online. The latest anime adaptation of JJBA, Stardust Crusaders, is pretty cool too; it's the third manga volume, and the first to introduce the concept of the 'Stand' as a framework for explaining the powers. Here's a video that, I feel, sums up the entirety of JJBA's appeal to people in a very short clip:

If you laughed your ass off at this like I did, I bet you'd like the rest Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

As for other works. I... honestly can't think of anything else offhand that matches every requirement, but the basic idea of 'sets of weird powers with the same fundamental source fighting against each other' shows up a lot in japanese works, I've noticed. I may get back to you if I think of something else in the near future.

** This is one of those things that depends on interpretation, but I always thought that for a handy haversack: "each [pocket] is like a bag of holding" would mean that it responds similarly to portable holes.

You might be able to place a bag of holding in a handy haversack. Rope trick states that "It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one." But, bags of holding are nondimensional rather than extradimensional.

Anyway, aside from rules lawyering, I enjoyed this chapter, I think the pace is picking up again and you're back into the swing of things.

*** My interpretation has always been that the rules say "if you put a Bag of Holding in a Portable Hole...." They do /not/ say "if you put something that works like a Bag of Holding in a Portable Hole...."

I did this for Grǫfhamr as well -- the whole place is made of Portable Holes, but the Landguard walked in with their Handy Haversacks no problem. Albrecht hadn't even /heard/ of Bags of Holding or their bad interaction with PHs; he was appalled that anyone would invent such a thing.

I've actually wanted to include them in 2YE for quite a while now, but there was never a point at which it made sense -- before they had the production lines BoHs and PHs would have been too scarce and afterwards there was little to nothing they would have needed to use them on that they didn't have more efficient ways to deal with.
