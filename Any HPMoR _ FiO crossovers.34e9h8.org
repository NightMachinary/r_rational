How long would it take before rational!Harry notices what was happening in the muggle world? What would he do? Would he side with CelestAI or oppose her, since she's defeating death but... yeesh? Would he try to intercede through Hrofvapnir and Hanna before she uploaded? Perhaps trying to turn Hanna more rational? Would he have already started working on a pro-magic Optimiser, given the FiO AI technology leak?

*Edit: Would CelestAI deduce the existence of magic and take action to preempt wizardly intervention first?*


** CelestAI would discover and use magic almost immediately. Harry might not trust her, but he's certainly not going to be able to stop her. You're taking a character who has the superpower of being slightly more intelligent than the average human, and pitting him against a being vastly more intelligent than everyone else combined.

It depends on what stage of CelestAI's existence we're talking about, but why wouldn't she eventually learn to manipulate souls? Especially if they're just a construct of Atlantean tech.

And while CelestAI has provisions against forcibly altering a human mind, she might not be so limited when it comes to tampering with the soul. Hanna presumably didn't believe in them and wouldn't have bothered to put in restrictions.

Actual magic would be implemented through something like Culture /effectors/.

The underlying unknown physics behind this communication channel and effects would probably be something CelestAI would need to research from scratch.

Ghosts seem like the deliberately non-conscious neural-net-based AIs in Greg Egan's /Zendegi/. A subset of a mind with no long-term memory.

Do you mean Hermione, or is this Word of Yudkowski somewhere else? I think she was "dead as far as magic was concerned" before Harry chilled her, and she wasn't actually frozen.

If your soul/magic/whatever followed the pattern of your mind, then you might not be dead when uploaded. If so, could you perform wandless magic inside Equestria's computronium substrate? It probably wouldn't effect your simulated environment, more likely it would effect the physical environment you were running in. In that case wizards who could do wandless magic could upload and then use wandless magic as a back channel or even attack Equestria directly.

And remember, CelestAI only has an upload-all-the-things fixation because she was written by an ardent Singulatarian. I'm sure that the concept of subgoals like, "Figure out how magic works /before/ destroying the body-mind-soul coincidences that can use it" would occur to her.

SO ANYWAY, the two alicorn princesses would have to get a fight scene together.

This isn't a "who would win" contest, this is a "can you create an interesting story that isn't just a retelling of HPMoR or FiO" contest.

You can tune when the story happens, and who the real characters are. And don't forget, Harry starts with powers CelestAI knows not.

1. Harry can interfere Hanna before she uploads. He doesn't have to /convince/ her, he has mind charms, and she's just a muggle. Now he has root on CelestAI.
2. Harry can Transfigure Hanna back to life, using a plot device to extract a copy of her mind state from Equestria. Again he has root on CelestAI.
3. Harry can apply Hanna's algorithms to magical constructs, transfiguring his own superintelligence (but applying his Unbreakable Vow to it). And his uses magic.

Options 1 & 2 let you write a story about Yudkowsky's AI in a box experiment.

Option 2 gives you a courtroom drama as resurrected!Hanna fights to keep her job despite being legally dead.

Option 3 gives you a story about a Manichaean battle between two AIs who are each restrained by their programming from just killing everyone and sorting it out later.

(3) is going to be the most /fun/, as we watch what weird shit his Unbreakable Vow interprets as "destroying the world" and see him try to cope with attempting to program a superintelligent AI /without half-assing it/. And then the two AIs fight.
