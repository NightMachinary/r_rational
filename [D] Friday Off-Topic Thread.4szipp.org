Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

It doesn't go deeply into difficult math and does not have a long list of prerequisites, instead it describes an easy way to get started with DL, explains how to quickly start building stuff and learn everything else on practice. It's helping me a lot.

Also there's a free course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, it's a great introduction into general ML, it was very useful to me as well.

** So I'm curious, what were your thoughts on the last Re:Zero episode?

Personally I loved the balance of animation (the battles were short but interesting), voice acting (which IMO was on point) and music. Particularly [[https://youtu.be/Hi2Xhg5qpo0][the piece that played]] through the episode and how they kept intensifying the sound until reaching the crescendo and rolling credits. It felt like something out of a Western drama.

An interesting point I saw on the direction of the anime is that they [[#s][Re:Zero Web Novel]]. I think besides time constraints it also speaks about the need for scenes to make a point and show some aspect of character development, lest it degrade from the impact and turn into torture porn. I think that links nicely with how another member here complained about how unnecesary are sex scenes in adult literature and movies and I think needless violence must also be moderated and exist to advance the story rather than letting the story drag for the sake of mindless torture. Even in hardcore smut a good story and cohesive plot can make a work go from simply shock factor to something truly memorable.

I think the web novel failed in that aspect and taking from the closest rational work we have, Mother of Learning, it'd be like taking Zorian and making him fail over and over through several chapters without him attempting to at least escape, try to solve the problem or show aspects of his changing psychology. I think that's bound to bore readers and make the scenes lose their impact, leading to readers rage quitting out of frustration.

Now the villain was a curious mix of creepy and comical. I have mixed feelings about him as while I initially found him very creepy in how he takes glee on suffering, after rewatch the impact is a bit lost and he feels more jarring and even a bit silly. I think in part it serves to lessen the darkness of the scenes he appears in with his silly antics and that has been my justification so far but I'm curious on what you think about him.

I'm mainly curious on this community's thoughts on that kind of villain given that they are so far from rational ideals. I know that rational literature aims for villains that are on the more gray end of the scales and have a clear purpose and rational approach to problem solving (ex. Luthor from Metropolitan Man) so has anyone ever attempted to tackle a villain like The Joker, [[#s][Fate/Heaven's Feel]] or [[#s][Re:Zero]]?

Would you attempt to give them a reason to behave that way and a method to their madness or are okay with Complete Monster type of villains? I think not all villains have to be likable or redeemable as long as there're consequences to their actions or they act like bully types/grunts to more manipulative and calculating villains but I'm curious on what the community thinks of them.

About the relationship, I like how they have been developing Rem and Subaru's relationship and it seems as if their interactions were leading to this episode. I think they still fall for some clich√©s with the more jarring being that they show happy moments with the character or the character smiling before they brutally kill them. I suppose the aim is to increase the attachment to the character and make it feel more strongly but I think for seasoned viewers it would have the opposite effect as the moment those scenes appear you know the character is a goner and can emotionally prepare for it.

I've read some complains about how much they have neglected Ram and Emilia but I'm more interested in Rem right now and I like what they've been doing with her so far.

I like how they showed Rem's [[#s][Re:Zero]].

Also Subaru finally got forced to face the consequences of what inaction can do and seems to finally have decided to stop avoiding his problems. Whether he will do the right thing or not is also to be seen.

Personally I've been wishing they also delved a bit more into the politics of the setting as they seem particularly convoluted and interesting but I suppose we're stuck with Subaru for the time being.

Despite that the guy [[#s][Re:Zero 15]] was my favorite and one of the best I've seen in anime so far in emotional depth, can't argue for rational congruence.

It seems the story points towards a villain origin story and have to say it has been interesting so far even if Subaru still is the weakest link IMO given how little we know about him and how he seems to jump into situations without thinking.

--------------

On another note that's related, how long do you spend writing a fic before submitting it? And how much do you re-read it to detect wheter there's any irrational element? Do you get help from betas?

I've always been too impatient so usually wrote my previous fics in a few hours and then hit submit without proof checking because I fear losing patience/inspiration or going into a depression period and forgetting about it.

It has caused pretty glaring flaws and for the stories to flip flop between dark comedy/drama from one chapter to another.

Also I tend to take extremes without thinking, for example if I enjoyed how some comedy turned out, then the next chapter ends up having even more comedy even if it was originally meant to be a serious story. Or if some references were well received then I assume it'd be great to have even more references and it ends up cluttering the story. I'm trying to find a way to purge those flaws from my writing.

After learning of rational literature I've been wanting to adjust to this new style although so far it has been limited to consuming it and trying to find common trends I aim to adapt to my writing style but I'm dying to write again.

Besides that continuing language learning, about to finish the Kanji now I must figure how to craft sentences with them.

Anyway complete monster type villains are my favorite. I've been on record saying I'm pro xenofiction, pro alien goals. The culmination of that in a villain, is someone that isn't trying to make utopia, they aren't doing it for the evuls, they kill your family because the suffering you feel by seeing them dead is identical to the suffering they feel by seeing them alive. A perfect inversion of the human moral compass, that is my ideal villain.

In Unsong, the Archangel Uriel points out that evil can still be 'rational' if you have an unusual utility function:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúI understand this is confusing,‚Äù Sataniel said. ‚ÄúI didn't get it all at once. My first thoughts were the same as yours were -- it doesn't make sense, it doesn't glorify God, we'd have to smite ourselves -- I thought all of these things at first, trust me. But the more Thamiel explained to me, the more it started to come together. You've got to believe me, there's a sort of mental distance here, but there's a self-consistent position on the other side. Like, for example, if we were to defy God, we could smite those who didn't defy God.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúBut I still maintain that that wouldn't increase the glory of God very well!‚Äù said Haniel.

  ‚ÄúRight!‚Äù said Michael, ‚Äúand how would we sing songs of praise? If we smote those who didn't defy God, we'd have to smite ourselves every time we sung a song of praise! There are some serious loopholes here.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúSataniel's position is self-consistent,‚Äù said Uriel, without looking up from the parchment he was writing his proof on. ‚ÄúIt's like representing our desires in a utility function, then multiplying by negative one.‚Äù

***** Sure. Firstly, not everyone needs to be rational for the work to be.

Secondly, Serial killers do exist in real life. Sometimes they even hold an idiot ball in real life, leaving clues and such, just because that's part of what's bringing them enjoyment. Strictly speaking, that's always a bad idea, but I would still call it rational if the utility of the thrill they get outpaces the chance of getting caught multiplied by the potential cost. They only really stop being rational when they start underestimating that chance.

Being rational just means legitimately doing your best to optimize utility within the context of your own utility function. You can't call a particular utility function itself irrational.

That said rational fiction also has to have reasons for things. Serial killers are a real phenomenon. So a few of them here and there seems plausible without much further explanation. But there's still a limit to how evil you can go before you start needing some special reason in your story as to how a villain got to be so mindbogglingly inhumanly evil. Like, once a villain is ok with double-crossing the hero right after the hero spares him you have to start to wonder whether any human could possibly develop a utility function where that's sensible.

Not sure why that's so farfetched. From a rational perspective, as the villain, there could be a dozen reasons to off the hero after he spares you. Of course, they all assume you have the actual means to do it. Villains who try to double cross the hero but are woefully outclassed (a la Frieza vs Goku) are plain stupid. But, in a world where knives kill people, killing someone that spares you could easily fit into a conventional utility function.

It turned out that worldbuilding is very hard for me to do. I tend to worldbuild as I write. Then I run into the obvious problem of writing on the fly with no idea as to the direction I am aiming for.

Then again, I think you would have the same problem if you try to worldbuild rather than jump into writing stories.

It's not difficult-- if you have the discipline to write your chapters on time, all you have to do is start writing a few weeks before beginning to post, and delaying chapters so you update at the same rate, but are working on your periodic update x chapters ahead.

#+begin_quote
  The story is already fleshed out, so I don't need a backlog.
#+end_quote

Backlogs aren't intended to solve story-level plot holes. What they do is keep things consistent from chapter to chapter. At the pace most serial writers write (that is, less than a chapter a week) it can be enough time to forget things between chapters and unintentionally cause minor, but SOD breaking snarls.

In addition, if you look back and notice your pacing seems wonky, you can change things around a bit.

Real* authors have the advantage of being able to go back and edit everything into coherency, but serial writings don't have that benefit. A backlog lets you fake it.

I don't write chapters according to a fixed schedule, though I do write everyday for about forty minutes or so, the other twenty minutes or so go to support programming for my writings. I can write 400 words on a good day, but it's usually less than that, say 250. If we consider a chapter to be about three thousand words, then it will take me almost two weeks to finish a chapter.

That is not considering the editing process. I don't have a beta-reader to help out either.

#+end_quote

That... might be a problem. From what I've seen, by far the most important part of getting something popular on the internet is /consistency./ Having a kickass premise and excellent writing is great and all, but you, above all, need to keep people invested in your story. Look at Spacebattle's creative writing section-- even lesser known fandoms have threads that balloon out into the hundreds of pages with consistent updates, but there are plenty of good wormfics that people just lose interest in because they stop getting updated for a while.

That's especially true for an original work. While I'm not necessarily representative of the general population, I keep up with web serials by bookmarking the latest chapter and checking back every two weeks. If it's not updated for a while (my hard cutoff is six months, but I've dropped more recent stories pretty often) I remove it from my bookmarks and forget about it. Other people might do different things, but it's hard to care about a story if you've been away from it long enough to forget about the last chapter.

If you write chapters that slowly you almost certainty need some for of backlog, at least for the initial part of the story to get people invested. I'd also recommend dropping your chapter sizes to two thousand, or even one thousand words if it gets you updating weekly or, if necessary, once every two weeks. If you absolutely have to, update monthly. A consistent update schedule is key, and from there it's not too difficult to make a backlog.

Though there is some hope-- the more you write, the faster you get. Look at how much you type for reddit comments. The problem isn't sheer speed, it's being able to think of how events should follow one another to get to what you want.

*** For me I start with an idea or concept and try and flesh it out adding details over time. While doing this I try to think of the implications of whatever rules, events and situations are occurring how do they affect the world?

Over time I try and add to these adjusting things removing bits and even splitting a fictional world idea into multiple world scenarios independent from each other. The vast majority of these will go no where but there are always gems of ideas that I hope to finally make into stories.

Take any concept and try thinking about the implications that would have on society if it were to suddenly happen. This is the mind set I use for doing world building. When establishing your "present" time frame for your story you also need to develop the history of the world as that affects how the inhabitants will interact. Not every event will happen in the most predictable way take a look at real world history for that reference. More over the accepted history is not necessarily the real history yet both can have trickle down effects that need to be accounted for.

For me this comes easy however creating a story out of this is a lot harder for me as the personal level details come a lot harder to me than the big picture (It is just the way my brain works). Thus I usually go back to world building after hitting a wall when trying to write a story... Maybe some day I will finish a chapter?

I don't know if my thought process will be helpful to you especially as it is flawed in that I get stuck on the world building phase adding more and more details.\\
I can't do character interactions on a personal level or come up with even simple names. I start from the mindset of a scientist and historian. I know how the events in my worlds will generally play out how the large scale society will react economically socially and politically but I fail at translating that to the individual level.

- soft worldbuilding is stuff that can be modified without breaking things apart, e.g.: protagonist' background/goals, names, geography, politics.

I try to nail every hard aspect before writing the first chapters, but I may write a few scenes to flesh out some ideas, and try to have an idea about every soft aspect, sometimes written down.

I was at first stymied by the problem of drawing segments that crossed discontinuities--but then I remembered that I could just draw the faces individually and stitch them together later in [[http://www.gimp.org][The GIMP]]! I find this initial oversight rather hilarious in hindsight.

It's kind of interesting to consider what's necessary to push you away from a website.

Some months (years?) ago, I noticed that TV Tropes had removed its [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBraid][article]] on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/--due, of course, to its portrayals of intercourse between minors. (On [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/remarks.php?trope=FanficRecs.NarutoPeggySueFics][this page]] can be found a discussion of how this removal is unfair when the page for /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/, which contains several similar scenes, is still up.) This annoyed me, but I definitely didn't care enough to declare (to myself...) an official boycott of the site--especially when I wasn't aware of any alternatives, and when I hardly used TV Tropes anyway.

Some months (years?) later (and ago), I somehow (through checking whether /Time Braid/'s page on TV Tropes had been reinstated, maybe?) became aware of [[http://allthetropes.wikia.com][the All the Tropes Wiki]], which [[http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/All_The_Tropes:Why_Fork_TV_Tropes][apparently]] had been founded in response to the TV Tropes crackdown on NSFW pages (most infamously, IIRC, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaughtyTentacles][Naughty Tentacles]], which, IIRC, used to have a warning reading something like "We don't want content like this on this website" rather than a standard "deleted page" message, before the site's recent major update). Again, I didn't care too much about officially switching what little allegiance I had--since I hardly used TV Tropes in the first place, since I assumed that the new website must have significantly fewer editors and less content than the well-established version, and since I already disliked Wikia after once or twice being attacked with browser-redirecting ads on the [[http://naruto.wikia.com][Naruto]] and [[http://gundam.wikia.com][Gundam]] wikis (and also because it always seemed rather unresponsive). Still, in the past few months, I've drifted toward linking to All the Tropes rather than to TV Tropes when a link would be useful.

I still don't particularly like Wikia, but I haven't seen any especially-irksome ads on it in a while--and, in the course of writing this comment, I discovered that there's [[https://allthetropes.org][a /second/ All the Tropes Wiki]] on a non-Wikia site! Thus is completed my slow transfer of allegiance from TV Tropes to All the Tropes, I guess...

(I wonder--[[http://www.reddit.com/r/WikiInAction][will a similar process ever happen with Wikipedia?]])

Some weeks ago, I was very interested to see the esteemed [[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4modgn/monthly_recommendation_thread/d42go68?context=9][mention]] that he wrote directly in "raw [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets][CSS]]". I've done a few simple things with HTML, just for fun (in addition to some school assignments in the distant past)--copying from /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps][GURPS]]/ books ([[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Dogfighting%20Combat.html][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/FGeKwUx.png][2]]), making [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Italia%20structure.html][a tree structure]] of a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings][/Crusader Kings 2/]] game, uploading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11746791/1][a chapter]] to FanFiction.net (after seeing zillions of authors whine about how their non-=<hr/>= section-break markings were constantly devoured by the site--tee-hee!), and writing a program to download chapters from FanFiction.net (with everything but the text of the story removed). It really is fascinating, to see how a bunch of complicated, repetitive actions can be moved and condensed into the header of an HTML file, or into the classes and functions of a [[https://processing.org][Processing]] program, or into the styles of a Word document...

And, on the topic of forms of address--"*The esteemed* EagleJarl"! [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4rv3as/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d54bvcd]["*Mr.* Yudkowsky"]]! It's an interesting balancing act. On the one hand, anyone who can write a long, interesting, complete story is better than I am, and deserves thanks from me for condescending to allow me to read what he writes--but, on the other hand, exactly /how entertaining/ does a writer need to be in order to receive a title when referenced in his view?

Really, of course, a large part of it is just virtue signaling, both to the subreddit and to the referenced people themselves--I've got to one-up you plebes who call the codifier of your favorite genre so familiarly by his Kira-damned /first name!/--but part of it is /actual/ admiration, too. What's the cut-off? Would ShaperV deserve such treatment, if he frequented this subreddit? Would Orson Card? Would Chris-chan? (I mean, he /is/ a better artist than I am.) It's a /vaguely/-interesting question, I guess...

*** Inclusionists have been complaining about Wikipedia's deletionists policies for more than a decade. It's not going away.

Many sites were made to try to replace Wikipedia outright, but none found success. What ended up happening is that wikipedia was +replaced+ complemented by a million smaller online encyclopedias, each focusing on one aspect of the world that Wikipedia thinks is not notable. The sites you mention only exist because the deletionists won and people moved that content from Wikipedia to sites like wikia and TVTropes.

I'm not sure what this means for the potential successor sites to TVTropes. Maybe replacing TVTropes outright is hopeless but separate sites for the discussion and storage of encyclopedic knowledge about all the different fandoms that were rejected by TVTropes will start to emerge.

**** Instead of a fork, it would make a good deal of sense to have a complementary wiki with just the content TVTropes doesn't want on their site.

But that might make it look too much like a porn website, with all the issues that come with it (NSFW, a culture that's too heavy on porn jokes etc.). The Voat problem, basically.

***** When Star Wars fans got mad at Wikipedia for deleting non-notable Star Wars stuff, they didn't make a new Wikipedia dedicated specifically to non-notable stuff. That would be silly. Instead, they made a wiki about specifically Star Wars.

Likewise if Time Braid fans are upset that TVTropes deleted that entry because of NSFW content, it's probably a bad idea to make a TVTropes for NSFW works. It's better to make something like a FanficTropes or even NarutoFanficTropes website.

****** Problem is that then you get a bunch of unrelated wikias in many places. One of the things I like of Tv Tropes is that I can search for a specific theme and find all the works that follow that trope.

Its very useful to find new stories or interpretations of a given theme without having to read all the work beforehand and facilitates deciding whether something is worth reading or not.

Probably. In a way it reminds me of an event that happened here when the [[/r/news]] sub started censoring information about a shooting and there was a progressive backlash towards other subs that allowed those threads.

Reddit addressed that complaint and slowly have been trying to turn opinion back but Tv Tropes doesn't seem to be attempting to listen to the community.

My only problem with the All The Tropes Wikia is that they still lack information on a lot of sources but it seems to be doing well and probably may replace TvTropes if those issues of censorship continue.

I agree that its annoying, particularly because these are fictional works.

*** I think that this might be the first time Chris-chan has been mentioned on this sub. Which is interesting, because CWCville has some (but not all) of the features of an NRX society: most importantly, an absolute czar, and what seems like a strongly reduced presence of "the Cathedral" (however, this is probably because CWCville itself exists only in his mind).

*** My problem with criticism of the TVtropes moderation is that I remember the really bad old days.

I remember the first time I saw an online post commenting about the toxic elements of TVtropes and having a flashback to some days before when I was binging on it and I stumbled upon what was in retrospect a very pedophiliac comment. Suddenly it became easy to see a very dark side of TVtropes in its comments and interpretations, and that soured the site for me for a long time.

So I don't really see it as an inherent problem that they remove certain pages when those kind of problems pop up once more, I expect that they might be a bit overzealous but I highly prefer that to see the site burn from the inside once again.

** A bit late, but it started a bit late. What do people on here think about the coup attempt going on in Turkey right now?

It's too early to say what's going to happen, but boy do we live in interesting times with all the baggage that goes with that.

Something I've noticed about myself this year is that I'm way too unwilling to give any weight to the chance of massive change. I didn't think there was practically any chance of Brexit, mostly, I think because I've never lived through any changes on these levels.
