I'm a lover of fiction but haven't heard the word rational, what does it mean in terms of literature?


** A good place to start:

#+begin_quote
  There's a scene in the movie The Hobbit II: The Desolation of Smaug which Tolkien did not put into the original book.

  The movie version goes like this: The thirteen dwarves and Bilbo Baggins have just spent one and a half movies fighting their way to the place where Thorin, leader of the dwarves, expects to find a secret entrance into the lost dwarven kingdom of Erebor. This entrance can only be opened on a particular day of the year (Durin's Day), and they have a decoded map saying, Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the last light of Durin's day will shine upon the keyhole.

  And then the sun sets behind a mountain, and they still haven't found the keyhole. So Thorin... I find this painful to write... Thorin throws down the key in disgust and all the dwarves start to head back down the mountain, leaving only Bilbo behind to stare at the stone wall. And so Bilbo is the only one who sees when the light of the setting moon suddenly reveals the keyhole.

  That thing where movie!Thorin throws down the key in disgust and walks away?

  I wouldn't have done that.

  You wouldn't have done that.

  We'd wait at least an hour in case there was some beam of sunlight about to shoot through the side of the mountain, and then we'd come back tomorrow, just in case. And if that still failed we'd try again a year later. We wouldn't drop the key. We wouldn't wander off the instant something went wrong.

I can also imagine a “rationalist” retelling where Thorin realizes partway through that they've no hope against a dragon and keeps trying to find face-saving (and life-saving) outs, having long discarded greed and pride but just wanting to reconnect with his old dwarf-college buds lol

Alternatively, maybe Thorin reasons that the solution-space of some arbitrary dwarven puzzle is so mind-bogglingly vast that fiddling around in the neighborhood of his incorrect solution has little expected payoff. If your 32-digit keycode doesn't work, there are so many "reasonably close" codes to explore that even if you're in the right ballpark and dedicate your life to trying different codes, you'll never find the correct one (ofc this gets proven wrong when a nearby solution is indeed found, but maybe Eru had a hand in that, or something).

Sure, Thorin's reaction could easily be /rationalized/ by positing him having reached that moment by way of a counterfactual trajectory that led to the formation of for all intents and purposes a different Thorin. It's still not a perfect fit because it's a post hoc rationalization, but sure. I don't really see what that has to do with the actual reaction of the actual Thorin presented in the movie.

I still hold that this is the quintessential property that defines "rational fiction." I'm still not a big fan of the current sidebar definition, it's just as vague and generalized as the definition it replaced and is too inclusive of anything that just so happens to have strict worldbuilding. Rational fiction isn't supposed to be about worldbuilding, it's supposed to be about [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][intelligent characters reacting intelligently]].

***** Do we have access to movie-Thorin's internal monologue throughout the film? I don't see how supposing some measure of self-doubt as an explanation for his despair in the face of defeat is inconsistent with his prior actions. The latter two points refer of course to a different Thorin, which is why I called it a retelling. I haven't actually watched the films since their theatrical release so maybe I'm misremembering.

I guess I'd prefer that “rational” fiction focus more on internally consistent, realistic worldbuilding that explores the natural implications of some collection of premises, where things don't happen merely as the plot demands. Characters can be flawed and “irrational”, even capricious, so long as their actions are compatible with their experiences and motivation, which are otherwise within the range of variation for their class. I'd sooner call the genre that features “intelligent” characters implementing clever solutions that invoke IRL book learnin' “rational/ist/” fiction, personally.

According to both the old and the new sidebar definitions and the expressed opinions of a lot of people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], there's /nothing/ that distinguishes rational fiction except a collection of tropes related to rationalist fiction.

You can easily type ["hard fantasy"] into the googles and find that people have definitely been throwing the term around for over two decades, if not longer.

********* [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] is a place where people share stuff they made up, as in "this is a picture of a Kerithronean ranger, and here are some facts about how they breed their horses and play the traditional Kerithronean Mounted Games." If you enjoy making up worlds and want to share them without the bother of writing a story, [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] is for that. It is not intended to discuss works of fiction as such.

People may have been throwing around the term "hard fantasy" for some time, but that is distinct from it being a currently broadly accepted and currently popular genre. Sword and Planet, for example, goes back a hundred years, but it's a fairly obscure niche that went out of fashion some time ago. It is also not necessarily the case that all the people using a term are going to be using it to refer to the same thing; the encyclopedia entry you link to limits Hard Fantasy to stories with rigorous magic systems, not to intelligent and consistent worldbuilding fiction in general.

My point is that this place is basically the only destination I've found explicitly dedicated to discussing and promoting deep-worldbuilding fiction. And I've gone digging, for marketing reasons; if there's another such place, and it's got more than two dozen cranky holdouts posting twice a month, I'd be delighted to hear about it. There's spacebattles (and related/schismatic forums) but those are more eclectic, and frankly the proliferation of rules and fights-over-rules terrifies me.

Look at something like Branches on the Tree of Time. It grants the premise of Terminator's worldbuilding and then has Sarah Connor react rationally to the world as it's been presented to her. HPMOR grants the premise of HP's worldbuilding (with a few tweaks to things that really just don't make sense to the point of breaking the setting (like Transfiguration) because a certain amount of worldbuilding /is/ necessary and Rowling didn't do enough because the early books are for children) and then has Harry react rationally to the world as it's presented to him.

Rational fiction was supposed to be about characters and their thought processes, which is incredibly difficult to do correctly. That's probably why there's been values-drift towards worldbuilding^{[/citation needed/]} because that's just /easier to do./

Is there somewhere else we're supposed to take those conversations?

Certainly under stressful situations--and I think the Erebor example qualifies--otherwise sensible people can act in ways that seem senseless. Bilbo might well act calmer and more sensibly because he has much less personally at stake where getting in the mountain is concerned. But I'm going by a description here, since I got bored and stopped watching two-thirds of the way through the first Hobbit movie.

ETA: Phylogenik already addressed this above, more or less. Human, and presumably dwarf, behavior, can't be boiled down to what makes sense in pursuit of explicitly stated goals. Sometimes you're standing by the side of dragon-infested mountain wearing chain-mail underwear, and it's been six months, and you got locked up by an elf and had to escape in a damn barrel of apples and nearly drowned plus there were goblins and spiders, and at the climactic moment you were counting on to see you through everything seems to go wrong and you say AAHHH fuck it, and go down the mountain to smoke pipeweed.

Sure. But emphasis on the word "seem." Human reactions aren't simple. It's never just a single stimulus triggering a reaction, it's everything else that's ever happened in the history of your life and the situation context. There's always reasons for a reaction.

That's what a reaction is supposed to be - you hit the cueball and it strikes the eight ball at a certain angle and the eight ball reacts by going off at a different certain angle.

The issue with Thorin's reaction is based on granting the premise that the eight ball has gone off in the opposite direction from where a real eight ball would have gone in that situation. Arguing over rationalizations for why Thorin's reaction could have been realistic based on different orientations of the cue ball or whatever is fundamentally missing the point. It's just one specific example, you're not supposed to get caught up in dissecting it. It's a common thing in stories, the plot requires that a character react a certain way in order keep the plot from going off the rails, so the character reacts that way regardless of whether a real person would react that way in real life.

To me the gimmicky part of the sequence, as described, is not Thorin's reaction but the "last light" referring to the moon. Bit of a silly gotcha. Also doesn't make any damn sense, because if you're including the moon as a light, what about the stars? But I digress.

Like the scene in Rivendell where the elves are singing "tra-la-lally" and acting silly--Tolkien looked back wincing on that one. Likewise we're never given any hint in Hobbit that the One Ring is anything worse than slightly mischievous, and the original published text had Gollum agreeing to give it to Bilbo as a prize for winning the riddle contest (and apparently intending to honor the pledge).

Gandalf is much more effective versus wargs in Fellowship, basically setting off a magic foe-only firebomb on a whole pack of them. He fights off half the Nazgul on Weathertop with pyrotechnics Frodo et al can see from miles away. He's reluctant to use magic, but when he does use it he's quite powerful.

** My shorthand is "not Harry Potter." HPMOR aside, the original canon shows breathtaking lack of concern for internal consistency or intelligent plotting. The plots of books four and five are both ridiculous Rube Goldberg schemes to manipulate Harry into doing something extraordinarily simple that Voldemort could have accomplished with much less effort ("have Harry touch a portkey without entering a yearlong tournament" and "go get the damn ball yourself," respectively). The books are regularly mocked, even by devoted fans, for bizarre oversights and niggling inconsistencies (as one webtoon put it, "how come they need a permission slip to visit the candy shop, but not to play murderball?"). They're still enjoyable for a lot of people, but making the world and its events plausible is plainly not a priority for the author. In rational fic, it is. Bonus points if the protag wins by thinking things through, and all the other self-explanatory stuff on the sidebar.

In practice, there tends to be a LOT of fan fic, litRPGs, and so on, because that's the general trend in webfic right now. It's not necessary for it to adhere to any particular genre, though given the emphasis on worldbuilding I think it all winds up as some kind of speculative fiction.

** "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality][in honest pursuit of their goals]], as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
- Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.
- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

Presence of these /particular/ features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

*Adjacent tropes:* Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence /doesn't/ make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit][Fair-Play Whodunnit]]: story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.
- Absence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina][Deus Ex Machina]]: established story rules are never broken.
- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction][Deconstruction]]: genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.
- Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.
- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][Genre Savviness]]: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.

** Historically, the term was coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky to describe fiction (or, I suppose, also narrative nonfiction) that gave the reader a peek at the process of /skillful thinking/.

By analogy, "car mechanic-ist fiction" would be a story that would actually teach the reader, by fictional example, a useful lesson about fixing cars.

This subreddit popped into existence mostly nucleated around that original definition, but then the natural thing happened - we just started posting and upvoting whatever we liked. People have retro-codified this as stories driven by lawful rules that the reader can think about in advance, or characters not holding the idiot ball, or characters being smart even if the story doesn't try to teach you to do what they did, or stories about interesting science or philosophy.

So the people whose first exposure to the term "rational fiction" was this subreddit (or something like it), naturally associate the term with what we've promoted via this platform, which might be loosely described as "things you'll like (or more specifically, upvote) if you also like fiction depicting skillful thinking."

** There are some things in general that rational fiction should try to avoid:

- Don't negate cause and effect. Actions should have consequences.

- The main character does not live in a world tailor-made for them to succeed. The same rules that apply to everyone else should apply to them. If they are exceptional in some way, this should be explained, as well as the constraints of their power/ability.

- Villains do not do dumb things for the sake of being evil. Look at pretty much every James Bond villain. Don't just assume the hero is dead because "no one could have survived that" (this applies to heroes as well). Don't throw someone in a cell and forget about them, giving them a chance to escape.

- Don't mix up what is possible and what is probable. Just because something /can/ happen doesn't mean it /should/.

- Don't rely on /Deus Ex Machina/. Solutions should not fall from the sky just because the hero (or villain) needs them.

- Consistent rules with regard to "power levels" - a character should not be inconsistently stronger or weaker just because the scene requires them to fight someone.

- Characters, and in particular their sidekicks, should embark on the journey for their own, legitimate, reasons. Sidekicks in particular seem to always be around at the right place and time to be scooped up by the main character, and instantly join their group when they have no real reason to (and sometimes reasons /not/ to).

- Don't create world that is black and white - people have their own agendas, some might be bad people doing bad things and some might be good people doing good things, but there are also good people who do bad things and bad people who do good things.

- Avoid harems. This is pretty typical when the main character is the hero off to save the world. Women will instantly fall in love with him. If they don't immediately do so, something will happen to make it so.

- Character should communicate. Very often we see misunderstandings turn into something huge because someone was reluctant to divulge a piece of information.

- Characters shouldn't immediately rush to judgement, especially judging someone based off of their appearance or character. usually when this happens, the "twist" is that the guy who was mean and gruff and reluctant to help was really looking out for the main character, trying to teach them something, or didn't want them rushing off to get themselves killed, while the nice guy was manipulating them by feeding their ego or insecurity.

- Avoid "Evil Emperors with massive armies that appear from nowhere" - armies run on their stomach. Supply trains are a thing. An army is composed of more than just a general leading soldiers; logistics, engineering, cooks, doctors, transportation, even accountants make up and army. Soldiers need to be fed, armed, sheltered, paid. Even in an absolute monarchy, the ruler is still constrained by something as simple as crop yields.
