So this is a bit of a grab bag. [[https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost][/Dynasty's Ghost/]], the web fiction I mentioned two weeks ago, is proceeding apace, and, taking advantage of how far ahead I worked on that piece, I've begun a second web fiction on [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]] called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8yvx4a/rebels_cant_go_home/][/Rebels Can't Go Home/]], which features a hunter-gatherer teaming up with an expeditionary force that came from the stars. I also wanted to continue the pattern I set up last time, and suggest a rational-relevant web fiction I had absolutely nothing to do with. Consider [[http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Fanfic/Conquest/index.html][/Conquest/]], a Star Wars/Star Trek crossover that explores differences between those universes at some length.

Finally, to make this post more applicable to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I had a bit of fun writing some discussion questions for posted chapters of /Dynasty's Ghost/ that involve analysis of character choices. Reading them (under the spoilers) might make the web fiction more interesting.

Questions!

Prologue

-What information about the snake person should have been sufficient to cause Ormin to abandon his quest?

Chapter 1

-Based on the information Mai had before Varsis arrived, how appropriate is her reaction to events inside and around the Palace? What might have been a good alternate strategy?

-How strong is the case that Varsis is a traitor?

Chapter 2

-Using information presented in the story, was Broken right to make the pledge?

-Using information presented in the story, was Broken right to continue to withhold information about his background?

Chapter 3

-If you were Salko, how would you have handled the refugees?

-Is Varsis actually upset about Graven? Is this important?

Chapter 4

-What evidence does Mai have to be suspicious of Broken? How good is her case?

-Devin did not seem interested in ransoming Mai. Assuming the impression he is giving is accurate, is he right to have this opinion?

Chapter 5

-Why did Broken disclose Mai's identity?

-Should Mai have tried to escape, or side with the thieves over Broken?

Chapter 6

-If you were a leader in Gansu, would you advocate for pledging allegiance to the pretender Ehajdon?

-Should Mai trust the Minsu?

Chapter 7

-How well does it seem Broken and Moonsinger Fen know each other?

-Lin and Varsis made a similar choice regarding one of the main characters. In what circumstances do you think they might have made different choices?


** Really wanted to give this a try, but already at the beginning of chapter 1 it ends up just way to hard to read... Please get someone to read, correct and edit your texts. Its mostly small things like just exchanging some words, which will make it easier to read, else these small things add up and stop people from reading.

Example:

#+begin_quote
  But then a knock came *+on+/from* the door. As Mai got up, it burst open, and General Varsis walked into the room flanked by two of his soldiers.

  “General!” she cried. “What are you doing here?” She had thought he had left the palace *+when+/like* all the others did, *+when+/while* the mob had allowed all not of House Tachen safe passage out of the city. “Are you here to rescue me?” A glimmer of hope crossed her mind. House Makini could have stayed loyal despite it all.
#+end_quote

I hope this will not discourage you as this is not meant as criticism on your style of writing or story telling. I will try to read further into the story and hope that, like in most web fictions, the prose gets better over time.

*** Thanks for the feedback. One of the reasons I wanted to start posting work was to get information about what kind of approach changes I could make going forward, or on a second pass. I hope, if you keep reading, you do like the core story.
