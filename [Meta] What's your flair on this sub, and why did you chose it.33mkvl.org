Basically, they're Aperature Science if they had to work with severe budget limitations and strict military oversight, and still made badass tech that rivals anything.

I'm often unsure how much of a joke this actually is. Not with you, specifically, but I was trying to bridge the massive inferential gap of my Marxist politics with a friend a week or two ago on Facebook, and I asked him how he supposed the world was /supposed/ to be organized, and his answer was, "I ask CelestAI to organize it for me" -- /and he doesn't even watch MLP/. And I've at least occasionally seen [[/r/rational]], [[/r/hpmor]], and LW posters reference uploading themselves to pony-land as an appealing escapist fantasy (at least, /qua/ escapist fantasies).

The Facebook message thread was insufficient to contain my sputtering of, "But but but that whole story is so /reductive/ of human potential and it gets so many things /wrong/ and why can't someone /do the original work/ of thinking up something /better/ and you can't ask fictional unfriendly superintelligences to make your decisions on social issues /for/ you! And even to the extent she /was/ partially Friendly, if you /punt/ to your /imaginary construct of her/, you'll never understand the Friendliness thing well enough to actually /build/ a program that does anything like that! How do you expect to /get/ Pretty Pony Paradise if you don't understand what underlies it!?"

So instead I just said, "Listen $FRIEND'S_NAME, if you keep punting your decisions to imaginary superintelligences, I'm not building you one." Hmmm... that would make a great flair.

** "And with strange aeons, even death may die."

Lovecraft's universe is extremely irrational, filled with supernatural beings that cannot even in principle be understood. The original line is referring to Cthulhu's watery rest, and is very bad news for humanity. But taking the line out of context, the line sounds optimistic, and all the more so by its contrast to the original meaning.

Any attempt at rational munchkinry by characters in a Lovecraftian universe would be doomed to unimaginably horrific failure. It's not even possible to imagine a well written fiction where something other than that occurs, that doesn't abandon its fidelity to the original works. However, when I imagine the pure and desperate hope it would take for some aspiring hero to even try to fight against such nightmares, I feel awestruck and an echo of that hope blooms inside myself.

This matches my feelings about transhumanism and rationality, another reason the quote is appropriate. I think the technological pace of advancement is overestimated, but more importantly the nontechnological aspects of creating a desirable futurist society are going ignored and almost impossible to overcome anyways. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Moloch]] isn't Nyarlathotep, thank heavens, but he's still stronger than we can imagine. And while rationality is a good target to aim for in the abstract, it's actually more like a curse for real life human beings, or at least it feels that way in my experience.

I'm very pessimistic, but try to clutch at hope and enjoy it anyways.

I've read it literally /six times over/--runners-up for most-read book (four times each, IIRC) are /HPMoR/, /The Three Musketeers/, and /Robinson Crusoe/. I have it bookmarked so that I can recommend it instantly whenever an opportunity presents itself.

*** If you really like Time Braid, then you probably would love to have the chance to have your own copy of it. [[http://ficsave.com/][Ficsave]] is a great site for downloading a pdf, epub, mobi, or text file of any story off of fanfiction.net.

** This thread inspired me to make flair. I've written many posts on [[/r/rational]], but the group I'm most proud of is the setup and follow-through for [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2tw821/roleplayingmk_i_tried_my_hardest_to_win_in_an_ai/co2ylpe?context=3][this joke]] with the unwitting help of [[/u/alexanderwales]] -- so I have chosen an appropriate flair to go with it.
