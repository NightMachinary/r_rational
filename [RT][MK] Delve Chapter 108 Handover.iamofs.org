** Well, that wrapped up a bit faster than I thought it would. Now we're suddenly out of crisis mode and back to "what should I do in this world" mode.

I think the only major unresolved thing is the empire army. I don't think we're at risk of the barrier going down and them invading, so they must be off doing something else now.

Well that and the relationship stuff with Ameliah. I guess that's an unresolved thing too.

**** He definitely should get something out of it. The too Watch dog, the Warden herself, said that Fel Sadanis is a really important city, and if it falls into Empire hands, the war is lost.

There's no way they wouldn't offer a level 25 blue for control of the city and the actual barrier device, which only Rain could find, should Rain offer those terms. Plus, Rain is pretty much the most dependable, capable, and trustworthy Guildie there, so there shouldn't be any possible negative consequences of handing him a blue. The rank shift in Fel Sadanis should more than make up for that blue too, as there should be more and higher leveled blues there afterward.

Delve is quite the rational story and Rain is always a min-maxing person, he'd be a fool to miss out on such an overwhelmingly helpful benefit. Even Velika got a high level blue once she got the city, with the Warden physically there, hell, there should be no issue with Rain actually getting a level 50+ blue with all the help he provided.

If he doesn't get a blue, there better be some really good reason, because he's been stuck at the level cap with virtually no major improvements for half the entire novel, and without a free blue it looks like it's going to take a lot longer before he finally passes level 25 and becomes op.

The system is such a neat idea and well written concept that I want to see explored more, but the main character has been level capped and made no progress for so long. Like half the book at this point.

**** I'm not someone who particularly cares about builds in litRPGs because for me these are supposed to be stories. And if the story the author is trying to tell requires the MC to be at level 5 for 40 chapters that's fine as long as the plot around that is interesting. One of the problems I see in Delve when it comes to Rain's personal growth is that we have been constantly introduced to characters that were /way/ beyond Rain and are putting him in uncomfortable situations because of it. Rain's response to said situations has usually been "I'm gonna get stronger so that this doesn't happen again" but he hasn't really. Whether that's due to the way that the plot is structured or Rain's personal procrastination is irrelevant it still sucks to constantly read about how everyone even remotely important treats him and his friends as stones on the side of the road.

If Rain died tomorrow and we started following the amazing adventures of, like, Kettel, I'd be pretty much fine with it as long as interesting System-related things kept happening; meanwhile Rain heart-to-heart talk scenes do nothing for me.

** This is the the chapter where I think the story drops in quality.

Spoilers for future Patreon chapters and the current chapters of The Daily Grind.

From Rain's plan to start a guild, to how the end of this arc is handled, to how Lavarro and the Platinum Plate are handled to how Velika and the Citizens are handled. It just feels like a bunch of storylines were cut short and skipped while Rain's overarching plan was put on the fast track despite how ill-prepared he is and the story suffers because of it. His plan isn't even necessarily a bad one but he knows so little of the world that attempting to create a group with the intentions to upset the general current order is incredibly rash. And you would think one of his friends would tell him that especially when you consider all the things that they've gone through that are directly related to the state of the world. And it feels even worse when you consider that there is currently another story going through what is roughly the same arc, at least when it comes to the starting a group with the intentions of changing the world, The Daily Grind.

In TDG James has started a guild(or an Order as he calls it) , but the reasons for it are equal part desire and necessity. A huge group of people were just rescued after being abducted from Officium Mundi and the results of said abduction and rescue means that there are now literal dozens of people whose life were screwed with by what can be considered a minor eldritch horror and were erased from the minds of everyone they knew and now have to be reintroduced to society while at the same time these people were exposed to true magic in a world where it was thought to not exist. Many don't want to just give up on that. This means that the people who want to go back to their lives need financial and emotional support while the people who wants to keep diving into the extraordinary need physical and emotional support. Support that as far as he is concerned only he and his group of friends can provide. There's more but whatever, you get it. The reason he hasn't explored more of these places is because despite spending nearly a year searching he hasn't found one yet even with their abilities so the world literally couldn't be explored.

Not to mention the other issues I have with SeneschalSoul's style. None of this is some kind of PSA demanding that people stop reading Delve and read TDG, I just think it's unfortunate.

**** Huh. I get the complaints about characters, (even though I find them adequate), but I think the worldbuilding is quite interesting. I like how the system shapes the society and vice versa.

Also, the scripting is satisfying my thirst for progress for now. Rain is gaining powers outside the scope of even the highest level natives. And sychronization is progress as well. Complicated multidimensional progress is a feature. (Kittens game beats swarm simulator.) All that being said, while I am no longer salty about the recent lack of levels, it would be nice to have some soon.

**** That's fair I guess. Comparatively TDG starts slower than Delve in terms of general plot but I think it's character development is way stronger despite having to spread that development among 3 main characters and 3-4 side characters. I cared more about James' boss than I did most of the side characters that were encountered around the same length of time in Delve, and more than the old mage dude in Rain's party. It also means we got to see more of Officium Mundi and it's effects on the world through James and co then we do in Rain with the dungeons and blues.

****** Janus is the old mage dude, forgot his name.

I have a couple of issues with litRPGs that focus on and fret about that story's system mechanics.

Like, we as readers cannot interact with the system in any way so we can't personally verify anything that we're told. Can you tell me the specifics oh what points in strength means to a person? What does having a 5 in STR mean? A ten? Twenty? Fifty? What about something specific like 327? Do points in STR equate to muscle mass? Probably not but then what? The amount of pounds you can carry comfortably? The amount of pounds a person can put into an attack? Their grip strength? All of those? None?

And even if you know the specific details of the system the author can literally change what the numbers mean later on because they needed to. Where before a person with 20 in STR couldn't lift that huge stone for whatever reason later on another character with a 20 could because the story needed them to. Not to mention that maybe the calculations are wrong and the author would have to go back and redo them to make them make sense. Leaving the people who tried to keep track feeling kinda foolish.

Whereas I can play Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's Gate and see what the numbers mean when I interact with them and what they mean in story. It's why I liked the books that are written in official campaign books of TTRPGs. Whether that's in Eberron(D&D), Golarion(Pathfinder), Shadowrun, or the Ninth World(Numenera).

The characters stats are implied but never stated. But you know they have stats. Meaning that sometimes that strong character can struggle to bear that load that a weaker character holds easily, or a show character can move just fast enough to stop that arrow. But at the same time that strong character can and usually does throw people around like they're children and that slow character can never be on time for most scenes.

TDG does this well because while the characters are given /very/ specific abilities, that's not all they can do. So even if James gets "Crossbow +1" it doesn't mean he can't shoot a flying paper mask out of the sky with a pistol, and when he is get the Accuracy ability that massively increase his ability to hit things it doesn't mean he can't miss .
