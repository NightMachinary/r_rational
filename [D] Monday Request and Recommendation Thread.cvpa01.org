Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  There are two things everyone knows about demons. The first, of course, is that they can make anything that is made out of atoms. They can't make people - when they try they get something that breathes but does not blink, does not flinch, shows no signs of higher brain activity. Atom-for-atom indistiguishable from a human body - a delight to medical schools and people in need of organ transplants, not that you'd get a whole person made if you wanted a kidney -

** *Request:* Stories in which the plot happens at the protagonist's initiative.

Instead of being forced into some kind of plotline by circumstances, the main characters are free agents that decide what goal they want to accomplish on their own, and the plot is about them pursuing it. Said goal could be anything, but I'd prefer a long-term large-scale one.

Things that /aren't/ what I'm looking for:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact][The protagonist is trying to stop the antagonist's plot]].

- The protagonist is responding to some kind of novel crisis (such as a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassSuperEmpoweringEvent][mass empowering event]] or an alien invasion).

- The protagonist is taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (such as getting superpowers or being transported into a different universe). (Even if they have a choice in whether to take this opportunity, the plot is still mainly shaped by it, not by the characters' own goals.)

- The protagonist is working for some kind of organization, and the plot is about them completing its assignments. (It's fine if they're part of an organization, but the plot is about pursuing goals /orthogonal/ to the organization's. There isn't a lot of agency in a soldier following a general's orders... unless the soldier's actual goal is to rise in rank until they could implement some particular changes to military policy.)

*Recommendations:* Science Fiction with Weird Technology

[[/u/Veedrac][u/Veedrac]], last week you were [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/csib4y/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/exf14u4/][asking]] for such stories; here's my list. Note that it's entirely possible you're already familiar with most of them.

(Nature of technology is spoilered where appropriate.)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156775.Quarantine][/Quarantine/]] (78k words) by Greg Egan. What if the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics were correct?

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2372021/chapters/5238359][/Floornight/]] (70k words) by nostalgebraist. Souls-based technology that allows to create and re-integrate parallel timelines.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/59462-orthogonal][/Orthogonal/]], trilogy, by Greg Egan. Set in a universe with wildly different laws of physics. To be precise: it functions on Riemannian geometry, not Lorentzian. See more [[http://www.gregegan.net/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html][here]], down the page.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823062.The_Light_of_Other_Days][/The Light of Other Days/]] (103k), by Arthur Clarke. Easy-to-create wormholes allow surveillance of any location in the past and present.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509784.The_End_of_Eternity][/The End of Eternity/]] (71k) by Isaac Asimov and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10753368-palimpseste][/Palimpsest/]] (28k) by Charles Stross. Same premise: an organization abuses time-travel to control humanity's development from prehistory into deep astronomical time.

- [[https://qntm.org/ra][/Ra/]] (156k) by Sam Hughes. Magic is real. Magic is faked via "nonlocality technology", which allows to directly store and transfer mass, energy, momentum, spin, and electrical charge. Also: simulations are abused.

- [[https://unsongbook.com/][/Unsong/]] (240k) by Scott Alexander. I mean, it sort of fits.

- Cleanest example: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/276516][/Fifty Years in the Virtuous City/]] (8k words).

- [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][/Twig/]] after Arc 10, as [[/u/Juansson][u/Juansson]] recommends below. It features a cognitively enhanced protagonist attempting to destroy an empire from within. It somewhat runs contrary to my third counter-example. I think the caveat is that the "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" of having been enhanced is sufficiently general that it doesn't force the story in any particular direction.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot][/Mr. Robot/]], which is about a hacker attempting to orchestrate an economic collapse.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][/The Traitor Baru Cormorant/]], whose protagonist is trying to destroy an empire from within.

*** You wouldn't happen to be fluent in German, would you? Eschbach's [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausgebrannt][Ausgebrannt]] is about a German dude who comes to the US as a temporary translator in a software project, and has a dream of staying and attaining the American citizenship, and eventually become rich on other people's money and other people's ideas (as you can see, he's not the most alturistic person).\\
The first part of the book is about him determinedly integrating himself into the company, using some almost underhandedly manipulative tactics. The story eventually sees him become a better person, but it's quite a process.

Other than that, I can recommend [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]. The main character, Sylvester, is almost /always/ working on some kind of scheme or plan, even if in the beginning he's usually reacting to something his superiors or enemies pull. His increasing ability to act on his own is one of the more important trends in the story. Towards the end he and his friends become a force with an agenda of their own.

*** Noon EST, seems like a good time if you're living on the east coast. As far as changing it to a more thought out time, perhaps a poll could be taken to find the best time?

**** Unless there's a critical mass of [[/r/rational]] users in a particular timezone, any time will be a bit arbitrary. There's an argument for basing everything on UTC in that case, because then it's at least predictable and consistent as the closest thing to an international "default" there is.

On mobile, so I can't type too much right now.

*** Feeling like a broken record, this is the third time in just this thread that I recommend [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]].

Since you've probably already read that one, I'll also recommend [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Girl Genius]]. Mostly Steampunk, but has some bio-punk mixed in.

The first episode of Love, Death and Robots has drawn comparisons to Twig before, also has [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFS2DWgijh4][this]] rather awesome rendition as a music video.

** I haven't visited the rec threads often, and I don't read a ton of fanfic, so I might be missing something incredibly well-known, but...

Anybody got a rec for a rational SoIaF fic? I've been seeing some of the more grandiose conspiracy theories out there, and it's reminding me how good the books are and how much I'd like to see more stories in the world. I'd especially love if there was one that got more into the mystical elements of the world. AUs welcome, most important thing to me is internal consistency.

Edit: I just remembered the Joffrey time loop one, but the synopses I heard didn't sound like my kind of thing.

*** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/][The King in the Long Night]] is a crossover with Stellaris, where the Commonwealth of Man (militaristic xenophobic human colonist faction) finds the world on which GoT takes place, and decides to uplift them in order to get access to their relatively strong Psykers. For this purpose they identify key players and place agents near them, to influence them in certain directions.

** Looking for a dungeon core story that isn't just a person in a box.

I would also like to see more of a process of discovery rather then the core being handed knowledge of everything to them because they have been reincarnated, magical companion, or game system.

Picked up Dungeon Engineer from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but havnt started reading it yet.
