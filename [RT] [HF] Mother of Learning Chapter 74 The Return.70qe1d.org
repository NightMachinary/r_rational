There are romantic relationships without sex, sure, but I don't see Silverlake or Quatach wanting one. And most of those relationships still have cuddling, kissing, etc, which a lich just can't do.

She's a hermit in the middle of the forest, in a pocket plane /by choice./ He's an animated pile of bones high up in his country's ruling class.

If they wanted a relationship, they'd have one.

First of all it immortality separates them from nearly everyone else and allows a mindset of "we against the rest of the world".

The next thing is that in order to acquire immortality one needs to have a specific type of personality, because one needs to be dedicated enough to reach this goal in one lifetime.

Although ZxZ have the first property and I can imagine Zorian without the time loop could have reached immortality Zach does not have the right personality for it.

********* Thanks for posting it! I just finished reading through it in English, and that post is how I discovered it. [[/u/jaghataikhan]], if you check it out, make sure to get the second translation; it's what I read, and various sources say it's a large improvement over the first.

I had a few minor issues with the text that I presume were translational. It was odd, for instance, to see Elvish "runes" (as opposed to "script" or "letters", or just "Tengwar") mentioned by someone with enough Tolkien lore to mention specific Valar by name. Overall, I found it to be quite readable. I will note though, that it felt very Russian, from the implied worldview all the way down through minor turns of phrase. I'm glad the translator preserved the story's Russian character, but it has a different flow than natively-written English work that I guess could be disorienting.

I quite liked it in the beginning, but like the commenter on the other thread, I found it much less interesting once it became a spy thriller. I enjoy spy thrillers in general; I think the issue here was partly that I wasn't expecting it, and partly that the spy thriller aspect depended on a lot of very minor details happening very far from the main plot. Agents and agencies are hard for me to keep straight when the geopolitical context is fantasy and the story I really care about is 3000 miles from the one I'm reading. Still, I enjoyed it a lot more than I didn't.

I don't remember exactly, but it was in a context that I was reasonably sure it referred to Tengwar. (Maybe it was a note written on paper.) I'd forgotten about the Cirth at the time, though, so I suppose it might actually have meant those. Whoops!

It might be just a translation thing. Or I might be objecting over nothing. It's a somewhat pedantic distinction that only a language nerd would care about, but we all know Tolkien was the biggest of those.

As a native English speaker, and a language nerd, I understand "rune" primarily to mean a symbol that looks like it's from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark][Futhark]], and was probably invented to be carved with a chisel, not written with a pen. Their shape reflects this: Straight lines, sharp angles, few strokes. In Middle-Earth, that would include the Cirth and all later modifications like the Angerthas, but not the Tengwar. As far as I know, this is always what Tolkien meant by "rune".

"Rune" also has a common secondary sense, where it refers to any symbol that has an obscure meaning or is hard to identify, especially if it is associated with magic. This would include the Tengwar for most readers, though it wouldn't for the characters--the Tengwar are just ordinary letters for them. There's also a third, least common sense where "rune" can just mean any letter or symbol.

Of course, maybe the letters in question actually were [[http://www.dafont.com/tengwar-noldor.font][Tengwar runes]].

***** Depends on how it works. Enhancement rituals were mentioned, which tie magical abilities to your life force, a part of your soul. While I'm not too clear on the details, that should carry over between restarts. If the agelessness potion makes you ageless by affecting your life force or some other aspect of your soul, it should be permanent. Similarly, I kinda doubt that Zorian plans to barter for the soul sight potion every restart.

It could work as an epilogue thing, but I think it works better as one of his minor projects that he does to take a break from training. Similar to learning more about Taiven, taking care of Kirielle (sp?), letting Kael advance his medical alchemy, and plenty of other projects that have little or nothing to do with escaping the time loop or dealing with the invasion. It doesn't particularly benefit from the time loop compared to other projects, so it's hardly a priority, but I think it would add some nice world building and characterization.

It's not just a joke, either; it's a real danger.

Still, I'm not sure what the simulacra would demand. If Zorian /had/ a way to give them continuity across loops, he'd do it; it would save him a lot of time and expensive materials rebuilding their golem bodies.

They already get to package up whatever memories are most important to them and merge them back into the original. Zorian could maybe use Black Room time to integrate a bit /more/, but ultimately he won't be able to completely integrate them all. So there's room for some negotiation there, perhaps, if it's important to them, but not cause for a rebellion.

They can already influence research priorities to do things like making better golems for themselves.

Maybe there could be a conflict if simulacra demand the ability to overwrite (and thus effectively possess) living hosts, the original refuses, and they go to war to modify him so he'll let them? They would have to diverge significantly from his morals for that to arise, though, and they only get a month to do it - less, if the initial golem-crafting takes a while.

** #+begin_quote
  He was a brand new type of simulacrum that the original had thought up recently -- instead of being embodied into an ectoplasmic shell like a regular simulacrum, he had been attached to a real matter golem body designed to mimic the original. This was a step up from the base spell in just about every regard, granting him vastly increased durability and halving his maintenance cost at the same time.
#+end_quote

I haven't read anything else in this update yet, but I need to comment on this before continuing. Remember when Zorian was told that the Simulcrum spell is step 1 in becoming a lich? Attaching part of your soul to a physical object after you've separated it out from your mortal body really, really sounds like step 2.

I've had my suspicions about that particular plotbunny since it first showed up, and I still think it's going to be part of the solution to how Zorian will smuggle his soul out of the simulation, so it's interesting to see that thread progressed a bit right at the start of the chapter.

--------------

Further comments after actually reading the thing:

#+begin_quote
  "You're trying to stave off death from old age?" Zach asked, surprised. "Wow. That's an incredibly advanced skill. I heard from Zorian you were a master alchemist, but I didn't know you were that good."

  "Silly boy," Silverlake chuckled. "I'm not trying to stave off old age. I already have that."
#+end_quote

Kinda figured she'd be older than naturally possible. But I will also point out that this means the odds of Zorian ever growing old are basically zero if he gets out of this mess intact. I figured he'd be set anyway, because I'm still betting on the lich thing, but now that he actually knows and has contact with someone who has already solved the problem with alchemy, it makes a nice backup plan.

#+begin_quote
  As for the contents of the inner layer, it consisted of three things: a nice, luxurious two-story house, an expansive herb garden full of rare magical plants and a heavily warded alchemical workshop where she did most of her work.

  Yes, a powerful witch that was clearly very proud of her traditions and made distinctions between alchemy and 'potion making' had a fully quipped alchemical workshop that would be familiar to any conventional alchemist out in the major cities. Zorian couldn't help but find that a little amusing.
#+end_quote

I would pretend to be surprised, but I have met at least one amish person and/or native american before. The myth of the noble savage is a great way to con people, but it turns out most people are people with the same wants and needs as other people, and are perfectly happy to take advantage of ways to fulfill those needs easily. Guess we'll have to just be glad she doesn't have a casino in there.

#+begin_quote
  "Hmph. Shows what you know," Silverlake said. "I'm doing it this way because this is the superior option. It's good enough for the job. Doing this with a complicated alchemical setup wouldn't get stuff done any faster or give better results -- it would just inflict wear and tear on delicate equipment and be a nightmare to clean up afterwards."
#+end_quote

As an addendum to my earlier comment, while most people are just normal people, other people are /wise/ people, and these rare treasures tend to notice that even obsolete techniques occasionally do have advantages and that there are no time cops running around forcing you to choose between only traditional methods or only new technology.

Which is a shame, because it forces me to admit that maybe she wasn't just fucking with Zorian last time.

#+begin_quote
  "It's because alchemy, in its current form, requires an entire society built to enable it. Somebody has to build all the vials, containers, heaters, and other equipment. Somebody needs to grow, gather and track down the ingredients used in it. Somebody needs to transport and distribute it to those than need it... or have the right connections to use it. Somebody needs to guard the workshops full of valuable equipment from thieves and various miscreants. The old witches had access to none of that, so they had to make do with chucking things into a big iron cauldron and eyeballing things. It is, as you said, cheaper. Cheaper in terms of money and also cheaper in terms of social infrastructure needed to support it."
#+end_quote

I'm sensing a pattern. Much the same could apply to magic in general. The whole idea of the Empire having risen to prominence principally because of an ordered and systematic approach to incorporating and disseminating all the magical lore that could be found hidden in a thousand tiny societies and forging it into an unstoppable force. No small tribal community could replicate that. You need an education system to spread literacy, you need a large and thriving empire to collect information from all over, both internally and by theft or trade from elsewhere.

It sounds like it indicates a general pattern of civilization growing and thriving through cooperation, but in light of the rest of her speech, it could also foreshadow the opposite. After all, if some disaster were to strike which sabotaged the nation's infrastructure, say by blowing up a city, alchemy would be driven out and the surviving alchemists would be forced to revert to potion-making. I wonder if something similar would happen to mages in general without access to advanced spells and knowledge of the kind stored in the Academy Library.

A disaster big enough to destroy infrastructure on that scale would destroy society as a whole. A city isn't thinking big enough.

Most people would be dead in that case, so who cares to prepare for it? It's like seriously preparing for all-out nuclear war in real life. Yeah, you /can/ do that, but if you feasibly prepare enough to matter, you'll bankrupt yourself, have little time to learn skills actually relevant in modern society, and still likely won't survive if disaster strikes.

The disaster this story is about, which is what I was trying to allude to, goes well beyond the destruction of a single city that I used as an example. All-out nuclear war is about the right scale.

And preparing deliberately for that scenario is not something that I mentioned at all. It wouldn't even make sense for them to try, since the coming disaster is not one that most people are aware of. That doesn't change the fact that people who do develop those skills for other reasons will have an advantage, and those skills will proliferate more readily than more interdependent ones if society does collapse.

I'm also skeptical of how well your comparison to nuclear war works when we're talking about a pre-industrial civilization. We have cars, planes, telecommunications technology. If civilization survives to any degree anywhere in the world, then the remnants of our organizational infrastructure will be able to access and support any other part of the world in a timely manner. That isn't true here. Aside from a minuscule minority of individuals capable of teleportation, transportation takes place at a walking pace or by train or sailing ship. If there is a collapse of the government, and the accompanying inability to effectively police trade routes to keep them even sort of safe from both criminals and monsters, then isolated provinces staying isolated for years or for generations is a thing that could actually happen. Besides which, this world demonstrably has had more advanced civilizations in the past which have failed.

Each simulacrum has a running mana cost to maintain its magical brain, plus a cost to maintain its body - negated by putting it in a physical golem form - plus whatever mana it spends on spells.

But mind magic is really quite cheap. It just takes concentration.

And a single Zorian has shown the ability to smoothly control a squad of six mindless golems.

So, the army size is at least 1 original + /n/ simulacrum-golem (golacrum?) generals, plus 6 * (/n/ + 1) regular-golem infantry, where /n/ is the number of simulacra he can maintain. Currently 48 golems plus one human. Probably each Zorian can manage more than six subordinates if the commands are simple.

******** While true, increasing numbers of golems only give any real benefit up to a point. Golems are basically melee fighters and that's it. They're useful for soaking up damage, and overpowering some types of strong magical creatures. They aren't mages, and rarely have any ranged attacks at all. For Zorian, he needs all the mana he can get, and sinking all of it into better golem control is a waste for a mage of his caliber. He is far more adaptable, deadly, and overall efficient using his mana for spells.

That said, I wonder how well he could cast spells if he had multiple copies of himself to work with? Ritual spells and general group casting are things he has never really focused on, at least partly because he's more concerned with personal power rather than group effectiveness, but he could get really good results if he had multiple mages with extremely good mana shaping skills focused on a single spell. Probably not terribly useful in combat, but an interesting avenue to explore.

Fortunately expense is not a real issue for ZZ :). Yes, mercenaries are much easier and cheaper, and he'll probably still use them, but don't underestimate the knockout punch of nearly 50 soldiers working with perfect synchronisation and no fear.

Note that the golacrums could also go kamikaze by drawing on ambient mana without limit. Normally this is just a fancy (but almost unblockable) way to commit suicide, as the foreign energy rapidly destroys your vital organs, but with a durable golem body, they could probably accumulate rather spectacular amounts of energy before they finally break down.

Hey, I wonder whether Zorian could design golems that would allow simulacra to swap between them? So if one of the golacrums gets in trouble, it can jump to another body.

** Since the loops coming to a close, I think Zorian's feeling the pressure and doing everything he can to squeeze as much usefulness out of each restart as he can. The improved golems were a good idea but he still may not have taken it far enough yet considering how obscenely valuable they are. Think about it, every restart he'll now be getting like 7 or 8 months worth of activity and work done. The potency of this really can't be understated. The 3ish years left is now essentially worth 21-24 years worth of activity, this is huge. With a SINGLE innovation, he just doubled the time he has available to work with inside the loop, he just bought himself a whole DECADE, another improvement like that and it's 20 extra years worth of activity. I'm not sure Zorian understands just how significant that was since he just mentions it once and blows past it. As we draw closer to the end, further improvements will yield more diminishing returns, he really needs to focus on these golems now as a priority, the gains are monumental.

Also his research with those hired warders, diviners, alchemists, golem makers and the rest is making him an expert in half a dozen magical fields. And if he's integrating the memories of all the simulcra, it means it's not just magical expertise he's getting, it's general knowledge, experience and wisdom, with all the experts he's constantly interacting with, I expect Zorian to be less and less surprised by things and demonstrate a high degree of knowledge about basically everything more and more so from now on.

Let's run some numbers on this.

If Zorian can recharge from ambient mana, zero to full, without special concentration, in [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/][about 3 hours]], and that can support 6 golacra, then each golacrum drains him at a rate that would empty him in 18 hours, without other interaction. However, souls generate enough mana ex nihilo to recharge in 9. So, on that basis, he could support two golacrums indefinitely in the black room, provided none of them used any magic. Might be worthwhile if he has a lot of reading to do, and didn't particularly need them stationed anywhere else. Also possibly worth bringing golacra inside the more efficient rooms, although that might require mind magic on the staff.

That's assuming that six golacra = passive regeneration including abundant ambient mana. If it's actually just his ex nihilo regeneration, sustainable even in dead zones, he could theoretically support 3 times more golacra under normal conditions. Seems unlikely that he would limit himselves that way though, so that's probably not accurate. On the other hand, if six golacra are only sustainable with periodic focused (ie meditating and doing nothing else) assimilation, then he might not be able to sustain any inside a black room without meditation.

All the more reason to use that time to integrate the memories of what his simulacra were previously doing. Sure, he could also read books, etc, but memory-integration really does seems like a valuable use of time.

Besides the political advantages of simulacra knowing that they'll be more completely preserved, and the fact that they'll have a harder time pranking him, he might find that increased integration helps him to better absorb skills that have proved hard to transfer, [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/72/Mother-of-Learning][such as language learning]].

The changes to the flora from his gathering could have changed the locations of any number of small animals who rely on those ingredients, or his mere presence could have chased them away to other areas, and killing the wolves made several other areas safe because of a lack of predators.

The knowledge of the location of the salamander in that one restart is not reliable information.

** I really hope that Zorian begins recording some of the things that he learns, specifically the mind magic stuff. He mentioned a long time ago about wanting to write a book about human mind magic, and considering how far he has advanced it would be a good project for when he has downtime.

Think about how difficult it was to get an actual education from the aranea. He had to barter for actual years in order to get to the point he is at right now, and their mind magic knowledge is hardly centralized in a single convenient location. Any human mind mage is, right now, almost completely shit out of luck if they don't happen to either make friends with an aranean web, or are born into the right noble house. It's a huge branch of magic that their society just hasn't been able to explore because they can't get off the ground in exploring it.

Even if Zorian left out the more invasive branches of mind magic, which frankly it doesn't fare well in compared to other schools of magic, it would be incredibly useful. I mean, who wouldn't want to learn how to keep perfect memories, or be able to sense other life forms regardless of invisibility or intervening walls? Combined with those telepathic relays, it's an instant communication vector with near unlimited distance.

There's also the more mundane things that Zorian has learned that deserve to be recorded. That shielding spell seems super useful if you have the requisite shaping skills. And he's also commissioned various projects in the fields of alchemy and golem making that would be incredibly costly to develop outside of the time loop. What government wouldn't pay for a flashbang grenade that briefly incapacitates Grey Hunters? Not everyone is concerned with keeping parts of it intact.

Personally I would try to avoid spending time on anything that wasn't skill advancing until: 1. you have all keys and have successfully left the time loop. 2. you've achieved /at least/ a potion of non-aging like Silverlake if not also the potion of eternal youth.

I think you are overly optimistic - as an example CIA case officers admission requirements are pretty high. So I doubt that many of empaths could make a cut. And what do think would be done to those who don't?

But that's not even main issue with mind magic. The main issue with it is that the more people know and use it the less useful it becomes. If you alone in the world capable of mind magic - you are golden. If 1% people capable of using mind magic and 5% people can defend against it, its pretty useful. If 10% capable of it and 50% can defend against it, then it almost useless.

She wouldn't be dumb enough to try that without learning everything she could about the marker first. If she tried, she would certainly trip the tampering switch on Zach and the loop would reset - or, if she targeted Zorian first, Zach would be free to pummel her. Assuming that she's even skilled enough in combat to take on both of them at once, so quickly that Zorian couldn't manually reset. And one thing she would quickly learn is that the marker is highly resistant to tampering and copying.

If there was actually any possibility of her duplicating the marker, her best shot at that would be to have the two of them willingly cooperate and provide her with a template. Which they would almost certainly be happy to do.

It's like when people talked about the possibility of Zorian attacking Xvim's mind once Xvim started tutoring him properly. It might be theoretically possible to do, but it's vastly less efficient than willing cooperation. And given how much ZZ could benefit from a looping Silverlake, they'd almost certainly cooperate if it were feasible.

Though I doubt it is.

There's more to consider than just that; if the soul really is duplicated by the process, then what happens with the marker? Two copies? Or a brand new, unmarked soul arrives from wherever new souls usually come from? Or the (already-damaged) marker tries to split/copy itself and breaks down?

***** Slightly spoiler-ish answer (in regards to beliefs of witches, not the plot itself), but I'll tell it anyway because I'm not sure whether I'll actually put this into the story...

The soul of the child sort of 'buds off' from the soul of the mother. At some point (quite a while before the actual birth of the child) the soul bud separates from the mother and becomes the property of the baby alone.

This is why witches believed only female children can truly continue their bloodlines. Although children clearly do inherit things from the father, to anyone observing the process with soul perception, the soul itself seems to originate from the mother alone.

The Ikosians (and most other groups) believe this only means some parts of the process are invisible to humans, even with soul perception. They cite the fact that children can inherit magical abilities from their father as their chief proof that there is more going on beneath the surface. Witches, on the other hand, placed tremendous importance to this fact. And since a person's 'soul lineage' originates solely from their female ancestors, sons are basically spiritual dead ends.

I'm guessing pregnancy initially boosts the mana capacity of a woman even if ever so slightly. I'm curious, though, if this means that the mana signature of one's parents is somewhat similar to one's own mana. Or might it be like blood types where there are a variety of differences and similarities, but due to the complexity of how blood works (antigens, DNA, etc.), eventually the blood of the fetus is usuallly not compatible with the mother's blood . . .

It would be interesting to conduct experiments with the mana of others to see what the makeup of personal mana is. What makes one's mana different from ambient mana? Can those differences be stripped or somewhat removed via some kind of magical filtering process? The research would not be easy to perform, I would expect, because it's morally shady. However, it would be cool if a group of friends wanted to run these experiments. Many applications would be morally shady, however I can see a group of rifle soldiers not only firing their weapons, but also acting as mana batteries for battle mages who use devices or a mage specialized in acting as a mana sieve.

Another result of your explanation is . . . the salamander situation is still unresolved, which is fine. A fetus' soul seems to grow from the mother's soul, but a body split in half? But then does the soul really reside in the body, or is the body really just a pointer to the soul? In that case, this is not an issue. This would be interesting because then both newly grown salamanders would both utilize the same soul, much like how two simulacra utilize the same soul.

** Pretty good chapter! I see that Silverlake is actually yet another potential romance-able waifu path!

Some errors I found.

Their skills have grown, they have become intimately familiar with the grey hunter's capabilities and they have brought a number of surprises designed specifically to counter it.

All of those "have"s should be "had", because it should be past tense.

it shook of the stun effect 

Missing an f there.

The bullets were filled the distilled essence

Missing a "with"

before they can track down its corpse

"can" should be "could" because past tense

Then again, the grey hunter did mangle one of the simulacrums

"did mangle" should be "had mangled"; tense inconsistency

sought out to original

"to" should be "the"

He was the one that shot the grey hunter!

"shot" should be "had shot"

Well, he and number three, but number three ended up being killed by the grey hunter's last hurrah.

"ended" should be "had ended"

He totally earned this and was not taking no for an answer.

"totally earned" should be "had totally earned"

"We have come to trade!" Zach said in an equally cheery tome, undaunted by her wariness.

"tome" should be "tone"

Everything you gain will be done at the end of this month, 

I think that "done" should be "undone"?

"It not possible for me to absorb your pocket dimension creation skills in less than a month.

"It not" should be "It's not"

which is why Zorian couldn't find it

"is" should be "was"; tense inconsistency

It had been five days since then, and thus far Silverlake was keeping to her side of the deal. 

"was" should be "had been"

Zorian was afraid

"was" should be "had been"

Silverlake did basically rope him into helping her with her alchemy

"did basically rope" should be "had basically roped"

Seems to be a lot of tense inconsistencies, with a noticeable lack of past participle usage. Should probably work on that.

Highly unlikely. There is a big difference between having the Key, vs being the Maker. Having the Key allows you to re-open the barred Gate, and apparently outside the loop it allows you to mark the next Controller, but that doesn't mean you're the superuser.

******* I still feel that there's more story behind those 6 months of incapacitation. As far as we know, the loop doesn't have a mechanism for simply not creating a physical body, at least with all the soulkilled arenea and mercenaries. They just show up dead at the beginning of the loop. Obviously, this doesn't work for Zach, since a dead Zach equals a restart. A coma seems the most likely explanation, but it's not entirely clear why his caretaker would cover up the fact, and his recovery in Zorian's 8th loop only took him about a day and a few good meals. I feel like if something took his soul entirely out of commission for 6 months then it should have had longer lasting side effects beyond that. Basically, I still suspect some sort of foul play from RR during that period.

**** Maybe not essential, but it felt to me like he was placing more value in external soul perception this chapter than any time in the past. I'm just wondering if some time in the past 9 restarts they developed a plan or made a discovery that made it more important to spend their finite time and less finite resources on obtaining it. Being able to study Zach's marker sounds like a pretty good possibility. I know you're not a fan of my Zorian soul merging theory, which I think benefit from soul perception as well.

And it's odd that they're only trying to get a potion for Zorian at the moment, unless they're sure it cause a restart if Zach consumed it, since it's apparently a more extreme version of the ritual Alanic did. But the Marker has different activation thresholds for different things, e.g. unstructured vs structured mind magic, so I think it should still be worth a try.

In the past I thought that soul perception fell under the category of enhancements that consume mana reserves, but this chapter made me change my mind. This chapter phrased it as being a natural part of every soul that's just normally sealed in its lower level of efficacy. If there is a cost to reserves, I think it would be under 1 magnitude.

I know that the first four chapters are really important, but I'm thinking of making my friend skip them, just because the world building can be hard to push through if you aren't already invested in the story. What should I do? My friend's into fantasy/mystery sort of stuff, so MoL fits the bill pretty well. I just don't know how to go about getting her to try it. As a side note, one of her favourite series of all time is called 'Skullduggery Pleasants', if that helps with anything. She does also like Harry Potter, but I'm not quite sure how well HP translates into MoL since they are both incredibly different from each other. It's kinda stupid to ask the rational reddit about skipping the core worldbuilding chapters, but I'm genuinely asking about your own experiences.
