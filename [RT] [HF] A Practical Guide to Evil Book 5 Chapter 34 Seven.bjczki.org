*** I can see her doing it; she set up Vivienne as her heir and everything. Plus she never really wanted the throne anyway, and this helps establish the "named should not be rulers" part of the Liesse Accords.

***** My bet is against Cat since 1) her being the "special One" doesn't click for me and 2) there are several other candidates. Malicia is technically allied with the Dead King and was previously tracking ZeZe. Hasenbach can get involved through the Augur or Tyrant's scheming. The Dead King may still be a candidate depending on the particulars of his "apotheosis", etc. Also, the possibility for Hakram being the "One" according to Tyrant's scheme meant that we shouldn't dismiss non rulers/royals either.

I guess from Callow's story, it makes sense for Cat to abdicate for the Accord and Vivi's rise. But looking at the ritual to create their Fae court, I don't quite see the Crown of Callow being the One needed to "make a god so we can kill it".

****** Ah, but the question is /how/ would they get the Dead King/Malicia/Hasenbach's crown? There's no narrative weight to the Dead King dying for good in Arcadia, Malicia is still in Praes and if Hasenbach gets kidnapped/thrown in it'll cause Procer to revolt. The only choices are Cat or Pilgrim

******* And Kairos, although I'm having trouble seeing him giving up his crown for the greater good.

Re: the poster you replied to not seeing Cat's crown as the special one, though, I'd like to point out that the "and one" was laid out as part of a fae bargain she entered into. It makes intuitive narrative sense to me for that one crown to be separated and special because it's hers, since fae bargains always seem to have that kind of 'gotcha'. I could totally see Larat doing his dramatic treacherous lieutenant reveal that the other crown had to be Cat's all along before she wheels out the plan they prepared for that exact eventuality, mostly involving her just handing it over without a fight and letting SoS beat the snot out of him mid-ascension.

** So Arnaud wasn't /the/ Assassin, just /an/ assassin. Was really hoping Tariq was gonna open a merciful can of whoopass on the princes there for a minute.

Anyone with a better memory than me know what the exact nature of Cat's promise to Larat was? 7 crowns and one, IIRC. She's got the 7 from the Proceran princes, and considering she apparently had an extra in her back pocket, I'm wondering what the one is supposed to be. The dramatic implication is that it's her own, but frankly, for all that we're holding the princes in contempt for not wanting to give up their crowns, I'm gonna be sorely disappointed in Cat if she essentially spared Rozala's crown for her own.

*** She said last chapter that the one will either be her own, Tyrant's, or Pilgrim's. The /one/ will influence the nature of the resulting realm and will need to be given at, presumably, the pivot. Of course, twists can happen and a different crown from one of these three will be chosen (Hierarch, for example, or even the Dead King, though that seems very unlikely).

**** I wonder if the act of giving up a crown could transition a Name, How great a Name for Cat would /The Uncrowned Queen/ be? It's seems likely that the name exists, there has to have been a ruler in the past who ruled their country despite lacking a Crown, even if there wasn't then there has to have been /stories/ about such a figure, and that is what really matters.

***** I think it's the last thing Cat would want, given what she's trying to achieve with the Liesse Accords.

Also, that Creation isn't so easily fooled: some of the crowns laid at Cat's feet were swords. It's the absolute authority you're surrendering, not just the physical object. I'm sure an Uncrowned Queen's rule would be just as disastrous, after having surrendered her crown to Larat, as a crowned one's.

**** Yeah, but when Aisha was talking about "the Prince's Graveyard", I was imagining, like, tens of princes coming to fight Cat, and running away in terror after she killed twelve of them, so that the common people would exaggerate and say "there were enough dead princes to fill a whole graveyard!", until "Prince's Graveyard" would become the de-facto accepted term to designate the battle.

Having a prince name the event, while it's taking place, to bitch about the fact that a single prince died (not even killed by Catherine herself) is kind of a step down from that. Same thing about the "Uncivil Wars", really.

**** I know he was desperate to get out of the story changes the Winter King and Summer Queen were about to lay on Arcadia, but I don't think Larat would offer a bargain that only freed him when he died. It's possible Cat intends to twist things that way, but I'd have felt it more if it had happened while she was still merged with Winter. Without that Fae tinge to her thoughts, I feel like it'll go down a little more like this:

Larat- "You fool! Don't you see that all along the final crown was to be yours? I have tricked you, once Queen of the Fae, and now I shall take the crown that would be mine again!"

Cat- "Okay. Here." * Proceeds to let Pilgrim, Saint, and Rogue Sorcerer beat the everliving tar out of Larat before he even finishes his victory ascension dance *
