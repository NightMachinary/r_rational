** ... Ok, this got weirder than I expected. Also, dammit, my complaints about the realism of the scenario were included and now they're looking petty and ridiculous.

Also, I didn't know you could get this kind of formatting out of AOOO. Kind of makes me want to write a whole forum-only fanfiction just to see how far I can take it.

**** Yeah- it's HTML and [[https://archiveofourown.org/help/skins-creating.html][a subset of CSS]] that's pretty permissive except for custom fonts. It's mostly set up the way it is to prevent people from hosting arbitrary/potentially dangerous content as a fic. This chapter was pretty much just done with tables and some styling to mess with font size and padding and so on! (h/t Nostalgebraist for an example of how to do it in The Northern Caves.)

*** Ao3 was created specifically to give writers more creative freedom; that includes formatting choices. ff.net basically only gives you basic markdown.
