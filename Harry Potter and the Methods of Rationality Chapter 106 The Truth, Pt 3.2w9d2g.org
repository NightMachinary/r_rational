** So ... what was the point of setting all this stuff up as a run up to the Mirror of Erised, from Dumbledore's perspective?

That Voldemort was able to disarm the traps over a period of months in such a way that this disarming went completely unnoticed by Dumbledore, Snape, and presumably Moody is ... not /unbelievable/ but certainly seems to be going without much comment in the text itself beyond "Oh yeah, I totally just disarmed all of it".

But with that said, what possible plan has Dumbledore set in motion which explains his actions?

*** Couple that with Quirrell inexplicably going with a dastardly evil plan instead of mundanely effective plan and it becomes obvious that something interesting is afoot. It seems like Quirrell is playing the stereotypical villain for some reason.

**** And what does Quirrell's overt evilness make Harry do? It convinces Harry that their "spirits can not exist in the same world." Considering this and Quirrell "marking [Harry] as his equal," it looks like Quirrell is trying to fulfill the prophesy in the immediate future. I think it's safe to say that Quirrell knows exactly what he's doing.

*** One reason: even if you believe you have a secure password-hashing algorithm (or magic mirror), you still want to rate-limit people's login attempts, because having a bunch of side-channel (timing, etc.) data about attempts available is how you figure out a workable attack on the "spell" used in the first place.

Another reason: if Dumbledore put the thing in the Great Hall (or even in his office) somebody would probably eventually just knock it over and break it. Seven preparatory challenges seems about right to instil a certain level of /respect/ about the mirror---they might try to get the artifact from it, or steal it, or break it on purpose, but they wouldn't ignore it as a random piece of shiny glass.

Dear HJPEV,

For a supposed level 2 rational character, you sure do hold the idiot ball pretty damned often. You deserve whatever you get.

** I still don't get why Qurriell couldn't just say "Hey Harry, let's go get the stone that will allow me to survive." What possible advantage could his current strategy offer? Also, I seem to remember a certain someone making grand declarations about death being the biggest enemy and all that jazz. And now suddenly Quirrell is on top of Harry's priority list for flimsy reasons. Did Hogwarts get hit with an epidemic of magical dumbpox?

*** Well, if you think that death is bad, you might want to stop the super powerful and highly intelligent wizard that gives out avada kadava like it's candy. Also, having a gun pointed at you can sometimes cause you to reorder your priority list a little. That's not dumb at all.

Yes. One might also want to make people exercise more and eat healthy food, distribute some mosquito nets, cure aging, popularise cryonics, create FAI and many, many other things. Sadly, one does not have the time to do all of them at once, and is forced to choose. If you actually want to win a war against death, you do not waste your time on tin-pot dictators.

Harry is nor making a utility calculation here. He's sulking because his favourite person killed someone and tricked him.

I don't see it. It's not like he has the option of telling Quirrel "sorry, I've something better to do". For one thing, he doesn't have anything better to do, it's not like he currently has some research project going on that can eliminate death (the stone might be the nearest thing to that). For another thing, there is a good chance that Quirrel would just kill, imperius, memory-charm or tortue him.

For another thing, Harry really thinks that he might have the power to reshape the universe so drastically that no one will die anymore, and he thinks Quirrel might be as or more powerful and ambitious as himself and that Quirrel is Evil.

****** Just minor nit, but since either of them casting magic on the other causes bad things to happen, only kill or torture are on the table at this point. If there was someone around Quirrell could imperius them to cast something on Harry, but they left everyone behind.

** I'm afraid I am going to have to call shenanigans on this one. That isn't just a three-headed dog, and every reader knows it. That's Cerberus. Hades' own sweet pet.

You do not kill the dog of Death; it's the kind of thing where even if it's technically possible, it doesn't get you anywhere you want to go. Even /Hercules/ didn't kill Cerberus, just wrestled it into submission, and monster-killing was his stock in trade.

I get that this is not a setting where Hades is going to show up and interfere in the story, but still.../Cerberus/, man. If any magical creature has contractual immunity to death, it's that one.

***** Greek mythology isn't real in canon, there is no Hades. Magical creatures in HP are generally portrayed as the inspiration for various mythologies and legends. Hagrid says in canon he bought Fluffy from a "Greek chappie," which would make him (or more likely, his species) the inspiration for Cerberus instead of the genuine article.
