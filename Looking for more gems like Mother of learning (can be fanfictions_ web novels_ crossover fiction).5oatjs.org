******* I am disgusted by the sexual act itself, not by the romance. It's only come across as bad because we live in a society that just love to tag and condemn people. So what if I don't like watching two grown men show physical affection to each other? People have weird aversions to a lot of things. It doesn't mean that I don't respect them as human beings. These days being politically correct is just an impossible task.

You tell someone that you are more attracted to light skin women and suddenly you are a racist.

You make a bad joke about your fatness and feminists call for your blood.( e.g Hugh Mungus)

And apparently it's impossible to prefer reading from male POV without raising some eyebrows.

Granted, that word /is/ also often used when people try to impose moral judgement upon the subject of the conversation, and I guess someone in OP's position /could/ go out of their way to choose such a phrasing that would decrease the chances of being misunderstood.

No, it's called communicating. If a word has common connotations that you don't want to communicate, you use a different word.

Yes, which is why if you're trying to communicate revulsion without judgement yuo don't say 'disgust', you say it makes you feel squicky, or uncomfortable, or you dislike reading it.

Now that you put it that way, I agree, to some degree.

The problem (partially) is that sometimes the person either doesn't notice that they're using the less-advisable phrasing, or they can't use anything better because English is not their first language. And in both cases the polit-correct hivemind aggros at them and loses all reason. And things like that just piss me off, I guess. Ehm, I mean, they make me squicky? Ahaha.

** The “contains some romance” bit makes it somewhat hard for me to give you recommendations because I generally don't like when romance has a major role in the plot-buildling, and tend to forget those parts even when they exist. Nevertheless, here are some things you may like:

Novels:

- *[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/50834-the-magicians][/The Magicians/]]* trilogy --- Chronicles of Narnia \ Harry Potter deconstruction where even magic can't cure protag's depression.
- *[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341735.Replay][/Replay/]]* by Ken Grimwood --- protag keeps waking up each time he dies, but each time a bit later into his life.

Webnovels:

- *[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing][/With This Ring/]]* --- a Young Justice SI fanfic with male protag (WiP). I haven't read the most recent chapters, but several months ago he was starting to look for a romantic partner. It has some slice of life elements, but it's not that much of a problem if you're not waiting for new chapters to come out. There are some idiot balls, but not that many.
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][/A Hero's War/]] (WiP) --- protag wakes up in a middle-ages fantasy setting, and his first obstacle to survival is a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors][/Tremors/]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy][expy.]] IIRC, had some neat [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift][TechnologyUplift]] going on.
- [[http://www.fictiongrill.com/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis/][/How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis/]] --- Similarly to the previous story, starts with waking up in a fantasy setting. IIRC, the selling point for this story was that the protag had to survive while he had no special powers, or something like that. Also IIRC, the story somewhat dropped in quality later on.

Translated asian webnovels:

All of these are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse][RPGMechanicsVerse]] stories in one way or another, so if you don't like that genre, these won't be for you, I guess.

- *[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/][/Reincarnator/]]* --- has some repeating tropes, but otherwise is well-written. Protag goes back in time to try saving humanity after a meta-verse merging event.
- *[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-king-of-the-battlefield/][/King of the Battlefield/]]* --- premise is very similar to the previous one, actually.
- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/terror-infinity/][/Terror Infinity/]] --- a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/][jumpchain]]-type cross-fic that has so far featured the following cinematic universes: Resident Evil series, Alien series, The Grudge, The Mummy, Final Destination series, Jurassic Park, [[http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Mask][the Vampiric Mask]] from JoJo, Starship Troopers, The Lord Of The Rings.
- Evolution Theory of the Hunter
- Life Mission
- Dungeon Hunter --- this one noticeably drops in quality in later chapters

HP fanfics:

- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]]* --- Harry's sister dies, and he tries to resurrect her. Very good writing.

** Mother of Learning doesn't and won't contain romance, the author has clearly stated that. I don't feel that that detracts at all from it, though; I agree that it sets a high standard.

Presumably that means that you're OK with unfinished-but-living works?

I finally checked out A Hero's War recently, and binged it all. Lots of magitech, interesting effort to deal with the economic and social ramifications of introducing the industrial revolution. Romance is present, but not overstated; though bear in mind that it's unfinished.

The only point that seemed to ring a bit false was perhaps a bit too much idealism about how people would react to massive social and technological change. There's push-back, certainly, but I would expect more.

I can't say that I identify with your identifying more with male protagonists, but to each zeir own, I guess.

If you're willing to branch out from that, the Arithmancer is fun, exploring "What if Hermione was a genius at maths instead of a bookworm?" It only covers years 1-4, though, and the sequel is IMO moving a bit slowly.

Have you read everything on rationalfiction.io? I enjoyed some of them more than others, but if you like MoL, they're all worth checking out. Bear in mind that that site doesn't always have the complete story uploaded.

** [[http://otherhistory.proboards.com/thread/431/shall-reap-whirlwind][And They Shall Reap The Whirlwind]] is a self insert into the life of bomber harris. It's long and well done.

[[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/][Set in Stone]] A rational/ist Stonepunk story set in the future on planet controlled by an AI in an agrarian society. A very interesting and enjoyable story. [[/u/farmerbob1]] 's other story [[https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/about/][Symbiote]] was also pretty good.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/58095][Savage Divinity]] I remember the start being a little slow, but seriously awesome world-building. Has a fair amount of romance

#+begin_quote
  A modern man finds himself reincarnated in the body of a young slave with no skills and quickly fading memories. Follow his journey to find normalcy while living in a savage world, filled with myth and legends, monsters and Demons. In a land where the strong rule, the weak serve, and bloodshed is a way of life, peace is a luxury few can afford... Less action, more character and world driven is my aim. Mature language and themes, but no raunchy sex.

Updates 3 times a week usually, currently I get more excited by updates from this than from MOL.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]] is a story where humanity lost a war and was conquered, but humanities most powerful weapon, an AI Battleship, continues the war 1500 years later. It's been 4 years since I've read it and from what I remember it switches genres to a survival horror novel about halfway in for 20 chapters or so. Really good and apparently there is a sequel that I am going now going to have to check out.

[[https://thegam3.com/2016/05/10/prologue-start-enter-the-game/][The Gam3]] is an extremely well done Litrpg. If its something you like the author has published an edited version of the first book [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DFCNAPG][Opening Moves]] with some extra content. Its the best LitRPG I've read, feels smooth and not clunky.

** If you're willing to give light novels a second chance, check out Overlord. Its far and away the most professionally written light novel.

There is also Harry potter and the natural 20. D&D Harry potter.

If you want to branch out to scifi, [[/r/hfy]] has a lot of really good stories. Check the sidebar for the genre defining reads.

** Legion of Nothing serial by Jim Zoetewey [[http://inmydaydreams.com/]] Collection of first story arc on Amazon: [[https://www.amazon.com/Legion-Nothing-1-Rebirth-ebook/dp/B00IR2CLUU]]

NOT RationalFic like the top of your list, but in line with a number of other recommendations in the thread and I think probably appealing to a lot of the same readers.

Not especially action packed for something in the superhero genre, but really good - Protagonist starts story in late high school (?). Grandson of Golden Age IronMan / Rocketeer analog - He is a bit of a cross between modern Geek/Engineer and a Modesetti Hero. There is a romance thread but so far the series has kept everything (including drinking/smoking/drugs/language) mostly PG - PG13. Violence is also usually not vicerally graphic.

I found it one of the most Unique and interesting takes on the Super Hero genre going on right now. It has a wonderful mix of post Marvel/DC deconstruction of the standard tropes plus a delightfully earnest retro Golden Age vibe with a hint of inventor punk for spice.

Contains a few sparks of romance [[#s][]]

** As other people have said, Worm's MC is female but you almost never notice it at all. I guess it's fairly light on the romance side of things, but it has all the smart writing that you're craving. It's also a monster of a read at something like 12,000 pages.

A Practical Guide To Evil is another one with a female MC, but again, it almost never comes up.

Pokemon and the origin of species, as well as the uncompleted Game of Champions, are both awesome as well.
