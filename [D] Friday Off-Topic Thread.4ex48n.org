Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** I like to write things down (usually in keywordy streams of consciousness) on post-it notes or emails/messages to myself and check them when I'm in a better position to do something about them. Like I'll be biking around and have a BRILLIANT thought on how to implement some algorithm or code in a more efficient way, but I sure as hell won't remember it (or even remember that I needed to remember something) when I've access to a computer in however many hours, so I'll pull over and text it to myself. Then, when I get home or when I'm working the next day I'll look at all the messages I sent to myself and jog my memories. If I'm at home already but want to jot some quick thoughts down, I'll use Windows' Sticky Notes app or scribble on one of my whiteboards (esp. useful if it requires weird symbols or diagrams).

There's probably a more sophisticated way of doing this with dedicated memo/note taking software, but my thoughts aren't so elaborate as to require such dedicated storage and just using my phone's facebook messenger is more convenient for easy access from any and all computers. Since my thoughts also aren't so important to dedicate effort committing them to longer term memory, I find this better than trying to construct memory palaces or whatever, too.

******* Ok it's not that they lack any visual memory it's that they can't form mental images, though they can still do other things, and interestingly they can still dream normally. Other types of disorders exist for other senses.

Just to clarify if you do have it and certain things are alien to you: Generally when people imagine images they are I guess, having a really low key visual hallucination that is of lower quality and not as "real" as normal vision or hallucinations and doesn't interfere with primary visual stimuli. Studies show the accuracy of these mental images (along with visual memory) varies substantially between individuals with my own mental images being pretty low res.

Ultimately this is like trying to explain red to someone who sees every color /except/ red, you can kind of explain stuff because they are familiar with visual stimuli vaguely similar in both cases but in both cases it's a fundamentally unbridgeable conceptual gap.

If you don't have this disorder it ought to be really obvious, however if you do then the concepts may not make sense.

Actually now that I think about it I suppose since very few people with aphantasia have the corresponding disorders for all other senses I suppose I could just say that imagining images is like imagining sounds, or smells, etc

Sounds sort of the opposite of me. I /can/ form mental images, they're just borderline useless. Think "blurry image of the Loch Ness monster" as my upper threshold. My dreams are more conceptual than visual, like a blurry man-size shape will be to my right, but I /know/ it's a dude in a duster wearing a cowboy hat. So, not aphantasia, just the far left of the bell curve.

I noticed the issue with myself after reading the story of a scientific argument near the end of the 19th century. One faction was insisting that people were perfectly capable of recalling or creating pictures in their mind, with the other adamantly insisting that this wasn't really possible, and those people who claimed to do so were only pretending they could mentally see the image. Basically just a shouting match with everyone making a Typical Minds Fallacy. Supposedly, it went on for a decade or so before someone thought to take a survey, and surprise surprise, it turned out that mental visual capacity was a bell curve.

*** I've assigned a person-action-object visual image to each number from 0-9. In practice, I mostly use this to easily fix the page number of whatever book I'm reading in my mind. Sometimes for memorizing phone numbers.

Ex. I was on page 219 of Brandon Sanderson's Bands of Mourning yesterday (my favorite Mistborn book now, seriously, so great) - 2 is Luigi, planking, with a green fireball. 9 is Rick, belching, with his flask. 1 is Buggs Bunny, chewing, with a carrot. So the page number appears in my mind as a mental image of Luigi, chewing, holding a flask. Easily pictured, easily recalled.

There's an easier way of doing this for page numbers that just matches each digit to a letter, such that most combinations create memorable one-syllable sounds. But that's became it's meant specifically for remembering page-numbers, and isn't really applicable to anything more than 3 digits long.

My method is adapted from the system for memorizing the order of a deck of cards, which I got from the fantastic book Moonwalking With Einstein (all about memory and memory techniques - highy recommended).

Edit: corrected page number

*** You can play this mod without being spoiled, so if you've for example played Thaumcraft by the Thaumonomicon only, [[http://psi.vazkii.us/]].

You assemble tiles onto a 2D grid of 5x5-9x9 squares, which stand for "position of the caster" or "add these two vectors" or "raycast this position and this vector to the next solid block", or "this value", or "add this vector, maximized in its length at this constant, to the velocity of this entity", or "lightning strikes at this position", where pronouns always refer to values produced by one of your choice of the four adjacent tiles. Materials used in the construction of your wand limit grid size, complexity ('number of tiles that aren't constants or "this value"') and potency (sum of constants used in tiles that have direct effect on the world, weighted by tile type - manacost also works like this, but uses a different weighting). The tutorial unlocks tiles and raises your mana pool+regen up to a cap at the end of the tutorial.

Spells reach up to 32 blocks from their point of origin, which you can choose in the crafting of the spell to be you, where a projectile hits something, where a gravity'd thrown "grenade" is after a few seconds, where within 32 blocks you had placed a "detonator charge", or where within a few blocks you place a spell circle. Spell circles repeat a spell 20 times across a few seconds (and theres a tile that counts the current iteration) (15x mana cost). You don't regen unless you haven't cast for a few seconds, except that spells you made to be channelling allow regen after a few seconds of channelling ("repeatedly casting") (iteration tile works here too).

One tile does "pause spell execution for this constant time" (and another lets you "treat this number smaller than this constant as constant"), and the only conditional does "stop spell execution iff this number is 0" - have fun with the lazy evaluation order of tiles.

****** To my knowledge the debate isn't settled. It's more of a trade-off in terms of wound healing vs. risk of infection (with infection greatly slowing wound healing) and highly dependent on the antiseptic in question, as well as the type of wound. Burns in particular are prone to infection so generally get treated with antiseptics, especially since in my case the top layer of skin was completely removed with the burn.

*** There are actually specific responses you should try to give if you can, or try to get an offer from them first. In general, part of what they're hoping for is that there's a like, inverse bid-ask spread, where your dream salary is lower than what they're willing to offer. So for example:

- The most you'd ask for is $65,000 since you're not aware of your value.

- The company is willing to pay you up to $80,000

So, in this case if the company asks you what you'd want, you say "$65k/yr", they pay you, and you leave $15k on the table. However, if you are canny, do research, and ask "$90k/yr", they say "the best we can do is $80k" and you don't leave cash on the table. Or, if they make an offer first, they offer you say $75k/yr and you leave less cash on the table if you accept it. You can also still counter-offer.

Either outcome (hearing their offer first, or being informed and making a big ask) is better than making a small ask and leaving cash on the table.

You won't ever be given more than you ask, so ask high. It's tough to ask so high that it negatively impacts you. I use glassdoor to find out salaries. In my area, the SF Bay Area, an entry-level electrical engineer or software engineer should be making at least $60k/year. Depending on your field and level of knowledge (and the company) this can be higher.

** I'd like to talk a bit about the presidential election and specifically about Donald Trump. Even more specifically, I'm going to make a series of predictions and see if you guys agree or disagree.

Scary Prediction #1 - Trump will only get even worse with his insults and trash talk. He wants attention and doesn't care if it's positive or negative. I'll even go far as to say that he wants riots and people staging protests against him for maximum attention which is related to Scott's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/][Toxoplasma of Rage]]. I'm actually scared and worried that he'll end up causing people to be hurt or killed because of this. And he'll even make use of the poor person's injuries/death to 'justify' his actions.

Obvious Prediction #2 - He'll win the nomination for the Republican party. He's so far in the lead that I doubt anyone else will catch up, although Cruz has my support.

Unusual Prediction #3 - Sanders will win the Democratic nomination. This is because people will see Sanders as Trump's counterpart and the guy to beat him. Yes the Democratic Party wants to vote Hillary who is currently leading, but Sanders is anti-establishment and an underdog. He'll win through the popular vote. If Trump wasn't running, Sanders would not have such a strong position.

Shocking Prediction #4 - Afterwards Trump'll change absolutely everything about himself. He'll say that he didn't mean his words as harshly as people thought. He'll be accepting of immigrants, higher wages, gay marriage, marijuana, etc, etc, major Democratic issues, and everything else he's been dumping on. He's only been as publicly extreme right as he is now to lock in the Republican vote. No Republicans are not terrible people who support racism, but if you are a supremacist, I can be very confident you voted Republican in the last election. Or just good old fashioned xenophobia towards foreigners.

Either way, Trump will paint himself as a Democrat and most likely even pick a Democrat as his running mate. He'll switch to the left side so fast that you will get whiplash. Yes people will fight and scream how he is a turncoat and a liar (as if we didn't know this already!). But memories fade and people will be fooled. He will become someone who you agree with and you will think, aw he's not such a bad guy (I even expect this to happen to myself and I'm the guy writing this!).

Hopeful Prediction #5 - This will not work and Sanders will become the next president. No, I cannot provide any accurate reasons/evidence for why I believe this. I'm betting on this prediction coming true with 60% likelihood and it's more wishful thinking and hope for this to be true when the betting percentage should be closer to 50% (between him and Trump, not between all of the candidates right now). But it's important for the next prediction.

Surprising (not really) Prediction #6 - If Sanders becomes the next president, Trump will claim this was his plan all along. Why? Because he *knows* prediction #3 as well. And he will want to get something back after losing which is to deny his losses and claim that everything that happened was all part of his master plan to...make politics engaging, say that he always supported Sanders, and to change up the two-party system, or something like that probably. Oh and he'll say that while being President would have been nice, he didn't care too much about it.

Depressing Prediction #7 - No matter what happens, Trump will face absolutely no consequences for his actions.

Let's have a calm and "rational" discussion!

EDIT: Some grammar edits, editing #6 a bit, and adding prediction #7.

*** Fun predictions!

I don't have any of my own, but I do have bookies that I keep up with. The bookies are saying:

*Democratic Candidate*

- *5/1 (long) odds on Sanders* being the Democratic nominee. They give Sanders a *17%* chance of being the nominee, assuming fair odds. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *1/8 (short) odds on Clinton* being the Democratic nominee. They give Clinton an *89%* chance of being the nominee, assuming fair odds. Since they shorten it (probably quite a bit) to gain profit, they think her odds are actually lower.
- Amazingly, they are also giving 25/1 (long) odds on Biden somehow becoming the nominee. Obviously, they real odds are much longer and they're shortening it, but it's hilarious to imagine Biden becoming the next Democratic nominee 4% of the time. Probably some people are betting on this so they shortened the odds a huge amount to make more cash.

In any case, since this adds up to 118%, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit. Even so, the bookies disagree about who is likely to become the Democratic Party nominee. Sanders may well be our nominee, but it seems that the people who make a living off of making good probability estimates think it's more likely, though not certain, that Clinton will be our nominee.

*Republican Candidate*

- *4/7 (short) odds on Trump* being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Trump a *63%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *7/4 (long) odds on Cruz* being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Cruz a *36%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *9/1 (long) odds on Kasich* being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Kasich a *10%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower-- probably much lower.
- Romney and Ryan are both in there with very very long odds, that are still probably shortened for profit.

So, it looks like the bookies agree with you on Trump being the Republican nominee. Since this adds up to 109%+, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit.

*Next President - Outright*

- *2/5 (short) odds on Clinton* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Clinton a *71%* chance of being the president. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think her odds are actually lower.
- *5/1 (long) odds on Trump* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Trump a *17%* chance of being the president. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *8/1 (short) odds on Sanders* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Sanders a *11%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *10/1 (short) odds on Cruz* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Cruz a *9%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- Small chances in here for Kasich and (wow, again?) Biden as well.

Pretty fun. Again, as always, they shorten the odds for a profit. Here, we see 108%+ chance, added together. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time.

*Winning Party -- Outright*

- *1/3 (short) odds on the Democrats winning. 75% chance if odds are fair*
- *9/4 (long) odds on the Republicans winning. 30% chance if odds are fair*

Pretty fun. Again, as always, they shorten the odds for a profit. Here, we see 105%+ chance, added together. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time, especially as we see nominees.

Looks like your predictions on the electoral outcomes are not implausible. Trump will likely win the Republican nomination, and will likely lose the general election. Although Clinton is more likely to win the Democratic nomination than Sanders, Sanders still has a good shot at it.

The moral of this story: watch for Biden coming out of left field! Biden 2016! Biden 2016!

***** By the way, the reason Biden is listed as having a chance is the possibility of both Sanders and Clinton withdrawing from the race. Let's say Clinton has something come up like she gets thrown in jail or something and completely withdraws. Then, Sanders has a stroke cause he's like a million years old and just dies or becomes unable to run. This happens, like, 3 weeks before the convention or something.

In this situation, the party needs to go take a look at who it has lying around who could step up and run for the presidency, since both candidates who have delegates are disqualified. The Democrat with the best national-level name recognition who might be able to win the general election from a standing start is Biden. So, if both Clinton and Sanders withdraw from the primaries, Biden will be the Democratic candidate.

As for Sanders, the only way he wins at this point is if Clinton drops dead, basically.

I fully expect Trump to stomp all over the conservative social R people in his efforts to de-screw the economy. I'm all for that, as I am a financial conservative and social liberal.

There should be a balance between social programs and capitalism. That balanced approach, IMHO, starts with a balanced budget, and sane policies for economic growth to allow for social programs.

Happiness gains decreasing returns from more money, therefore redistribute money in order to increase total happiness.

He has almost completely ignored inner city violence, which is a huge problem compared to law enforcement violence cases. Why does he do this? Because he wants a fractured social infrastructure. Victims vote for people who stand up for them. If you can use the big lie technique to create an entire victim class, and pander to it, then you have a large voting block you can count on.

However, when you point out that people are hurting themselves, it doesn't have the same political effect. People prefer to be able to blame others for their problems, and pointing out that teens kill more teens than cops do won't have the same political effect.

If the President were truly concerned about the lives of violence victims, he would address the most numerous cases. Unfortunately, lives don't matter, votes do.

Does this address Trump's over the top statements? No. Trump is using the same tactics, but more openly. He is painting a picture of the US against the world instead of blacks vs cops or rich vs poor. Do I agree with it all? Hell no.

***** Clinton had basically nothing to do with the Dotcom bust, so why are you blaming him for the economic downturn? The issue there was irrational investors convinced they were buying in on the ground floor of the new Walmart, when the companies they were buying didn't actually have coherent, workable business plans. There's nothing the President could have done to fix that problem.

In addition, at this point it's been more or less proven that Reagan policies /do not work./ Growing the upper class to grow the middle class is a frankly stupid idea because the upper class doesn't spend money the way the middle and lower classes do. Middle class and lower class folks spend all or most of their money on goods and services, increasing economic liquidity and driving demand for food, housing, clothing, and other consumer goods, as well as movies, music, etc. Rich folks, on the other hand, do invest money in businesses, but without people to purchase things from those businesses that's totally pointless. Zero jobs in businesses geared for the middle class can be created if there is no middle class, no matter how much money the "job creators" pump into them.

In addition, rich people don't tend to start businesses as often as middle class people. Once someone is rich, they can either take an active role in their wealth (which some of them do) or they can do whatever their conservative financial advisor aimed at maintaining that wealth tells them to do. Starting a new business is /not/ a money-making move most of the time! It takes a lot of work someone used to luxury isn't necessarily willing to do, for no guarantee of any return. How many billionaire entrepreneurs do you know who continued starting businesses after they made it big? I can think of two: Dean Kamen and Elon Musk. And, Elon Musk doesn't do what he does for money, he does it because he literally wants to save the world. Most billionaires don't have that kind of motivation.

Most of the really super wealthy in this country see this problem already. The fact is that the titanic machine of American industry cannot move without people to buy the things it makes, and right now we are crushing the people who buy things. Could Warren Buffett have made it as big as he did in a country which didn't have a middle class? Absolutely not, because Berkshire Hathaway buys and sells companies which rely on that middle class. Could Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have done what they did without a middle class? Nope, because they sell consumer electronics to the masses of people who can afford the luxury.

Not everyone can be rich until automation happens, I get that. However, until then, making the rich richer will just result in millions of angry poor people and no economic liquidity. If you can barely afford to eat, what's the point in inventing? You only have so much time, and you need to spend it scraping together enough to eat.

Or, as will eventually happen on the path we are following, you can spend your time scraping the bones of the formerly rich together. Those who pretend everything is fine in the ivory tower have always found themselves cast into the glaring light of reality and dashed upon the ground. If you don't let people eat good food, they will eat the rich. Marx was wrong about many things, but he wasn't wrong that, if you get enough people mad at you, eventually they kill you.

The actual stuff a conservative Republican can directly do to harm the social standing of various people directly is limited. Mainly, you'd want to watch out for anyone who seems trigger-happy on restricting civil liberties through direction action (Executive Orders and control of the intelligence agencies allows for this), or someone who would not veto socially restrictive national legislation. Also, anyone who would appoint rightist supreme ourt justices.

Since a lot of social policy is done on a state level (gay marriage, and effective access to abortion for example), the President won't be able to directly affect that. Probably the most worrying thing would be if a president was able to nominate a supreme court justice you disagreed with.

If your main goal are good social justice outcomes, probably the thing you care about most for presidents is that they nominate justices with whom you agree. Their use of military force doesn't directly affect social outcomes. Failure to veto bills you disagree with is a problem, but not nearly as much of a problem as a congress where both houses can muster a majority for a bad bill. Eventually, someone with whom you disagree will get elected unless the house is fixed.

The president has a lot of power, but things like setting tax rates, banning gay marriage/abortion, and so on, are not actually in his power. Anything he wants to do with that stuff has to rely on his ability to herd the cats in congress, which actually is not something I expect Trump would be able to do. Could Trump still cause lots of trouble with his court appointments, usages of executive power, and potential decisions with our intelligence and military agencies? Definitely. I wouldn't worry about his ability to lead the legislature though.

The ACA wasn't passed because Obama had direct power as president, it was passed because as president he had soft power and influence with his party, and the Democrats controlled both houses. Any threat to social justice from a national legislative level is likely to come from something like that. In this sense, one who agrees with Democrats on these issues should always vote for Democrats.

Trump is widely looked down on by much of the world (particularly Europe) and his politically incorrect bravado / impulsive decision-making reinforces the "cowboy" reputation the international community hates about the US. How much does this matter?

**** I'm not comfortable betting money on politics, but if you wanted me to put a value on how strongly I believe Sanders will beat out Clinton, it would be 70% certainty. It seems to depend on who wins NY.

I posted my predictions for the following reasons:

- To test my understanding of politics and people by predicting how the public will vote. I'm doing this publicly as a way to keep myself from flinching from being wrong later and not saying, 'I really knew that other person would win' all along.

- To have some political discussion where people are most likely to keep a cool head. I am also curious to know where people here stand in politics. Don't worry! I won't hold anyone's political views against them. There are too many good and interesting people I want to meet who have political views strongly opposed to mine for me to reject someone purely on politics.

- To test my understanding of Dark Arts Rationality. Trump seems to do a lot of the same things as Quirrel says to do to manipulate the public and he reminds of Quirrel, but not in the hyper-competence way. In addition, he acts very much like a sociopath I once knew who I will call S for sociopath. Like S, Trump will say anything he wants to get other people to believe his 'image', he only cares about his public image. Like S, Trump has never shown any remorse or regret for any of his actions and the few times S apologized for anything, S showed no signs of lingering guilt. The one time that S was caught out in his lies and manipulations, S did a major 180 degree turn and went from being dismissive and insulting to wooing and being extremely loving towards the woman I knew. Since Trump has show many other signs of being similar to S, I fully expect him to do a flip-flop once he gets the Republican nomination. I think of his relationship towards the Democratic party as similar to the relationship between S and the woman (She dumped him hard with a restraining order on S).

Sorry for such a long post. I know it wasn't what you were asking for but when I started typing, all of this just flowed right out of me.

***** I mean, ok, fair enough, but Trump is running for the /Republican/ nomination. And Trump is also majorly missing one of Quirrellmort's most important implied pieces of advice: have a David Monroe figure. For an egomaniacal sociopath, he's suffering from the sociopath's typical flaw: such a total lack of self-control that he never reaches past the sociopathy to acquire any real charisma he could use to get followers. I mean, he's basically an Ork Boss -- not even the Fist o' Gork an' Mork, just a regular Bossboy.

Fuck - speaking as a voter, donor, and volunteer for the Sanders campaign - in this campaign, Bernie "Anvil that Needs to be Dropped" Sanders is the /most/ charismatic candidate in the race. That's actually really fucked-up. Or possibly, on the other hand, my expectations for charisma are completely miscalibrated by anime and other fiction in which both the heroes and the villains are really good at making you actually root for them.

And sorry to say, but I do expect Hillary to win in New York. We've pulled upsets before like in Michigan, but that was a unique situation where a state law prevented polls from actually drawing a well-randomized sample. In NY, we're well behind, still suffering that retarded racial gap thing, and she's got the state's Democratic machine sewn up. It's the state that gave the world Tammany Hall.

Same thing basically. I look at the friends and enemies that person has, and how s/he treats people around them. Judging them on their opinions doesn't make sense to me, because after reading the Sequences /How to Change Your Mind/, I have realized that in a slightly different life, there are many amazing and unpleasant people who I could have been. As a result, it's a poor way to judge someone on views and opinions that they most likely grew up with. It's far better to get a grasp of their character by looking at their actions rather than what they say. "Actions speak louder than words" or something like that.

** Fanfiction Question:

So first things first, this question will have little to do with rational elements at ALL (unless you count trying to manipulate an audience somewhat rational), so I apologize in advance:

I'm writing a Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars, an anime) fanfiction called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804422/1/Nisegami][Nisegami]]. It's currently about 75k words, 9 chapters and it's been out for like two months (I update it pretty much every week).

Here's my question: I'm trying to maximize the amount of reviews I get on my story. I don't want to break my chapters up into smaller ones (which could be a valid way to increase my review spread) So, with my review goal in mind, is updating every week too often? I just wondered if leaving longer gaps in between updates would make people "thirsty for more", thereby increasing the story's popularity? There may not be a specific right/wrong answer to this question but many of you are experienced, intelligent authors, so I figured I'd ask :)

EDIT: And even beyond just my initial question about spacing out updates, what are some of the other methods you guys have seen/used to increase the amount of hype/feedback your story has gotten? I'm already posting updates on the subreddit of the series, and I do my best to reply to all of my reviewers. What more can I be doing to get views/reviews?

So if I were to do that, I'd feel like I was just trying to farm reviews, in much the same way I'd feel if I broke up my chapter lengths simply to improve the spread.

*** I wonder, though--when searching for a new story to read, how many frequenters of FanFiction.net look at review counts, and how many look at favorites? I personally sort by favorites, and try to give less weight to reviews, specifically because reviews are multiplied by chapter count, while a person can give only one favorite to the entire story. Also, a review may be positive or negative (e.g., /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ is #11 on favorites but #1 on reviews among English /Naruto/ stories, while /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ is #48 and #73, respectively), while a favorite obviously always is positive.

It'd be an interesting survey to conduct.

(In particular: I've given out 33 reviews in the course of my FanFiction.net career, in comparison to my 299 favorites, and probably half of those reviews were negative--so I /really/ don't consider reviews to be a very good indicator of a story's worth.)

*** I pay fairly close attention to the metrics on my story and the ways that they trend upwards and downwards. If you look at the charts for viewership numbers, (which are a more useful metric to a writer than reviews, as well as tracking closer to favs which I see as more important as well) you'll see that on the day you post and 1-2 days afterwards you get increased numbers (around 3-4 X my non-updating baseline), after which it'll basically go back down to baseline pretty reliably over the course of the next few days. Unfortunately this means that the most useful advice I can give you is "no more often than every 3 days", which obviously doesn't answer your question but I'm afraid it's the best I've been able to come up with from my study of the data.

Now if you want to encourage (manipulate) more readers into reading your story, but you don't want to feel manipulative your options will obviously be fairly limited. So instead I'll just list all the methods I'm aware of and you can decide from there. I don't use all these myself, they are however the methods I've noticed as being most effective. Breaking up your chapters and posting every 3 days would probably increase your numbers, by allowing you to ride a constant tide of high viewership numbers, but you've said you don't want to do that. Asking questions in the A/N at the end is a time tested method to get reviews. Simpler questions will encourage more reviews, as they require less effort from the reader. It's best to ask questions which are genuinely interesting to you, because people can sometimes tell if you're being insincere. A good picture is definitely a plus, yours is pretty good so you seem to have that covered. Chiaroscuro as an example of both recently asked people to vote on what his new picture from four options, which I recognised as an extremely effective manipulation while also being taken in by it. So I left a review. Very clever of him/her.

The largest option you have for more readers would be crossposting it to SufficientVelocity and SpaceBattles forums, with links to the ff.net version in the first post. You would likely gain both extra total readers and extra ff.net readers as people migrated to read on their favourite platform. Properly implemented, it is entirely possible that your total readers over all platforms would multiply as much as three or five times over. It is also entirely possible that you'd get as many likes on each chapter as your current fav count on SB, since the more general method of people finding new fics means you'd be competing for readers from a far larger pool. Instead of competing just for Shokugeki no Soma readers, you would be competing for the pool of all readers. For example if I have 174 arbitrary numbers worth of views on ff.net, then I have 264 on SB and 82 on SV. I approximate that normally the SB number should be only twice the SV number, but since I engaged the community regularly in discussion and conversation on SB and not SV, the SB thread stayed on the front page for a disproportionate amount of time and the numbers were inflated. You can obviously manipulate that by posting replies when your thread coincidentally is just about to leave the front page.

The downside to this is the extra time spent posting things on three sites, and the extra time it takes to make any edits to three sites. This is especially a problem for me because I suffer from depression and thus pull from an extremely limited pool of purposeful effort every day, I think therefore that it might be less of an issue for you. On the upside you can generally expect a far greater volume of feedback, and on SB and SV a surprisingly large percentage of the people you talk to will also be working on fics of their own. This means you can get some surprisingly high quality feedback from people who really know what they're doing. It also means the readers can be somewhat mercurial. While by and large it's positive, sometimes it isn't, especially if the author doesn't know how to properly mediate a crowd. There is also the risk of spending too much time interacting with the community and not enough writing, because it's fun to talk to readers. Also if you've got massive plot holes or other discrepancies, they will point them out.

Finally there is obviously the option of posting it here, if it's rational fiction that is. I think I picked up a fair number of readers around here. In fact, it's probably where I got a /lot/ of my first 100.

**** Those are pretty interesting ideas. The cross posting idea is a really good one, I'll have to look into that. A few people have mentioned it, so I may look into doing the little question/poll things at the end of each chapter. As far as posting it here, I wouldn't do that. It's not rational fiction in the least. It's just an AU, more intelligent interpretation of Shokugeki no Soma. But it's still most certainly shonen.

Either way, thanks for the detailed response good sir/madam!

***** Happy to help, dude/dudette. Best of luck, I hope you get a lot of fun out of it.

I wonder if it's possible to write rational shounen... I don't think it should be impossible by any means, of course you'd know your story better than me. I almost tried my hand at rational Bleach once, but it died on the vine.

****** I don't know, a lot of what makes shonen...well...shonen would be fairly difficult to convert into a rational world. A lot of the vibes (for lack of a better term) that shonen works give off don't really fit a rational setting. For example, the classic "Me or Someone I love being in trouble unlocks greater power" shonen trope or even the "Anger = Power" trope. In a rational setting, while someone you care about may make you willing to go to greater lengths, it's difficult to justify the aforementioned tropes in their pure forms. Getting angry =/= Super Saiyan in rational works, usually. Especially since most rational works have a rational protagonist, who's usually too intelligent to go blind with rage. Again, that's just one example though.

In general, I don't think shonen works do well when you apply intelligence to them, particularly ones involving supernatural powers as, in the vast majority of the media in question, these powers are very inconsistent and/or easily exploitable if you think for 5 minutes. So any sort of rational attempt at super powered shonen would be either way too much work OR an OP protagonist. For example, the Waves Arisen. A very good, rationally done Naruto fanfic. But it didn't feel like a shonen work. Not at all, at least to me.

******* Well, there's always the option of making it self-aware and having it subvert its own tropes. The universe rewards people who fight for those they love with massive power, so the main character starts consciously attempting to set up situations that trigger shounen powerups by gaining as many allies/friends as possible with precariously positioned people, and training their thought patterns to be as protagonist-y as possible. (alliteration motherfucker, I speak it.)

"My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected." for example, takes a standard shounen/harem story and makes it work without really changing the world or the storyline simply by adding another character and focusing on them, while they help the original shounen protagonist.

It's true that most shounen works don't react very well when you actively apply intelligence to them, but that just means more work needs doing on the worldbuilding. Of course, replicating the /feel/ of a shounen is another matter entirely. "I want to be stronger" may be the rallying cry of the rationalists, but generally that gets translated to "I want to be smarter".

Still, I'm sure it /can/ be done, though not simply or easily.

******** Agreed, it probably can be done. It's just fairly difficult. Merging shonen and rational, while still outputting something people want to read, seems like quite the challenge.

Also, he faces a series of ever more impossible challenges, which he must overcome with the power of rationality, science, and just plain smarts. No spoilers, please.

** Recently read about [[http://hackaday.com/2015/01/13/cheap-diy-microscope-sees-individual-atoms/][this]] [[https://dberard.com/home-built-stm/vibration-isolation/][project]], a scanning tunneling microscope which lets you resolve individual atoms with everyday electronics. The most complicated part is stabilizing the device against vibrations, which he does with a system of springs and magnets.

The scanner works by pointing a piece of wire at different points at sub-nanometer resolution and seeing how much current flows. The pointing device is a piece of atomically sharp (broken-edged) tungsten wire hooked up to a cheap piezoelectric disk that has been cut into 4 sections using an X-Acto knife. The needle gets moved around, in precise increments, as voltage is applied to the piezo sections.

I had no idea this kind of precision was possible with such cheap parts. Given that the needle could also function as a printer or etcher, this has made me update in the direction of it being possible to construct a relatively simple desktop-size fabricator for relatively high tech computer circuitry. That would make it likely that a small scale, fully self replicating system could be created (and that this is achievable by someone in a basement, with the requisite understanding, not necessarily a high tech lab).
