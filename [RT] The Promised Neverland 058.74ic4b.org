** Why do angsty dudes in Japanese fiction always seem to wear long coats without putting their arms in the sleeves?

*** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoatCape][TvTropes]] seems to think it's more of a "cool dude" than an "angsty dude" thing, which fits, as it rejects the traditional norm of how coats are supposed to be worn. It also seems to be a "military badass" thing in anime, as even some of the more rules-abiding marines in One Piece seem to do it.

Of course, if you use TvTropes examples as your only guideline, you're also free to speculate that it means that the character is a Nazi sympathizer, given that Goering apparently wore his coats like that :/

**** Thanks for the link! I knew I wasn't imagining it.

I'm speculating that he glues the shoulders on.

***** I'll admit to actually having worn coats like that in the past, though only for short intervals at a time; in my experience, you don't need glue if you're willing to adjust from time to time. Given that there's no wind in an underground shelter, he should be fine.

Then again, with the amounts of gun violence the final page foreshadows, he might be in for a few wardrobe malfunctions...

EDIT: Scratch that. Reading the TvTropes page, there's apparently an official statement by the author of One Piece that the marine admirals' capes don't fall of because they're kept on by justice. In that case, I nominate Not-Minerva's coat to be held in place by assholeish insecurity.

**** Coats like this look cooler than capes.
