Just a little thread for [[/u/TK17Studios]] giving words of encouragement. Your story is amazing and I look forward to every update. Also, I thought I'd stop being a lurker and let you know how far your story has reached - I live in the country of <see PM>!!! You have the attention of the world! (Perhaps one day I'll do a translation for you :) )

Anyway, keep up the amazing work!


** r! animorphs has replaced hpmor for me as my go-to good story to use against the "all fan fics are terrible" points people make. I love how alien you've made all the different species feel. And having read so many different books it's brilliant how unpredictable yet smart all you characters are. Chapter 20 was the first thing I've read in a very long time that's bought me to tears just by being such a beautiful moment. and i just want to thank you for having written it

** I just binge-read r!animorphs last week and I have to say I've barely thought about anything else since. It's obscenely good. I love how all the characters are believable and smart and different. I devoured all the reddit threads about each chapter. My favourite parts in no particular order:

-The characterization of the Yeerks, they're not just Evil For The Sake Of Being Evil

-Visser Three is completely insane, I love it

-The high level of competence displayed by non protagonist characters

-Individuals having different goals instead of just melding together with everyone else who's on their "side". In particular the way the war having slowly shifted from "defeat the Yeerks" to "defeat V3" was perfectly executed IMO

-The high level of technical competence in your writing

-Rachel's character in particular. She's just so well written

-Version control morphs. Fuck that's so cool

-The way that all the characters' voices sound in their heads, they have different flows and cadences, you can FEEL whose head you're inside

Please write more TK! I'm eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the story. In the meantime I guess I'll reread it.

** Also, I want to give a shout-out to [[/u/DayStarEld]] here, for his great work on Pokemon: Origin of Species. I just did a pre-mortem with some friends yesterday, and other things have definitely worked it's way into my life, not to mention the fantastic story (still trying to figure out what angle Geo is taking in the background...)

It's these two stories I'm obsessively reading and looking forward to updates!

The only reason I haven't posted an encouragement thread for P:OoS is because you post on a monthly cycle and I can't influence you :D only 12 more days to go!!!

** Aw, shucks, you guys.

Update time, I guess: I've founded a group house called [[http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/][Dragon Army Barracks]], I've been off at a multi-week AI researcher training workshop for CFAR and have another one coming up around Halloween, I've been posting a new rationality post every day for the past 26 days on [[http://www.lesserwrong.com][LessWrong2.0]], and I got a grant to run my rationality bootcamp, which supplements the generosity from people like [[/u/MagicWeasel][u/MagicWeasel]].

So things have been busy. I've felt a little guilty every time I've thought of you guys waiting, but I've also felt a little guilty every time I picked up the r!Animorphs doc because there's /so much world to save./

That being said, I'm genuinely seriously f'real putting in a solid six-hour writing block this weekend, so maybe things will go well enough for an update this week?

I particularly know that I owe [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] the updated interlude that he's been pulling for; he's been very patient.

But anyways, this was an extremely pleasant surprise for me today. All the warm-fuzzies. Thank you so much.

*** Hey; thanks for the update!

I heard about Dragon Army Barracks from the controversy last May, and I hope things go well - but even more so, I have to say, I hope the experiment discovers something useful whether positive or negative.

Best wishes on your writing, whether here or elsewhere!

** Absolutely agree. As [[/u/the_real_twibib]] said, I find myself pointing fanfic doubters to r!animorphs these days more than HPMOR, simply because the beginning of HPMOR can turn a lot of people off while r!animorphs is far less "abrasive" and the writing and story /starts/ amazing rather than ramping up to amazing.

** I have to second every nice things that's been said, and add that R!Animorphs would be my go-to example for "Rational fic that avoids the common sins of rational-fic"

There's no centralisation of competence into a single rational wunderkind, there's no lengthy durdle-diversions for the author to explain all the cool things they know, and there's certainly no sense that the protagonist is assured victory by virtue of how smart they are...

Instead you've got a crowd of high-competence allies and adversaries who pull no punches, a plot moving at a clip that almost risks going to the other extreme of happening quickly enough to leave me stumbling behind its pace (I should really re-read, or read slower... but at every point I urgently want to know what happens next) and every major encounter feels like it could be a total party wipe for the good guys (as it should be, when fighting an alien menace).

** I'm also a [[https://www.patreon.com/Sabien][patreon supporter]], and all the money is being used to set up a rationality boot-campfor middle schoolers (though I wouldn't care if [[/u/tk17studios]] was using it for gambling, he earned it afer all, but it's a pretty good cause!)

So yeah if you want to offer some monetary encouragement I'm sure it wouldn't hurt!

(but also, wow, it's an amazing story! I don't support much on things like patreon - I'm notoriously stingy - but The Reckoning is SO VERY AMAZING. I wish it wasn't animorphs fan fiction so that way it could get published "for real" and end up as a movie starring Matt Damon)

** Animorphs was one of the first book series I ever got into way back in elementary school. It was one of the first examples young-me encountered of the power that fiction wields in exploring the human condition, and it had a big impact on the way I came to see and understand the world.

And now decades later, Animorphs: The Reckoning maintains that same spirit, only even better. I can't say enough good things about it.
