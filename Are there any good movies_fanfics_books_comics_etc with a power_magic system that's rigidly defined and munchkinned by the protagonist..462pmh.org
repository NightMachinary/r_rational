** Magic in the Inheritance Cycle is very rigidly defined. There isn't much munchkining done by Eragon, though, mostly because most of the low-hanging fruit was already taken after thousands of years of study by immortal elves. Zero energy expenditure methods of killing? At least twelve discovered. External power sources? Loads. Time travel? Many have tried. They all died. Not recommended. Resurrection? Not possible, you'll die. Healing? Just need to know the right words.

Edit: Teleportation? Really expensive, too expensive to do with humans, but doable. Long-distance communication? Impractical for non-mages, highly useful for mages. Radiation sheilding? Obscure, but extant. Detonating your own atoms as a last-ditch effort? Done. Twice. Spells specifically for dulling swords so you can practice with them? Yup. Magic goldmine? Impractical for most purposes, but still used. Immortality ritual? It works on whole species and takes many centuries or perhaps milennia to actually result in immortality. Mind magic? Primary method for mages to fight each other.

For example, as horrific as it was, the Army-level warfare in book 3 was realistic and very well done. Magicians would ward large groups of soldiers, and if the magician died, you could 1HKO large swathes of enemy mooks by bursting a blood vessel in their brain or something with minimal MP expenditure.

****** I'm going to preface this by saying that I haven't read Earthsea, so what I know about it's magic system is gleaned off of wikis and previous arguments, so if I misrepresent something, please tell me.

Now, I can see why you think the magic systems are similar-- there's a language where things have true names, and also people have true names, and knowing that true name gives you control over something.

The first difference is that Earthsea's true names are more like giving directions, while Eragon's Ancient Language is more like writing laws. In earthsea, if you say a string of true words, the universe will conform to the meaning of those true words. In Eragon, if you say a string of words in the ancient language, some effect that could be interpreted as having the same meaning as the words said will happen, but what exactly happens is largely up to the interpretation of the magician. If you say "a fireball materializes in front of me" in earthsea, you get a fireball. If you say that in the ancient language, you might interpret that increasing the heat of the air so that it combusts, raising nearby flammable materials into the air and setting them on fire, materializing a fireball (the candy) in front of you, setting a ball on fire, or even something more esoteric like granting yourself laser eyes because your particular interpretation of those words was that you'd convert your own body fat into energy using a combustion reaction, and then your eyeballs would have a material effect on the world in front of you.

The second difference is that the ancient language is actually completely unnecessary to cast magic in IC. Not using it is the usually height of stupidity because of the third difference (energy is derived from biological processes, so if you use too much energy you're dead as a doornail), but it's possible to cast magic nonverbally. Indeed, there isn't even specifically magical about the Ancient Language. In earthsea, there's some mysticism involved in having the dragons, paragons of balance, speaking in a fundamentally magical tounge. In eragon, it's an engineering decision. Magic was too unpredictable because it was hard to concentrate, so the precursors decided to cast a spell that let magicians limit the possible effects of their magic.

And speaking about that third difference, it's actually what plays the largest role in making the magic systems different. From limiting the potential scale of IC magic (creating a thunderstorm, like in Earthsea, would literally kill more or less every single human in Alagaesia) to forcing IC magicians to abide by MAD (to make sure your spell will penetrate their wards, you're likely going to have to kill yourself too) to incentivizing more minimalist use of magic (a magical flashbang is showed off as one of the more effective uses of magic in the series.)

I'm not going to say that the magic systems aren't /similar/ but saying they're identical because they both use words to cast spells doesn't really make sense.

Draining is actually a closely-guarded secret, taught only to high-ranking Elves and Dragon Riders, once they are thought to be respectful enough of life not to abuse it, but also because you're thinking of magic as a Tolkeinesque "does wut da plot wants" lawless nonsense.

It's not quite so in the IC. Think of magic as an electric current, and wards as an insulator. If you ward (insulate) the livestock, then no offensive magic (electric current) will be able to affect it.

** Some self-promotion since you've already read some of my other recommendations. I write "hard magic", rules oriented fantasy with pretty clear reasoning for my characters. The first book is [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]], and the second book, [[http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Sorcery-Broken-Mirrors-Book-ebook/dp/B016IPJ1R8/][Stealing Sorcery]], has even more of it.

Some characters do more munckinry than others, and in different circumstances; Taelien is very good at combat optimization, but he doesn't utilize his skill set as much outside of combat. Jonan is pretty much the opposite, and Lydia falls somewhere in between.

Fair warning that my writing can come across as "video gamey" - I'm a game designer for a RPG company (Obsidian), and it comes across to some extent in my work.

I recommend looking at the preview chapter to see if you like the style of it.

**** It speeds up somewhat mid-way into Chapter 8 (which is just after the 50% mark), and there are definitely more action scenes in that chapter and beyond it. Most people tend to think one of the parts of Chapter 8 is the best part of the book, so since you're close, you might want to consider reading that scene and seeing if you like it. You could even skip ahead if you're into that kind of thing, and if you like the scene enough, go back and catch up.

Discussing options is definitely a part of the style of the book, so that's still going to happen later on (albeit less and less as things get crazier). The second book has less of that because a lot more of the second book is "solo" content, but I still prefer to have characters actually think and plan their actions. That's an element of what makes this books (mostly) rational, but it's definitely not a style of writing that suits everyone. Even I have to be in the right mood for it.

***** Yes, I love deliberations, but where I'm at, it's become difficult to continue reading, but since you mention chapter 8, I'll keep going to at least that ch 9-10.

You have a good premise, and I can sense there's a definite magic system, and I am excited to keep reading it, if only to learn the system.

That said,you do good action sequences.

******** Awesome, glad you enjoyed it once things picked up a bit. I really appreciate you taking the time to reply. I'm going to try to make sure my future books are better paced (I think the sequel already did this to some extent, but your mileage may vary).

I think action scenes are probably going to end up being my specialization. There are definitely a lot more of them in the sequel.

********* Yes, I'm glad. Now, despite the desire for action I'm still a rationalist reader so i hope that by the end of the story at least i can step through and define the reasons antagonists and the protagonist move forward and how, beyond a simple "because plot"

The other thing is i hope taelien makes more nonhuman friends, lol.

Last hing I'm noting is the transition from taelien as main character almost to a side character. He's my favorite character so i hope in the next book we get to see more of what he's capable of.

********** You should definitely be able to see the motivations for the antagonists in the second book - I think they're generally clearer than in the first book, in fact. I think I probably should have made it clearer [[#s][in the first book]]

Taelien definitely does make more nonhuman friends. There's a lot more "making friends" in the second book in general, really. It's more character focused.

You get to see Taelien showing off more in the next book, although you also get to see more illumination of his weaknesses. He grows more as a character in the second book. The characters in the second book get roughly equal time, but the book is about 50% longer, so it's more of each of them overall (even if you include the fact that there's an additional perspective).

*** I wouldn't say FiO is rigidly defined, from our perspective anyway.

I assume you're thinking of the limitations on CelestAI. But as readers, we don't get access to whatever binary code rigidly defines them. So we can't predict how they'll work in practice, or admire CelestAI's cleverness when it routes around them. The author could've made CelestAI do /anything/ by claiming the existence of a hidden loophole in its hidden code, and we'd just have to accept it.
