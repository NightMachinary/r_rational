** Not mine, I just came across this and decided to share it.

This is technically two stories:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6876866/1/A_whole_new_world]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7293701/1/A-whole-new-universe-sequel-to-A-whole-new-world]]

They're not particularly marvelously rationalist, nor are they particularly marvelously written - but it's always interesting to see what different writers do with the concept. The second story has several nods to Three Worlds Collide, incidentally (and with permission, apparently).
