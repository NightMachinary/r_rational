** Neat that the story's thumbnail is finally being used, less neat that it's clipped. I may need to make a square cover. As always, feedback is very, very welcome, either here or shouted at me as we pass on the sidewalk.

I look at you. We make eye contact. "What?" I ask.

"The last chapter of Fling a Light was a complete mess. Seriously, this is almost as bad as that debacle with Piggot last chapter."

"Oh, thank you for the feedback," I say. "Do you have any suggestions for how I could improve as a writer?"

You open your mouth. Spiders pour out, crawling down your neck and making their nest in your clothes.

I consider screaming, but hold out my hand to shake instead. In the distance, haunting piano music plays. We know this is all there is to life, both of us flying through the void, hiding our inner turmoil and also spiders and screaming reviews of fanfiction at passersby as we walk through our dreary lives, waiting for this world to end and put us out of our misery and spiders.

*** I don't have constructive criticism sorry. I just really enjoy your story and want to tell you that. Looking forward to more.

** Have you considered posting this to spacebattles or sufficient velocity? Their Worm fandom is a lot more active than on FF.

** Just read the whole thing. Neat so far.

The obvious defense against Endbringers trashing up a big portal hub is to not use a hub. Setting up portals is cheap enough that you can have any number of different topologies that will work just fine.

*** While that is true, Taylor's thinking in this story has been not just how to best benefit the world in general with her power. Specifically she wants to benefit her hometown and revitalize its economy. Her idea of the hub was a result of seeking a solution to her local goal. There are downsides to this approach, as you say.

** I didn't like this chapter as a whole, but I loved

#+begin_quote
  Quickly, I went through the priming procedure on the weapon. Whoever had put it together had put two switches that had to be pulled at the same time for safety, but I'd ripped both out and replaced them with an electric trigger that needed a randomised key of between 0 and 64 precisely-timed pulses, interspersed with an equivalent number of between 0 and 64 "ticks" in which there was no pulse. In my eyes, going with a password that used a system only you understood was even better than using a password that took ten thousand years of supercomputer time to guess.

this part.

** Rampantly uncertain of which people are the same people across the different sections of this chapter, but I assume that was deliberate.
