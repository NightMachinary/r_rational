** I tried to be careful with the SJW in this chapter, but I'm not sure I did a good job. I really don't want to make a caricature of this type of person, since I'm sure a lot of these people come from a good place. The problem, of course, is that some of these "social justice" types really are just as combative and easily offended as the character I introduced. I'm trying to strike a line between realistic and fair here, but I think I failed. I dunno, I'd love some feedback on this.

Oh, and for those curious about the story, this is literally anime Dresden Files. If that sounds interesting, please check it out! I'm posting these every week. I really want to make this great so any feedback is welcome!
