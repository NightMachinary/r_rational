Upvoters generally upvote stuff regardless of whether it belongs in a sub or not. If this was not the case, there would be no need for rules anywhere, people would just downvote everything that doesn't belong out of view.

If you want examples, feel free to go into random rising [[/r/science]] threads and see how many puns, jokes and especially anecdotal comments get plenty of upvotes.

As far as I can tell, voting has a huge bias towards "like/dislike" and away from "belongs/does not belong."

For another example, see my comment ITT being downvoted when I'm talking about the story. It clearly belongs ITT but it's been downvoted because people don't like it.

Not really seeing the problem here? Puns and jokes are funny, of course I would want to see funny things related to an article im interested in. And anecdotes play an important role in grounding a scientific finding in reality, in making them more than just abstract numbers.

I am simplifying the problem of, whether a post belongs here, by suggesting that it's as simple as counting upvotes. There are lots of complicating factors, but sometimes it's best to look at the simple facts. It's easy to get bogged down in overcomplicated arguments on the definitions of rational, the purpose of the sub, etc... But the simple fact is, every upvotes is someone who's day was made a bit happier by these updates. Sure it doesn't fit into your definition of rational, but it does fit into mine. If there was a consensus that it wasn't rational, that might be different, but the content of a sub should be decided by the people of a sub. And the best way to measure whether the people like something, is upvotes.

** Taking an inappropriately wide swing here because with this story I'd rather WMG at the most interesting thing my intuition gives me instead of the most likely:

The one who shot himself was the real Bucket, and the other one is the robot. Maybe you can't die in Wonkaland for some terrifying chocolate-related reason (Would explain how the other kids in the first one survived like that to leave), and the only time to leave the factory is at the inception of the suspiciously Cabin-In-The-Woods-esque “contest” ritual. The inside of Wonkaland might as well be a sweets-themed nightmare realm, after all, and not an underground factory.

Or I guess it could be a realistic (chocolate) robot, or (chocolate) engineered bioclone. If you think that's more rational.

I mean, it's certainly more plausible that a robot could a 40 foot octuple backflip than an old man... That said, who knows. Gene Wilder's fun little summersault may have made people question their assumptions about Wonka, but Old man bucket's insane actions here make people question reality itself. It's a great escalation.

#+begin_quote
  This one strikes me as similar to UNSONG: a batshit insane world that is nevertheless a response to an existing work which focuses on the ramifications that said work ignored or glossed over. It's meta-rational.
#+end_quote

I don't see how it can be any kind of rational without the cohesive rules UNSONG had.

#+begin_quote
  Why so? Both poke fun at and play with their source material, with a similar level of surrealism. There have been fewer puns in Chili, but the night is young yet.

Because unsong had stable rules. This story does not.

I'm coming into a fan club and asking the fans why the thing they are a fan of could be bad. I didn't expect to be showered with upvotes.

As for upvotes on a post, that is not a good gauge for how well something fits in a sub. Something has to appeal to reddit's primary audience to get upvoted, upvoters don't generally care where the thing that appeals to them is posted. So, I can probably post news about trump getting impeached or a funny/cute picture and get a score similar to this post's.

For similar reasons, I don't think it makes sense to allow everything this community might be interested in (or simply ignore everything that doesn't fit). Then this sub would probably eventually become [[/r/memes]] or [[/r/politics]] or [[/r/nsfw]] or something because that's what reddit's primary audience is interested in.

That's not to say it didn't work; Unsong did a good job of not overreaching itself in terms of new principles, generally. But it had a very similar vibe, where new things were introduced for the sake of a pun, and one that might even require a footnote on gematria/Hebrew language to understand.

*** I have no interest in arguing definitions on what is rational and rationalist, all I care about, and the purpose of the sub, is whether the works I find on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] are more likely to be things I like than works I find elsewhere. It's not a coincidence that this fanfic has been popular here, nor is it merely a result of high construction quality.

As an example of why people who like rational works are likely to like this work, the answer to the riddle was one of the most effective lessons of rationality I've read on this sub. People suggested the possibility of "entering in what you like more than anything else" as of chapter one, and the concept was popular. But as more people won those winners didn't quite line up with the theory, and the puzzle text never really worked with it at all. What I learned upon being so horrifically wrong while learning the true solution was that I was not properly counting the evidence against, I let my feeling that the solution was clever override my rationality. Learning those kinds of lessons is a big part of the reason i read rational works, and Chili did it brilliantly!

I could talk more about it, but ultimately, this is Reddit, and we can see whether the people of a sub want certain content by the upvotes, and this content is clearly, what the people want.

**** Absolutely agree. Also, the solution involved novel use of established Wonka technology, and that makes it a more satisfying answer than "Charlie rigged the contest." Deconstruction and munchkining are other reasons I come here on top of the rest.

*** I agree with you that unsong is at a different level, and that this isn't really rational fic. That said, it is expressly a meta satire of rational fic and this community itself. As such, I think it's relevant here. People seem to be enjoying reading and discussing it. Theres also tons of other serial fic on this sub that isn't rational, even those that are quite popular. Maybe just stop clicking on the threads and move on if it bothers you.

***** Literally the meta-point of Unsong when it comes to Kabbalism is that anything can be rationalized post-hoc as being consistent with a sufficiently vague set of precedents.

Unsong doesn't break the rules of its magic system because /its magic system has no rules/. It just pretends to have had rules all along via profound-sounding post-hoc rationalization. You could have justified any other sequence of magical events using the same techniques.

It's like that magic trick where the computer asks you to pick a card from a set of five presented to you, and then it magically removes the card you picked - the trick being that /all/ of the cards have been replaced. You don't notice because you were focused on one card, but the same technique works for every card.

***** Magic /system/? It had as many magic systems as it had characters. Every chapter, just about, introduced some new magical or mystical, or divine, or whatever system of supernatural interaction. The idea that you could predict a hallucinogenic battle of word roots with a drug cactus, or the weird singularity effect of Wall Drug, or the effect of traversing the Panama Canal, or literally any other random thing that happens in the story on the basis of a previously established 'magic system' is... not accurate.

Don't get me wrong, I loved Unsong, but the idea that it had a nice, consist and rational system of magic just isn't supported, in my opinion.

  [[/u/gryfft]] if someone made a porn movie and mentioned [[/r/rational]] in it would you be ok with it getting posted here?
#+end_quote

I'm not [[/u/gryfft]], but in my opinion, if somebody made a porn movie that directly addressed this community in it, or maybe made a comment on some issues or interesting parts of [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I wouldn't mind seeing it here. But with a label [META], which I also believe to suit the story in question better than [RT] at this point, even if it seemed to be [RT] originally.
