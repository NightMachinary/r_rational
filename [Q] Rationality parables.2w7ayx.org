I recently came across [[http://thecodelesscode.com/case/61][TheCodelessCode]], a collection of k≈çan/parables about the art and politics of software engineering. It's a fantastic blog/comic/thing, even for those not familiar with programming (there's a marker at the top right that scales how "geeky" the topic is), and it made me realize I'd really love to see something similar for rationality.

Does anyone know of anything like that? The closest I can think of are a few of the sequences and short stories on LessWrong that have the same feel of mixing antiquity with modernity.


** [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html][The fable of the Dragon-Tyrant]] is the first thing to come to mind.

I vaguely recall someone trying to write Aesop-style stories for the common biases, maybe from CFAR? I wasn't too impressed by the results though.

*** Ahhh, I remember that. It was fantastic, but not quite what I'm looking for.

If you come across the aesops I'd be interested in checking them out at least.

*** Yeah, those were great too :) Thanks for bringing them up, I should have mentioned them in the OP.
