Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

****** I attended one, but it wasn't identical to all others: we customized somewhat.

And the accusation of paganism is just me being way harsh on seasonal holidays, due to being Jewish and thus conditioned to view all nature-centered celebrations as idolatrous. We only had /two/ things in our service that made /vague/ reference to the concept of a sun-god, and everyone was actually secular. This is as opposed to singing a whole song listing off mythologies about the sun and solstice before reaching our modern scientific understanding.

...I have no idea how to make a 'general' one. Step one is usually to stop and think about who your target audience is.

** Reposting this because it probably wasn't seen and I think it's interesting.

Check out this paper about quantitative style features of more and less successful literary works: [[http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1181.pdf]] I am most surprised by the fact that more successful books are found to use more prepositions. Does that resonate with the wisdom of the writers here?

*** Their most successful metric was unigrams (basically, word choice).

#+begin_quote
  Interestingly, less successful books rely on verbs that are explicitly descriptive of actions and emotions (e.g., “wanted”, “took”, “promised”, “cried”, “cheered”, etc.), while more successful books favor verbs that describe thought-processing (e.g., “recognized”, “remembered”), and verbs that serve the purpose of quotes and reports (e.g,. “say”). Also, more successful books use discourse connectives and prepositions more frequently, while less successful books rely more on topical words that could be almost cliche, e.g., “love”, typical locations, and involve more extreme (e.g., “breathless”) and negative words (e.g., “risk”).
#+end_quote

A lot of this is just "show, don't tell", which is the very first rule that you hear if you're a novice writer walking into Creative Writing 101. You don't say, "John wanted the bread," you describe how John is hungry and express his desire in other ways. It's basically the same reason that you're supposed to avoid adverbs. I sort of think this might be why prepositions are so favored; they represent markers for time and place, manipulations of other words.

The finding that increased readability is not correlated with success is also not too surprising to me, mostly because readability comes with tradeoffs in terms of prose style and sentence complexity. I think I would have liked them to separate that out into a graph that measures readability against success, but they only say "increasing readability decreases success", so my guess that there's a trade-off is pure speculation.

I don't know, I don't think quantitative analysis at this level is all that useful because of all the confounding variables involved, which is probably why most previous attempts were qualitative.

** I started reading Polyhistor Academy a few days ago (It's been posted on here, which is where I found out about it). It's about a university of magic where murder is allowed and only 10% of the students are allowed to survive to graduate. I'm one semester into the story and I don't see why anyone would send their kid there if they didn't just want an abortion 19 years after conception, but if you just set that aside it's entertaining. No idiot balls so far, and the forum readers get to vote on lots of decisions, from which classes to attend to hobbies to independent magical research. They have been wise enough to make the MC learn how to magically make himself better at learning, and have seemingly maxed 'learning speed' in just over one semester. Sadly, they also spend like half the MC's time painting, which gives them some illusion magic and the chance to flirt with second best girl. Clearly a better choice would be to let the mad shark toothed doctor install interesting upgrades and get the chemistry teacher best girl with a crush on him to secretly teach him advanced magical chemistry.

Then you can sail through the rest of the things with the only requirement being the minimum pass grade.

Can't remember where I was (pg 100+ in the forum) in but I've put it to the side for a while, the growing feeling of missing information by only reading the story updates and using the forum as a reading interface was becoming a pain.

*** I had a January term class in college that was all about that book. January term is the thing that some colleges have where you have a single class for a whole month rather than taking four or five classes over a semester. So we'd spend a day or two on each of the chapters, talking about them for several hours each. It was one of my favorite classes I took, though there was nothing particularly practical about it.

Though I think that if I reread it now I would just say, "Well duh" to a lot of it, since I've now read so much of the material that came from it. Sort of the same phenomenon as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny][Seinfeld Is Unfunny]].

*** I started reading it a few years ago. At one point early in the book, it describes this puzzle and challenges the reader to solve it. So, being someone who enjoys puzzles, I thought I'd give it a shot.

At first look, the puzzle seemed unsolvable- but since the book heavily implied that there was a solution, I figured I must be missing something. What followed was an hour of struggling to figure out how such an apparently unsolvable puzzle could in fact have a solution, and feeling like an idiot.

Eventually, I gave up and went back to the book, only to find that the very next page opened with something like "Ha, ha! Bet you thought that puzzle had a solution. Actually, it's unsolvable!"

At that point, I was too annoyed to keep reading, and I never did find the energy to pick it up again.
