** Honestly this whole scenario depends on

- The level of superintelligence of the snail,

- How the immortality works and

- Where the snail and your start out in relation to each other

If the snail is sufficiently smart all bets are off because you can't rule out it hacking physics or mind controlling you or some other BS which can't be ruled out. Also if it is smart enough and you can't get to it quickly enough then it figures out a way to create a botnet and instantiate a GAI in which case you're also dead.

However if the snail isn't super creative in it's approach, or it starts out such that you can trap it before it starts utilizing its extreme intelligence. Then it's just a simple matter of locking it in a box, hell it's not even a computer or capable of easy communication so it's way easier to trap indefinitely than an AI.

Anyway once you've trapped it just encase it like the OP does, but don't bother putting its prison somewhere you can't later access it. This is because you want to be able to reliably count on your ability to dump it into a larger celestial body eventually and at some point a supermassive black hole.
