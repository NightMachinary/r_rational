** So... Cat is holding auctions where people, who were recently uprooted from their way of living, and had their clan destroyed in a way that, in their culture, is synonymous with death and slavery, are offered permanent and temporary power-ups and status upgrades, that are basically the only way they know to escape the old "you've outlived your usefulness" treatment. There's a lot more candidates than there is power to distribute.

**** Yeah, but there's no reason any of them would back down from a bid. They'd all desperately want the shares of night offered, and they're all used to serving someone else; so there's no reason they wouldn't promise ridiculous durations like "I will serve 10'000 years!", because as far as they're concerned, it's either "get the night" or "get shafted down the line".

***** Possible resolutions?

Cat needs an army now, more than she needs them in ten years (with the crusade over, her intention to abdicate, etc.). The rules of the auction could be set up to reflect that by making the first years of service bid worth more than subsequent. The further Cat goes, the stronger the enemies are meaning more Night and (possibly) more who will attempt to fight rather than surrender. So do you bid now to avoid being left behind, or hold your valuable first bid until there's a larger prize?

Or if Cat/Akua is capable of dividing up Night, the auction might be "pool the bids, and divide proportionally" rather than "highest bid takes all". In this case, there would be a point where after enough bids are made, the amount of Night gained is not enough to raise you out of the left-behind class and you're better off waiting for a less contested auction.

****** Exactly, she is building an army of loyal Super soldier sworn to her and bound to follow their oaths by winter, and when they die she can just retrieve their power and pass it to the generation, who will swear the same oaths as their predecessors.

Another question to ask is whether this is evil, my gut says it is, but when I consider it more I think that if she wasn't doing this than the Dwarves would just be curb stomping the lot of them and every semblance of their culture, she is instead recruiting those willing to serve in a way that would be productive and sustainable above, and giving them tangible benefits in return for their service.

*** Presumably they can't bid more than a lifetime of service in total, and they have Ivah to call bullshit of how long that is for a dow.

Additionally we know that not all night is created equal. (amount and utility of the skills it includes varies)

​

So the bidding probably works somewhat like a draft in that they're essentially taking turns. They will all end up sworn to Cat for a lifetime provided enough night goes up to auction, but the auction determines what they get and in what order they make their deal.

​

For personal bidding strategy, given that they're moving towards the center of the drow's power-base it's reasonable to expect that the night at auction is going to get better in future battles, and that they have more foes ahead than behind. So for now it'd be unwise to bid your whole allotment, unless you are that desperate, and just want to make sure you get in on the oath now rather than possibly missing out later when the more patent players start bidding more seriously. Unless a particularly choice bit of night comes up for auction, or they reach the tipping point where sigils start folding rather than fighting most drow probably won't want to bid their entire allotment on one auction.

Then maybe the mantle of the Sve Noc changed hands, of the Sve Noc changed their mind, and started encouraging the back-stabbing and what not... so now everyone's trying to take what exists, instead of making more, and it all goes to shit.

** So this was awesome, but I always feel like the other shoe is waiting to drop when things start going so well for Cat. Any thoughts on what that's going to be? Off the top of my head, potential issues (sooner or down the road) could include:

- Sve Noc is the biggest immediate issue. Cat's new army is being bound with oaths of both Night and Winter. That means Sve Noc withdrawing her power could shatter Cat's new forces, and significantly weaken the ones who remain. So Cat needs to recruit, dominate, or harvest Sve Noc for her power... and if drow culture is any indication, her morals are going to be a bit conflicting with Cat's. Each of those options has drawbacks - recruitment means Cat needs to offer Sve Noc something valuable. Domination means always having a dagger at her back, as betrayal is the bread and butter of the drow. And harvesting means Cat takes on Night, which she is (rightly) very reluctant to do.
- No matter how Sve Noc turns out, her power brings issues too. While the drow army isn't entirely Evil, it definitely has significant Evil parts to it. Which throws it back into the narrative flow and potentially calls for a bolstering of Good's forces in turn.
- Cat's drawing on Winter quite a bit, and that seems like it HAS to have large consequences at some point. On a more meta level, it brings Callow closer to Winter... who knows how that'll turn out. But it also means that Cat becomes less human, and even if she's shunting off the alienation for the most part, that will also have some effects on her minions. And it is pretty much stated as a certainty that Larat will eventually betray her, so that's a hurdle that will approach at some point. And then there's the deal with the seven crowns... what happens when she fulfills that? Does she lose Winter? Does she become Fae in truth? Or... what happens if she reneges?

Alternatively, the gloom doesn't and Cat finds herself having failed to fulfill her contract with the Dwarvs, or at least being held as having weasel-worded her way out of it and gaining resentment rather than respect from the dwarves as a result.
