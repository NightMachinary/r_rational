  .../give me your tired, your poor. Your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send them, your homeless, your tempest-tossed, to me./ And send them you do, a tide of humanity struggling toward our gates with a desperation that puts Ellis Island to shame, and we turn none back, nay, not even the meanest. Especially not the meanest.

...well played, Thamiel, well played.

** Man, this is a great universe to be a hippy.

Anyone working for The Man is literally in league with the devil, open-source software gives you superpowers, and all it takes is enough LSD to usher in a worker's paradise.

**** Pretty sure vegans were just name-dropped by Thamiel. He probably founded PETA to "raise awareness of healthy plant-based foods", in addition to the other meanings speculated.

** Anyone get the blind children bit? I got the Devil Went Down To Georgia reference, of course, and for the plant-based stuff I suspect it's a horrible pun on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_gluten_%28food%29][Seitan]], but I don't get the blind children bit.

**** Is there a specific instance in which Satan is supposed to be blinding children? The closest I can find is 2 Corinthians 4:4.

  In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

  You say we are your enemy, you hope it is true, but in your heart you know it is not. We are allies to each of you. Every time there is a protest to be crushed, you have called upon us for assistance. Every time there is an election to be won, you have turned to us for advice. Every time there is a war to fight, you have asked for our aid.
