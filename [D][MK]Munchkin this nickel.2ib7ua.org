Here's a nickel. You can, at any time, telepathically command it to return. It +returns+ disappears in one place and teleports to your right palm, tails down, at rest relative to your palm. The return is instantaneous, no matter where the nickel is. It therefore travels at infinite speed.

The nickel is not indestructible; it has physical properties similar to a regular nickel, and can be bent, cut, etc. However, whenever you call it, all of its atoms it will return in unharmed form, at 20 degrees celsius.

You otherwise have only what regular physics and technology as we know it can do.

How much power can you gain?


** Everyone's already going for high-concept stuff. Lemme try a few simple things.

- You can cheat vending machines and money-changer machines with it. Can't do it too much or else you get caught, but I imagine you might be able to make/save a few extra hundred dollars a year. Maybe more if you find a good place without surveillance.

- You can go to the James Randi foundation and use it to win the million dollar prize.

- If you press your palm flat against something, and then return the nickel to your palm, it should end up meshed in whatever you're touching. You could then rapidly teleport it over and over again, disrupting the chemical structure of whatever you're touching as the coin repeatedly tries to undo the changes to its structure. Probably a potent tool, that. Could drill through just about anything, given enough time. Not to mention the interesting potential for chemical reactions, depending on the structure it ends up forming.

** Dissolve it. Nickels are 75% copper and 25% nickel; they should dissolve in sulfuric acid, though I've never tried the experiment.

This will produce a solution of SO4^{2-} sulfate ions (how do you write that when Reddit doesn't do subscripts), and a mixture of Ni^{2+} and Cu^{2+} ions. The dissolution will also release a cloud of hydrogen gas.

I'm not really sure how the recall power will deal with the nickel being disassembled like that. I'm hoping for a lightning bolt, or maybe an explosion. Intuition says that I'd recall the exact particles that the nickel was originally made of, but electrons don't work like that. They're not tracked individually, two indistinguishable particles really are indistinguishable at the most fundamental level we know of. I could probably break quantum physics with this nickel, but I don't know enough to say how. (Also, experiment with FTL messaging, that's also potentially powerful.)

For an accidental version of the same phenomenon, allow the nickel to rust before recalling it.

Still, that's the best I can think of at the moment. Stealing money 5c at a time isn't very profitable. The coin isn't very useful as a tool, even accounting for the fact that I can access it after being thoroughly strip-searched (there's no time in my life where that would have been remotely useful).

******* So, I don't know whether this is deliberate, but there is literally no such thing as simultaneous events in relativity. What is simultaneous for you is not simultaneous for someone moving at high speed relative to you. So I'll assume that "the return is instantaneous" is from your POV. You could use this to make a time machine, but to send one bit to the past you'd need to do a relativistic flyby of the Earth so not very practical.

Using the 20 degrees you could heat or cool something to 20 degrees. Or rather you now have a theoretically perfect heat bath. Stave off the heat death of the universe, destroy some entropy!

You could create a reactionless drive by firing out the coin and resummoning it. This could help you with the time machine above. A rail gun could fire the coin quite fast at the cost of excess heat, but we do have an infinite heat reservoir.

Also, what happens to things in the way when it returns? Do the just disappear? What happens when you melt a normal coin and your coin together and then summon your coin back? You'd be left with a piece of metal with 50% vacancy spread evenly, I suspect that this would be like nanoporous carbon except with metal and be quite good at storing gasses. Though it may be better to mix it with something already used like metal hydrides.

** A modern nickel is 75% copper, 25% actual nickel, weighs 5g, has a value of $0.05, is 1.95 mm thick and 21.21mm in diameter, per [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_%28United_States_coin%29][wiki]].

Of these properties, the most straightforward to begin to abuse is its mass: drop it down a vacuum tube of arbitrary length, convert potential energy into kinetic and then into heat at the bottom, return to top where your palm is facing down for it to drop again. Breaking conservation of energy in this way is convenient, but not exactly groundbreaking.

Perhaps more powerful is its property to be transmuted in form and then reassume its original shape at a new location. You could, for example, melt it down, grind it up, distribute it in a food supply, then hold that population hostage to having the copper in their body forcibly ripped at high speed from their body.

** I think that the teleportation out of your palm is much more useful than bringing the nickel back to you.

A micro SD card is smaller than a nickel, so I could use it as better communication than other people have proposed by replacing the nickel with 64GB of data at the far end. This can be done with anything small or delicate as well. You can mail the nickel to another lab (without any special precautions) and swap it out for some cryogenically preserved biological samples once they're ready.

With constant/rapid commands, you might be able to scrape away material from any surface. Press you palm against a wall and summon the nickel. There will then be a nickel shaped hole in the wall, filled with the nickel. Next move your palm over a bit, and repeat. The first hole will still exist, but it will be filled with a nickel-shaped plug of material which can be easily removed. Repeat as often as you want for more holes.

IIRC, Gorilla glass works by swapping out sodium atoms for potassium in some complicated process, increasing strength. Find a process that can use this technique with nickel and/or copper, melt the nickel down, refine it etc, put a bit of the other metal (gold? palladium?) in your palm, then recall the nickel to swap out the atoms.

Essentially you can teleport anything you want into the space where the nickel was. It sounds like any fluid my cupped hand was holding, whether it be air, mercury, sulfuric acid, or (not a fluid) vacuum, would be sent off to where the nickel was. I'm not sure how I'd stick my hand in a vacuum yet but I'll revisit that later.

Now, the first thing I'd want to do is be able to put that nickel anywhere I wanted it quickly, so creating some kind of railgun type launcher that I could hold in my left hand would be needed. Now we could go one of two ways, which I will need a question answered. Either I replace the nickel mid-flight, or I replace the nickel after it has struck its target.

My first question would be: does all momentum on both nickel-sized collections of atoms cease upon the command? If I commanded the nickel to return in mid-flight while holding my right hand in a bowl of water, would the water be moving with the same velocity? Same momentum? Or zero velocity relative to my palm?

The atoms you exchanged for the nickel are given the coin's velocity (NOT its momentum) at the time it was exchanged. That means if the coin was on a rocket a .2 c (Bringing up its own problems, but look past them for a moment) and you summon it, the coin appears at rest in your palm, and the water appears in rocket, going at .2 c along with the rest of the ship.

If the coin disappears Bob-simultaneously with its reappearance then its reappearance should be in my future. I now know that the bad guys are attacking.

** If you melt down the nickel, use the result to create a hollow shell, then fill the shell with whatever substance you want, you can use it as an untraceable delivery for said substance. Probably nerve gas, if we're talking weapons. Or just use it as a stopper, for a larger quantity in a container. Or brown recluse spiders, if you want something exotic.

Another idea is to give a solution of the nickel to somebody, then see how it affects the body when removed. Repeated enough times could give a map as to how the body absorbs certain substances (Possible medical uses? I'm not certain there would be any benefit to this. Besides torture, since I can't see this being easy on the body. Actually, by varying the times you issue the return call, you can probably chart out the optimal times to return to get certain responses)

I can see the FTL signalling having some use as a single-shot undetectable communication for coordinating two groups without any visible interaction. Nickel disappearing is the go signal, and nothing was sent, so nothing can be intercepted. This would gain more usefulness in higher surveillance areas.

Definitely abusable. If you split your hand in two, and pull the two halves apart, the way I read this is that it would return instantly to the point halfway between. So it can be teleported into walls, and by spamming the return command, you could keep replacing nickel sized holes in the wall, until your through. So a perfect wall breaker if you can manage to get to any two equidistant points from that wall.

So If I define my palm as "my palm," and then cut it in half, do I now choose which of the halves is now "my palm"? What about my belief that "my palm" is in two pieces? I ask because the implications are fun. If I can change "my palm" between parts of whats was actually at one point my palm (to help with the actual belief part), you've got a network there. If you have to pick one half of the palm to become "my palm," does that mean if you subdivide further, you have to reassign, and on and on? Because eventually, you will get to a point where you have designated a single atom as "my palm." (At the cost of destroying the rest of your hand, but this is all theorycraft anyhow) And then by issuing a return command, you would be able to fix its position by returning the nickel to the center of that atom /by definition./ I'm not sure what Heisenburg would do about that.

My third point was supposed to imply the center point was moving slightly between return commands to burrow through the wall. My fault for lack of clarity on that one.

**** So... the most horrifyingly slow murder weapon? Throw coin, put hand to - let's say - victim's face/throat/skull, recall, repeat, rinse? Obviously could be a trivially stupid source of infinite kinetic energy/work/(entropy reversal), possibly something about clever use for electrolysis? That last usage could literally explode, unfortunately. It isn't clear what happens if the nickel is powdered/dissolved/annihilated, what with atoms not being labelled billiard balls and all.

** The return to 20c is abusable.

Have your hand surgically removed, place it with the coin in a specialised heat engine and spam the return command to generate electricity. Use this to generate actual power, or build a commercial empire around it to gain political power.

You could also abuse it to shed momentum for space travel, e.g. sever hand, attach to flywheel, get it moving arbitrarily fast with conventional power and them spam return for a zero-cost constant acceleration fuelless engine. Timing might be a problem, but you'd have to eperiment with that.

There are questions about what happens if the atoms of the coin no longer exist, eg if they're combined with antimatter. Also what happens if your palm is atomised over a wide area, does each surface atom of the palm get a corresponding coin atom, or is there a central atom? Also what happens to matter occupying the space when the coin teleports in? If its destroyed, then it could be used to cut hard materials.

*** The big problem is that the effect isn't really large enough. With a heat engine in your hand, you're generating power, but you're not generating /enough/ of it to really make a difference. It's got to be something like making pennies per hour - probably even less. It's the same issue with using the nickel to generate power by dropping it over and over - while you're getting out more than you put in, you're not getting enough out of it to really make it worthwhile.

If an atom of the nickel is made permanently destroyed, such that the components of the nuclei are made unfindable or destroyed, then a new atom is created or teleported in, similarly to the electrons from above.

#+end_quote

The nickel appears a little over a half a hand-depth over the center of your palm is, or the center of the components of your palm, if your palm happens to be over a large or oddly shaped area.

The atoms of air where above your palm are exchanged for the atoms of the nickel, unless your hand is closed, or a vacuum, in which case very small pockets of vacuum are placed where the nickel atoms were.

** - You could use it to create some sort of perfect vacuum in the shape of a nickel. Not sure what you could do with that...

- You could cool anything by repeatedly throwing the nickle into the hot substance and teleporting it out.

- If you had some sort of launching aparatus connected to your hand it could repeatedly throw the nickle down, up, or away exerting a force on you (might only be useful in zero g).

** Well...

*/You could use it to stop a nuclear reactor in meltdown : */

Reactor enters meltdown mode where the rods are overheating. A device is present that will quickly inject the nickel into the cooling water, preferably somewhere very very hot. Once in there, nickel 'instantly' absorbs heat. You summon the nickel back, which makes it arrive in your hand, at 20 degrees celcius, tails down. Your hand is on top of the nickel-injector, and the process repeats (thousands of times if necessary) until the reactor temp is low again.

*You could use it to propel a spaceship :*

Youre on a small spaceship with a bottle of LOX pointed out the back. LOX expands rapidly when heated, and is kept at extremely low temps. You insert the nickel into a slot, and the nickel enters the LOX bottle. Since the temp diff between the nickel and LOX is so high, some of the LOX boils off, creating pressure, which causes some of it to be pushed out the nozzle, at which point you have Newtons Lawed your spaceship forward. You then return the nickel to your hand, at 20 degrees and tails down, and repeat the process.

*You could disprove every theoretical physicist :*

You let the guys at CERN turn some atoms from your nickel into a teeny, tiny black hole. You then get those atoms back out of the black hole.

*You could cause huge bubbles in the ocean :*

You go on a cruise, and drop the nickel into a deep spot of the ocean. You wait for it to sink to a good depth. You then call it back. You just created a pressure drop that, if its replaced with the air that was just above your palm a second ago, makes a nickel sized bubble at whatever depth it was at. Since bubbles rise, and rising bubbles get bigger, 30 minutes later your ship gets capsized by a ginormous bubble. (someone do the math and tell us how big a bubble would be if one were formed near the bottom of the ocean) (This is assuming the pressure dosent just dissolve your bubble, Im not up to speed on the physics of gasses under pressure) (unless its taco night)

*You could validate satellite / spacecraft clocks timing to a very high degree.*

*You could punch someone /slightly/ harder than usual.*

*You could make a metal detector detect your 'empty' hand.*

*You could start a scam where you say 'you give 4 cents, and Ill give you a nickel' and make sweet, sweet pennies all day long on a street corner in NYC.*

Really theres not much you COULDNT do.....

*** I think the bubble would collapse under the pressure.

When a bubble is injected at the bottom of a tank, the air of the bubble is already at the pressure of the bottom of the tank, so as it rises, it's losing pressure but amount of gas molecules is the same, so it expands.

When you teleport a nickel-volume of sea-level air down, you've increased the pressure but not the number of molecules, so it will collapse, possibly dissolving entirely.
