Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

*** Audiobooks:

- Yuval Noah Harari's /Sapiens/ and /Homo Deus/: An excellent pair of books on the history of humanity and its potential future.
- Parag Khana's /Connectography/: Viewing the interactions of states based on borders is is obsolete; instead, look at their economic and social connections.
- Peter Frankopan's /The Silk Roads/: To go a step further, viewing state interactions through the lens of borders has always been limiting. History is more fun when you introduce economics.
- James SA Corey's /The Expanse/: Space opera meets detective novel on the edge of armageddon.

Podcasts:

- Revolutions: A historian covers several of the world's major revolutions in roughly chronological order, starting with the English Revolution in the 1600s and most recently taking on the Revolutions of 1848. Witty and intriguing throughout.
- The Methods of Rationality Podcast: You probably already know about this one; it started as a fan reading of HPMOR and has since turned into a bi-weekly podcast recording rationalist fiction. Their most recent large project was a rendition of Alexander Wales' /The Metropolitan Man/. Currently on hiatus, but there's a lot of content to delve into.

Lectures:

- The /Democracy at Work/ YouTube Channel: Not likely to be as popular here, but still interesting; Richard Wolff explains the economic theory of socialism and the failures of capitalism. The [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wkO3qsZY_U&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTNMCC0ypXHZ-kW7yCz4T0Zg][Online Lecture Series]] playlist is quite extensive.

*** The "strategy" for the Democratic Party is going to vary by congressional district. It will be set by candidates, not the party. People tend to misjudge what House of Representative races are like. It's not a top down party strat, it's bottom up from these small districts. Congressional districts tend to have about 700,000 people in them. Most of them don't have issues that cleave along Sanders vs Centrist lines. They are highly heterogenous. What might work in say, a more urban Colorado district wouldn't apply in, say...

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri%27s_4th_congressional_district][Missouri's 4th.]] Missouri's 4th congressional district had been held by the Democratic party since 1955. We held that seat for half of a century. Ike Skelton served as the congressman for that district for 17 terms, from 1977 to 2011. This guy voted with the Democrats on most issues, but on gun control, abortion, and DADT, he was conservative. He had a lot of support from the rural areas of his congressional district and was well liked by everyone.

#+begin_quote
  The district's population was 91 percent white (see Race and ethnicity in the United States Census); 85 percent were high school graduates and 17 percent had received a bachelor's degree or higher. Its median income was $42,317. In the 2008 presidential election the district gave 61 percent of its vote to Republican nominee John McCain and 38 percent to Democratic nominee Barack Obama. In 2010 the district had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+14.

  ...Skelton was re-elected in 2008 with 66 percent of the vote.
#+end_quote

This was a blue dog Democrat, the kind the Dems need a lot of to hold a majority in the House. But then, in 2010, The Tea Party came for him, and he was defeated. Now the seat is held by Vicky Hartzler, who is a birther, a climate skeptic, and against welfare programs like food stamps. Her constituents are okay with this somehow. She's popular and will be hard to unseat by any Democrat, unless things seriously go south and the district agitates for change.

It's tough to see where we go from here in Missouri's 4th. And there are a lot of districts like this. Not saying it's impossible, but it's gonna be hard. The local/state Democratic parties have their work cut out for them, both for winning state legislature and contesting house seats that the Republicans now have held for nearly a decade. However, the situation in California's 10th (which is generally a toss-up in most polls but Republicans have held for 4-6 years) is completely different.

Every race deals with a different constituency and a different set of candidates and issues. The California 10th cares a lot about water and certain social issues that just aren't important in Missouri's 4th. Race issues are completely different. Both are dealing with different levels of gov't money from the feds and from their own states, and have different levels of poverty, types of industry, etc. Both benefit differently from Obamacare, and have different exposure to illegal immigration, etc.

The idea that there should be a singular national policy that is more Bernie-like or more centrist is not entirely wrong, but is also basically wrong. There will be some national-level party guidance in the midterms, but congressional races are a lot more local than people think. There will be many Democrats running on many platforms, and not all of them will be taking their marching orders from Sanders or from the party.

It wasn't a super unreasonable idea to think "if Skelton doesn't vote for the ACA, he will be around to vote on other things" given that the Dems had held onto the district for half a century. And like, yeah, given what we know now, sure, this ended up causing him to lose, but he was not one of the "guys the Democrats threw under the bus" cause he was one the ones the were trying to save.

Assuming that voters can't see through tactics of that sort is exactly the kind of cynical thinking that led to this situation in the first place. And no, they weren't trying to save him. They were trying to save the district. Or do you really think they wouldn't have replaced him with a more liberal democrat if they thought such a candidate would be able to hold the seat?

Yes, it's a general characterization, and quite wrong in the particulars. I know this. However, in the context of this discussion, where the question is whether to move left and shore up the bernie base, or move center to shore up the moderate base, "spot on" would be a more accurate term.

Look, governmental policy doesn't happen in a vacuum. A party, having chosen it's policy preferences, tries to convince its base, and the rest of the population that those preferences are the best ones. In the Obama period, the Democratic party had political capital to spare, and they spent it to push the country left on a number of social issues, with significant successes in healthcare and gay-rights (successes with climate-issues and trans-rights have been more limited). Pushing the policy preferences of the whole country has a cost, and Democrats burnt through a lot of political capital doing so, far more than they expected, and they didn't so much move the country as the party itself (being a significant fraction of the country.)

Trump voters held rallies where they burned their MAGA hats after he announced he would sign a Dream Act into law. Studies have shown the rising popularity of fascist organizations in Europe correlates directly with the number of immigrants and refugees allowed into the country.

******* I don't think naturalization is a deal-breaker, it's just highly distasteful. If there's an opportunity to implement effective border control and a merit-based immigration system AND deport all of the illegals currently here, that's the best case scenario. But if the only way to convince everyone to agree to the border control and merit system is to also allow the illegals to stay, then I, and I think most Trump supporters, would reluctantly accept that deal.

The fact that a nonzero amount of Trump supporters are completely unwilling to compromise does not logically imply that all, or even most are.

I'm not sure why you bring up Europe, given that they have immigrants forming literal rape gangs, but it's certainly a good argument in favor of increased border control.

That was the excuse they gave, but evidence that's come up since the Rotherham scandal blew up suggests that it was a lie the police and council used to cover their own incompetence and disgusting attitudes towards the victims (e.g. calling 12-year old girls "slags" for being molested).

I'd also recommend watching The Betrayed Girls, the BBC documentary on Rotherham and similar scandals, and looking into the testimony of non-police investigators as well as that of victims of the gangs.

#+begin_quote
  The failure to address the abuse was attributed to a combination of factors revolving around race, class and gender---contemptuous and sexist attitudes toward the mostly working-class victims; fear that the perpetrators' ethnicity would trigger allegations of racism and damage community relations; the Labour council's reluctance to challenge a Labour-voting ethnic minority; lack of a child-centred focus; a desire to protect the town's reputation; and lack of training and resources.

  The government appointed Louise Casey to conduct an inspection of Rotherham Council. Published in January 2015, the Casey report concluded that the council had a bullying, sexist culture of covering up information and silencing whistleblowers, and was "not fit for purpose".

#+begin_quote
  The Pakistani community in Rotherham, and elsewhere in Britain, has not followed the usual immigrant narrative arc of intermarriage and integration. The custom of first-cousin marriages to spouses from back home in Pakistan meant that the patriarchal village mentality was continually refreshed.

  Britain's Pakistani community often seems frozen in time; it has progressed little and remains strikingly impoverished. The unemployment rate for the least educated young Muslims is close to 40 percent, and more than two-thirds of Pakistani households are below the poverty line.

  My early years in Luton were lived inside a Pakistani bubble. Everyone my family knew was Pakistani, and most of my fellow students at school were Pakistani. I can't recall a white person ever visiting our home.

  Rotherham has the third-most-segregated Muslim population in England: The majority of the Pakistani community, 82 percent, lives in just three of the town's council electoral wards. Voter turnout can be as low as 30 percent, so seats can be won or lost by a handful of votes --- a situation that easily leads to patronage and clientelism.

  If working-class British Pakistanis had been better represented in the groups that failed them --- the political class, the police, the media and the child protection agencies --- it is arguable that there would have been a less squeamish attitude toward the shibboleths of multiculturalism. British Pakistanis may be held back by racism and poverty, but by cleaving so firmly to outmoded prejudices and fearing so much of the mainstream culture that swirls around them, they segregate themselves.
#+end_quote

It sounds like a situation analogous to how American city planners specifically planned where impoverished ghettos of minorities would live and designed public transportation infrastructure with racial discrimination in mind. The criminals are still at fault for their crimes and the police should be held responsible for their failures, but prejudices engrained into mainstream culture and public institutions is what allowed such a horrible tragedy to occur in the first place.

I think this situation is an example of how white liberals can /horrifically/ fail at combating prejudice and discrimination, but more due to ignorance about the minorities they seek to represent and the problems that plague them. I don't blame political correctness for the damage done here, I blame the /failed implementation of it/. I still think public institutions need to be proactive in their defense of minority and immigrant communities from irrational ideas and people, without falling victim to irrationality themselves.

The Gatestone Institute has come under heavy criticism for bias in their reporting. Wikipedia references them publicizing debunked fake news like the "no go zones" story, association with public figures who explicitly "hate Islam", and a Google search showed a Breitbart (a site who's owners have spoken with pride about its association with white nationalism) article citing the Institute as a source. The Daily Mail, meanwhile, has been proven multiple times to spread fake news without fact checking first.

The articles you link unambiguously criticize multiculturalism and feminism, and dismiss the explanation of the statistical increase being due to a change in the legal definition of rape without any evidence. Peter M. Cloughin admits to being banned from Facebook and Twitter, has published books that explicitly deride Islam as a concept, and the advertisement for his book on the left of the page includes a quote of praise by white nationalist Richard Spencer.

I have enough reason to believe that the sources you cited have an islamophobic agenda that they are promoting. The claims they make are not trustworthy, so I see no evidence to indicate that governments are altering or ignoring crime statistics to promote a harmful agenda. However, I do believe that these sources are doing harm by promoting unjustified prejudice against Muslims, so they should not be treated as legitimate sources of empirical data or unbiased analysis.

You have done nothing to convince me that my current beliefs about this issue are incorrect and I will not change them until I have been presented with hard evidence that contradicts them. Until that time comes, I will continue to assume that people who make claims similar to this are some form of racist or xenophobic and view any tolerance of such unjustified beliefs as poisonous to civilized society.

This is not rational. I don't find the idea that 50% of the U.S. population being rampant bigots consistent with the reality I observe. The majority of people are relatively friendly and are a priory neutral on the issue of new people they meet, oppose racism, oppose sexism, etc. People disliking Islam is not equivalent to a bias against Islam, instead it comes from a shift that the evidence provides. Islamic countries are more likely to be awful and oppressive places, check. Islam creates more terrorists than other cultures or religions, check. Islam promotes the oppression of women, check. These facts are common knowledge.

Given these observations, it is rational to shift your opinion of Islam negatively compared to your prior you would have of some random religion you know nothing about. Many people conclude that Muslims are more likely to be dangerous than non-Muslims, in the same way they would conclude that sharks are more likely to be dangerous than chipmunks. It's not "Islamophobia", it's observing reality and acknowledging that it exists. This doesn't mean you should discriminate against Muslims, especially ones who have adopted Western culture and values and aren't bigots. But to leap from "not all Muslims" to "there is no correlation" is blatantly ignoring what Islam actually teaches. I will reiterate: the vast majority of ill-will towards Islam is deserved and based on observation, not prejudice.

Additionally, when a claim is made that Muslims are raping women, it is rational to give this claim a higher likelihood of being true than a claim of other religions or groups such as race doing the same, because Muslims treat women as less valuable than men. It is consistent with the other observations. It doesn't make it automatically true, but anyone who dismisses it outright without some good evidence against it is clearly biased.

I don't see how Western Muslims who've grown up in a western society behaving with western values is a good predictor of new refugees who want to implement Sharia Law:

[[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law]]

Sharia law is sexist, homophobic, and not compatible with western society. Maybe the best common ground is to make the distinction between progressive Muslims who are willing to adapt to Western society and culture and obey the laws of the land they reside in, and radical Muslims who commit terror attacks, follow Sharia Law, oppress women and homosexuals, or approve of and desire to implement those things. Because most of the people arguing for Islam are thinking about the former, and most of the people arguing against it are thinking about the latter. We should let in good!Muslims and treat them like ordinary people, we should shun bad!Muslims and let them live in their own countries where they can live in their own culture and won't be offended by things like bacon or dogs or a woman's legs that they'll inevitably encounter if they live in ours.

  First of all, any mainstream Islamic religious scholar will tell you that there is no sin­gle monolithic definition of Sharia as it exists today any­where in the world. Very generally speaking, the concept of Sharia has come to be defined as “the ideal law of God according to Islamic tradition,” according to Professor Intisar Rabb, director of the Islamic Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School. But as Professor Rabb has also made clear: “Sharia has tremendous diversity... It is not a monolithic doctrine of violence, as has been character­ized in the recently introduced [anti-Sharia] bills that would criminalize [basic Islamic] practices” like charity-giving and other benign legal matters like divorce and estate planning. Professor Rabb has also noted that Sharia “historically was a broad system that encompassed ritual laws, so in some ways it recalls Jewish law that has rules for how to pray, how to make ablution before prayers” as well as dietary rules involving kosher (or halal) food.

  “Some of the biggest misconceptions about Islamic law are that it proposes a scheme of global domination,” Imam Zaid Shakir, a cofounder of Zaytuna College in Berkeley, California---the first Muslim liberal arts college in America---explained during an interview for my latest book. He also pointed out that many Westerners mistakenly believe that Islamic law is not amenable to change in the face of changing circumstances, that it is a system that oppresses women and that by definition it is an enemy of western civilization. In fact, he stated that Islamic law actually categorically forbids many of the practices that the average person fearfully associates with some Muslims today, like killing innocent people (non-Muslims and Muslims alike) and stoning women.

#+begin_quote
  But sharia isn't even “law” in the sense that we in the West understand it. And most devout Muslims who embrace sharia conceptually don't think of it as a substitute for civil law. Sharia is not a book of statutes or judicial precedent imposed by a government, and it's not a set of regulations adjudicated in court. Rather, it is a body of Koran-based guidance that points Muslims toward living an Islamic life. It doesn't come from the state, and it doesn't even come in one book or a single collection of rules. Sharia is divine and philosophical. The human interpretation of sharia is called “fiqh,” or Islamic rules of right action, created by individual scholars based on the Koran and hadith (stories of the prophet Muhammad's life). Fiqh literally means “understanding” --- and its many different schools of thought illustrate that scholars knew they didn't speak for God.

  While it's true that many majority-Muslim societies have laws that treat women unfairly, many of these laws, like Saudi Arabia's ban on female drivers, have no basis in fiqh. In instances where there is a fiqh origin for modern legislation, that legislation often cherry-picks certain rules, including more woman-affirming interpretations. And on a range of issues, Islam can fairly be described as feminist. Fiqh scholars, for instance, have concluded that women have the right to orgasm during sex and to fight in combat. (Women fought alongside the prophet Muhammad himself.) Fiqh can also be interpreted as pro-choice, with certain scholars positing that although abortion is forbidden, first-trimester abortions are not punishable.

  To be sure, there are patriarchal rules in fiqh, and many of these are legislated in modern Muslim-majority countries. For example, women in Iran can't run for president or attend men's soccer matches. But these rules are human interpretations, not sharia.

  In the same way that the Ku Klux Klan's tactics are a poor representation of Christian practice (despite its claims to be a Christian organization), the Islamic State is the worst place to look to understand what sharia says about punishment and the treatment of innocents and prisoners. It's true that sharia permits harsh corporal punishment, including amputation of limbs, but fiqh restricts its application. Theft, for example, doesn't include anything stolen out of hunger or items of low value. (That piece of fruit Jasmine “stole” in “Aladdin” certainly wouldn't qualify.) Adultery? Yes, corporal punishment for extramarital sex is Koranic in origin, but it comes with an extremely high evidentiary burden of proof: four eye-witnesses. It's a sin but not one that is the business of the state to punish.

  The Koran repeatedly commands Muslims to keep promises and uphold covenants. That includes treaties among nations and extends to individuals living under non-Muslim rule. Muslims have lived as minorities in non-Muslim societies since the beginning of Islam --- from Christian Abyssinia to imperial China. And fiqh scholars have always insisted that Muslims in non-Muslim lands must obey the laws of those lands and do no harm within host countries. If local law conflicts with Muslims' sharia obligations? Some scholars say they should emigrate; others allow them to stay. But none advocate violence or a takeover of those governments.

  There is no evidence that Islamic law is encroaching on our courts. On the contrary, the court cases cited by anti-Muslim groups as purportedly illustrative of this problem actually show the opposite: Courts treat lawsuits that are brought by Muslims or that address the Islamic faith in the same way that they deal with similar claims brought by people of other faiths or that involve no religion at all. These cases also show that sufficient protections already exist in our legal system to ensure that courts do not become impermissibly entangled with religion or improperly consider, defer to, or apply religious law where it would violate basic principles of U.S. or state public policy.

That's the point I was making: you started talking about Islam, he drew the argument toward the original point that Islam was brought up in, politics, and if you wanted to stay away from any political or real world outcomes from your discussion on Islam, that was your time to say "Well that's outside my area of expertise, I was just clarifying this one point on Islam."

If you don't want to talk about Trump, fine, don't do it. But your very labels here, "Trump obsessed people" and "feral fanatics" are insulting. You are placing these labels on others due to opinions they have that you then say you have no interest in engaging in. That's not respectful dialogue, regardless of what your personal experiences have been.

Consider how /Republicans/ feel right now: they have one of theirs in the Oval Office, and majorities in both chambers. Still, they can't repeal Obamacare, build a wall, or lower taxes. Cronyism and nepotism still reign in DC, the revolving door is alive and well, and the people writing the laws are still those with the most the gain. None of the stated policy objectives of the American right are coming to be.

#+end_quote

Also, your perception of the GOP appears to be more than a bit skewed. In what follows, when referring to "the GOP", I mean party leaders, office holders, and influential conservative think tanks. I am willing to grant this point as obvious to anyone with a brain: Trump panders to fascists and racists. However, the rest of the GOP does not (or at least makes an effort to not be seen to do so). This is distinct from saying that people of questionable morals agree with various policy proposals: one can desire a Wall for many reasons, only one of which is racism. As far as I can tell, most of the GOP loathes Trump and would replace him with Pence if they possibly could. The GOP does not want an authoritarian leader. More importantly, they don't want an embarrassing leader. And I believe if there are sufficient grounds to impeach Trump, the GOP will do so; maybe not easily, as doing so would inflict very real wounds on the party, but I think they will do so.

--------------

I sounds like your real goal is to live in a safer country. I can get behind a certain amount of obstructionism. The GOP was routinely lambasted in the media for being obstructionist during the Obama years (specifically 2011-2016), and with good reason. And in truth, the opposition party often earns the moniker. I agree that less powerful presidents would be good for the country. But I think it would be much more meaningful to discuss actual policy goals than obstructionism in general.

Congress should reign in the president, passing (or repealing) laws so as to reduce the powers of the executive. Wartime powers should be rescinded when we're not actually at war, and limited in scope when we are.

On the other hand, pushing for impeachment is likely to be costly, and unlikely to work.

What we should actually discuss is which policies are doing harm to national security, and what we can do about them in particular.

  however, this person makes no bones about correcting others. and if this person demands others to pass fact check procedures on his statement (confirming he didn't do that by himself in the beginning), that's an extreme example of disrespect to any opponent.

You're not in a courtroom. You asked for a source, Daystar gave one, even though you didn't give any source for your own claim. He wasn't trying to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his thesis was true, he was exposing his opinion; maybe he wasn't exposing his opinion in the most neutral/objective/humble way, but again, neither were you.

#+begin_quote
  honestly, i don't see how politeness/niceness/cheerfulness could have helped here, if one person has granted himself a privilege not to check statements, he sells here as proven facts.
#+end_quote

Look, I've been there.

You understand something, other people don't, so you correct them, and then they just keep saying the same things you just corrected. I've been on that side of the fence. And in hindsight, I'll say it: I'm ashamed of past!me, because past!me was a fucking asshole.

When you say stuff like "Updated: Ops, I've just found that I'm the second person who found a false dilemma in your reasoning"; if you're right, you sound like a complete jerk; if you're wrong, you /are/ a complete jerk. And sometimes you're wrong. Sometimes you think someone is making a fallacious argument, but the truth is you don't understand what they said.

You don't insult people who disagree with you because sometimes you're really sure you're right and you're wrong anyway, and sometimes the people you insult are right.

Aside from that, when you're unpleasant to someone, they become more defensive, more aggressive, and less rational; less likely to communicate clearly, less willing to consider your ideas, etc. I know that from personal experience: people are more honest to honest discussion when you don't attack them; that includes passive-aggressive stuff, and clever remarks like "how look, binary opposition, I expected better from this subreddit".

great, that you understand how this spiral of misunderstanding works. this is my first post here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/70vl9f/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dn8qrr1/]]. am i agressive? am i unpleasant? not neutral? i said that both parties are right, and warned about danger of zero-win approach.

*trekie140* replied with insults into someone i don't know. and no, even if he doesn't call /me/ an ignorant racist, it's still a highly toxic approach, which hinders discussion. and this is what i pointed here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/70vl9f/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dn9551x/]]

calling opponents, who even not present here to defend themselves, ignorant or racists or evil or having no moral ground is not ok. it is a disturbing and threatening sign of witchhunting and dehumanization. if the approach /others but us are immoral ignorant racists/ is not how binary mindset looks like in real life, i don't know whether such phenomenon exists at all.

if this community is ok about naming others immoral evil ignorant whoever and gives priority to staying pleasant with each other only, it is a valuable lesson for me to learn.

"catching him in the act" doesn't imply i'm going to call the police or raise a shaming campaign. it's like seeing someone to put a hand into your purse. better to make a mental note that it might happen and keep a safe distance.

about not giving any source: what source should it be? the source about ISIS not created in 1999? or the source when ISIS was created? how can my source help if a person refuses to read even his own source? look. we didn't talk about the conflict of sources: his source says one date and mine says another. the problem is he provided no source. he didn't check what he sent. you didn't check what he sent. because if you have done that, you'd see that wikipedia provide no reference about this date.

and yes, i'm disappointed. we do not speak about what is facts at the moment, how to find better sources, how to optimize fact checking, what is the most common gaps in this kind of procedures. we do not speak about truth and how to find it. we waste time on talking how to sound nice and pleasant in the circumstances, already far from nice and pleasant: "Delivering a difficult message is like throwing a hand grenade. Coated with sugar, thrown hard or soft, a hand grenade is still going to do damage."

UPDATED: we got a conflict when the issue is not about something big like personal beliefs or faith or moral principles which can hardly be safely addressed. we have a situation when the request of fact checking and not calling others ignorant evil bastards led to discussion about manners. in real life, such incident implies an uninvited guest's interference into a private party. good that it's happened before emotional attachment to the community. i understood my mistake, and will not come back here, my messages and posts will be removed within the coming week.

******************* good link.

i understand your point better than it might seem. and here is something you might have missed regarding why being abrasive is an amazing tool.

first, it saves resources. all that sweet dancing around takes time reading and writing. and this is what companies pay for to their employees in customer service. not for resolving issues but for imitation of sincere respect.

second, it's water fast. "wikipedia is not a source and you're ignorant not to know that" has no double edge while "I don't think your source is valid, do you have another?" opens doors to "why not? why are you biased against wikipedia? because it doesn't support your point? why do you reject my source? ok, i have another source - link to any random website. what? you don't like that too?" if a person proudly provides a link to wikipedia as a source, without a single attempt even to read his own "source", his participation in the discussion has no value.

third, are you aware about the concept of speed dating? men and women have 5 minutes to estimate whether they want to continue communication. so doesn't matter what they are talking about, in reality, they check all those tiny details - clothes, way of smiling, laughing, etc. the same with communities. one-two effective interactions with core members of the community predict its general quality very well. and this interaction felt like a clubbish set. that's why i have removed all my messages from here.

four, abrasive language is a perfect screen tool. it's internet, we don't know each other, whatever conflicts or insults we have here, that means nothing in real life. so if a person takes abrasive language /personally/, s/he is not particularly smart. if a person can't acknowledge "two times two equals four, stupid!" because of the word "stupid", this person more likely takes in "two times two equals five", wrapped in appealing courtesies.

five, abrasive language helps in screening middle class from labor. historically, sweet manners were the main tool of elites to control and discipline its own members. "a gentleman must be respectful to other gentleman, because they're equal". so its one hand rubs another mentality which originates from the clique and vertical type of their network. low classes, in contrast, don't need that because their network is horisontal. so by default, everyone treats each other neutrally, and the ability to "bite the bullet"/"put the money where your mouth is" is highly valued. their approach is "either pay to me for being polite with you or prove you're worthy of my respect".

sorry for nerdistry.

#+end_quote

Yeah, but those are all good questions. Just saying "you're ignorant" doesn't cut them out. If you have standards you'd like to apply for source-quoting, the reasonable thing to do is to explain what standards you want, and why you want them; which opens the door to the other person going "Hum, maybe you're right, maybe I should research it more", or "No, actually, this is a valid source, and here's why". Saying "you're ignorant" cuts both these options off.

Also, to repeat my earlier point, you're not always right. You're not Doctor House or Rick Sanchez. Sometimes you're wrong about stuff, and you don't realize it. Or you 50% right, or you're 80% right and the other people see the 20%. Real life is complicated, and you can't boil it down to "If you can't see the truth, you're not worth talking to".

********* I will grant that a list of bullet points without any explanation barely qualifies as reasons. I do not mean, with these points, to say that Obama was responsible. He did not create any of these situations. Saying that no evidence of wrongdoing could be found misses the point entirely. It was the handling of each of these that was bad. Obama regularly showed poor judgement (according to those on the right) in how he approached and handled foreign powers, especially those that are antagonistic toward American interests. A president that bows to foreign dictators (as seen from very early days of his presidency) is someone who it would seem is putting the country at risk.

It is not outrageous to say that the world became more dangerous under Obama's time in office, though we could debate the particulars of the claim forever. The fact that it is possible to debate proves the point.

--------------

Now I ask in turn: how is Donald Trump's wielding of power putting the nation at risk? (Please do not take this question as rhetorical denial: I have no love of Trump, nor desire to defend the man. I just want to know that these criticisms are well-founded rather than knee-jerk reactions to a political loss.)

Most were handled fine: not perfect, perhaps, but certainly not to the point that made America less safe.

Obama was not a perfect president, he made a lot of decisions I disagree with. But the majority of Republican perspective of him has been shaped by an unending stream of baseless accusations, exaggerations, or outright falsehoods.

Let's step through these, then.

Fast and Furious

- The executive acted in a way that hid information, and prevented congress from finding out what happened. Claiming executive privilege was exactly the wrong thing to do. Obstruction eroded public faith in the president, and made Americans feel less safe.

Libya

- It was exactly Obama's refusal to take the lead that led to the half-assed international response that we got. In the aftermath, this same attitude led to the Muslim Brotherhood taking power, leading to a more dangerous world. I know it's not fair to second guess a president from years later, but a certain amount of criticism is justified.

Benghazi

- Obama owns this mess. He may not have been personally making decisions that led to what happened, but it was his administration that screwed up, and he who denied all blame. He, and his administration, engaged in a deliberate campaign to deceive the public. The fact that he did not personally tell a provable falsehood does not excuse his deceptions. The fact that american citizens died demonstrates that the world had become less safe for Americans.

ISIS

- +Obama personally founded the Islamic State in Syria and the Levant+ wait, what? That's our standard now? Of course Obama wasn't responsible for ISIS. However, by leaving a power vacuum in Iraq, the expansion of the Islamic State was inevitable. And again, the administration's response to the rise of ISIS did nothing to help. This is another of those situations that is easy to second guess in hindsight; however, there were plenty of warnings in advance that abandoning our allies in Iraq would have disastrous consequences.

Iran

- Yes, the nuclear agreement. I understand that congress made the agreement possible, due to their feeling that something needed to be done, even if they couldn't reach a consensus as to what. But why, WHY let Iran continue developing a nuclear program? For what reason does this oil-rich nation need nuclear power?! This nation that is sitting a stones throw away from Israel, which they have vowed to wipe off the map? Of course they're abiding by the nuclear agreement! By following it, they'll have nuclear weapons in only a few years! (And money! We gave them money to fund their program, too!)

Iran

- Let me reiterate this one, because reasons. Chuck Schumer famously studied the agreement in detail, and concluded that he must vote against it. He then proceeded to convince the rest of the senate Democrats to vote in favor of it. What the hell?

--------------

As for Trump, I think we'll see his first test shortly, with North Korea. No matter what he does, I'm sure he'll attract criticism, much of it fair. However, I don't think ISIS propaganda is a fair criticism. We could discuss this point further, as it gets quite complicated. DACA: why do we have non-citizen soldiers? Again, there are points on either side and we could debate. As for classified information: screw Trump. Yeah, he deserves the criticism. However, while holding him accountable for his past actions, is it possible that a future change in behavior could restore our allies faith? That is, could the damage to US security be reversed? Or is Trump necessarily toxic?

It's well documented. The administration straight up blamed a filmmaker. I was paying attention, and I saw the excuses unfold in real time! I recall seeing Mitt Romney debate the point with Obama, and Candy Crowley shooting him down. She'd been fed the transcript of Obama's speech made the day after, and lied to protect Obama. I recall watching news channels pore over that same speech the next day looking for what Candy saw. And it turned out that Obama did mention terrorism in the speech, in an entirely incidental manner. You cannot change the facts of this matter by wishful thinking.

But the lies aside, we were discussing national security: protection for the Benghazi embassy was the responsibility of Secretary Clinton, and of the Obama administration. That they did not provide adequate security is self-evident. Questions of wrongdoing do not factor in: they did the wrong thing regardless.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe Bush shouldn't have signed that agreement then.
#+end_quote

As you say, while the decision to end the war was Bush's, the details were up to Obama, and /he should have renegotiated in the face of changing circumstances/. I know there were political realities in Iraq that I am not qualified to understand, but he should have done something difficult instead of what was easy. Did he make sure that the new government had the tools and allies it needed to face an existential threat? Self-evidently, no. I cannot argue that he wielded power in such a way as to harm US interests as that he failed to use the power he had to protect US interests. It's a small distinction, but the former is treason while the latter is merely neglect.

His verifiable actions (cancelling public appearances) were those of a politician more concerned about re-election and political power than about outcome: he comes out looking like the worst kind of dishonest politician.

If it seems like I'm beating the Iran drum here, I am. This is the main positive action Obama took that harms US security. You may disagree. Quite a few senators did as well. A majority of senators agreed with me, some of them Democrats. I don't think it's outrageous to say there is room for legitimate debate on this point. Furthermore, [[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1191/text][HR 1191]] is problematic for two reasons: 1) it unconstitutionally ceded the senate's treaty power, and 2) Obama didn't follow the terms of the law with regards to the JCPOA (he was required to give all relevant information and documents to congress but did not). A strong case could be made for treason by Obama for entering the US into the JCPOA and releasing funds to Iran, a terrorist state. This was an impeachable offense, and I consider it a tragedy that he will never face justice for it. That he /felt/ it was "best" is not relevant. He lacked the authority.

Second, even if that's not true, what, so we get to decide which countries join the nuclear age because they MIGHT use the centrifuges in a way that develops nukes? If the US is going to crown itself hegemon then we should hold a parade first so everyone knows exactly what we're doing and why...

In fact, flipping it around in another direction, maybe he IS a dishonest politician in the other direction, and didn't actually think it was a bad outcome but said he did and voted against it without whipping against it because he wanted to be on the record as against it for political reasons (meaning to get more support from his voting base). I don't see how one judgement is more fair than another if one starts from a neutral position on the nuclear deal itself.

I argue elsewhere in this thread that Trump is more of an independent candidate than Republican. It's a tragedy for the Republican party that he was their nominee. The biggest partisan action he's taken was to nominate Gorsuch to the court, and I think that more more a matter of the political necessity of keeping one of his main campaign promises than anything else. (Remember that a lot of Republicans held their nose and voted for him solely because of the supreme court vacancy.) Other than that (and some fights over cabinet positions), Trump has been doing his level best to anger and frustrate everybody.

  The USA is not the world police and should not want to be.
#+end_quote

It seems to me this is where left and right diverge on foreign policy. Conservatives claim that the US has moral superiority, and a responsibility to judge when foreign powers act in bad ways. i.e., the US is, and should be, the world's policeman. Yes, I know about the UN, and various coalitions of nations. I know it's complicated. It was much easier to justify during the soviet era, where there was a mindset of an "us against them" zero sum battle for the future of the world going on.

The fact is that most nations get along well enough. They have open and honest elections, don't imprison or kill their political dissidents, and don't launch missiles across their borders and into other countries. Even monarchy's and dictatorships are fine as long as they don't do the last two. But why do we tolerate the existence of a country like North Korea? From a rationalist perspective, this seems insane. Can one can read /Three Worlds Collide/ and not imagine North Korea as the baby killers? Is it really rational and moral to do nothing and let them continue on as they have?

*** The reason the Democratic Party turnout in 2016 was so low was because they weren't different enough from the Republicans and the status quo.

Obviously, that may seem odd - why would anyone vote Republican just because the Democrats aren't different enough from them? It should be like guessing how many jelly beans are in a jar. If the Republicans guess 2,850 and it seems a little too far, then the Democrats can guess 2,849 and they'll be sure to win, right?

Except, elections aren't like that. Election day is not a national holiday. Some people have to choose between voting and paying their bills. For everyone who would otherwise have the day off, they still need to have enough motivation to go to the polls rather than do whatever it is they do to relax and have fun. If the Democrats hug themselves right up next to the Republicans, most people to the right still vote Republican, some moderates vote Democratic, and a ton of people to the left say "Fuck it" and don't make the effort to go and vote.

In 2008, 69 million people voted for Obama, and 60 million people voted for McCain. In 2016, 66 million people voted for Hillary, and 63 million people voted for Trump. Notice how the Democratic votes went down by 3 million while the Republican votes went up by the same amount between those two elections.

In both elections, Democrats got the votes of 90% of their registered voters, and Republicans got 89% of theirs. However, independents went 52-44 in favor of Obama in 2008, and then 48-42 in favor of Trump in 2016. Independents are obviously the ones shaking things up here, but what we do know about them?

When looking at political leaning instead of party affiliation, we see another story. Liberals voted 89-10 in favor of Obama in 2008, then 84-10 in favor of Clinton in 2016. Conservatives voted 78-20 in favor of McCain in 2008, then 81-15 in favor of Trump in 2012. Moderates voted 60-39 in favor of Obama in 2008, then 52-41 in favor of Clinton in 2016. Clinton lost 4% of her support with liberals, 8% with moderates and 5% with conservatives in comparison to Obama. Meanwhile, Trump succeeded by gaining 3% increased support from Conservatives and a 2% increase in support from moderates.

A few important points to note: while Hillary lost 8% of moderates, only 3% of them voted for Trump. Similarly, while Hillary lost 5% of conservative votes, Trump only gained 3% of them. Hillary even lost 4% of liberal votes, even though Trump gained 0% with them. All of those missing votes represent people who still voted, they just voted 3rd party rather than going for Hillary or Trump. That represents a significant bloc of voters across the political spectrum who were happy with what Obama offered but disappointed with Hillary. To recruit those voters, you'd need a message closer to Obama's. Not more of the same (e.g. bland continuation of the Clinton dynasty), but significant changes for the better.

The rules /are/ inconsistent and confusing. The Democrats use a system of super-delegates that explicitly gives the party office holders more control than individual voters, while the Republican party does not.

There are two other significant entwining factors that impact a candidates chances of winning: donations and polling. The more money they raise, the bigger a campaign they can run, and the more name recognition they'll receive, causing them to poll better. Similarly, polling well encourages supporters to donate to a successful candidate, increasing their odds of winning, while polling poorly discourages people from supporting a lost cause. All of which happens in the context of a broader political debate (and official televised debates).

  Hmmm. So, a large, corporate client can exert significant influence on the race with a large, early donation. I don't think this is a great thing.
#+end_quote

It's not as bad as it sounds. While the ability to bring in cash is important, it's not a deciding factor. Mostly because voters aren't as stupid as we sometimes pretend they are. If campaign spending was that significant, Jeb Bush would currently be president. However, despite his early massive fundraising, he couldn't get his campaign off the ground (probably because his name was toxic to voters who would not have a third Bush in the White House).

The biggest effect of early cash outlays is to bring a candidate before the public eye in order to be judged by the public. It's like how advertising doesn't make you buy things, but presents you with the option so you can decide if you want to.

To summarize, there are detrimental effects of big money in politics, but it's not as bad as it sounds.

  And this is a terrible thing. Your electoral system is set up in such a way that deliberately increasing the odds of a poor choice winning will look like a good idea to voters at a certain stage of the process?
#+end_quote

It's a very bad thing, but not usually a problem. Most voters understand that voting for the weakest candidates in this manner causes everyone to lose. Most people are content to stick with a party affiliation and vote for candidates they actually like or agree with. It just /feels/ better to vote for someone you like than to vote for someone you can't stand for strategic reasons, even if it's hard to explain the logic at the time. This phenomenon mostly becomes a problem when voters start feeling partisan urges that bring on irrational behavior. Let's just say that 2016 was a strange year.

** tl;dr: Thoughts on a worldview subsystem that replaces morality and ethics, invitation for discussion.

--------------

The idea is that when one has to make a decision or a moral judgement, they disregard the morality and decide what to do based on the predictions of likely rewards and punishments for their person, their goals, their values, etc. In this system, there are no objectively valid laws or moral truths that need to be followed just because, as axioms. There are only various fractions (e.g. governments, subcultures, etc) and phenomena (e.g. forces of nature, one's own human psychology, etc) that need to be accounted for because they will punish or reward the decision maker based on the latter's decisions.

So, for instance:

- one doesn't steal 1) because of the likely punishments from the fractions “government\law enforcement”, “previous owner”, “public”, etc; 2) because stealing will gradually lead to developing a bad personality --- with “bad” being defined as ineffective and unsustainable in long-term; 3) (optional, would depend on one's goals and values) because stealing would harm others (empathy), harm the society in general (game theory, society-without-theft being seen as a value, etc); 4) etc;
- one doesn't flash all the money they have on their person while outside because of the likely punishment from the fractions “thieves\pickpockets\etc”;
- one doesn't walk home alone while wearing a revealing dress because of the likely punishment from the fraction “rapists”.

Also note that some terms that would be heavily relied upon in a morality system become obsolete, meaningless, or blurry enough to be unusable in this one. Among such terms possibly are: right\wrong, fault, blame, crime, sin, revenge, right, privilege, etc.

- So, for instance, when the possible decision of walking home alone at night is being discussed, it should be irrelevant whether or not the person has a /right/ to walk home or not. What should be considered instead is the possible consequences. They base their decision on whether or not they are willing to take the risk of potentially being assaulted. They can also take further actions (e.g. through political activism, which would essentially be siccing the fraction “law enforcement” on the fractions “thieves” and “rapists”) to lower the risks involved with walking home.
- When being wronged by someone, it should be meaningless to regard possible /revenge/ as something related to morality. Instead, one can 1) think how to prevent such punishments happening against their person in the future (in which case the demonstration of revenge itself could possibly be one of the solutions, as a future repellent) 2) (based on values) try to get their revenge anyway but only seeing it as the final reward itself, 3) (based on values) try preventing them from acting in the similar manner against others in the future.
- When a corporation is lobbying to deny climate change or is dumping toxic waste into the environment, it's irrelevant whether or not the worsening ecology is the /fault/ of such corporations. Instead, what should be considered is how to change the country's\world's economical\political systems in such a way that it will no longer be profitable for corporations to harm the ecosystem. Similar examples with privacy laws, internet laws, politicians, etc.

I guess in that manner you could even classify it as ethical egoism, with the egoist agent potentially having a vast array of things included in the domain of their self-interest (e.g. the above-mentioned utopian society as a value to strive towards).

And also, if you defined consequentialism in the Hollywood supervillainy type of “ends-justify-the-means” manner, it wouldn't be what I had in mind because the means themselves are also part of the consequences.

***** My personal philosophy has always, as far as I can remember, been something I'd never seen anywhere, that I'd call "pure consequentialism" (but "basically consequentialism" is a cool name too).

My intuition on the subject is: "I do things that make things better, and I don't do things that make things worse; I define 'better' and 'worse' through empirical observation and evidence gathering". In other words, first I figure out what makes people happier or healthier or less miserable, and then I make rules around that, not the other way around.

I think consequentialism works best as a pure rejection of arbitrary rules, not as any particular set of rules. I'm consequentialist because forbidding gay relationships because "it's impure" is bullshit, and because I want government policy to be based on whether or not it's going to work; I'm not consequentialist because I believe in any specific happiness aggregation function.

Basically, I think the essence of consequentialism is to believe not in the letter of moral rules, but in their spirit.

  revenge
#+end_quote

You could try preventing further negative actions against your person by taking revenge upon those who have already committed such actions, but in the bigger picture this would likely not be the most efficient way of doing things.

The future assailants may not even learn about your act of revenge, or they may not care about it, or something else.

And even if the situation's happening in an environment where all your actions will become known to all relevant agents, then maybe your intimidation will work but still not be the best solution to the problem. E.g. 1) there might've been some other, more efficient ways of ensuring that nobody tries to wrong you in the same manner again or 2) the intimidation itself can have other negative results (e.g. an even further escalation).

Ultimately, when you strip the sense of gratification that you'd receive from the act of revenge itself, as a solution the revenge will often turn out to be a subpar solution. So, in this case what I meant was: take revenge if you're valuing the sense of gratification it will provide highly enough, but don't take it pretending that it'll be the best solution to your problem because likely it won't. Something like that.

#+begin_quote
  blame
#+end_quote

If what you're facing is a systematic problem, no matter how much you blame (or even punish) the agents who are just following the rules of that system, the problem will continue to persist until the system itself has been sufficiently changed. So, for example, you could even change the system to have heavy incarceration for all kinds of minor crimes, and it would even change things to a certain degree. It just wouldn't be the more efficient solution --- compared, for example, to altogether eliminating the need for all those minor crimes, and so on.

Certainly, revenge tends to be suboptimal in most situations, but you cannot simply discard the option. If vengeance truly solved nothing, then all countries' laws and courts are meaningless. After all, our justice system is essentially regulated vengeance. It is a revenge system that is carefully regulated to both deter would-be offenders and cripple (fine/imprison/hang) offenders so it is harder for them to offend again.

Same reasoning applies here. Blame is a suboptimal solution in many cases, but cannot be disregarded.

- 3) eventually, the objectively better\best solution should be chosen, which will most likely not be the solution of revenge. And if, once you've made sure your emotions aren't influencing you to make a biased judgement, analysing all the available options still shows that path of revenge will be the most effective, then that's just what it is and you proceed with revenge because it's the best option you have --- not because you see the act of revenge as some sort of moral obligation or because you are deceiving yourself because of being influenced by your emotions, etc.

So depending on the definition I'd say the justice system is operating through punishments and maybe vengeance, but not revenge. They provide punishment, both positive and negative, as a repellent against such crimes in society, they isolate the criminals from the rest of society, and they try to rehabilitate the criminals (often rather poorly, but whatever) before releasing them back into the society.

Revenge: 1) harm done to someone as a punishment for harm that they have done to someone else

Does this not fit justice systems which hang serial killers (death to someone that has given death to someone else)? Or fine vandals (financial harm to someone who has caused financial harm to someone else)? Or imprison kidnappers (captivity for someone who has held someone else captive)?

From my perspective, our justice systems are essentially outsourced and regulated revenge, because taking revenge personally is too difficult and tends to result in horrible misunderstandings/collateral damage. So instead, the participants outsource their revenge to the government, who then takes a carefully regulated amount of revenge upon the guilty parties. (Regulated because of various constraints like minimizing collateral damage while also satisfying the public so they don't go all vigilante and get their own revenge.)

This argument is strongly defended by New York Law School's Professor Robert Blecker, who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. [..] Some abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. [..] It is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another death is a relatively unique punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act (e.g. rapists are not punished by corporal punishment).
#+end_quote

Firstly, I admit that revenge seems to have also found its place in the justice system along with deterring punishment, isolation, and rehabilitation.

On the subject in general though, I think maybe what we're arguing about is a conflict of paradigms? In one paradigm, retributional harm is viewed as something done for harm's own sake, something to even the score, so to speak. In the other, it's viewed as a deterrent, a means to dissuade others from committing the same crime. In one, capital punishment is seen as an act of revenge, while in the other it's seen as a way to prevent the criminals that are deemed incapable of rehabilitation from any future acts of crime. Same with financial harm: seen as revenge v.s. seen as deterrent and penalty aimed at covering the caused financial damage. Same with imprisonment: seen as revenge v.s. seen as isolating the criminals until either they're judged fit to be released back into society (parole) or the determined incarceration period that was functioning as a deterrent has expired.

On a somewhat different note, the principles adopted by governments may not be very suitable to be used by individuals. For instance, some of the nuances [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/70vl9f/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dn6plnl/][mentioned here]] may be irrelevant on the scale of a governing body but very important on the scale of an individual.

- It should be clearly and obviously connected to the act that one wishes to disincentivise

- It should include sufficient cost for the target that anyone wishing to accomplish a similar task will gain an extremely negative net result if a similar vengeance is visited upon them. (Assuming future offenders take a moment to think about things, this should ensure that they care).

In particular, you should be able to follow these moral axioms in all contexts, since they are objectively right.

For example, the naive utilitarian system says "you should always maximize total utility, even at the cost of individual utility". If that is an objective moral axiom, then you should be able to obey it in all contexts to achieve some objective moral good. In other words, you can't say "oh but in this particular context the sacrifice requires me to murder someone for the greater good, so it doesn't count and I shouldn't follow the axiom". If you wish to do that, then you have to change the moral axiom to say something like "you should always maximize total utility, even at the cost of individual utility, unless it involves murder". And you have to keep adding all sorts of little nuances and exceptions to the rule until you're satisfied that it can be followed in all contexts.

With that in mind, whenever I encounter a system of morality, I test whether it is objectively right to follow this system by imagining hypothetical scenarios of agents following this system, and try to find one that leads to a dystopia of some sort. After all, if it leads to a dystopia, a state of the world that many would reject, then how is it objectively right?

I have not found a system that passes this test, so my conclusion is that there could be one, but I don't know of it.

******** Well, it depends on the specific definition of "utility". So for example, many forms of utilitarianism advocate that the negative utility of a death, outweighs all positive utility from non-death related issues. Hence killing someone for the amusement for an arbitrarily large crowd of people is a no go.

This simplifies calculations a lot, since now you just have to weigh deaths against deaths, without considering any specific utility functions like people's desires and preferences.

So now, imagine the following hypothetical scenario: suppose there is an agent who has two attributes:

- Ultimate Killer: Instantly kills anyone anywhere whenever he wants to. Unlimited uses. Undetectable.
- Human Omniscience: Not true omniscience, but anything that is known by a human, the agent knows it too. So humans can't deceive the agent, nor would the agent accidentally kill the wrong person.

(You can think of the agent as some ascended human, space alien, AGI, or supernatural being.)

Although this is a very restrictive set of attributes, there are several things the agent can do to maximize utility. For example, he could kill off all serial killers, since their lives are less numerous than the lives of their victims. But it wouldn't stop there, because humanity has a problem: overpopulation.

There is only a limited amount of food, and humanity isn't very good at limiting their growth rate. And whenever there is a food shortage, the agent has an opportunity to maximize utility, since he can effectively choose who gets to eat and who just dies. At which point the question becomes, who should die? If someone eats X food, and two other people combined eat X food, you could sacrifice the first person to save the latter two if you only have X food. In other words, the agent should choose to sacrifice the people who need to eat more food, keeping the people who need less food to survive.

Who needs more food? Well, energy in = energy out, so whoever is using more energy needs more food. Tall people. Heavy people. Muscular people. People who use their brains a lot, because brains also use lots of energy. The agent kills them so that more people can be fed from the same amount of food.

Fun fact: Did you know a person without arms and legs needs less food? Less body mass to feed after all. Same for people who are paralyzed (since they don't use their muscles), or born with various defects like missing body parts or barely functional brains.

The agent doesn't even need to wait for a famine, there's a limited supply of all kinds of resources, and people die from starvation/poverty all the time, even in first world countries. Start early, culling the people whose genes promote high maintenance bodies to save more lives in the future. With the agent happily removing all the "bad" genes from the gene pool, you end up with a dystopia where humanity is reduced to small creatures with minimal body mass, minimal muscle strength, minimal brain activity, etc. After all, a large population of barely human lumps of flesh has more total utility than a small population of normal human beings.

Now, there are of course, other ways in which the agent could maximize utility. For example, he could cull the stupid in favor of letting the smartest people survive, hoping that the brightest minds would advance science the most and somehow increase food production with new scientific tools. But there are usually ways to adjust the hypothetical to prevent that. In this case, the hypothetical could be set in a time period where agricultural science has hit its absolute limit, with no more methods to increase food production.

********* Okay, you've presented an excellent argument for the statement that the negative utility of a single death should /not/ be considered infinite.

So then, the obvious question may be, is it ethical to kill one person for the amusement of a sufficiently large number of people, where 'sufficiently large' may be larger than have ever existed through history?

There, I'll say 'no', for the simple reason that - even if such an action has net positive utility - it does not have /maximal/ net positive utility. Because killing someone does have significant (non-infinite) negative utility, and the same arbitrarily large number of people can be entertained by (at the very least) a significantly less morally objectionable method. Such as juggling, or telling funny stories.

--------------

As a further point in favour of the idea that death should have finite negative utility, I point you to the legal code of any country that maintains the death penalty for certain crimes. Enforcing such laws enforces the idea that the negative of killing a person convicted of such a crime must be less than the negative of not enforcing the deterrent.

The question then is, how much negative utility is a death worth? If it's too large, then the previous hypothetical still applies. If it's too small, then the agent should simply kill all humans immediately since they will experience more suffering (negative utility) in their lives than in death.

Now the moral axiom is on shaky ground. When the rule is extreme, like "thou shalt not kill", that is relatively easy for people to agree on and defend. But when a rule is moderate, like "thou shalt not perform said action if said action has moral value below 0.45124", that becomes extremely hard to defend. Why 0.45124? Why not 0.45125 or 0.45123? If that form of morality is *objective*, there has to be a specific value, with some very precise reason as to why the value should morally not be infinitesimally smaller or larger.

Especially in this case, what is the objective moral value of the negative utility of death? If you went around asking people what that value was, and require them to be extremely specific, you would get wildly different answers, with no clear explanation for why it should be exactly that number unless they claim it's something extreme like infinity. Now, I concede that it is possible that there is a specific objective moral value for death, like -412938.4123 utility points or something, but I am certainly not aware of it.

How about "thou shalt, to the best of thy knowledge, do the action which giveth the greatest moral value"? So if you have a choice between an action with a value of 12 and one with a value of 8, you do the 12 one. Even if you can't put exact figures to it, it seems it would be usually possible to intuit which course of action has more moral value than the next.

For life insurance to work at /all/, insurance adjusters must be able to put a finite monetary value on a human life. I'm not sure what that value is, but it would make a starting point.

Alternatively, since all you really need to know is whether a given course of action has a greater moral value than another one or not, you might even be able to get away with not directly assigning an explicit value at all; as long as you can estimate an ordering between different courses of action.

This doesn't quite work, for multiple reasons. First off, I would be very surprised to find a life insurance company that actually cares for its customers, enough to truly give them the value of their life. It's all about making money. Rather than ethical debates on the value of human life, insurance companies typically set their prices and their payouts based on things like how many customers the insurance company has, and what the average rate of death is among their customer base, what specific pre-existing conditions their customers have, etc. It's very much an economic construct, and the economy, being an imaginary human construct, is inherently subjective. So I find it highly unlikely for the objective moral value of a life to be depending on such subjectivity.

Not to mention that insurance companies don't even agree on the same payouts. Some pay more than others, making their money by charging their customers more. Are the lives of people who pay more then worth more than the lives of people who pay less? What about the lives of people with no insurance? What if the life insurance pays in different currencies? How are you dealing with currency exchange? Is the moral value of a life dynamically changing based on the current value of the dollar? Is my life worth more if I move to another country? And what happens if someone tries to artificially change the moral value of human life by adjusting the life insurance payouts? What if it turns out life insurance companies are shams that will declare bankruptcy instead of paying up when most of their customers die in some disaster?

This does not sound like an objective morality at all, if its based on people "intuit"ing/"estimating" what the moral value of each choice is. After all, "intuit"ing/"estimating" things is by its very nature, very subjective; people disagree on what the most moral action is all the time.

At best, you can argue for the existence of a moral gray area, where things are not objectively morally right or morally wrong. But then, if objective morality exists, there should be objective boundaries on the gray area. So now you need to determine the exact boundaries of the gray area, putting you back at square one since you now have to argue why the gray area should start at 0.45124 instead of 0.45125 or 0.45123. Argh!

Alternatively, you could argue for a gradient transition between the gray area and the objective area, with no boundaries other than the extremes. But then the resulting moral system isn't really objective or useful, since it only tells you objective rules at the extreme cases and makes guesses about everything in between, and you wouldn't even be able to tell how accurate these guesses are or where you are in between because the boundaries and the gray area are poorly defined.

Your point that the monetary value assigned by insurance companies has little to nothing to do with the moral weight of murder is an excellent point, and is enough on its own to completely demolish that argument.

Hmmmm. You are right.

Very well, then. I would then like to put forward the proposal that an objective morality can exist, but that I do not know every detail of exactly what it is.

I suspect, because this makes sense to me, that it includes the following features:

- Each consequence of an action has some moral weight, positive or negative
- The moral weight of an action is equal to the sum over the moral weights over its consequences, multiplied by the probability of that consequence occurring
- These moral weights cannot be precisely calculated in advance, as humans are not omniscient. At best they can be estimated
- The correct action to take in any given situation is that action which has the greatest positive moral weight. There is no exact boundary; if the action with the greatest moral weight has a weight of 4, then that is the correct action; if the action with the greatest moral weight has a weight of 100, then that is the correct action.
- Because the exact moral weight of an action cannot be precisely calculated, there is a grey area where the error bars of the estimates of two actions overlap (i.e. where the person choosing to act is genuinely not sure which action has the greater positive moral weight)

Given this, the remaining task is then to assign moral weights to the various consequences. I'm not quite sure how to do that, but I think that they must be finite.

Well yes, that is exactly what I have been claiming. I'm just less optimistic about its existence, because we cannot even compute the objective moral weight of a consequence (like a death), much less deal with the uncertain probability of it occurring.
