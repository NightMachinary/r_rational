** This. This chapter is why I can't wait for Red to progress in his psychic training; not only is the ability extremely useful, it adds additional 'colour' to the character's narrative that I really like. Plus, if this is how useful being psychic is to a trainer, I can only imagine how useful being psychic would be to a professor, whose main goal is to understand Pokemon. Its the one pet peeve I have with this otherwise flawless story. I feel like Red is underestimating how incredibly useful his psychic talents are, if developed properly. To me (not that I'm some kind of super smart rationalist or anything), psychic powers would be worth a hefty investment.

*** I think the issue is that we assume that Red lives in a rationalist piece of fiction, where /everyone/ has been working intelligently for some purpose. Thus, talented and powerful psychics must have already made a lot of progress in the area of understanding pokemon in that regard. In fact, I think Prof. Oak has an Alakazam and can use it in his research. I think it's safe to assume that people have already picked all the low-hanging fruit in the field, so he would not gain much for himself or for the field of pokemon research by blowing all of his assets on intensive psychic training.

Also, that would mean he would have to miss out on adventuring through the region with Blue and Green while he trains. ;)

**** Good point. However, I think it is still a fair point that Red would have a significant edge if he developed his psychic powers. I don't mean he should put his journey on hold and pay for lesson. I just think he should be taking a more active approach towards working at unblocking his psi potential while he journeys. Like maybe he could have asked the psychic who he spoke to if there were any exercises he could do on the road to help take down his mental blocks and develop his abilities, or he could be shown to be planning on catching a psychic pokemon, so that he can get used to mental communication; stuff like that, so that it doesn't feel like that plot element is going to be dropped for a while.

******** This actually made me so happy :) I love psychic Pokemon the most, especially the beginning evolutions. Though I have one question; from the cartoons I watched growing up, it looked like Sabrina was basically an Alakazam herself, but in your story, Mewtwo says human psychics barely deserve the name. Just how powerful (in terms of, lets say, Pokemon levels) can human psychics become in Origin of Species, and are all psychics born equal or, even if you have the gift, is your potential decided by genetics?

Not really: as Giovanni said, alakazam is the smartest pokemon around but its problem solving skills are akin to a 3 year old child's. Think chimp/ape level intelligence.

To me a world where pokemon are intelligent enough for human communication, even if it's only a few species, is a world that looks so drastically different from canon games or anime or manga that it's barely recognizable. For one thing I don't see how humans can possibly survive with such incredibly powerful and intelligent beings around, especially before pokeball tech was invented, and for another, even if they do, the whole concept of essentially enslaving sapient creatures would sort of have to be the main focus of the story.

** Been bingeing the story and looking at the chapter posts. But this is the first where the post wasn't archived. :D

Been really enjoying it so far. ~I like how you introduce the rational/empiricist themes more subtly than many authors do, and the characters haven't had ridiculous levels of success from the beginning simply by being more rational.

Also really excellent worldbuilding. You've managed to make the pokemon setting as depicted make internal sense without contradicting the main parts of the canon. But also given it a lot more interesting avenues and depth.

Only minor ciriticism would be in characterisation, I'd have difficulty describing the main characters much other than by their loose role in the story. Doesn't meaningfully affect my enjoyment of the story though.

Re Chapter 33

Interestingly we seem to see far more in battle switching in this interlude than in the battles before. That and the references to sweepers, etc makes em think that competitive battling in this is going to look more like the real world competitive metagame than the anime. Which makes sense if you have competent people competing and refining their techniques over time. Though the pokemon switching in the real world does depend heavily on type pairing, which seems not to operate the same way in this world. A potential overlap between Red and Blue's

Its good also to get a sense of how someone becomes a gym leader, and how that interacts with the Champion system. Still not super clear what the elite 4 do. Dooes a trainer have to beat them and the champion like in the games? Or is the champion decided by a tournament like in the show?

It occurs to me that we haven't really had a good in-universe explanation of why gyms specialise on a particular type of pokemon. Given their role as defence and training centres that would seem a disadvantage.

The after event review is also good and gives us a sense of how competent the movers in the setting are and how seriously they take incidents. I often hear people decry that sort of beaurocracy but it can be very useful.

Yeah this hasn't been explored yet, but basically it's a mix of cultural norms, personal preference, and promoting a wide range of "experts." You don't want your best trainers in the region to all be specialized in training just 3 or 4 types of pokemon, after all: while a gym leader's "real team" consists of every kind of pokemon, their specialty ensures that they're the go-to expert on a given type, incase one is needed.
