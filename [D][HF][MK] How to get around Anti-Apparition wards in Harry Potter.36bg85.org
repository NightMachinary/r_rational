If I were planning to write Harry Potter fanfiction I would use this exploit myself, but I'm not, so I'll just throw it out there. Feel free to borrow it.

To review: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Apparition][Apparition]] is "the magical action of travelling by having the user focus on a desired location in their mind, then disappear from their current location and instantly reappear at the desired location" and involves focusing on the Three D's: "One must be completely /determined/ to reach one's /destination/, and move without haste, but with /deliberation/."

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Anti-Disapparition_Jinx][Anti-Disapparition Jinxes]] are somehow cast "to prevent Disapparition in an area for a time." [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Anti-Apparition_Charm][Anti-Apparition Charms]] likewise prevent Apparition into an area.

My theory is that those two wards work by detecting a simultaneous /intent/ ("destination, determination, deliberation") and /effect/ (bend space into "a very tight rubber tube" between two points). So if a different intent coincidentally had the same effect, it wouldn't count as Apparition. Specifically, a wizard could focus on their current location and their desired location, and intent to unite those two points. Coincidentally, any bodies at those two points would be swapped. This might also have the convenient side-effect of not making a "crack!" noise, since air would be swapped from the destination to the starting point instead of leaving a vacuum to be filled. (House-Elves make a loud noise when teleporting, but they can get around anti-Apparition wards, so if they are using this particular technique then the sound must be caused by something other than vacuum.)

The trick of achieving identical effects with different intent generalizes. If an object has been warded against Incendio, one could try raising its temperature with "Augmentum Temperatus" without /intending/ to cause a fire and hope that physics takes care of the consequences for you. This kind of exploit can be countered by using wards against total effects, without reference to intent: a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Flame-Freezing_Charm][Flame-Freezing Charm]] would freeze any flames, no matter what caused them (unless the cause is itself able to overpower the charm---I'm sure Fiendfyre could not be frozen with one).

All of this is based on the assumption that magic itself works according to some kind of Aristotelian metaphysics, where Forms and Attributes really do exist, and conscious intent is a third kind of thing which can affect the former via transfiguration and the latter via charms. (Aside: does this mean that Muggles are p-zombies?) How to reconcile this with the Muggle physics of quantum field theory or general relativity is an open question, but QFT and GR have not yet been reconciled themselves anyway, so I think that's acceptable.

I've been playing around with similar ideas, where dualism is actually a thing. Muggles have no mental self - they're p-zombies. Squibs have a mental self, but it's disconnected from the body (the old families know it's kinder to destroy the body; squib-dom is /much worse/ than lifelong paralysis). Wizards are entites which exist on both mental and physical levels.

What makes this particularly interesting - aside from 'what is the moral status of entities that empirically don't have conscious experience like us (but might through some physical basis)' - is the hazards that wizards alone are exposed to.

Eg: Love potions, having a magical effect, only work on Wizards. Likewise all other mind-affecting magic, Dementors... etc. On the other hand, having a non-physical existence helps you survive lethal injury, dis-corporation, old age, etc.

Most magic only affects physical things, via non-physical mechanisms. Those who study the nature of the mental world too deeply tend to attract great power to themselves, followed closely by Powers no sane person knows of, before they vanish in some catastrophic experiment.

The society is divided not by political philosophy, but rather metaphysical: is a muggle a person? What makes something morally right? Squibs? (of course, saying any of this to a muggleborn witch or wizard is a colossal /faux pas/)

TL;DR - Harry Potter and Philosophy of Dualism 101, with explosions.

(edit: yes, I have read /Philosopher's Zombie/. It's good, but quite different.)

*** Interesting! I'd love to read a story that expands on these ideas. It wouldn't be quite canon, though, since Merope Gaunt was able to affect Tom Riddle with love potions. (Possible fix: some love potions can also affect neurotransmitters in p-zombies, causing them to behave as if they were in love.) There are probably canon instances of Imperiusing Muggles too.

It also raises questions about magical creatures. Is a flobberworm morally worth more than a Muggle, since it has some tiny amount of subjective experience?

We also know that souls can be bound to simple objects like Horcruxes, so you don't need an object like a human body which is complex enough to show apparently conscious behavior even without a soul. So while Muggles have to solve hard engineering problems to cyborg-ize themselves, could a wizard just make a golem with a clay head and transfer their soul to it? Given your setting, they could probably benefit from extra explosion resistance.

**** Some issues with canon, yeah - but almost anything coherent would have that problem! The general impossibility of controlling or obligating Muggles is a feature, not a bug. In this universe, Merope used a potion with physiological rather than mental effect, and went slightly crazy when repeated date-rape didn't lead to a stable relationship (Voldemort doesn't have a pleasant backstory).

These questions are indeed interesting. You appear to hold with the traditionalists too, in the claim that conscious experience cannot exist in purely physical substrates. Daniel of house Dennet would disagree...

Soul magic is far more dangerous to a wizard than any explosion, but in principle this would be possible - if about as wise as dancing through the Forbidden Forest on midsummers day in iron boots, shouting that all fairies are bastards...

***** In the real world I actually agree with Dennett, but if dualism is assumed to be true in this fantasy world, it wouldn't make sense for certain arrangements of neurons/transistors to /also/, by sheer coincidence, create a conscious entity. So whatever similarities Muggle behavior has with wizard behavior, must arise from a complex unconscious simulation.

Horcruxes, ghosts, and Dementors are the only examples of soul magic I can think of in canon, and none of them are really beneficial. Ghosts are denied the afterlife (or whatever is beyond the Veil), horcruxes split your soul (which has unspecified terrible consequences; I would say it drove Voldemort crazy, except that Tom Riddle was pretty crazy to begin with), and Dementors are the worst possible thing (similar to [[http://hdm.wikia.com/wiki/Spectre][Spectres]]). There are plenty of mind-affecting spells---Cheering Charms, Confundus, the Diadem of Ravenclaw---but at least this area of magic isn't entirely too-dangerous-to-risk.

****** But, if you think about it, the existence or dualistic individuals doesn't prevent the existence of monistic ones. We know from canon that wizards are dualistic (voldemort being a disembodied wraith) , now saying that muggles could only be dualistic or p-zombies is a false dicothomy, they could still be monistic, we have weak evidentemence for that : we know the physical laws that rule the muggle universe are the same than ours, we can assume muggles are identical to real world people . The only unanswered question is what did magic do on human evolution? We know that if evolution finds something that's exploitable it does but we have no canon information on that, it couldmake an awesome plot point.

Luckily muggles also lack the senses to perceive or means to interact with magical effects, so the 'entrance' to various districts is more of a portal to folded space (ala Kings Cross), rather than "hidden" (like canon Hogwarts).

I dunno. P-zombies?

You could still argue through the same line of thinking Eliezer uses, which is that if our talking about consciousness is caused by our being conscious, and Muggles have indistinguishable descriptions of consciousness, either they're probably conscious too or our consciousness is secretly epiphenomenal.

Mind you, there's still the question of /why/ Muggle and wizard brains work so differently, but that's no odder than the rest of magic. Maybe an ancient wizard decided to back up his brainstate, who knows?

****** My favourite so far - ie the only one I'm likely to write - is a kind of meta-crossover, in snippets. There are no YW-universe elements whatsoever - instead,someone has published a /suspiciously/ familiar book series.

Harry finds The Book one day while hiding from bullies in a library, and it becomes very important to him. Hermione has been searching all her life for enough knowledge to make the world stop hurting, and discovering magic is a wonderful dream that's slowly turning into a nightmare. They meet on the Express, and since both are hiding from everything form a sibling-type friendship. Ron is mostly irrelevant, like in canon, but may turn up sometimes. (noticing familiar backstories? There are no co-incidences...)

Then an indefinite series of snippets, mixing all kinds of themes. The Avedictory, Provocodictory (Dementors, yeah?), the Oath - and meaning it when wizardy doesn't come, monsters and magic and learning and whatever of life I want to write... Less of a focussed story than a wandering exploration of worlds.

In some ways it's crossover fanfic, with maybe a touch of meta and a subtle kind of write-who-you-know.

** Honestly, I always got the impression that anti-Apparition spells "worked" by detecting the Apparition spell and stopping it. Kinda like a counter-curse.

House-Elves get through because they technically use a different spell that happens to have identical effects.

Conscious intent is clearly "real" in the Potterverse, for a certain measure of "real" - they interact with spells just as effectively as, say, temperature or momentum does. Better, even. On this basis, it should be easy enough to check if Muggles count; just have one interact with a piece of magic that requires an emotion, like Harry's sacrificial love shield thing or a Boggart. (I bet they do, for the record, and there's probably canon evidence.)

But then, so are /words/; Transfiguration is easier when the target and subject sound the same, as with guinea pigs and guinea hens (completely unrelated creatures otherwise.) Supposedly, so are "magically powerful numbers", although we haven't the foggiest idea what that /means/.

Keep a bullet/pellet smeared in basilisk blood with you at all times. Harry can do this anytime after killing the basilisk in Book 2.

Use Wingardium Leviosa to send the blood pellet flying off into the distance. Anti-apparition wards have to have a ward surface, ie. its outermost range, even if it's half a mile away in each direction.

That said, is Gemino really likely to work that way? Food cannot be conjured out of thin air; presumably magical objects also cannot be conjured (otherwise you could just make a Philosopher's Stone from nothing), and I would expect something as powerful as basilisk blood to also be un-duplicable.

According to [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gemino_Curse][the wiki]]: "Over time, the copy tended to rot or tarnish more quickly than the original... It is also unknown as to whether or not the Gemino Curse can duplicate living or sentient beings, or if it is able to replicate an object's magical properties."

I read on the HP wiki that Gemino creates temporary duplicates and can only be dispelled by the caster. Which literally means that once this happens, Gringotts is fucked. The basilisk blood doesn't have to exist permanently; anything it ruins before it dissipates will also be irrevocably damaged. Food, philosopher's stones are only valuable because they last. And while the copy rots or tarnishes more quickly, I don't see how basilisk blood can get /more/ ruined.
