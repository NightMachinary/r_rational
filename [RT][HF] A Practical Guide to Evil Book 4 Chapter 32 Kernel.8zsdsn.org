** It seems like that whole journey was meant as a tutorial on how to fight the wandering bard, "the way that leaves no openings" Cat means that he was rising to power in such a way that the bards whispering objections couldn't affect him, he had to sacrifice more than half his country in order to make him self king in such a way as to have no chance for objections.

*** That's if the woman laughing at the end isn't the Bard. She isn't above doing a hi-by (a drive-by by saying hi-bye) when the villain's master plan turns out to be her master plan too.

**** Well I imagine it is her laugh in the past at the fall of Keter, she already admitted defeat at that point so she is just laughing at the sheer horror of it, that seems like her style as well.

***** Alternatively, she's laughing because she knows that the dead king just bound himself in his victory to the point where he can't act without praesi/villainous intervention even though he wanted freedom.

The ending sure is ominous, considering they've likely just crossed that gate.

*** If hope is the province of Above, perhaps being beyond hope is no bad thing.

Of course, that's not likely true, and even if it was I doubt it would stop Cat from ending up fighting a couple of nascent gods and an Old One before noon.

*** An good and old frase. Is from dante's divina comedia. Written over the gates of hell.

Very fitting here.

*** Isn't hope the opposite of adequate engineering? I have a feeling the dead king would get along well with HJPEV if he ever lived up to his own hype or any nuclear engineer when planning and or making things.

*** I'd argue it would be fairly repulsive to her. She gets the ick just from changing Akua's appearance, I think she'd balk pretty hard at altering personalities.

**** Also it becomes fairly hard to commit to the "use right up until the moment of annihilation" strategy that Thief wants if your alternative is to massage the kinks out of her personality. That'd likely cause conflict within the Woe.

** I'm kind of confused about who they think they are fooling with the Akua disguise. Like, do they really expect the Dead King to not recognize a Named spirit? Binding Named spirits is kind of his whole deal.
