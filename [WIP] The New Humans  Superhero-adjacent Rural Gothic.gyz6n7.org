** Hi, author here. So, I didn't really write /The New Humans/ as rational fiction per sae, but me and my team did try to approach the world building and characters thoughtfully.

So, a summary, /New Humans/ is basically a 1960s period piece examining the nature of cults cult and children's psychology through the lense of the superpower genre, against the backdrop of a Cold War ended by a Superman like figure called "The Flying Man." I'd say "superhero" genre but none of the main characters actually qualify as superheroes, not yet at least.

Tldr: /X-Men/, but it's a cult. Also Australian.

Just a warning, the story does start as a bit of a slow burn, and some of the earlier chapters are way too long.

Am interested in any and all input.

****** Just a warning, it might not be on Royal Road forever, due to a content report. It's under review.

*** I'll let others answer this more fully. A fast read of the first chapter and change shows some rational elements at play. The setting comes across as similar to an SCP take on supers, complete with experimentation to determine scope and function of powers. It looks appropriate for this subreddit.

**** Also, I'd argue that the story also has a number of transhuman (posthuman?) themes and motifs. I'm very interested in the "lived experience" of beings with nonhuman capabilities and perspective, a bit like mild xenofiction.

For anyone who's familar, Alan Moore's /Miracleman/ is a bit of an influence, to put it lightly. Fun fact, that comic basically invented /Luminosity/'s ending about twenty odd years early.

Oh, me and my editor (a very equal contributer to the work, I might add) were guests on a podcast a little while ago talking about the story. Their series covers a lot of other good web fiction, too, like my friend's [[https://touchwebserial.com/][Touch]].

** Hey, reaching out for a bit of advice here. Does anyone know of some genuinely amazing natural landscapes or features on Earth, they would be experiencing daylight during nighttime on the East Australian coast. Also, has to be broadly safe for a baseline human child. As in, they wouldn't die instantly. Water would be nice, too.
