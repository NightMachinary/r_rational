I just read 73 out of the 74 chapters of harry potter and the natural 20 over the last three days, and I just realized it looks dead. The last thing I could find by the writer was a tumbler post from January of 2019, has any more recent things come from him?

Also can any one recommend any other fiction based around DnD rules (I really like how the amount of rules lead to the abuse of them)?


** It's too bad it's dead, I enjoyed it. I particularly liked the part where he realizes he has just experienced a time skip and the plot is about to resume

*** I also believe the best part was the knowledge he had, as if he was a real life person playing dnd. The exposition form the gm stopped so I better pay attention.

** Unfortunately it has been dead for a while... But it had been dead previously and the author came back to release a few more chapters, so who knows.

Not exactly the same subversion of DnD ruleset, but [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25326486-orconomics][Orconomics]] tries to make a functional with an economy based on party quests. It's really good and extremely funny at points

*** Have already read the first two books of orconomics, its very good, but I dont know if I will read the third one when it comes out cause by this point I have forgotten most of the details besides the broad ideas of it.

** [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0][The Two Year Emperor]] by Eaglejarl was fun, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] isn't D&D exclusively but it's a must-read to anyone who enjoys the genre.

*** Just to clarify, The Two Year Emperor uses similar munchkining of the rules. Worth the Candle is another LitRPG story that I recommend, and I think is generally better than The Two Year Emperor, but there's not so much munckinning. Mostly because the main character doesn't know the rules very well, and they (mostly) don't even apply for everyone else.

I would classify Worth the Candle as almost entirely an exercise in munchkinning by the main character, and to some extent the 2IC character, to solve every problem they need to solve. Moving skill points around the way he does is absolutely a munchkin move.

***** I disagree. Muchkinning is much more starkly depicted in the Two Year Emperor, with the main character trying to set up mechanisms a la Peasant Railgun. What goes on in Worth the Candle is the much less game-ruining Optimization. Metagaming is a core part of Worth the Candle, but it doesn't rely in the insanity that was DnD 3.x's "Mechanics = Physics". The system in Worth the Candle is explicitly based on degrees of abstraction and GM permissiveness.

****** That's a fair argument, I do see your point. I think there is also an element of gross failure to roleplay in munchkinning, ie they engage in “wildly unrealistic behaviour” in pursuit of goals that should and could never occur to a /person/ raised in the world of the game, with its cultural assumptions and background knowledge. Juniper is an explicit self-insert with Earth, gamer, cultural assumptions and explicit GM-imposed goals in the form of the Quest Text.

***** I guess what I mean is that in Harry Potter and the Natural 20, it involves flagrant rule abuse. Like using a tower shield for invisibility on the basis that it grants full cover, so nobody can see you or anything you're carrying. The Two Year Emperor generally isn't quite as extreme, but it still uses rules to be vastly more powerful than intended, like using automatically resetting magical traps for things besides traps.

Worth the Candle seems to have this sort of thing less. Mostly because the rules generally only apply to Juniper, and he doesn't actually know what they are. The only flagrant rule abuses I can think of were on accident.

** He tweeted as recently as September 2019, and also he has 2 D&D modules on DriveThruRPG called "City of Eternal Rain" and "Into the Living Library". I've run the Living Library one and it's good fun.

** The classic story of D&D characters being aware of the rules and abusing them horribly is from 1986: [[http://www.rogermwilcox.com/ADnD/IUDC1.html][The Intercontinental Union of Disgusting Characters]]. The first edition rules were not particularly well written (the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIntercontinentalUnionOfDisgustingCharacters][TV Tropes page]] mentions 'loopholes big enough to drive a siege engine through') but I remember it being a fun romp.

** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheMunchkins][Harry Potter and the Munchkins]] comes to mind, though it's not actually D&D rules, and also it was never completed.

Edit: There's also [[https://www.nuklearpower.com/8-bit-theater/][8-Bit Theater]]. I never got through the beginning, but the later comics I read are pretty good. Red Mage believes he's in a tabletop RPG, and often uses that knowledge to mess with the rules. Though he's actually in a videogame.

** It's always a shame when these stories go on indefinite hiatus like that. Even if the author comes back to it their style changed over time, they got worse from not writing at all, or they just don't remember the plan in detail and have to make up something new, which screws with the prior foreshadowing.

I also forgot the details by then so it feels like I came in in the middle.

** HP & N20 is one of the best HP fafics I've ever read. It's brilliant and hilarious, and he does an awesome job exploiting the DnD mechanics in the HP universe. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Here's the link]] if anyone is interested.
