** Why not add it to the sidebar? I think it's more relevant than [[/r/rokosrooster]], [[/r/OfficialHPMOR]] or [[/r/VoluntaristLWBookClub]] all of which have very +little+ few subscribers.

*** [[/r/VoluntaristLWBookClub]] has over 100 members! I remember how long [[/r/rational]] sat under that line.

To be fair, [[/r/OfficialHPMOR]] has more members than subscribers, considering it contains every member of the Bayesian Conspiracy.

The social group of LW that does camp trips and meetups?

Or some secret club that we are supposed to solve some intricate puzzle, fight a bunch of bias monsters and write a book on rational thinking just to gain entry?

Because I can only do one.
