Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial set in a unique(ly horrible) world. It updates every Sunday and some people here like it. A lengthier summary is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/][here]] and you can start the first installment [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]].

EDIT: for some reason, Reddit is treating this post as invisible for everyone but me. Editing to try and shake it out of it.

*** Thank you! We worked it out, there's some sort of goofy glitch and I think I know how to avoid it in the future.
