** I've never read a manga, but there are rational anime. Haikyuu!! Is an example I've been meaning to write a post about. Surely the manga is similar?

*** I thought haiku was about wanting to become a great volleyball player? Doesn't seem rational from what I've seen.

**** It's about rationally going about that. How does it being about volleyball make it less rational?

****** It absolutely does. The characters have realistic, consistent motivations, and they intelligently work towards their goals. That's rational fiction

******* So, you can have smart characters, and there are lots of shows that have smart characters, animated and not.

But rational fiction is when they apply the methods of rationality to objectively analyze their environment and gain an advantage. A good example of this is harry Potter and the methods of rationality or even death note. In haikyuu the characters are smart but not "rationality smart". There is a difference.

******** You're thinking of /rationalist/ fiction. That is indeed something different. Rational fiction has a "lower" bar to clear, so to speak

There's a good explanation in the sub's about section

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  - Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Haikyuu!! checks this box

#+begin_quote

  - Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Check

#+begin_quote

  - Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
#+end_quote

Debatable, but I'd count it

********* Hmmmm, yeah I suppose I've been spoiled by very good rationalist fiction and have set the bar too high. Good catch.

** You're unlikely to find a "pure" rational manga, but you can find several manga that have characters and societies that act mostly rational in response to a situation, while still having common genre tropes like a hotheaded protagonist or emotionally-driven powers.

/Attack on Titan/ could be considered one example of this. The characters are more driven than would be rational (especially Eren, the main protagonist), but the setting is pretty consistent, and the military chain of command of the scouts is pretty ruthlessly rational in tackling challenges rational and not as is most of the supporting cast within that group.

However, it is a "soft" SF (pseudo-magical) setting, not a "hard" one where the physics all work exactly the same as our world, if that's one of your requirements for being "rational." The 3D mobility gear is pretty physics defying, and titan abilities (/existences) are semi-handwaved / semi-justified.
