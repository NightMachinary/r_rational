Alternatively, just don't advertise at all.

** Ahaha, I knew Mark couldn't be dead if we didn't see the body. Suck it, Dylan! You thought he was your narrative appendage, but now you're just part of his backstory.

On a darker note, it concerns me greatly that an angel said Uriel is "dead." There's a real tone of finality to that. Do angels use that term for those who are temporarily destroyed but will recoalesce later? Is it possible that Uriel is gone for good? Because I would be /seriously/ bummed.

*** On the chapter about the angel war, Samyazaz took it as a given that the dead angels would come back. Then they explained Thamiel's weapon caused the true death, which rather surprised him. So I'm fairly confident Uriel can recoalesce, assuming the world lasts that long.

**** I really hope so. He's far and away my favorite character in this story, and I love his friendship with Sohu. It would suck giant donkey balls if he never returned.

** Mark, a man who spins stories to the universe is now on a boat, which makes him our Mark Twain. Mark Twain's original name (before he took the boating term) was Samuel Clemens. "Samuel" refers both to a name of Hebrew origin meaning "name of God" or "God has heard," and to the spirit of America, Uncle Sam. "Clemens" is a Latin name meaning "merciful." Therefore, Mark's arrival signifies that God will hear his own name and mercifully save America.

*** I'm not sure he cared whether Mark was actually dead or not. I think he was trying to use Mark's apparent death to give himself an advantage in the placebomantic duel. Everyone knows that killing the hero's sidekick is a one-way ticket to hell!
