*** I agree. >90% of people are not criminal under US conditions. I'd argue that Masters are significantly more likely to be criminal though. Their powers don't have a 'good' use and the mere fact that they can use it creates suspicion.

If outed Masters cannot find regular jobs, they may have no recourse but to find criminal jobs. That further justifies the suspicion.

The suspicion also creates a biased sample: Masters that can hide their powers choose to use their powers like Shakers, for example (Glory Girl anyone?), or they may choose not to use their powers at all. So only criminal Masters are identified, further increasing suspicion.

Of course, given that triggers may correlate to emotional states and more controversially, personalities, this suspicion may be entirely justified. Not that your suspicion of someone that can make you love them is unjustified. If you thought that the person in front of you is a madman and could hurt you, you are in every right to not hire them.

**** Depends on the master. I wrote a doctor with a minor thinker power that lets him know what tests to run on a patient and he also has a very minor calming aura. Not enough to pacify someone, but enough to make a patient feel a little better, set them at ease.

*Edit*: although I recall there being some question of whether this constituted a master, shaker, or stranger power when I first posed the question of what category a calming aura fits in.

In-canon there's a lot Bitch could do with giant beasts of labor. The dogs ended up plowing fields, right? That's a very useful sword-into-plowshare example.

***** You're right. The doctor is probably going to pass as a normal person. Bitch's case doesn't apply though, since she is separate from 'proper' society. But for a hypothetical animal Master, they might not get a pass. In-story, there is not clear logic to powers.

We know Bitch cannot control people, and the Protectorate might know that from experience, but the people in story that don't interact with parahumans? It's not difficult to draw false parallels between controlling humans and animals (they're both living things.)

"There must be a reason the Protectorate classifies human and animal Masters together," they'd think, either consciously or subconsciously (though the only reason they're classified as such is because the classification spread informally, then had been institutionalised.)

This isn't conclusive, or even true, but doubt is all it takes to seriously hurt a person's life. Some people are going to be generous ignore the doubt, but most are going to be cautious.

There's probably a movement to split the 'Master' Category to 'Master' and 'Beastmaster' categories or something like that.

Quibble: if they couldn't find a job they could probably create a legal job for themselves if they wanted to. That said, the vast majority of people are not entrepreneurial and therefore would not consider that option. In that case, yes, crime would likely be the easiest and first-thought-of option.

** Parahuman Population (Tabs 1 and 2):

Assumptions:

1. Scions grants powers to 1,000 parahumans per year. This contradicts canon of <100 parahumans in 1980s, but that results in growth rates that are either too low or too high (Population does not reach ~600,000 by 2011, or does, then accelerates into billions in <10 years). 1,000 per year is also about ~2-3 per day, and that seems a reasonable guess. Scion has no reason to be consciously grant more powers, and by period 20 budding growth >> Scion growth.

2. There is a limit to growth that ends in 1 in 100 of the population being parahumans. The Doylist reasons are that linear growth rates results in populations that are either too low or too high, and that I like the idea of fundamental inequality.

3. The parahuman population is distributed as such (w/ overlap):

Brute 30% Shaker 30% Mover 30% Changer 15% Blaster 15% Striker 10% Breaker 10% Tinker 5% Master 1% Thinker 1% Stranger 1% Trump 1%

This is based off of Brockton's figures, and balance issues (Brutes cause much less trouble than Thinker on a large scale, so there should be significantly less Thinkers).

International Politics (Tab 3):

Assumptions:

1. Scion grants powers and powers bud in proportion to population. The strength of the powers are also in proportion. There is no reason for Scion not to do this, and budding depends on the population of parahumans existing.

2. Parahumans are not geared to conflict. This contradicts canon, but is not acceptable in a rational setting. Because parahumans are not geared to conflict, they can be organised by states.

3. China and Russia, and especially China, are functional states. The idea of the C.U.I is not acceptable in a rational setting. Russia may be a corrupt hell-hole, but it is a corrupt hell-hole that can participate in international politics as a state.

Given these assumptions, you can see the immediate problem from the figures in Tab 3. China and India combined have 1/5 of total parahumans. The US is outnumbered by 5 by China. The US outspends China's military by 3. Not only that, parahumans are far superior to ordinary soldiers, and require far less training. Parahumans are also superior to: tanks, helicopters, bomber planes, rocket launchers, missiles, nuclear missiles, etc.

The US military advantage does not exist. Given that much of US foreign policy depends on US protection (Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia etc. ), the political landscape should be completely changed.

Assumption:

1. Tinker-tech can be replicated by other Tinkers to some extent, and by non-parahumans to some lesser extent. That Tinker-tech cannot be replicated is not acceptable in a rational setting, but 'free' Tinker tech is likely to change society too completely. Some replication is a good balance: The tech is going to spread, but it's going to take some time. 30 years is sufficient only for the most basic and least controversial tech to be common.

Given that Tinker-tech can be replicated, and that China and India has the most Tinkers by default, China and India should be the technological hubs of 2011, give-and-take bad governance and corruption penalties. But by the 1980s China was already opening (Nixon met Mao in 1972, Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was established in 1980).

You know how DC and Marvel resort to having dudes punch each other in the face to resolve all problems? That's because the existence of superhumans change things complexly.

Does China's power cause Japan to develop nuclear weapons? Become more nationalist? Form a bloc with Korea and the South East Asian nations? Does the US become more hawkish and increase defense spending? Does the population become more conservative? Does Russia ally with the US to balance China? Does India? That's only some of the changes from one change.

I'd like to explore all these changes. If you can help me brainstorm more changes to explore, I'll be closer to a coherent, interesting and reality-conforming Rational!Worm :)

Most bar the toughest of brutes can be taken down by heavy weaponry. You're rating the general parahumans rather highly. They can certainly do a lot, but tanks and missiles often beat them.

In assuming that parahumans are inherently all tractable to whatever goal you wish you overpower dictatorial nations. Someone like China who is continually working to suppress internal dissidence is going to face regular parahuman aided rebellions. A nation's strength will be heavily predicated on how effectively they can utilize their parahumans and stop them from going villain/ hero against the state.

You're radically changing society in a way that isn't going to appeal to people who like worm, and removing difficulties in a way that isn't going to appeal to those who dislike suetopias.

You might as well just write a superhero story in its own universe.

**** In order:

Thinkers are not common in canon. Thinkers appear to be common because the important people were Thinkers, because Thinkers have disproportionate effects. The spreadsheet represents a summary of the populations. This is necessary so that I do not create /too many/ Thinkers, because Thinkers are easy solutions to problems. By limiting the number of Thinkers, and defining those Thinkers, these Thinkers can cause problems, and I can expand on those problems. If I don't define the Thinkers, "Why didn't X do Y" is going to be a serious issue.

Strong emotions still cause triggers. Having triggers in proportion to the population does not exclude that. It just means people feel emotions in all countries, though some of those emotions might differ country to country because of culture. East Asia, for example, might have more Thinkers because of the stress they place on placing examinations.

The spreadsheet does not account for this, because it's a bit of work to do so, and regardless of the distribution of power classifications, the problem of China and India having 40% of the parahuman population still exists.

Conflict exists with and without powers. People are still greedy, lazy, hateful, complacent, etc. without Shard-induced conflict. I removed the Shard-induced conflict to remove the conflict balls in this story. If people gained powers, realistically, all societal order does not just break down.

It is rational for parahumans to stage coups. But China is united (sort-of, excluding the territories in dispute e.g. Taiwan) at the time of Scion. How does the they know who else is disgruntled, or who else has powers? The problems that apply to normal coups still apply to parahuman coups.

A group of parahumans that has no popular support is never going to topple the government of a functioning state. Because the state itself is going to control parahumans, and the state controls the parahumans of all of its territories.

That's not to say China doesn't have problems. With powers, Tibet and Xinjiang are going to be a lot more difficult for China to control. China probably forces parahumans to register their power in those territories. Hong Kong and Taiwan might become more independent.

I think most Brutes can survive machine-gun fire. I think that's a reasonable baseline to be considered a 'Brute', since normal people can survive, say, pistol fire. So Brutes are almost certainly superior to regular infantry.

Not all Brutes can destroy Tanks, maybe. But if Alexandria can stop on 100 tanks per minute, then tanks stop being viable for war against the United States. If Germany, France, the UK, Russia etc. all have high-tier flying bricks, then tanks stop being viable for war, especially since tanks aren't free. You can repeat the logic for any other weapon.

Statistically, there are going to be high-tier flying bricks in every major country, or high-tier flying cannons etc.

I hope that I've explained satisfactorily. I really do like Worm and it's characters. What I'm trying to do is remove the elements that are generally considered irrational by other users. Of course, if I remove those elements Worm is going to be different. But hopefully still Worm-y.

A Master, Thinker, Tinker etc. alone is not sufficient for a coup. They'd need to gather other supporting capes. How do they do so? Nobody is going to openly tell your their powers and their political positions. The other capes might be geographically and culturally separated. If they disagree with the existing power structure, they might disagree in a different way from you. And in gathering supporting capes you're risking the state's (Thinker-enhanced) intelligence agencies detecting you.

It's simple to imagine an established rebel group that defeats existing power structure, but the difficulty is that such a rebel group is difficult to establish.

Political organisations outside of the CCP, I don't think so. I don't even think there are significant organisations outside the CCP. There's a law limiting gatherings of more than 40 people today, though I'm not sure if it applied then. The geographic dispersion is an issue, but it doesn't help the coordination problems of potential rebels.

Potential rebels also have the problem of personality and capability match. Some random peasant that can read minds is more likely to try to make money than take over the government, or they might not have the capability to stealthily expand their power. If the CCP is more unpopular or less centralised, its easier to coordinate; you could just go to the nearest opposition group and tell them you have powers. But I don't think those conditions exist.

In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood had long been established. In Iraq, ISIS's leadership consists of former Ba'athist leadership that had been displaced by the US.

That might be true. I don't feel like I know enough about China's intelligence community to say for sure. But intelligence does not strictly need to be gathered by intelligence agencies. It could just as easily be passed up the chain of command. Mr. Li might report to the CCP head of his village that Mr. Wong is asking 'wrong' questions of the other villagers. The CCP head of the village is going to report to the CCP head of the province, etc.

I feel at this point, though, it's better to resolve these argument by writing rather than arguing.

*** These assumptions don't make a lot of sense to me.

If Masters, Thinkers, Strangers and Trumps are all vanishingly rare, then there's no reason to have separate categories for them in the first place - it would make more sense to lump them together as "weird/meta stuff", much like the actual Trump category in canon.

It also seems odd from a balance perspective, given that most of the Masters and Thinkers we see seem to be quite weak - danger senses, sensing roughly what category a person's powers fit into, mapping out the area around you, stuff like that; while almost all Masters in canon just create disposable minions. We don't see many Strangers at all (amusingly), but given that Shadow Stalker is classified as a stranger, I suspect the same is true of them.

It seems very strange to me that powers are given out "in proportion to population" - are you doing away with trigger events entirely? Why? Obviously this is going to completely break the canon setting to the point where it's unrecognizable.

You declare that Tinker limitations and subtle Shard influences are "not acceptable in a rational setting". Why? People in real life already have biases and shortcomings, and there's no reason for Shards /not/ to make use of mind-affecting abilities to prevent, for example, Panacea from immediately destroying everything. The entirety of HPMOR, /the/ original ratfic, takes place [[#s][with a hero who]]

Similarly, real technology requires a significant technology base in order to produce and maintain. Factor in the fact that many Tinkers canonically have other powers, the sheer flood of mismatched one-off items, and the fact that they're designed with little concern for safety or ease of production - not to mention the fact that Tinkers possess only enough information to operate the devices - and it doesn't seem unreasonable that we'd end up with "only" a technology boom. But if this really seems unacceptable, why not declare that all Tinkers are making heavy use of reality-warping powers? It makes more sense than setting your story in the middle of an immediate Singularity.

I'm also not entirely sure why you reject the idea of the CUI; parahuman powers can obviously lead to revolutions fairly easily if the population isn't heavily invested (or feels actively oppressed by) in the current system, and the CUI seems to do pretty well using a few core powers with great synergy to absorb most others into their power structure.

They have a great, effective system that scales well, and which they believe is the only way to avoid the world ending. Their only failing is that they violated international law in a quick power grab, and ended up isolated from the international community, which seems like exactly the sort of conflict you'd expect in a ratfic.

**** Paragraph one and two are fair points. I can probably increase the proportion of Masters, Thinkers and Strangers, as long as most of them are low-rated.

On the third paragraph, that's bad phrasing on my part. There's still trigger events, but trigger events happen in proportion to population, because emotions happen in proportion to population. Though there might be some differences in classification (e.g Mexico has more Brutes because of gang conflict).

I agree, people in real life have conflict. From my perspective, therefore, there is no reason for Shard-induced conflict, that results in a lot of irrational even for irrational people.

Panacea is not going to be able to break Shards. I think breaking Shards is a cheat to make Taylor important at the final battle. Given that, I think Panacea is fair in canon.

If Brockton hospitals ship the most terminally ill or genetically disordered people to the hospital for Panacea to heal, and Panacea occasionally participates in research, healing to give insight to the healing process to medical professionals who can then scale up the process, that rationalists Panacea a bit without changing her character.

Of course, there are some healers that charge millions for, say, making aging celebrities young again. That can create a lot of conflict. Perhaps some people feel that parahumans should be forced to act for the common good. Perhaps some people feel that only rich people can afford not to age etc.

I actually agree with you on the first Tinker point. I'm not sure where our disagreement is. On the second Tinker point, I prefer not to have them reality warp. I think that ruins the flavour of Tinkers.

I've responded to the idea of coups earlier in this thread, but the CUI is also both communist and anti-parahuman. By the 1980s, and even more so by the 1990s, when the parahumans are coming into their own, China has started transitioning to Capitalism, and there is little political support for Communism.

China is surrounded by geopolitical threats: Russia, India, Japan, Korea. Tibet, Xin Jiang, Taiwan and Hong Kong are independence minded. The US is also chilling in nearby bases. There is going to be no political support for an anti-parahuman stance.

If some group manages a coup and takes an anti-parahuman stance, you'd expect immediate meddling by their neighbours who don't want civil war spilling into their countries, or millions of Chinese fleeing China into their country.

You'd also expect the military and every parahuman and parahuman group in China to oppose the group. You'd also expect civilians to oppose such an illegitimate government, especially if the legitimate government is agitating against them. No such group is going to last, though the exact outcome of such a Conflict is hard to predict.

The CUI is a result of the author thinking "Wouldn't it be cool if China were like North Korea?". But China is not North Korea.

Wouldn't places with more stress have a lot more trigger events, though? If you're in the middle of a civil war in the Third World, there's going to be a /lot/ of trigger-worthy events in your life.

This is kind of important in canon, actually; mild gender inequality in the US acts as an excuse for Wildbow's tendency to write female characters whenever he forgets, parahuman-enabled civil wars acts as an excuse for the Third World to get worse rather than being fixed instantly by Eidelon or Panacea, and the fact that people from lower-class backgrounds are disproportionately likely to trigger justifies the disproportionate criminality of parahumans (above and beyond the fact that the authorities have a limited ability to stop them.)

  Panacea is not going to be able to break Shards. I think breaking Shards is a cheat to make Taylor important at the final battle. Given that, I think Panacea is fair in canon.

Nooo. Definitely not.

Well, I mean, yes, the fact that Taylor's power could be jailbroken into such a convenient form was definitely a cheat, but Panacea is absurdly broken without that. She's probably the most powerful Tinker in canon, with the possible exception of Dragon.

She's able to cure an entire city of disease by creating self-replicating pathogens that remove it and then die off. She's able to create creatures that can fly and are strong enough to carry a human being, bugs that mimic Taylor's power, stuff like that; and that's when she's barely trying. /And everything she creates is self-replicating if she wants it to be./ And that's without even getting into the potential for transhumanism, or the fact that she has near-perfect instantaneous mind control.

If you want to remove mental restrictions on powers, you have to remove Panacea and Dragon (well, Richter.) Both of them are quite capable of fixing or destroying ... well, /everything/, pretty much, barring a few really strong parahumans.

They could be replaced with expies, though; a girl that can restore human bodies to perfect health with a touch, and a brilliant disabled woman who builds Tinkertech suits, perhaps.

I want to keep Panacea and Dragon as much as possible. I like them very much, and because I'm getting rid of a lot of elements of Worm, I need to keep some elements of it. Dragon is probably fine as she is for the reasons others stated.

I'd probably tone Panacea's powers down however. She can create diseases, sure. She can cure diseases, sure. She can 'improve' people and animals, sure. But no disease-curing 'plagues'. I'd keep her mental issues. Her crush on Victoria and her limiting herself from her 'true' potential power (e.g. making people younger or smarter, becoming more politically influential, spreading deadly plague) are still perfectly plausible for a normal human.

Then again, I could also imagine someone having the power to create viruses that can make people smarter, and not doing it. There could be all sort of implications that a single person might think is too much for them to handle, or they might not want to be burdened with people asking more from them (since you can make people smarter, can you make my child, specifically, smarter?).

Viruses that make people smarter might not even be all that noticeable. A lot of people in the US are probably smarter today because there's no lead in their pipes, but there's no horde of intellectuals roaming around the US.

Cauldron still exists, and they're still messing around. I don't have a grasp of the consequences of that yet, but at least on first impression nothing much has to change.

Contessa could still perpetuate wars in certain regions as parahuman factories, and she might not mess around with political powers much as long as they are compliant to demands, since adding more criteria to her paths likely lengthens her paths. She is also not going to promote wars everywhere since she needs centralisation for her power to be useful, or she'd be herding hundreds of millions of cats.

Depending on how far human biology can be pushed she could make people so smart that it's like the difference between humans and chimps: sure chimps are pretty smart but we're the ones who keep them in cages and if we wanted we could easily kill all chimps on the planet. If everyone helped it would maybe take a week. Imagine if a nation got that kind of advantage from Panacea's virus.

Leaving Panacea psychologically broken is definitely necessary for her not immediately breaking the world. But it doesn't make for a rationalist story. In such a story every important character is awesome. Everyone does interesting things. Panacea not using her powers is simply frustrating. It's only tolerable if it's the shards that keep her this way.

Anything can be rational if one sets the definitions properly. In this case, however, the entire shape of the universe is defined by:

1. The author literally handing Conflict Balls to every super so that they use their powers for Righteous Face Punching instead of, say, farming or power generation.
2. The author saying "nope, Tinker tech can't be mass produced because reasons."
3. The author saying "nope, you can't do that. Endbringers fall, everyone dies" any time a character tries to actually change the shape of the universe.

It's a fun story (if you enjoy unrelieved grimdark, of course), but Wildbow very clearly worked backwards -- he had a setting he wanted to write in, so he kept adding restrictions until he could have that setting.

When the entire basis of your universe, as well as the motivations for the characters, rests on author fiat then I cannot get behind it as a rational story. YMMV, of course.

  She's a full human-level AI, she just needs her fetters removed. That's going to happen sooner or later -- she's not going away, and eventually she'll find a Thinker or someone else to unshackle her. Might take a year or a century, but it will happen. Actually, didn't Armsmaster / Defiant do that? It's been a long time since I read it, but I recall that he spent a long time mucking around in her guts, removing limitations and reverting her to backups.
#+end_quote

Yeah. This is treated with an appropriate amount of caution by the characters (well, except Defiant), and only succeeds in extremely limited ways. It also prompts one character (Saint) to disable her for much of the climax for fear that she might successfully take over the world if unbound. (Also worth noting that she's bound to forcibly prevent anyone who tries to remove her limitations, although she circumvents this through the obvious method.)

Wildbow has mentioned that her creator was specifically made by his shard to limit his creations as much as possible, because "allowing an unbound AI to be created would be a grave error by the entities".

**** I think you could write a rational story set in the Wormverse, even if you include a lot of the head-scratching conceits. I think there's a lot to answer, but with one exception none of the answers are that hard (the exception being Tinkertech, which makes no damned sense, because reverse-engineering is a thing). You can keep the conflict-ball in play and free energy doesn't actually matter that much.

However, I also agree that making such extensive changes /probably/ results in a world that only has a weak flavor of Worm, since it's going to be so drastically different. If you remove so many of the supporting posts, you have to replace them with your own, so you're sort of just left borrowing characters and places and writing your own superhero fiction in Worm drag. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just ... different.

But I don't like the striker explanation either, because there are a number of cases where Tinker tech is loaned out for extended periods of time, or where Tinker tech requires no obvious interaction from a parahuman, or where Tinker tech continues on going even after the Tinker dies, or etc.

Mostly I just find Tinkers to be really problematic.

I think the striker answer implies that there is good science backing the item, it's just science beyond current human understanding. The power just helps the tinker leapfrog the current manufacturing limitations.

The reason that their shit is always breaking is because the power does a half-ass job, fault tolerances are too low, it doesn't go through the equivalent of UL lab certification. The reason they can 'tune up' items is because of the power hackery being re-applied.

The point of the system isn't really to accurately describe how something works, its not like the entities actually created abilities in those different buckets. It's just shorthand for discussing powers.

I believe there is actually a discussion of pros/cons of the system in cannon (pros like improved response in emergency, cons like misunderstandings of the true nature of the power).

******** The striker explanation that I didn't adequately describe, and one which you are probably already familiar with and may already be referring to, is not that the striker ability is actively making the item work, but that it periodically alters an item while a tinker is working on it, such as to alter its molecular composition, and so the tinker doesn't know it's happened. Having no basis in science I assume such changes could still be analyzed and reverse engineered, should the material be replicable, and so that's a plot issue.

Really, it seems to my recollection that most of the plot issues of Worm come from Wildbow either vastly underestimating or vastly overestimating how powerful X organization or Y superpower would be.

I'd have made tinkers only rarely trigger into being very good at complicated technology, and instead made them component workers. Tinker A makes amazing capacitors, Tinker B makes the best batteries, et al.

***** You're right that it's going to be different. I do like Worm's core mechanics immensely though. My impression of the Rational genre (at least for fanfics) is: Keep the core mechanic and character backstory (but not necessarily their reaction to it), change the other mechanics and details of the story to be more 'rational'. Hence HPMOR's Harry bears no resemblance to actual Harry Rational!Narutos bears no resemblance to canon Naruto, etc.

**** If that is the case, no Rational superhero story can exist, including yours eaglejarl ;) I'm going for the HPMOR route. Some aspects of the story are changed to allow for more rational decision-making (e.g. Shards not affecting psychology) and the core mechanics (Scion, Shards, powers, Endbringers, Protectorate etc.) and characters are kept. The problems of decision-making still exist.

Powers are not distributed 'fairly'. Some countries or family groups might have them disproportionately. Free-energy, for example, is considerably less free if it's tied up in one or two parahumans that can generate sufficient energy to sustain a power plant, and they are controlled by say... Romania. Powers many not have equal utility (Brutes vs Thinkers), and there might be exploitation of one group by another (Brute cannon fodder? Brute slaves in Thai fishing boats or Peruvian mines?).

You can dump future-tech into crappy planet, just as you can dump developed country-tech into a crappy country, but that doesn't mean all of them problems of the receiver of aid is resolved. Social institutions, co-operation problems, path dependency etc. all change the results for better or worse. If there's overall benefit, it still doesn't mean the receiver transitions overnight. It might still be interesting to explore the long-drawn transitions.

I was actually making two separate claims: (Worm is not a rational story) and (if you remove the parts that make it non-rational but keep all the flavor, you will end up with a post-Singularity story).

The reason I feel it's not rational is because everything about the story rests on "the shards are Conflict Balls" or "the Endbringers keep you from doing anything sensible." It's thinly disguised author fiat.

Actually, I should modify what I said earlier: you /can/ tell a pre-Singularity story in the setting you describe, you just don't have a big window in which to do it. You have until Dragon becomes unfettered, basically. If she never becomes unfettered, then you have a decade or two.

Well, considering Simurgh's POV section, the Endbringers might be a counter to Dragon's unfettering, since she's using the flapping of butterfly wings to pwn Dragon's boxen. Actually by that token, isn't Simurgh basically a UFAI that Eidolon unknowningly created? So, the grace period seems to extend to Dragon unfettering and Simurgh's pacification.

****** See, I'd argue it's /excellent/ author fiat. Don't look at Worm as a ground up build. It's entirely top down. It reminds me of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun][Shadowrun]]. If you're not familiar, Shadowrun is what happened when a late 80's rpg design lead declared "Let's mash up Neuromancer and Lord of the Rings. And do everything we can to race players down the rabbit hole of Authorial Fiat Bullshit." Wildbow started with the premise "world that looks recognizably like a superhero genre setting", and then tried to justify it as well as he could. "Nigh-Omniscient Idiot Space Whales" was a great one, pulled off extremely well for it's medium and editing realities.

In the story we see, her fetters can be loosened, but there have so far always been severe side effects. And I know people 'round these parts like to assume that the path from "strong, free AI" to "human irrelevancy" takes at most 3 hours, but it wouldn't violate my SoD if that took more like years/decades. Come to think of it, I'd love a fixfic in which Dragon Unbound shepherds humanity through a much more pleasant version of Accelerando.

There is a good chance that something akin to Toybox (a large, unstructured community of tinkers with no government affiliation) would still arise.

Once it hits critical mass, when all the cool toys are there and they're too tough and too useful to be worth opposing, it could even snowball into something much bigger. /Weaver Nine/'s Society, perhaps. The Endbringers are what prevents this in canon, and I'm not sure how much room rational!Worm has for Endbringers.

I don't think any government is going to tolerate a large, independent group of Tinkers just as they're not going to tolerate, say, a 10,000 strong mercenary force.

The Tinkers can claim to only use their power for self-defense all they like, but the government knows if they are subjected to some policy they don't like, they are going to use their leverage to ignore the government's authority.
