** Chapter 65 is [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2017/12/29/monitoring-renzo-posada-null/][here]].

Year 1 is done, and Heroes Save the World is now on (planned!) hiatus. It will be returning, with the first Sequence of Year 2, in mid-April. I've been working out what I need to do in order to accomplish my goals this year, and I anticipate publishing three Sequences (39 chapters) this year.

*** I look forward to it!

I don't know why this isn't more popular; it's one of the better webserials I've seen.

**** Unfortunately, I had some eye surgery and other stuff that led to the hiatus getting extended to August (since I also have grad school and a (very) small business that needs to stay running). I mentioned this in an off-topic thread, but if you're just now spotting this thread then you may not have seen that.
