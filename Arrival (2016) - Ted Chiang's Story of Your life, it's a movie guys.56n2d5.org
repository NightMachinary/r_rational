** I am honestly speechless. How did I not know about this earlier.. It's airing November 10. I think there has also been some pre-releases in some places - I first heard about it through a youtube movie review. But I did not know then that it was TED FREAKING CHIANG's. Someone else wrote the screenplay though. So psyched for this.

**** I was originally pretty worried when I read about the director (known for extremely violence in films) and friends were telling me the trailer had gunfire/panic, etc., but everything I've heard since then has made me pretty optimistic.

** The story gave me chills. It's extremely well written! I'm very much looking forward to the movie adaptation, though the trailer makes it seem more "violent" than the story was.

** GAH! When I saw the trailer it reminded me of his book - I didn't realize he helped write this movie! Man, I hope it does well so Ted Chiang gets a name boost, he has a lot of fantastic stories.
