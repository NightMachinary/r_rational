Hello, this is the first time i post here.

I have a world with "soft" magic ( I know this place is not for something like this, but because of my personal reason, i did not develop a hard system ) and i am in the process of developing it. But in the process there is some trouble : 1/ how do you develop magitech if you dont treat it as a alternative law of physics, rationally And 2/ What is the difference between educational system of magic and engineering.

I know it may sound awkwark, but still thank you for reading.


** It's fine to post soft-magic works here! Your magic system doesn't have to be explicitly detailed, it just has to be consistent. If Bob can throw a fireball on Monday then he should be able to do it again on Tuesday unless you show a reason that he can't.

I'm not sure what you're looking for with your post -- do you want help doing the worldbuilding?

*** Yes, but rationally.

I want to build a world with soft magic, and ofc, I have my magic systems. However, in which scenario that my world came to these magic system is what i am wondering, in the aspect of technology, education,and. epistemology

**** Perhaps, depending on how it works, make it into a soft science, an art, or a philosophy. Due to how difficult soft magic is to replicate results, it would make sense to at least putting it as a social science.

****** Make it intensely personal. Magic expresses differently in each individual, and can differ in a single person just between moods. Sociologists and psychologists can draw /some/ general conclusions, but each individual mage has to spend a lifetime mastering how magic works for /them/, which results in apprenticeship, or "Degree in General Studies" style learning being the best solution, and making mass production of magitech virtually impossible.

******** Fun interesting note, if magic is personal and based on your way of thinking/ emotions, then there would possibly be a surge of schools, each with its own traditions/ practices that work best for them. With a feedback loop and sounding chamber would reinforce people who already have similar thoughts to be more and more alike, allowing them to learn greater magics from each other and also be more and more seperated from the normal way of thinking. (Sort of like how political parties are view from the outside, except that conforming to the "stereotype" more and more gives you more power and status)

********* oh, and depending on the level of civilization they have reached there could also be thousand page grimoires that is just the variations on a single spell so that someone who wants to learn to, say cook some food, would have to try each individual spell, unless they made a system of classifications so you could guess which one would work best for you.

(Hypnosis and autohypnosis could be powerful tools in the right hands)

************* Brandon Sanderson is a notable author in the field. The Myst series was pretty awesome for it. Bartimaeus was a YA that did it... There are a good number of authors that do it, but not so many that it seems an overly popular genre.

****** There are ways. Depending on the art, it could innovate in certain ways. Does mahogany work better than canvas for painting magic and does the symbolic interaction work through it better? Or maybe certain colors make it better to manipulate opinions? Does paint made from one material work better than another, and so on. Focus on the art and metaphysics with a question of who'll use it, how, and why.

** Daystar Eld and Alexander Wales run a great podcast called Rationally Writing [[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/][here]] that has two episodes on magic systems [[http://www.daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-6/][here]] and [[http://www.daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-7/][here]]. Those should be able to answer most of your questions, if I remember what they covered correctly.

** The short version is that we can't really answer your question without knowing details of your setting.

The long version is a bit more complicated...

No matter what style of system you want to use, you need to start with a foundation. Thus, you need to get much more basic than this.

You need to answer the fundamental question of: /Why does this world have magic?/ And I mean that in the "meta" sense.

The answer will always be one of two things.

1) You want to create a system of magic and then go forwards, positing how it will influence the development of civilizations and nations until you reach a certain point in this developmental timeline you want to place your story/RPG. You take the skeleton of hypothetical changes and then flesh it out with details according both to what would logically follow and what you need to 'add' to ensure you get the setting you want.

2) You want your characters (both pro- and an- tagonists) to be able to do a specific thing or have a certain set of capabilities that normal beings of their type (usually humanoids) can't normally do. You build the system backwards from that point to establish how and why it works as it does. The "Magitech" and "education" will follow from this depending on the nature of the setting and the civilization you've designed.

** So did you develop it?

Maybe you like this blog: [[https://mythcreants.com/blog/how-to-create-an-eclectic-magic-system/]] It gives a guide to make stuff of fables and fairy tales (like witches, ghosts, wizards or cultivators) and make them somewhat work together rationally.

Answers to your questions (but I made some assumptions since I don't know your magic) laws for magitech can be as easy as in dnd, where you need some days, materials and you need to cast a similar spell every day to make a magic item with an effect.

or you have something magical (like dials in One Piece) and those can absorb for example fire. and then set it free. Or magic crystals that react to electricity/force.

To 2: Hard to answer without knowledge of your magic. Maybe it is the difference between artistic drawing (many styles) and technical drawing (there is a norm, how to do it).

*** kind of half-way to its final. The only thing i have to do left is the caster, the spell and the symbol. It is kind of complicated if you want to have a glimpse :

Domystichon talks about mystic system and mystic structure.
