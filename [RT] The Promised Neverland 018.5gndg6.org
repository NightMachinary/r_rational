** Ahhhhh. And there, my concern from last week's chapter is addressed. One of the other kids stumbling across a morse code book and pointing out that the owl in said book had morse code around it too, prompting Emma to go and look at the other owls she saw, is much more plausible than how it was initially presented. I am mollified :)

** They have been to careless in choosing where they talk .Now sister krone knows who they are and that will have conseuences, although this can be potentially usefull because if krone tries to overthrow mama that could be a good distraction to proceed with their plans , but it also could make the demons more focussed on this farm, which probably had less security measures since mama had a perfect historial of keping kids from trying to escape

** Am I the only one who has strong r!Animorphs flashbacks reading this?

Also, I feel this episode is a lot more nuanced, and realistic than the previous ones. The kids make mistakes, get emotional, etc. On the other hand, the pace of the story is slowing down way too much.

** Sister Krone has seen. So what? Mama already knows.

Not much of a "plot twist" and very little plot progression. :(

*** Sister Krone doesn't know Mama knows. And she /does/ know Mama hasn't told this to the overlords. Sister Krone now has something which she may think might help her usurp Mama's position.

*** Mama knows some. She doesn't know Ray is a double-agent, nor that Don and Gilda are in on it. This is very significant, and potentially deprives Ray of his status as a trump card. The kids now rely on Krone not telling Mama that she saw Ray, or they're probably done for.

This is an uncertain outcome. Mama knows some about the kids, Krone now knows all about the kids, the kids know that Mama knows some about the kids but not that Krone knows all about the kids, and Krone knows that Mama knows some about the kids, but not that Mama doesn't know all about the kids.

**** #+begin_quote
  Ray is a double-agent
#+end_quote

Would he be a double agent or a triple? I think triple. He's a kid (single) secretly working with mama (double) who is super-secretly working for the kids (triple)

***** The count starts at zero, I should think. After all, Emma or Norman aren't "spies" or "single-agents", they're just kids. In working for Mama, he's regular spy, or a single-agent, and in actually working for the kids, he's a double spy, or double-agent.

****** Hrm. I'm confused why you are equating 'spies' and 'single-agents', since a spy would usually fill the role of a double-agent by infiltrating the enemy.

For comparison, I would assign a soldier simply following orders the label 'single-agent' in this naming scheme.

******* Here are some definitions of the terms "double agent" and "triple agent". As these are terms I have heard used this way in conversation, could you refer to another source for your definitions?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_agent]] - In the field of counterintelligence, a double agent (also double secret agent) is an employee of a secret intelligence service, whose primary purpose is to spy on a different target organization, but who, in fact, is a member of the target organization.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_agent#Triple_agent]] - A triple agent pretends to be a double agent for one side, while he or she is truly a double agent for the other side.

By these definitions, Ray is a double agent if he is working with Mama who wants to spy on the Kids, but he is in fact on the side of the Kids. If he then decides to actually be on Mama's side and only pretend to be a double agent for the Kids, he is a triple agent.

******** he could be a quadruple agent if he turns out to be working for mama and he being a double agent was only what he told Norman to avoid suspicion once he was discovered(so he is a triple agent) , but then at the end he was working for them and he being a triple agent was what he told mama when she discovered that he had told them that he was a double agent.
