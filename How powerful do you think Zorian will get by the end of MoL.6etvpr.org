Judging by the first two arcs, we don't have many more chapters left, probably not more than 20. Now, I don't see how Zorian can get to Zach's or Xvim's level of magical expertise and raw power in 20 chapters unless a series of sudden power ups happens, and it just doesn't fit with MoL's style. The whole story is about the GRADUAL development and learning of the MC.

Having said that, I recall nobody103 hinting that Zorian will be immensely powerful by the end, fighting dragons, and generally becoming a one man army.

So, does it mean that an anime style power up is inevitable even though it doesn't fit with the story "realistic" learning curve?


** We didn't have a benchmark chapter or learning/defining chapter in a while so we can't say how powerful Zorian has become.

The last chapter when Zorian learned a new skill was when Xvim taught him about dimensional magic. After that we had a benchmark chapter when Zorian 'teleport locked' the lich.

Zorian doesn't have much mana to become a battle mage and I think if he uses blood magic to extend his mana capacity then may be he could fight a dragon. If you read the world building blog then you know Dragons are sentient beings with butt load of Mana which makes it extremely tough to be defeated by a human mage.

  "An archmage is not an official rank that someone assigns to a person," Xvim said. "It is simply a term for a mage who has mastered several fields of magic to such an extent that they could outdo a typical specialist mage when it comes to those fields. I suppose the term could be applied to me, but it would be shockingly arrogant of me to claim it on my own. One is only ever a real archmage when other people start referring to you as such, and not many people use that term to describe me. Then again, not many people know about me in the first place, and I prefer it that way..."

The largest upgrades directly to Zorian I foresee, my guess, would come in the from of blood magic and turning his teams of researches toward the goal of teaching him as much awesome stuff as possible.

** I hypothesize that Zorian is either going to obtain a single, specific, and huge power from a source other than education (such as a powerful artifact or time loop specific magic)

-- or there will be a tonal shift, probably characterized by an immense loss, Darker and Edgier, raised stakes, and a long period of time passing in the duration of a few chapters, in which Zorian acquires and consumes with utter focus a source of education that no one else has access to, likely in the form of a mentor such as a bound primordial or the ghost serpent, and this period of learning may include time acceleration effected by the mentor.

** Honestly?

Literally zero more powerful.

We have had chapter after chapter of time travel, powerleveling.

At this point in time in the story, we are no longer worried about the powerleveling part. We are spending the vast majority of time focusing on the plot of the story.

Which is a good thing! There is only a year or so left in story, For them to complete their goal. The future chapters will hopefully focus mostly on the story, vs spending on powerleveling.

** We don't have that many chapters left, but we do have plenty of /time/. I'm pretty sure Z&Z have about 50 loops left, maybe 40 given recent chapters, and each loop is a month of real time, a month in Cyoria's Black Room, and something like a month in other Black Rooms.

So with 3 months per loop, we're talking 120-150 months left in the time loop overall. That's 10-13 years of time, and Zorian's only spent like 5 years in the time loop by now. With the extraordinary resources and opportunities time loops provide (such as coaxing powerful mages out of their prized spells and such) Zorian's still got plenty of time to grow.

*** There were 4 years worth of loops left when they found out about the time limit and I believe almost a year has passed since then, which would leave at most 40 30 day loops (3.3 years) assuming they never die, maybe less. They do get a full extra 30 days in Cyoria's black room, 17 in another, and 5 in the last one per loop if they use them all, but each time he uses one Zorian's simulacrums get dismissed so who knows if he will use all of them each loop. I would say if they never die in a loop and max out black room use each time, Zorian has a little under 9 years left in the loop. Seeing as he already has been there for just under 6 years, that would mean he would have a total linear time in the loop of nearly 15 years. Let's say 14 because I don't think they will risk cutting it that close to the loop running out of energy. So he would be roughly 35 years old in linear time by the time he exits the loop. I'm agreeing with you, just trying to figure out the exact times.

EDIT: Also I guess being able to create simulacrums counts as a force multiplier for what he can get done each loop, although he can't use them for training tasks, he can use them for knowledge and busywork tasks.

It might not fit Zorian's character /at all/, but technically by the end of the loop he should have little trouble securing himself a politically advantageous marriage that alleviates this problem. I'm pretty sure that even if it looks like he'd need to do so to save the world or something, he'd still rather use all his resources to find an alternative solution.

** I believe to remember the following from text:

- Soul bonds exist and a stronger personality can dominate a weaker personality via one.
- Sharing mana between mages is possible and gets easier with repetition.
- Zorian can turn mana into additional copies of himself.

This lead me to the way to specific hypothesis that Zorian might end up creating a Simulacrum spell variant that creates a copy of him soul bound to a target. The copy then dominates the target (I'm assuming being a trained psychic means you have an overwhelmingly powerful personality) and then learns to use the targets mana to sustain his existence/fuel his spells.

The net effect of this combination of spells is an exponentially growing number of Zorians, at least until he runs out of morally acceptable targets.

This would run into problems when the Simlulacra start diverging, but maybe Zorian can solve this problem ahead of time by using the aranea's secret cache to place appropriate compulsions on himself.

Yeah, that is a possibility. I don't know how well it would work, though, transplanting a soul into a different body. Necromancers can do it, sure, but it affects the quality of their work. I suspect that RR would have to adapt to Zach's body; he wouldn't be in top form. And he wouldn't get Zach's mana reserves, at least.

You're gravely mistaken. MoL was always going to be 3 arcs. We knew that ages ago. In fact, the author planned it all out in advance, and from what he's said, he's actually trimmed parts (that weren't plot-critical).

Reaching the Gate and then being told it's locked, RR has already reached the real world, you survived due to undefined programming behavior in unexpected conditions, is not that much different to the end of arc 1, where their attempt to catch RR, find out everything he knows about the loop, and get ZZ working together instead blew up with the aranea getting erased from the loop, Zorian going on the run, and RR escaping the loop.

No doubt arc 3, which currently is cruising with overpowered ZZ, will again build up tension as they approach the real world and challenges too big for even their skills.
