So narrative pattern being a focal point of WTC I wanted to share some thoughts about it and how it informs us on where we stand in the story as well as what we can expect in the future.

To begin with I would like to introduce those unaware to the work of Joseph Campbell on the subject. He developed a theory from studying various mythology around the globe and to resume it quickly, it's about how every story is always the same. His book The Hero with a Thousand Faces is still the reference on the hero's journey, which steps are as follow :

- Ordinary World

- Call to Adventure

- Refusal of the Call

- Meeting the Mentor

- Commiting to the Journey

- Test, Allies & Enemies

- Prepare to confront the danger

- Ordeal

- Reward

- The Road Back to normal world

- The final opponent

- Return with benefit

Of course these are rough guidelines. Some of these steps may not be included because the story starts along the way for example. Some steps can last longer while others are quickly passed by. But it's interesting nonetheless to have the pattern in mind.

Now let's talk about WTC. Every arc is a different adventure that follow this pattern quite reliably :

- All of Juniper quests are on stand by which is the refusal of the call quest. (he could try to do the locus quest in priority for example but he doesn't, currently he/they doesn't feel like it's the most pressing matter).

- He does commit to a quest (commiting to the journey) when someone provides him with new information or when he faces a situation which make the matter an immediate necessity (that's the role of the mentor which doesn't necessarily remain a mentor for the rest of the journey).

- Then he meets people in the process (allies & enemies)

- He has something really hard to do (ordeal)

- To get what he needed in the first place (reward)

- Before he simply returns something even harder and more personal comes up (road back)

- He must face it (final opponent)

- He comes back home and does good with what he earned during the journey (might be material or a lesson or a companion by the way)

The last arc in the library for example is textbook example of this pattern. But since the sum of all the arcs is also a big hero's journey in itself, we can expect the same pattern... Currently we stand at the Allies & Enemies (companions on one side, known threats such as Fel Seed, infernals or voidbeast on the other) and we repeat cycles of Prepare for danger - Ordeal - Reward in which he grows stronger and more mature. But what can we expect next and in the endgame? Well at some point he will try to break free from the repetitive pattern, if only to avoid Uther's misfortunes. That is breaking out of the magic world which is the same as the way back to the normal world. To do that he will need to confront an even stronger opponent (GM seems pretty obvious). In the end, it can happen that the hero choose to remain in the magical world but it's very rare and unlikely. Because he grew so much during his journey, he is now equipped to fix the ordinary world he came from. Staying in the comfort of the mastered magic world would be the selfish choice whereas coming back to make a change for better is the heroic choice. Also worthy of note that sometimes the hero doesn't get to choose (like Narnia for example)

So I'm telling you all this because Juniper said something in today's chapter : "I don't want to go back to Earth" (chap 144). Which shows that he's far from ready to go further in the journey. Sorry buddy, you don't want to, but you will... And I'll be crying man-tears when you part with Amaryllis forever.

Another question it raises is what happened to Uther? Was he stuck in the loop because he was dead in the normal world so there was no 'way back home'? Maybe he actually completed the journey and got back but I doubt it. I think he could never complete the journey because he never trusted his companions the way Juniper does. So he never actually got past the Allies & Enemies step. What do you guys think of all this?


** I don't think the author will be that formulaic with his writing, and I don't think the GM will either. Any similarities to the hero's journey exist as much to be subverted as anything else. I don't think things are going to end with Juniper going back to earth just because "the hero's journey says he has to!". The narrative may have a role to play, but I doubt it'll be that blatant. I mostly believe the GM that he doesn't have set outcomes to everything in mind, and while I'm sure the author does, the in-story narrative appears to mostly take place firmly inside of the fourth wall, I doubt the author himself is ever going to be relevant to the story.

Besides, the pattern DOESN'T really apply to the journey so far. He hasn't really refused the call as such, he was thrust into the situation with little choice but to go along with it, and didn't really at any time complain about "wanting his old life back". He misses a few of his friends, but he'd very clearly rather be in Aerb than on Earth. And while he's had a few mentors over the course of the story so far, I wouldn't say he's met THE mentor.

You may have a point with some of the arcs being micro-scale hero's journeys, but I doubt the overall story will be one.

*** I'm just saying it's common for stories to end where they started. It just wraps up loose ends nicely. That's Dan Harmon's story circle which is a simplification of Campbell's work.

Refusal of the call is a bit unclear, it's not that they haven't thought of it but all the discussion about narrative that we get points out to how much that would be a bad idea. Juniper expresses distaste for becoming the new Uther numerous times. Maybe it kinda counts? It's thin I'll give you that and it's the one subversion so far. [EDIT : Actually, we're more in a situation of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/THeHerosJourney][Resigned to the Call]] which is a variation] However I think it reveals thoughtful character design and the opposition of his want and need

- Usually, a hero would have a distinct WANT and NEED. The WANT is why the hero engage on the quest : find the graal, stop the bad guy, get a ton of money, restore peace on Aerb ; whereas the NEED in the true hole in the hero that gets highlighted by the trials. By the end of the story, the want can be given up because the need is the most important.

- In Juniper case, the WANT is to forever live in Aerb, the land of fun and magic, where he made friends, where he's super-strong. It's a comforting place for him. But the adventure and the entire world is designed to push him to his NEED which would be to come to term with the loss of his friend, to understand how he's hurt people close to him and to give him the will to apologize and be a better person

As for the mentor, there's one in each mini-arc from Amaryllis in the first one. In the grand scheme of things, I'd make a strong case for the GM being the mentor. Before meeting him, the story was simply about surviving the immediate threat but he provided an endgame that gave the hero determination to proactively engage on the journey. The mentor is the one that steels the hero's determination to undergo the journey, he's not necessarily good.

*** Campbell's work is descriptive of mythology and includes a number of notable stretches. Dan Harmon's [[https://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][story circle method]] is a prescriptive adaptation of it, much looser in the steps, and largely predicated on what makes people see "story" rather than "series of connected events". If you did [[https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Frational+%22story+circle%22][the following Google search]], =site:reddit.com/r/rational "story circle"=, you'd find that the author of /Worth the Candle/ is responsible for almost all the hits that you'll get, and has [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][written a blog post]] detailing how he planned to use that method in a prior work.

(The author's personal opinion is that Harmon /also/ overstates the case about universality, but that this method of storytelling probably /is/ wired in people, specifically in terms of what people desire from stories, and it's likely the similarity to the "comfort zone" social science model isn't coincidence, but more studies would need to be done to determine a social or biological basis for what makes stories tick.)

The extent to which /Worth the Candle/ applies either the monomyth or story structure methods, or subverts or plays with them, is an obviously an open question until the work is completed, but that's as much evidence of authorial preference as I think exists, excepting whatever may or may not have been said in episodes of Rationally Writing (there, I think [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-11/][Story Structure pt 1]], [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-12/][Story Structure pt 2]], [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-26/][Tabletop RPGs vs Writing]], and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-42/][Worth the Candle]] would probably have the most insight, but I haven't relistened to them.)

Are you perhaps under the impression Aerb isn't "real"? I'm pretty sure that was Uther's conclusion, but Juniper wants to believe, and so do I.

Could he? He could be working harder to grind loyalty with the Locus, although he did mean to do that:

  “Okay,” I said. I turned back to my things. “I'm just in the middle of packing up. I'm going to be living in the tree soon, in the bottle, to be with the locus.

The thing I'm thinking of is Glassy Fields, given that the bottle is glass...that might be high on their list of priorities, given that they almost went there before Kuum Doona.

Anyway, locus aside, my point was that everything remain on standby until something happens or someone come forward with information that makes one matter more pressing than the others marking the beginning of a new mini-arc.

  “Any chance that you'd have indexed the Second Empire's research efforts on the loci?” I asked.

  “Possibly, but unlikely,” said Raven. “No one has had any cause to go looking for them, given they've been assumed eradicated for centuries. I should warn you that late into the Second Empire, it was standard practice to lace classified documents with cognitohazards.”
#+end_quote

But I think Raven knows some countermeasures, and Joon has Spirit which should help, and Bethel is immune, so between them they presumably can deal with that.

Actually, I think they already went through the loci research:

#+begin_quote
  The day before we were set for our expedition to Darili Irid, Amaryllis and I spent a week in the chamber together, mostly so that I could read through the books her other self had written, and she could read through the other books (notably, the locus materials and Fel Seed manifests) and practice her newfound skill in Spirit.
#+end_quote

So it seems like it wasn't helpful; I guess they risked the infohazards, or had Bethel check it for known infohazards, or else it wasn't from that late in the 2nd Empire and there wouldn't have been infohazards, or maybe it just wasn't classified because all the loci they knew of were dead by then. (I think there is a line directly to that effect that the research was useless, but we can infer it from this one anyway.)

#+begin_quote
  my point was that everything remain on standby until something happens or someone come forward with information that makes one matter more pressing than the others marking the beginning of a new mini-arc

They have been mostly reactive, which they have noted in-story, although the current Atheaenium arc was pretty much chosen by them.

I don't think that's the same as refusing the call, though. It's more being unable to answer the call directly, yet.

They definitely are trying to get to the point where they can tackle major priorities directly, though.
