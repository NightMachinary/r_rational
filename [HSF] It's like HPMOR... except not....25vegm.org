** The perfect example on [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/][why intelligence isn't the opposite of stupidity]]. Harry in this story behaves like an average person /imagines/ hyper-intelligent people to behave, and the story is written around him so it doesn't become a problem.

*** Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Given the parallels to HPMOR and the fact that it's far less realistic and rationalist, it almost feels like a how-not-to-write-like-Eliezer guide.

*** Just remember it's not Science at all, it's /Mad Science!!!!!/ - the difference is that one works, and the other usually crops up in media.

I agree that it's not really rationalist at all though... nor does it fit the [HSF] tag.
