** Read up to the current chapter; I'm still very much enjoying it, even if I don't like all the characters. Which is not to say I dislike the story; Holden Caulfield being a totally unlikable protagonist doesn't make /Catcher in the Rye/ any less of a worthy read.

Then I read the comments on the final chapter. What the absolute hell is wrong with some of these people? I swear it sounds like some MRA group latched onto the story and hate that Colin is becoming less of a curmudgeon and gets "manipulated" into sex by a girl he actually fancies but fears getting close to.

It was just so odd to finish the chapter and think to myself "I wonder if anyone else has theories that Cheng is actually a Visitor like I do?" and then see the vitriol spewed there.

**** It's nice that you're optimistic about these things, that attitude can go far in dealing with constant disagreement on your work. Which is something that can stop or ruin creating works for many artists.

Now to give slight review of new book.

Ten days until new chapters? After such a tease? You are a cruel man.

humor is still great, though a bit sparse I feel in comparison to previous 100 chapters, though that can be due to be binging them and reading new ones as they come. Dunno.

I am a bit miffed that Colin didn't go pyro on the monsters that kill Attica. A deterrent works if it is used.

I also feel other characters need more development. Dudley, Flossie, Clara a substantial amount; Maurice (more comic/movie related shenanigans/playing) and Jenny (I don't feel her love of Colin and motives, also how does Colin look like? is he even moderately attractive? I think its my mental model that cant get over Jenny liking him based on personality) a moderate amount.

Shame if Laney doesn't play a bigger role in story, I adore her character and her interaction with Colin (general interaction, not romance related)

Keep up the good work. Know that I have refreshed your pages every day this week just to read a bit more of your story.

***** Thanks. I think I drifted into more emotional territory this book,with the whole Attica thing. The way i write means a lot of it comes down to whatever mood I'm in on the day.

Same with the side characters. I always mean to flesh them out more, but deadlines loom and I rush to write something that at least makes sense (barely in some cases).

As for the comments, it's such a relief to have readers I really don't mind them having a go, even if they sometimes horribly misinterpret what I'm trying to say. Better than being ignored.

*** My educated guess is the proportion of readers from [[/r/rational]] is much smaller and most readers come from Royalroad, where the overall quality of series and reader discussion is much lower.

It's a shame since the comments are the most active discussion platform I've come across, yet you have to dig through incessant complaints that the main ship isn't to their taste.

About your theory, I think that /if/ Cheng is a visitor, he's not likely to have a human form, which could be possible if baseline humans can be mutated into monsters (might explain the wide variance in species we see in the camp versus the homogeneous races introduced earlier). Some alternatives are: he could be a descendant of the first visitors, he's currently connected with visitor(s), Colin is the Chosen One to receive the heirloom scroll passed down the ages (jk), or someone taught him the magic word for dealing with Englishmen.

** Thanks, Mooderino! Take a break if you need one, I'm sure you'll be just as awesome a week from now.

I am pretty hyped up about this development with Cheng, but the uncertainty of Colin/Jenny sustained from the very beginning has finally been resolved, so of course that's what most of the comments are about.

For weeks now we've been rather vocal about how we wanted that ship to sink. How does just-leave-me-alone Colin work with I-know-what's-best-for-you Jenny? She seems awfully self-righteous and the sort of person who would try to "fix" him with her love and make him feel guilty when it inevitably turns out that he isn't fixable.

Would Colin be happier if he were less prickly and insecure, and instead a more outgoing, trusting person with a positive outlook on life? Sure. Also all of them idiots would have been dead.

I just hope this story isn't going to take a turn to where he is "transformed by the power of love" or something. I guess I'll just have to trust the author. Mood has been good at subverting expectations so far.

I don't want it to turn all rainbows and bunnicorns from now on romance-wise because that would be unrealistic given the protagonist's personality. But neither do I want to read much Colin/Jenny relationship angst. That would be a bit too real for this lighthearted escapist piece of fiction.

Maybe my issue is that I recognize myself in Colin? Well, good luck to him anyway. As for me, I will die alone, and I will deserve it.

** I have to ask, how much were some of the characters influenced by the IT cowed?

I had a little chuckle when I imagined Maurice as Moss...

Anyway, enjoyable read and I can't wait til you get back at it.

*** Not at all actually. It was only after someone mentioned Moss that I saw the resemblance, but personally I always envisioned him more like Eddie Murphy's character from [[http://www.movieactors.com/photos-2003/murphy89.jpeg][Bowfinger]]. This is because that's what the real guy looks like and his name actually is Maurice.
