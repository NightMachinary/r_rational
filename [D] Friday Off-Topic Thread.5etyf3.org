Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** The rationalist community has been pretty spread out lately, as far as I can tell. The death of lesswrong, most of the core being physically close enough that a lot of stuff happens IRL. The simple fact that the better known people have enough money to fly across the country for meetups and the like...

How can we consolidate rationalists into a more useful block? We have a pretty clear agenda, "raise the sanity waterline", use evidence to decide what policies to implement, interact with other sane people more often, etc.

But, most of the really competent rationalists end up doing their own stuff, and not spending a lot of time community-building. With a few notable exceptions, right now [[/u/daystareld]] as an example.

What kind of institutions could we create to help budding rationalists? Are there any tools that you'd like it if they existed? Can we consolidate the communities strength into a sharp cutting point to accomplish some important goals?

*** Growing a community like this one is hard, consolidating it is only slightly less hard. I wish I had the money or influence to do things like organize and attend meetups, maybe even set up an East Coast CFARS, but I don't see it happening in the foreseeable future.

As for important goals that require coordination, rather than individual things like being an Effective Altruist, there is one thing I've been thinking about: raising the sanity waterline by introducing more people to rationalist ideas and principles and content.

I've been working not just to produce content across different mediums (stories, podcasts, and now a board game) but also grow the community by recommending other rational fiction and podcasts to people I know in a variety of settings. But in that I'm only an individual of practically no influence, relatively speaking. There are a number of things people can do to that end, like maintaining TvTropes pages for rationalist stories, which helps add more potential inroads for people to find their way into the rationalist community through its media. But on an even bigger level, I've often thought of how useful it would be to encourage famous people who might be rationally inclined but not "uniform wearing" rationalists (thinking of people like CGP Grey or Derek from Veritasium) to make videos on some of the Sequences, or just generally become aware enough of the rational community and principles to mention them on occasion in podcasts or videos that they're relevant to.

Other fanbases that would mutually benefit from exposure might be linked to specific works. For example, if Pokemon youtubers with wide fanbases or well known artists like [[/u/arvalis]] are also interested in reading realistic pokemon stories, there can be a cross-promotion between my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Origin of Species]] and his [[http://arvalis.deviantart.com/gallery/39915677/Realistic-Pokemon][Deviant Art]] following.

I don't know how much of the above is possible by "coordination," but I think the chances of it happening improves dramatically the more people are aware of it as a goal and occasionally work on it. If there's someone in the rationalist community whose uncle's best friend is one of DC Comics producers, for example, they should totally try and make them aware of Metropolitan Man, just on the chance that they really enjoy it and contact [[/u/alexanderwales]] about adapting his story into its own issues.

Things like that would be huge for making the rationalist community more mainstream, slowly and subtly but surely. And the wider the community becomes, the more in-person meetups can occur, and the more influential in the public sphere, the higher our ability to raise the sanity waterline and coordinate on the /truly/ important things, like raising awareness of existential risks and dangerous societal issues.

Just a thought.

I think one of the best ways to do that on the micro-scale is to become so well versed in the most important take-aways that you can briefly teach someone a searchable term and its meaning in casual conversation. Not sure how effective it is. Small potential for life-changing impact over a diffuse population.

**** Pokemon has a huge fan-base, but it's hard to get people interested. Including it as a recommendation next time he posts a realistic pokemon drawing to the pokemon sub is probably a good start.

But I'd be hard pressed to post OoS to a pokemon related subreddit and say "here, read this". Or rather, it wouldn't get a lot of votes.

How could we make it "catch" better? My first thought is a mini-comic. Maybe professor oak explaining what's going on?

If you storyboarded a few pages, I know at least one guy I could pitch it to to try and get it arted in. There are probably better options then that even.

A lot of the interludes work as good "entry points" to get people interested in the story without spoiling anything: specifically the Mewtwo interlude, or the one with Janine in Fuschia.

And I'd totally be willing to storyboard some scenes. I'll see if I can get it done in the next couple weeks.

Really, the current issue is that there is no central force behind the community directing activity, so even if everyone agrees that something needs to be done, it isn't actually being done, because most things require coordination and precommitment from multiple people or they won't be able to happen.

So, is the solution to write a "the world is a video game" story /only/ after you've created a framework game into whose progression paths /everything/ portrayed in canon can be slotted rationally? (For example: The widely-varying attributes, equipment, and spells of /Dark Souls 2/ would make a fairly-rational framework for a fantasy combat adventure, if all the enemies were hostile NPCs [rather than most enemies' being fantasy monsters]. Both the player and every DS2 NPC are playing by almost /exactly/ the same rules.

So a lot of my free time this week was absorbed by Thanksgiving and doing my best effort to insert “bah, humbug” into conversations whenever feasible.  This update is thus mostly concerned with not breaking the combo and keeping things rolling.

[[/u/Dwood15]] and Xavion have both been helping create the prototype monster generator.  It's not yet at a sharable point, but stay tuned!

I may come back and edit this post once I have caught up with the log archiving (I'm a week out of date).  Tho it seems like there's not a ton of things to show in these posts, we had a few tens of thousands of words to the log each week, and there's always a lot of good discussion, even if it's just coming to a consensus on how things should work.

All this information we post here is hosted on machines we do not control. Therefore we cannot expect to ever truly be in control of it. This does not bother me.

As for the reddit quality, to control the quality you have to seek out specific communities. In seeking out specific communities you inevitably end up with people searching for the same things as you, which leads to the echo chamber. I'm torn on this concept, as I would prefer to choose the company I keep and the content I peruse, but on the other hand this sort of self-segregation is a factor in our division as a nation.

What CTR didn't realize was that the simple act of attempting to delegitimize the [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]] subreddit legitimized the complaints from the Trump supporters about liberal bias in media, social and otherwise.

CTR's meddling in [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]], and Reddit's failure to do anything about it, infuriated Trump supporters, and might have even impacted some close races.

It was also stated quite matter-of-factly by several reporters who should have been reporting unbiased news, that there was no place for objectivity in covering Donald Trump, because he was such a terrible candidate. In fact a couple actual articles were written to that effect, not just social media comments.

The media needed and still needs a browbeating, but what they need more is a representative population of liberals and conservatives, not a nearly 20-to-1 ratio.

I heard a conservative pundit indicate that part of the reason for this journalistic bent towards the left is that the lions share of students acquiring journalism degrees are doing so from left-leaning colleges. How much research went into that claim, I do not know, but it sounds plausible.
