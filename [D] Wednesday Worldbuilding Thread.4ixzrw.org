Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}

/This week's thread brought to you on Thursday, due to technical difficulties. From next week, it will be posted @3PM UTC on the correct day by [[/u/automoderator]]/


** Could we add a request to the original text post (and the text posts of future WW threads) that people who explicitly mention if they're offering these ideas to general usage? Sometimes you just want to bat an idea around for a bit and don't actually intend to use it, so being clear about this would be helpful.

(Also, this is really wonderful. Thanks for making it a thing.)

** My most recent bit of worldbuilding mentioned the existence of reactionless thrusters. They're not particularly powerful, in traditional scifi terms - but they still laugh at Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation. How many ways do you think that the physics that allows such things would have further knock-on effects?

For your entertainment (and assuming Reddit doesn't wonkify the formatting), here's the current draft of the relevant snippet, which takes the form of an IM conversation:

#+begin_quote
  2: So, what's the most WTF factoid /you/'ve picked up so far?

  1: They've got genuine, honest-to-Klono reactionless thrusters.

  1: Electricity goes in, unbalanced forces go out. No reaction mass, no exhaust.

  2: Okay, yep, not something I'd have predicted. Figure out how they work?

  1: Most of the math seems to be based more on info-sci than physics, but I've got the pop-sci gist.

  1: Premise: There are 'info horizons', from beyond which no information is allowed to leak to a given object. One such horizon: at the Hubble distance, where the universe is expanding away at the speed of light. Another horizon: When an object accelerates, a similar "Rindler" horizon forms in the direction the object accelerates away from.

  1: Theory: The universe treats these horizons /seriously/, and doesn't let you use clever tricks to extract info from beyond them.

  1: One such clever trick would be to use long-wave radiation, part of whose waveforms extend beyond the horizon. So radiation with certain long waves is disallowed.

  1: A common result: there is more space on the side of an object without the horizon than the side with it, resulting in more vacuum energy on the horizon-free side, resulting in a force pushing it towards the horizon. (Ala the Casimir effect, in which disallowed waves lead to lower vacuum energy within the space than outside it, leading to a pressure from the outside pushing in.)

  1: This apparently explains what inertial mass actually is.

  1: Another result: Because the vacuum-energy can't have wavelengths bigger than the Hubble radius, there's a minimum possible acceleration.

  1: This apparently explains galaxy rotations without dark matter, and cosmic acceleration without dark energy.

  1: Various other details explain the Pioneer anomaly, and the flyby anomaly, and predicted a few other anomalies that had gone unnoticed.

  1: Tech: If you bounce light back and forth, the bouncing is acceleration, and creates some "Rindler" horizons fairly close. By some clever building of the thing the light bounces in, those horizons can be tweaked so that the vacuum energy is more unequal on one side of the object than another, leading to what seems to be an unbalanced force on the object.

  2: If that's the best explanation you can give so far, you need to do more reading.

  2: ... The reactionless thrusters. How powerful are they?

  1: One of the first things I asked myself. I've done some modelling.

  1: There's a standard, containerized thorium-cycle pebble-bed reactor which outputs 60 megawatts electric.

  1: Apparently, a reactionless thruster that takes in 60 MWe produces about 3,000 Newtons of force. (I still don't grok Newtons either. That's about 675 pounds-force, or the equivalent of 305 kg in 1 gravity.)

  1: Put together the pebble-bed and its magnetohydrodynamic generator, the heat-tubes and radiators, the thruster itself, a few misc pieces, and round up, and we're talking a minimum of 200,000 kg.

  1: That works out to a max thrust of around 1.52 milligees, or 0.015 m/s^{2.} Nowhere near enough to lift off Earth, or Luna.

  1: But /in/ space, Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation no longer applies. So it would have an annual delta-v budget of around 475 km/s.

  2: !

  1: Yeah.

  1: To put that in perspective: One year of acceleration takes you 50 AU. Well, three years if you want to stop when you get there, instead of plowing into whatever's there with a kinetic energy of 25 petajoules, aka 6 megatons.

  2: !!!

  1: I know.

  2: No, not that. How are we still alive right now?

Anyway, you can't get a reactionless drive without also getting perpetual motion and free-energy machines. Why is this? I'll use your numbers to illustrate:

After 1 year, you get a kinetic energy of 25 petajoules, right? That's after a full year of 60 MW. Well, 25 petajoules per year is equal to 793 billion joules per second. 60 MW is 60 million joules per second. /So you put in 60 MW and get 793 GW out./

I'm willing to bite that particular bullet, if it's unavoidable. (Though probably with the in-universe proviso that such energy is no more 'free' than that of the Casimir effect.)

But before I do, do you (or anyone else reading this) know of any remotely plausible design to extract /useful/ work, such as electricity, when it takes at least 20 kilowatts to a ~30 kg gizmo (and probably higher for both numbers, for these smaller, less efficient designs) to produce each Newton of thrust?

Or, is there another subreddit I can ask this particular question?

***** You just put it on a ring that spins horizontally on a vertical axle and you put a generator on the axle and you are good to go.

edit:

I figured I might as well explain why this works and at the same time see how feasible such a powerplant might be.

Kinetic energy of a moving object is proportional to the mass of the object times the square of the velocity. At rest, your hypothetical MiHsC free-energy generator would consume 60 million joules to reach 0.015 m/s of velocity, assuming it's literally the spacecraft you proposed, taped to a stick that's attached to an electric generator. That takes exactly one second. Anyway, after one second, the MiHsC free-energy generator is carrying 200,000 * 0.015^{2} or 45 joules of kinetic energy. Shit, pretty lousy return for 60 million joule input!

The next second, it would take another 60 million joules to accelerate a further 0.015 m/s, to reach 0.3 m/s. It now carries 180 joules. That's not twice as much as after one second, but four times! The next second, it reaches 0.045 m/s and carries 405 joules, which is 9 times as much as after the first second. That's increasing quadratically. Meanwhile, the total energy cost has been 60 million, 120 million, and 180 million joules, which is a linear increase.

At some point, there's a break-even point, and you can extract (through the electric generator) as much energy as is being added to the system through the reactionless acceleration. At this point, you have a perpetual-motion device as you could deactivate the power plant and power the drive by its own acceleration. Let it go a little further, and you'll be extracting more energy than is required to run the MiHsC free-energy generator, meaning you can keep it running and make use of the additional energy.

My back-of-the-envelope calculations show it would take about a year to spin up to this speed, which is about 15000 m/s, assuming some losses to friction and so on. That's Mach 15, so very very fast, but far from relativistic. So far, we've only considered the most naive construction: In "reality", you would skip the whole nuclear powerplant issue and just start it spinning with the electric generator, which is also a motor. You would also run a power line to the MiHsC free-energy generator, since it's needed anyway in order to run off of its own generated electric power. Then the thing could start supplying net power after only a few hours of spin-up, and would not require anything near 60MW to get started. Anyway, at this point, the faster it spins, the more extra MW it can produce. Larger wheels produce lower G-forces and allow faster speeds and greater output. If we're assuming 50% power loss through friction and whatever, a wheel going Mach 16 would generate 6MW and a wheel going Mach 17 generates 12MW, and it just goes up (quadratically) from there.

Alright, how does this sound to you?

  2: Wait, reactionless thrusters... why bother with the pebble-bed reactor, instead of a perpetual motion generator?

  1: Well, about that.

  1: Remember, this thruster-thing works by carefully channeling the way light bounces to mold the Rindler horizons to be asymmetrical in particular ways.

  1: If the thruster is stationary, the math is easy-peasy. If it's accelerating in a straight line, still easy. When it's rotating, though, with an acceleration that's not in a straight line, like going around in a circle to run a generator, then the math combining material properties, EM fields, and the Rindler horizons gets pretty hairy. Maybe not three-body-problem hairy, but still bad.

  1: The general upshot is, the faster the thruster in a generator is spun, the less efficiently it generates thrust.

  1: There are some people who have very good math saying that trying to extract more energy than is put in this way is quite impossible.

  1: There are some other people who have very good math saying that there's no inherent obstacle to extracting useful energy from the vacuum.

  1: And some members of the latter group are pouring gobs of money towards improving the efficiency of rotating thrusters, ala the Big Fusion projects circa 2010s.

  1: And some members of the latter group are crackpots with basement supercomputers and machine shops, trying to gain recognition as 'The Guy Who Cracked Over-Unity'.

******* There is one way to avoid free energy from reactionless drives. It requires them to break Galilean relativity. That is, give the universe one preferred rest frame of motion that the ke of the device is measured against. Thrust would decline with the square of the velocity in this frame. A reasonable frame to use would be the comoving frame of the cosmic microwave background, a few hundred km/s relative to the sun. For velocities in the tens of km per second around the solar system its close enough to isotropic but at the hundreds of km per second or more required for interstellar stuff, it starts becoming much faster and cheaper to travel against the motion of the sun relative to said background giving a preferred direction for travel towards the blueshifted side of the sky. Side effect: you can tell your exact velocity by turning one of these on and pointing it in a few directions and the universe is no longer isotropic.

** I would like to get suggestions about how much of an advantage, long lived races would have in a fantasy setting. I'm creating a heavily homebrewed pathfinder setting.

I think the long lived races are crazily underpowered in vanilla pathfinder. I just don't see any way that a species like elves, that has potentially hundreds of years more experience than a human can receive no massive skill boosts and other stuff.

Another thing that draws my ire is that races get bonuses once they reach certain age milestones (middle age, old and venerable) which grant bonuses to mental stats and penalties to physical stats. The insane part is that /those two things are linked/ so shorter lived races age faster, but also gain the mental bonuses faster.

I hate this, because it makes no sense that if a human and an elf that are both adult ages for their race that the human would somehow gain a +3 to his mental stats over the next 50 years but an elf living the same life as that human would gain nothing.

So assuming you are willing to accept potential level adjustments, how would you make long lived fantasy races be realistically represented rule-wise due to their age?

Some notes on setting: The setting is medieval, and the world runs on magic not physics for the most part, this disallows most technological advances. Sufficiently complicated machines won't even work due to the random magical effects at small but still macroscopic scales. For instance mechanical wristwatches would fail basically immediately, because of how much precision they require. /I'm also deliberately nerfing permanent magic effects, and items to prevent this from turning into a magitech setting./

I am attempting to make this a setting that is actually modern in terms of say rationality, in some places at least. However I am trying to nerf magic and make many technologies impossible so that the setting stays for the most part pure fantasy with very little magitech/sci-fi stuff mixed in.

*** Well, part of the problem is that your level is a reflection of your experience, so most elves should just be high level and most humans should just be low level. This would reflect their relative benefits pretty well, since it's just /demographics/ rather than requiring any changes to mental abilities.

If you don't like the mental stat increases, just remove them. I've always thought that it was a little bit weird to get mental bonuses just because you're old. The bonus seems like it's a reflection of experience, rather than biology, and we already have levels to represent the effects of experience. If there's a human who's ninety years old and is only level one, on what basis is he more wise, smart, or charismatic than his fifteen-year-old level one traveling companion?

--------------

There are a few ways that you can "fix" things without needing level adjustments or anything like that. For example, maybe the long-lived races are just less good at gaining experience than humans; a human can pick up a trade in a few months, but an elf would take a decade to reach the same level of proficiency. The elf's comparative advantage is that he can keep on going, slowly gaining mastery over what would be a lifetime to a human, and once he's a master, he can keep on going past that, until he's a grandmaster, and it's not like he's going to die anytime soon after that.

The only way that this fails is for player characters, who by necessity need to all level at roughly the same rate. But it's not too hard to just say that player characters are special for some in-universe reason.

--------------

As for how much of an advantage age is ... it's not actually that much of an advantage. Living long allows you to acquire more skills and accrue more knowledge, but both those things atrophy with time. I took French classes in college and remember very, very little. I used to remember all of the lyrics to Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby" but now I'd be lucky if I could get through half of them. And I can't play Halo nearly as well as when I was pouring ten hours a day into it. That's with ten years time passing.

So I think it's fair to say that even a long-lived elf will probably not be a master at too many things, because mastery requires not only intense training and conditioning, but also /continuous/ training and conditioning. It's unrealistic to think that an elf would be able to go a hundred years without using one of his languages and still recall it perfectly. The same goes for archery, or magic, or any number of other things. An elf can attain mastery of things and then do the bare minimum of continuous training necessary to keep himself sharp, but eventually he's going to run into limits in regards to how much time he's got, and if he wants to be the best at something, he probably needs to devote a disproportionate amount of his training time to it in order to stay as sharp as possible.

Where living a long time really comes in handy is in gaining power and money. Once you've got a lot of money (which is the hard part) a smaller portion of your wealth is going into living expenses, which means that you've got capital to invest in things in order to make more money. In the 350 years that an elf lives, a human family would go through something like seven generations, which both dilutes wealth (assuming more than one heir per generation) and runs the risk of loss through incompetence, etc. So I would expect an elf who becomes rich to become /very/ rich, which easily translates to power and influence. Elves can accumulate in a way that humans cannot.

**** Hmm the option for elves learning things slower goes into the theory many people have that the longer lived races are actually really stupid. However i'm not super fond of elves being slower to acquire skills, because if that were the case they ought to take much longer to get levels skills and feats, (though humans get an extra feat at lvl 1 and 1 extra skill rank per lvl).\\
And even if you say that all the pc elves are special non-idiots I just can't think of a way it's psychologically feasible that elves can take many times longer to learn everything, and yet remain otherwise intelligent. Another problem is that they wouldn't just be worse than human at learning a skill in a given time, they would also be worse at dealing with basically every situation because of their extremely poor learning.

As for skill mastery, well while they wouldn't necessarily retain mastery of skills they didn't keep using, they would still almost inevitably end up with a low to moderate level of knowledge of most skills and knowledge, so they might be kind of like a bard I suppose. However it seems likely that nearly all elves would remain masters (compared to a human at least) of quite a few things that interest them (after all look at all the human polymaths who don't even have a whole century to gain expertise, yet become masters in many things). The 10,000 hour rule would be nothing to a elf, especially given they are usually depicted as having longer attention spans.

I actually don't think elves (or other longer lived races) would necessarily have very many /class/ levels. Most npc's of any race have levels in npc non-combat classes for one. Secondly is the fact that few npc's have more than a single level in a combat class, and those that do usually plateau at a certain point determined by their innate skill.

Given how quickly pc's can overtake pretty much every other mortal in their class, it seems apparent that in the game time just can't compare to innate talent.\\
Given that few people have what it takes to get to higher levels in classes. It seems likely that longer lived races usually would have a few levels in a few different related classes depending on their aptitudes. For the average member of a race, I would expect levels in classes that based on their RaW descriptions anyone can take, and of course the more people take those classes the more that knowledge will become widespread within that species.

Since these classes would be learned over great time (to make up for lack of any great innate skill) It might make sense to say that when they multiclass they don't get the normal benefits to gaining a level. For instance if someone took a few levels in wizard, bard and any of the other plethora of arcane casting classes, without actually ever seeing combat.\\
It wouldn't make sense for their hp to increase, though actually that kind of applies to any npc who hasn't gotten their levels through any sort of physical experience and hasn't seen much combat (kind of weird that even a elderly archmage still likely has /at least/ 22hp and could probably beat a 1st lvl fighter in a fistfight).

//As for what long lived races mean for society:// In my setting most long lived races have strong preferences for certain climates and environments, which keeps a massive number of them from just migrating to shorter lived races kingdoms so they can have a comparative advantage.\\
However this doesn't change the fact that there will still be many who are willing to try to to leverage their lifespans to gain their family power (you can trust your offspring more with power, if you have have been testing and grooming them for centuries)\\
The question is raised; Is it inevitable that immortals will end up controlling most large kingdoms? The only disadvantages they really have are that they have somewhat longer pregnancies and take 50% longer to reach maturity.

The only method I can think of to keep immortals from ending up in charge of everything, is to make populations too xenophobic to accept anyone of a different species or who is obviously inhuman having power.

(I have significantly nerfed immortality in my setting, it's no longer really easy for any king with class levels and money to keep /reincarnating/ himself, or using any of the other spells that will allow any rich guy to stay young (and mortal) forever. Basically immortality is damn near impossible to get, unless you personally wield powerful magic, what immortality you can get by paying a mage is going to leave you obviously inhuman.)

It could be cultural rather than innate. In the fantasy web serial Tales of MU, elves are fully biologically immortal, but tend to be extremely lacksidasical about things like building up skills. A human and an elf will go to the same university, study the same major, but the human graduates in 4 years with a typical workload while the elf screws around taking one class per semester for decades before graduating.

On the other hand, an elf not bound by those cultural mores can progress just as fast as a human can, at the expense of social standing within elven communities.

Say elves start taking 2 classes a semester to blow ahead, soon any elf who wants to best them will have to take 3 classes, and the cycle repeats. Plenty of elves are going to want to be top of their class which will inevitably lead to a subset of elves who are taking as many classes as they can manage.

Better yet those highly motivated elves will be far more likely to end up more influential. Both in academia and potentially elsewhere.\\
Once they get in power they are likely to increase academic rigor in competition to other colleges, or to give elves a edge over other equally longer lived races, and it's unlikely that once they get used to a certain standard they would ever lower the bar again.

Effectively I'm saying that if there is any element of competition you should expect it to eventually lead to people or groups operating as quickly as possible until both reach a a balance where they can't go any faster in their efforts to outdo the other.

*** Assuming that long-lived races aren't also significantly more hardy than a human of the same level, the only difference in longevity is the lack of death from age-related illness.

If you also assume that the only way to get to a high level is by dealing with comparable risks, then the level distribution shouldn't be too out of whack. Long-lived races can afford to be more careful with their progress, but the unexpected (or simple bad luck) could still kill them.

However, eventually they would become strong enough that most threats in the setting just aren't a concern. We wouldn't expect too many of these people to exist (perhaps slightly more than you would for humans), but the ones that did could continue gaining levels as long as is practical.

So a long-lived character that became an adventurer at 30 and reached the upper echelons at 90 could reasonably be an unstoppable demigod by 300 years old.

There's usually a disparity between adventurer levels and actual game time, however. Players tend to level much more quickly than you'd expect, and this isn't usually reflected in the demographics of the setting. You don't find, for example, that everybody who's been adventuring for more than 10 years is orders of magnitude stronger than the PCs who have been adventuring for a few in-game months.

If you rectified that, coming up with some particular curve for "time devoted to adventuring" and "average level" that all your characters obey, you could come up with a more firm answer for population distribution.

But in the absence of an simulations to demonstrate it, I'd say (using elves and humans as examples):

- The background mortality rate versus age for elves would be comparable to the human equivalent, except stretched out to cover the whole range and normalised.
- They would likely have a commensurately lower birth rate (otherwise they would have just taken over the whole world, unless balanced by other disadvantages).
- Elven military would start at a higher level than a human military (can train for literally decades before being deployed) but would probably have fewer new troops (see birth rate). Depending on how advantageous the level advantage is, this might significantly mitigate attrition. May need to tweak specifics for balance (unless you want elves to ruthlessly outcompete the other races).
- Elven adventurers would have a slower rate of level advancement and be less likely to die to monsters at a given level since they have the luxury of time. Could also start with better training, but adventurers tend to just go off at level 1 for narrative purposes.
- At very high levels, humans would start running into the issue of death. Expect relatively more humans than elves to turn to lichdom (or setting equivalent, if it exists).
- Beyond those levels, the number of humans would drop drastically. Almost every character at the highest levels would be an elf, assuming it takes a long time to reach them.

**** I actually addressed this in a prior comment on this thread, I'll just repost it here:\\
I actually don't think elves (or other longer lived races) would necessarily have very many class levels. Most npc's of any race have levels in npc non-combat classes for one. Secondly is the fact that few npc's have more than a single level in a combat class, and those that do usually plateau at a certain point determined by their innate skill. Given how quickly pc's can overtake pretty much every other mortal in their class, it seems apparent that in the game time just can't compare to innate talent.

Given that few people have what it takes to get to higher levels in classes. It seems likely that longer lived races usually would have a few levels in a few different related classes depending on their aptitudes. For the average member of a race, I would expect levels in classes that based on their RaW descriptions anyone can take, and of course the more people take those classes the more that knowledge will become widespread within that species. Since these classes would be learned over great time (to make up for lack of any great innate skill) It might make sense to say that when they multiclass they don't get the normal benefits to gaining a level. For instance if someone took a few levels in wizard, bard and any of the other plethora of arcane casting classes, without actually ever seeing combat.

It wouldn't make sense for their hp to increase, though actually that kind of applies to any npc who hasn't gotten their levels through any sort of physical experience and hasn't seen much combat (kind of weird that even a elderly archmage still likely has at least 22hp and could probably beat a 1st lvl fighter in a fistfight).

*** I am going to try to address the problem 'immortals are going to be in charge of everything'.

Well, why not give elves (or any other immortal race, for that matter) some disadvantages to address extremely high skills and wealth accumulation?

- The accumulation of wealth is frowned upon in elven culture. If the violation of this principle will lead to worse place in afterlife (which existance is proven in-setting, perhaps), this might stop some elves enrichment.

- Elven magic uses memories as mana. Therefore, irrelevant skills of elven wizards degrade very quickly.

- Alternatively, some unscrupulous elven ruler had sold his/her entire race to demon king, thus casing disadvantages similar to the previous point.

- Elves has much lower resistance to mind magic and (probably) reading social clues. Because of it they might much less capable rulers, even with centuries of experience.

As for elves being weak-willed, unless it was a massive weakness that would just ensure the elves in power were the stronger willed one's. If the weakness is universal then that just ensures that ruler has mages protecting him, or that he invests in other countermeasures.

*** I always approached Elven immortality's disadvantages the same way I approached human mental difficulties. They have a fixed amount of brain. Human cognition gets slower and slower as they age because the brain has to build everything we learn out of everything we know. Quick recall deteriorates evenly as knowledge increases.

It's not a medical problem so much as a data compression one.

Elves may have developed cultural traditions which slow their acquisition of skills in order to allow them to remain lucid in after the centuries. Investing less energy in remembering anything that isn't critically important, selecting specific skills and dabbling in them only as much as would prevent the inevitable slowing of cognition.

There are, perhaps, ancient elves who have drank deeply from the well of possibility and are full of the wisdom of the ages... but it is slow and delicate work to wrench it out of the tangled knots of their overstuffed memories.

** Dreams do come true!

One idea, related to magic (When are my ideas not related to a magic system?) I've been holding in my back pocket for a while, is another form of ritualism (a little bit less gruesome than blood ceremony, if anyone remembers my post about that).

The system is based around timely rituals, which I'll call a holiday. When a holiday is instantiated, using a special holiday-instantiating spell derived from unrelated magic, a period is chosem, as well as a depositing celebration and a withdrawing celebration. Anyone who performs the depositing celebration on the same holiday (without being too out of phase) deposits whatever they're contributing the depositing (ordinary items, generally, but interaction with other magic can allow for more interesting deposits) into a shared pool. Once it is in the pool, it disappears from physical reality, becoming almost but not completely detached from time and space. Anyone performing the withdrawal celebration on a holiday can (again assuming they are not too out of phase) withdraw from the associated pool, either with an explicit request, or with a sort of generic withdrawal. A generic withdrawal serves as a sort of limited wish-granting, where the celebration will withdraw an assortment of things, balanced against the needs of other withdrawals near the same time, and also with a random element (which can pop up even with explicit withdrawals in sufficiently extreme cases), which is determined by the length of the holiday period, and exactly how out of phase the celebration was.

This form of ritualism was discovered very, very early. Pre-agriculture.

e-

A holiday is technically a single instant, and has no duration. For an explicit withdrawal, the probability of the withdrawal varying in any way from the request begins and ends one third of period away from next holiday, peaking at half a period, where the probability is approximately 63%. For a generic withdrawal, the probability of variance is never completely zero (since a mismatch between the request and what is available is always possible), but is low, no higher than about 8%, within one twelfth period of the holiday. It rises quickly beyond that, exceeding 80% at around a sixth period, 90% beyond about a fifth period, and from there steadily approaching certainty at exactly half a period.

It is common, but a celebration, just as a matter of practicality, usually needs at least five people, just to make sure that ritual is being performed without faults due to one or two people having to run back and forth between different parts of it.

Oh and how common is this magic? If common, and holidays can be really long then depending on the length of the ceremony people might use it to store everything using a ritual only known to them. If longer and with shorter holidays then people would use it to store things they don't need quick access to.

For items which are interchangeable organizations would almost certainly use secret rituals to store them, for instance they would be used to store gold and other resources you can stand not having access to in full at most times.

A neat idea might be to have a few Sources, who have their own, massive bubbles, and Sinks, who can only have bubbles by spending time around Sources and soaking up power. Maybe have a small subset of Sinks able to spend sourcepower in some kind of a magic system, and an absolutely miniscule subset of Sources able to use that magic system as well, but with no power issues.

Running out of power has the obvious drawback of dropping you into stasis, essentially at the mercy of anyone who might want to come along.

Another idea might be to have some sort of way for time to return to an area - maybe, when a Source dies, their Source remains, hanging invisible at the spot they croaked, and though it doesn't have a bubble itself, it can still charge the bubble of anyone in the vicinity.

The moment everything freezes and Sources and Sinks are assigned, every Source in a moving vehicle is probably going to die in a crash, with a few exceptions. This should litter high-volume freeways with Sourcepoints that communities can grow around.

But if you insist on knowing the reason why this happens, it doesn't have to be a one way machine or device like you're assuming, it could simply be dumping people where it wants and returning without them knowing. It could be a phenomenon, machine, or even an alien that does this to people, but you don't even know you went back in time or to an alternate dimension, only that you appear to be in the Roman Empire, or to wherever it chooses to send you.

*** Nagas: Where is the human snake transition? Weather they have arms or not makes a huge difference, but weather they nurse their young is not unimportant. Where their "crotch" would effect their nudity taboos, but not much else, I think.

Biologically the most natural transition point is probably near the sternum, but I'm not sure that matters.

Egypt: well I think a lot depends on what sort of tone you are going for, and on how much work making and maintaining a mummy is. And how lifelike the undead are. I mean the actual Egyptian beliefs had very life like mummies, with at least one god being able to father a child post death and revival.

An interesting idea is if each generation of Pharoah gets their own eternal kingdom.

If you instead want a more pulp feel. .then I think the revival shouldn't be what the builders of the tombs intended, but rather some sort of later effect that made their material bodies come to life.

**** I think, if I had to give a coherent account of DW timetravel, it would center around the analogy of time as a river - there are areas where it's fast-flowing and you can't do much or your changes risk being swept away by the time currents, "high ground" where any changes will cause the future to flow along a very different path and alterations are easy, and low points where events almost always converge and it's very difficult to tunnel through to an even lower ground-state.

You can set up an ambush where the river is narrow and there's little room to maneuver, or wage a huge battle in the open water (where you might try to build something bigger, too.) You can seize valuable territory and blockade it to deny it from your enemies. You can poison the well upstream, or overfish. You might even be able to branch into, or merge with, or travel overland to another river.

Basically, time travel works differently in different time periods (an idea /Who/ has played with from time to time in a technobabble way.) You /deliberately try to exploit/ areas with useful properties.

You're safer in a place that follows HPMOR-style rules where you can't change the past, but more constrained; in a region where paradoxes kill you, you have to be incredibly careful; places where Time is flexible and cartoonish give you a lot of room to maneuver and are valuable for letting you build up forces, but you're likely to kill the local wildlife if you build too much there.

** Let's say that there are demons that take over people's bodies, permanently (or, well, at least indefinitely). These demons have no knowledge or skills beyond those of their hosts, but their values are opposite. Notably, this does /not/ cause them to commit suicide at the first opportunity - because they know that the longer they stay alive, the more opportunities they have to do things that would upset the body's original owner. How might we expect those possessed by such demons to behave? Ignoring, of course, the obvious disaster scenarios of people with global power being possessed.

*** I'm curious how opposite values are defined, given not all values have opposites. The thing I think makes the most sense is that sadistic instincts are converted to altruism and vice versa. However selfishness isn't really a value per-say it's just the absence of altruistism, the /opposite/ of altruism as previously stated is sadism, or more generally a deliberate drive to commit actions one considers evil.

So I suspect someone pretty selfish would become selfless, however they still wouldn't care about other people, instead they would just cease to care about themselves, so without any other strong values they would probably commit suicide.

I suspect that the most common reactions to demons would be: Most people would probably end up reversing relationships making them kill their loved one's, after that they might then go onto do small scale serial killing probably targeting people the host would normally sympathise with the most. So most demons probably would go kill a bunch of children until caught.

Given most people are religious you would likely have a fair bit of variation due to that. Muslims and christians hosts would almost certainly go about trying to make people lose their faith, then killing them, and generally try to maximize the people who go to hell. Certain christian hold that once you are saved you can't be un-saved, so they would probably not bother spending their resources killing people who share their faith unless they are a figure who is likely to get multiple people saved in the future. Other religions I can't as easily make predictions about so I won't go into them here.

Oh and if the demons can work to get more people possessed, then they will probably work to do that above all else, provided they care about affecting the world in any way.

Plenty of governments would probably try to get any loyal enemy prisoners possessed, so their loyalty would turn into a strong desire to help their captors. Of course you would need to keep demonized enemies on a tight leash, because if they had any altruism they will likely be super evil (/though/ that may have certain benefits).

Also it would be /really/ good to know whether demon's can be exercised, and how possession works. If you have some specific setting in mind then telling us the details (medieval, or modern, etc).

**** The big thing to keep in mind is that self-preservation is not inverted, exactly - in fact, the demons themselves feel some sense of self-preservation, as they want to maintain a useful vessel. So, I don't think most demons will commit murder unless they think they can get away with it - or unless they see an opportunity to commit such extreme mass murder that it outweighs the personal consequences.

It's a modern, apparently mundane setting. Demons can only be exorcised by the disenfranchised soul completing a difficult quest in an alternate universe. This has either never happened before or no one has ever been believed afterwards. The existence of demons is therefore essentially unknown. Demons (who aren't already possessing someone) will take any opportunity possible to possess someone, but have no control over those opportunities. The frame of mind most conducive to demonic possession is depression.

I would like to know more about how possession works exactly, presumably most people who become suicidally depressed aren't being possessed. Depending on how it works demons might try to become psychologists, who would then deliberately prescribe medications and manipulate their patients so that their patients would be driven to the state of mind most conductive to possession.

If the setting is modern then you would expect nuclear war to be a likely outcome. Demons would take great care to end up in positions of power in multiple nations, they would then escalate into a cold war and build up reserves of nukes as high as they could, then they launch all the nukes (which were secretly dirty bombs designed to cause maximum fallout) to destroy most non-demons on the planet.

If the demon population is smaller and less powerful they would likely instead pool their resources to develop biological weapons. After spending a few billion on it they would likely be able to develop a highly contagious virus, the important thing would be that it has an long incubation period, in a few years basically everyone on the planet has the disease once it actually starts killing people, you would also design it after diseases like aids that people would have no chance of fighting off or developing vaccines for in the few years before ~99% of people were dead.

*** I personally wouldn't write about this idea, it sounds un-fun if confronted unflinchingly. Still, people manage to write about serial killers, and I guess it wouldn't be from their perspective.

Cutting themselves; more generally, forms of self-harm that are painful and humiliating, but not life-threatening or even crippling (BDSM people have put a lot of thought into these.) Cutting, slapping and burning onesself are the first things that come to mind for most people.

Psychopathic/sociopathic behaviour. More than that; this is a psychopath with a burning desire to torture and kill other people, which probably means a cannibalistic serial killer /and/ children in the basement /and/ serial rape ... but probably more cautious than the ones you see on the news, who are already by definition pretty darn cautious in order to make it far enough to become newsworthy. But also your usual abusive relationships, scams, and shady financial dealings because money is useful no matter what your utility function.

Since most people are religious, our demon will commit blasphemy and try to get themself sent to hell; more notably, they'll try to get other people sent to hell via the easiest available means. To the extent that people end up contradicting themselves because they want to believe (both in religious and philisophical terms), our demon will contradict themself because they want /not/ to believe but can't deny it (because they retain the host's world-model and (lack of) knowledge.)

Any loved ones they had are probably dead, caution or no caution ... unless they're locked in the basement.

Since it takes a while to reason things out, I'd expect a brief period of spazzing out as everything they did because they /wanted/ to is suddenly inverted without any coping mechanisms. Probably building up from "immediate pain feedback is now orgasmic" to more complex ideas.
