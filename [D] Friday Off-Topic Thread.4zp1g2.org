Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** So I've been watching Supernatural every now and again recently---ironically, I despise the overarching plot line and skip it whenever I can, just so I can watch the "filler" episodes. All I want is for two brothers to bust ghosts without whining about how they're dysfunctionally dealing with issues and each other, is that too much to ask?

But more to the point, there are demons in this setting, and said demons can be expelled by chanting or reciting an exorcism. Once I saw that, my first thought was, "Why are they reading it out of a book? They should just memorise it. In fact, why don't you just record your voice saying an exorcism and play it whenever you fight a demon?" But I thought, whatever, maybe there's some handwaving going on about how it needs to be direct from the mouth of a believer or something. But no. Later on, they do just that: they play a recording of an exorcism---over a loudspeaker, what's more---and use it to incapacitate a building full of demons.

/And then they never do this again./

What? If you had just made up some rule of magic that explained why they couldn't record themselves and have it work, I'd go along with it. But if you've proven it works, /why not use it‽/ Or even go further: record your voice, speed it up 10x, and perform tests on a demon once you capture it (since they capture these things every other episode without difficulty). If that works, just open every engagement by pressing "play" on an MP3 of you reciting an exorcism sped up by a factor of 100---in half a second of seeming white noise, the demon is gone before it can even execute a hostage or react.

I know it makes little sense to rail about how irrational a non-Rational work of fiction is, and this show has plenty more to complain about, but that particular bit stuck in my craw something awful.

*** Oculus drove me absolutely nuts with this. It established rules for interacting with the evil mirror - excellent, /interesting/ rules - and then it broke them and things happened for any reason or no reason... which didn't matter because the characters acted like they didn't know the rules they'd told us anyway.

I don't mind so much when it's Doctor Who and the universe is wibbly wobbly and changes every episode... but if a story goes to trouble to create a set of laws by which its cosmology operates, it had better /actually operate by those rules/. Otherwise, explaining them was just a giant waste of time.

**** I used to wonder why I didn't get annoyed at Dr. Who for this. If time travel works this way one week, and a different way another week, why don't I care about the inconsistency? Then I realized that, like the real world, the rules are there and are just really complicated with lots of exceptions. If I want to travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles, I could drive, fly, bike, walk, take a train, take a bus, sailboat, motorboat, ride a zeppelin, get shot out of a cannon, fired from a slingshot, mail myself, whatever. And each option has its own weird quirks to how it works. People assume time travel will just have one way to travel from later to then, but in Dr who, it's a different method every week, so the rules are different each week. The same applies to spaceship propulsion, forcefields, teleporters, computers, etc. The Doctor is just crazy smart enough to know all those little quirks and use them.

***** I would like to believe this, but I don't.

The reason people don't get annoyed by Dr. Who is because they like the show, and shows that we like get a lot more leeway than shows we don't.

If you accept the "it's a different method every week" claim, or the "The Doctor is just crazy smart enough to know all those little quirks and use them" as legitimate excuses, then /no show should ever annoy you/. Why? Because that claim is essentially [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt][a TimeLord did it]].

Doctor Who is a fantasy show in a scifi setting, and I'm fine with that. Fixing all of the plot-holes in Doctor Who would probably be harder than [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/327646.html][steel-manning the Time Cube]], but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy watching it. We don't have to make excuses for why Doctor Who is actually rational any more than we have to make excuses for Phineas and Ferb. Some shows are irrational, enjoy them.

*** I think it's interesting to ask about the difference between an ontically and epistemically reducible universe. For example, we know damn well that chemistry is ontically (territory) reducible to the quantum physics of atomic interactions, but it's not really very epistemically (map) reducible: when you try, a particular spot on the "chemistry" map turns into a patchy, intractable fuzz of a heat-map of states on an overly-zoomed-in "quantum physics" map in all but very, very simple cases.

I think that in philosophy, foundationalism would have to be chucked out of epistemology, but there are already fairly good reasons for doing that. At any given time, we have some set of "overhypotheses" (meta-level principles we try to derive more specific statements from), but we only have an informal sense of which of those principles is the truest, the most precise, or the most expressive in terms of capturing lower-level principles. So sometimes we learn more about the world and realize that we need to "switch" foundations by moving an overhypothesis "up" or "down" the hierarchy.

Someone pointed out that less wrong articles mostly focus on epistemic rationality and don't really say anywhere near as much about how to be more instrumentally rational. It occurred to me that this Ted talk might be a very good jumping off point for that discussion:

*** I don't like videos like this. For one, it feels a bit like a toned down Shia Labeouf's "Just Do It" speech tailored to a presumably more educated audience. It has minimal actual content and it's kind of patronizing. The speaker appears to be assuming that her audience consists entirely of young adults who never had any self-discipline growing up - who always had to be nagged into doing things by their parents. She essentially just berates her audience for their weak-will, tells them they'll /never/ feel like doing the things they know they ought but that they should somehow do them anyways - namely by leveraging the five second window they /do/ feel an impulse to do them (even though they'll /never/ feel such a thing).

I think of speeches like these as "Try Harder" speeches. At best, they get you psyched up for a minute when you're feeling down, but you haven't really been given much of a strategy to work with. You're just supposed to try harder this time - make sure you actually do the thing you know you ought to. Make sure you don't just say, "It's fine," or wait until you feel like doing it. If this works for someone, that's cool I guess. It just doesn't really make any sense to me.

It's worth noting that while the main sequences on Less Wrong don't have a lot on instrumental rationality, there are sections that do. Luke Muelhauser's [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_Science_of_Winning_at_Life][The Science of Winning at Life]] sequence, for example.

**** Yes in some ways I can see how it might seem a bit patronizing. But this wasn't just a "try harder speech". The advice given in this Ted Talk is actually useful advice as far as I can tell. Unless there is something specific that she recommends that actually isn't a good idea to put into practice? I suspect that what she is saying are the very very basics, and they just seem so obvious to you that you feel like she is telling everybody things they already know and being congratulated for it. However, a lot of people probably struggle with the basics, and people aren't always entirely aware that being an adult means becoming your own parent rather than no longer needing parenting, nor of the amount of activation energy needed to change their behavior, nor about the five second rule. Also feeling a momentary urge to do something is not the same as feeling like doing it. Sometimes I have felt the urge to do my homework when I am completely exhausted and just want to get it out of the way, but I didn't really feel like doing it so I ignored the urge and put off my homework for later. Also how do you know that the advice in that Ted talk is aimed specifically at young adults who have had no self-discipline growing up? Not everyone who has yet to learn all of the most basic prerequisite skills of instrumental rationality is necessarily college-age or below.

***** I don't know that I explicitly disagree with anything from the talk, but the tone felt like a bit of a guilt-trip at times. I'm generally uncomfortable with that style of motivation. It has a tendency to condition people the wrong way - make them associate the thing they want to do with the guilt they feel whenever they remember how much they failed to do it last time. And it creates a bad feedback loop where people try to increase their feelings of guilt in hopes it will incentivize them do the right thing this time, but of course this only strengthens the association.

I'm also a bit wary of taking advice from this sort of speaker on principle. As best as I can tell, she has no more expertise in this subject than anyone who's read a self-help book. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Robbins][Wikipedia]], she has a law degree. She's not a psychologist. She's a "life coach." You could be a life coach - you just need clients and/or public speaking engagements. Maybe she did a lot of independent research, but a lot of her talk merely appealed to intuition rather than studies. She occasionally made some vague claims about "science" and used science-sounding words sometimes but all self-help gurus talk like this and a lot of them contradict each other.

Again, she might be correct about nearly everything she stated - this isn't really my domain of expertise. I just think that if you really want to dive into instrumental rationality, there are probably some better places to look.

** How do you cope with never being completely satisfied with yourself? I have this constant feeling that I should be doing more, or strive for greater accomplishments, or don't risk to waste my potential.

This is exacerbated because I am not satisfied with my current situation and I want to get over it as soon as possible, so I postpone social or pleasurable activities to after I'll have a job and independence secured. One reasoning is: I don't really want to feel well now, because I don't deserve it yet, and want to use my present unhappiness to fuel me forward. On the other hand, there will be always a main objective to accomplish, and this state of mind leads to apathy\frenzies cycles, isolation and a general inability to enjoy the present moment.

So, is this only me or do you ever felt this way? Thanks to you all by the way, this is my first post after years of lurking and I enjoy this community immensely.

This is a really terrible method, and I mean in a "been there, done that" kind of way. This is the stuff downward spirals are made of. You're trying to punish yourself to motivate towards a nebulous future reward, but a stick with no carrot is just abuse.

I don't know how productive your current phase is. Going out with friends to a bar or movie kinda is a waste of time most often. But those are far from the only options, and I would ask you step back and look at the past period and examine the things which took up the most time you would have otherwise spent being social, and ask yourself if they really paid off in the end. I never watch the news because 99.97% literally does not turn into significant information which is actually worth my time. I'm not trying to bash you or anything, just don't let your productivity become another form of procrastination (I've seen it happen).

Here's what I think: no one /deserves/ happiness. No one /deserves/ suffering, or apathy either. Those feelings are hard-wired in your brain, but there's no moral construct attached to them. "Deserving" never comes into it. There will never be a time when you can say "Now I am allowed to be happy," that's just a fallacy. Happiness isn't bestowed upon you by friends, or society, or God, or whatever. You find it for yourself according to your values, and if you're lonely or something and you can't find happiness then you go out and /make it/.

Happiness isn't a finite resource, it's renewable. Even better, it's abundant, and the better you get at being happy (creating and consuming what you enjoy, whether that includes/requires other people or not) the more happiness you can get out those of activities.

Just a thought. Quite possibly wrong for your situation, but then again, maybe not.

**** Seconding this very strongly.

Also have been in that state of mind, and am just now coming back from the resulting fallout. (wasted a year or so, failed several courses, lost motivation to do research and learn things for several months) It was because I was never satisfied with what I had accomplished, always wanted to get more done in the day and so on. (had some anxiety issues that were intertwined with this stuff too)

My recommendation is to set (achievable) goals for how you want to spend your time and allow yourself to feel satisfied if you meet them. These goals should only be on things you control though, i.e. completing a job application, studying for an interview, getting feedback from a friend on a cover letter and improving it, etc. as opposed to "getting hired in interview" which is not something that's in your hands (directly). It helps to think about relaxing, socializing (after you've done the planned amount of work or what not for the day) as an objective that's important to your goals rather than a unnecessary distraction.

Does that make sense? (or not?)

Looking in retrospect I think this started with a disdain for the culture of appearance (think Instagramers, ecc.), that backfired with a resolution to not appear happy without first having done something that matters.

This resonates a lot. I start with sacrificing a lot of activities, suddenly have lots of time, and then waate it to feel more miserable in the end. Treating time as a scarce resourse and periodically check the results from every activity is both very necessary and very difficult (nobody wants to feel wrong and there are lots of excuses that comes up). I have to work on this and prepare some red flags.

One things that helped me is precommitment: staying at home have certain benefits, while the benefits of going out can't be anticipated with precision; there is the serendipity, and new encounters, and the friend of a friend that was passing in town that night and ends to be the love of your life. So it's useful to just precommit to do several things that don't appear so great at the start knowing that the best things comes from the unexpected.

That's awesome. It's worth also saying that almost always it's most efficient to just beginning to do the thing than overthinking the more efficient way to do it, as we learn and improve by doing.

I've heard lots of people talk about ways to have high self-esteem "from the inside/without external validation", but things still tend to work out even when you can't turn yourself into a person who magically generates their own self-esteem. Actually, IMHO, it's pretty typical to feel depressed for a few months after graduating if you don't have a job, before the hedonic treadmill effect kicks in and re-normalizes your happiness and self-esteem levels.

One resource that you probably have is flexibility, which means that you have more freedom to form whatever habits you want to form. So, if you want to (say) go jogging at 3pm each day and only be productive in the late afternoon and evening, try modifying your routine (or lack thereof) by one habit at a time until you practice a set of habits you're content with.

Good luck, and best wishes to you. Please do post again after a while if you have progress to report, or would like additional advice and encouragement once you have tried a couple more tactics.

** How would you go about investigating/researching/exploiting Things Man(kind) Was Not Meant To Know, i.e. stuff that drives you insane just by knowing about it?

The way I see it there are a couple of categories of TMWNMTK:

First there is forbidden knowledge, meaning that there is some agent/entity/process which checks whether someone is in possession of it and, if that is the case, inflicts madness upon the offender.

Second there is eldritch knowledge, meaning that the concepts involved induce insanity because grasping/internalizing them leads to some kind of mental degenerative positive feedback-loop or brain damage.

Third there is unwelcome knowledge, meaning that there is some conflict between what you have learned of the world and what you desire to hold true that leads to some kind of mental breakdown. This differs from eldritch knowledge in that it is your personal psyche and not the general structure of the human mind that leads to your vulnerability.

Fourth, and last, there is transcendent knowledge. This is some kind of insight into the true nature of reality that causes you to act like a crazy person, even though you are perfectly sane.

Transcendent knowledge seems to be the easiest to deal with: Simply share it with as many (willing) people as possible, so that you can investigate it together without having to fight against being perceived as insane all the time. Which, now that I think about it, might just be the rationale behind every single crazy, isolationist cult there is. How do you prove to others, and yourself, that your cult is the one that is actually correct? Assuming that your special insight doesn't give you equally special powers. If it does, then demonstrating them might lend credence to your claims. Or not.

Next, it seems to me that there are two ways to deal with unwelcome knowledge: either keep such a closed mind that nothing you learn can shake the foundations of your beliefs, or be a rationalist. Though the former makes the investigation part of my question rather difficult.

Eldritch knowledge would be the most interesting, I think, since research would involve creating minds alien enough to safely comprehend and/or use the eldritch knowledge while still being close enough to human to communicate and/or cooperate.

Though researching forbidden knowledge would be an interesting exercise in crafting theories that are close enough to the truth to be useful, but far enough away to not trigger the interdiction effect. Am I wrong or would this result in the only reliable users being those that work by memorization instead of comprehension?

For the purposes of this question I assume that there is some value in investigating these memetic hazards apart from the realization that there is some kind of brain-melting trivia loose in the universe.

Are there more kinds of TMWNMTK that I didn't consider?

Are there actual terms for these categories that are widely used but unknown to me?

Would you be interested in risking your precious brain-meats for the betterment of humankind?

How do you prove to others, and yourself, that your cult is the one that is actually correct? Assuming that your special insight doesn't give you equally special powers. If it does, then demonstrating them might lend credence to your claims. Or not.

  Are there more kinds of TMWNMTK that I didn't consider?
#+end_quote

There probably are more kinds of insanity-inducing knowledge if you set aside the question of whether the knowledge actually has to be /true/. There's propaganda or indoctrination that induces shared hallucination or mass hysteria, for example, or acculturation or medical misinformation encouraging lifestyles where nutritional deficiencies/supplements contribute to psychiatric disorders directly. Or for a concrete example, the meme that one must maintain an ideal body may be associated with the development of eating disorders.

(These may or may not correspond to variations of your original categories. They are probably closest to the category you've defined as 'eldritch' though they are not particularly eldritch at all. Perhaps "welcome knowledge"---if unwelcome knowledge insanity results from a /conflict/ between what you have learned and what you desire to be true, then this would be from a /cooperation/ between them---a sort of being confirmation-biased into insanity.)

... I also got to thinking about other possible/fictitious kinds of exotic knowledge that can't propagate by normal means. At the very least there would be

1. /inconceivable/ knowledge (knowledge that refuses to register in the human mind, even when directly exposed to the experience it refers to)
2. /ineffable/ knowledge (knowledge that resists being formulated or even approximated by any means of human communication---it can enter a mind, but not leave it)
3. /unstable/ knowledge (knowledge that cannot be recorded or communicated without errors)
4. /mysterious/ knowledge (knowledge that can enter a mind but only with a sense that the thing isn't /really/ known or understood)

I suppose these can all be observed in the real world when understanding of difficult knowledge is attempted by insufficiently-strengthened minds. Whether they can exist in the absolute might depend on whether knowledge can be an "immovable object" or understanding can be an "unstoppable force".

I hear an old woman's voice

She is dying

Gasping for breath

They say that they are powerless

That they had no choice

They could have saved her

I could have saved her

I should have saved her.

I hear the death of the thousands

Crashing like an ocean against indifference

The untold pain and suffering

the gasping and crying

the pain.

I could help

I could do something

But I do nothing

I feel the pain and the sadness

And do nothing,

If, at that point, I felt frustrated that I was doing something silly or pointless, then I'd take the opportunity to remind myself that I could do something I had been putting off or avoiding.

It's worth mentioning that vigor and health in the short term can trade off against longevity and health in the long-term. In short, testosterone is sort of a real life version of the pepper-up potion, albeit on a longer timescale.

My personal opinion is that estrogen is like a weaker version of the "testosterone pepper up potion", which trades some medium term protection from e.g. osteoporosis for minuscule increases in life expectancy and middling increases in lifespan.

The literature isn't quite as supportive of me on this claim about estrogen as it is of my above claim about testosterone.

** I am visiting a friend in the UK at the moment, and I took a side trip on the way here and spent a day in Amsterdam. I've never tried any drug but alcohol before, and decided Amsterdam should be safe. I've been curious for a long time, but I don't have the kind of connections that would allow me to get my hands on anything, plus there's always the chance there's something wrong with what you get. Hence, Amsterdam, where weed is legal and safe and I won't get stabbed.

It was weird. I probably recommend it, but maybe don't do it alone. Be with a friend if possible. One muffin is quite enough.

My 'space cake' muffin hit me after two and a half hours, and it happened very quickly. I was out in the sunny street when I started feeling like my legs were growing longer and harder, and there was a weird sense that some alien being was doing the reshaping. Then the sensation moved to thighs, then arms, then neck then mouth. It's really good that I had time to dive into a KFC and get food and a seat, because I spent the next three hours writing very slowly about how it was really difficult to think about more than one thing at a time, or finish a thought, or get myself to actually write down what I was thinking I should write down. It also really messed with my perception of time and made the movie Clue (1985) seem like the crown jewel of Tim Curry's acting career. Unfortunately, I also had several good ideas for my book I'm writing. I would have preferred to come away with the sense that it was an interesting and unique experience that I never wanted to try again, but instead I found it very helpful for my writing. Which is a bit of a bummer, because I have no intention of visiting Amsterdam often, nor do I want to get anything illegally back home in Sweden.

I'm very glad I tried it, but also a bit annoyed and frustrated that it turned out to be useful. Obviously there is the chance that the random sparks of creativity would become rarer or disappear with repeat exposure, but if so I probably won't find out for a few years until I drop by Amsterdam again.

A brainstate reachable using drugs is usually something you can access /without/ drugs given sufficient guidance, training, and time. (For example, if you shut a person in a dark room for a week, they start hallucinating. In this case it's because the brain ends up trying to read meaning into static in the visual field, rather than because the higher parts of the visual cortex are being weirdly activated, but the effect of a dark room is not dependent on drugs.)

** In a previous Friday Off-Topic Thread, I was looking for advice on stemware. I recall someone asking for me to report back when I bought something, so here's the report. I am still shopping around for some casual with-stem wine glasses, but I finally got some casual stemless wine glasses that have worked out quite well. They are Riedel stemless Riesling/Zinfandel glasses [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D4U7MQ2/][(amazon link)]] and they pretty much meet my needs. They're a bit expensive ($8 per glass) but so far seem to be doing well.

They are fine in the dishwasher if you put them somewhere nothing will bump them on the top rack, and they are basically wine-glass shaped. They seem to have a normal wine glass level of fragility, and although their shape isn't perfect for a red wine, the experience is fine and you're probably not going all-out with expensive wine if you're drinking from a stemless glass.

When I ordered them, I had to return my order to Amazon twice due to the glasses arriving with some of them broken, so make sure to check the box carefully to see if any of the glasses are broken. Amazon handles this sort of return for free (including giving you a shipping label) but it's kind of a pain. In the future, I'll see if I can buy these in a store near me instead to avoid that hassle.

Overall, I recommend them if you can find them in a store near you, or are fine dealing with Amazon returns.

** Recently I've been going through Catharine Asaro's Skolian Empire books. I've got mixed feelings, that can be summed up as '8/10'. These books are not rational in any way or fashion.

The books are predominantly romances. I think the genre it falls into is probably closest to Romantic Fantasy as defined in [[http://prokopetz.tumblr.com/post/148985837272/ive-mentioned-romantic-fantasy-in-a-few-recent][this Tumblr post]]. It feels like an evolution of the sort of things that Mercedes Lackey or especially Anne McCaffrey were doing. It's much better than McCaffrey's stuff... but that's sort of damning with faint praise. There's a bunch of reversing gender roles stuff in her work in various ways, but it's mostly not done in a particularly interesting/clever/plausible/unique way - Ancillary Justice, for example, was way better for this kind of thing, and many other authors have done gender role reversal stuff in better ways than Asaro.

The Skolian Empire books were advertised as a hard sci fi setting in the place I originally saw the recommendation for them, and also are so advertised on Wikipedia in a few places, but I feel like that's /mostly/ a lie. It feels like the majority of it is just using some trappings and names of science-y things without really thinking about them or considering them in much or any detail. It's full of soft sci-fi conventions and devices, and the occasional hard sci-fi detail doesn't really make it feel super plausible. I like hard sci-fi, and I like soft sci-fi, but this mixture of the two is less appealing in some respects. Looking at the author's background, I would have thought that most of the issues I had with the books' science background stuff would be things she would specifically have a ton of background and experience, so I just don't even know. In a few of the books, there is actually quite interesting and cool science fiction stuff at least loosely based on actual science that is unique and interesting, but in a ton of it there's just a lot of space magic with the occasional science-y sounding word. I feel like Asaro underuses a few of her space magic plot devices really poorly, too, in ways that would take a really long essay to go into; for example, she completely failed to sell me on the vital utility of the telepath-powered instantaneous FTL comms communication system that so much of her worldbuilding and society was pinned on.

Relatedly, there are a number of really weird retcons and totally unnecessary plot holes that happen in the books that overall annoy me. I think the books were probably not written with the expectation that someone would marathon them in a row sequentially and read more than a dozen of them in a week. For one example that won't spoil much, in one of the novels a big deal is repeatedly made of how for a barbarian society from a world devolved to primitism that has no axial tilt and a very regular orbit, they had lost all notion of 'years' and didn't use them at all to gauge maturity and in spite of the main character coming from a society which retained them, they were never able to think in 'years' or really understand the point of 'years'. Then a couple books later still on this yearless world, the same barbarian character and everyone else in their barbarian society is constantly using years and thinking/talking in years when justifying that another character is too young to leave home and attend a military academy, or old enough to wed someone, or whatever. It's not rare for details to feel majorly inconsistent between books.

A more vital irritation with the books is that they were written with a non-chronological order in such a way that reading in publication order you get spoiled for the ending and conclusion of one book by the other books fairly often. You'll read a page summary of how X met Y and fell in love or whatever in book Z, and then have an entire book of it happening later on as book Z+n. This is less a concern in the romance genre than in many other genres, but it feels like a really odd decision - a couple of these 'review history of some side character' books are sort of OK in their own right but add basically nothing to the overall plot, and I spent much of them less interested - they were just filling in the details when other books already let the reader know how everything came out in the end, which feels sort of pointless.

A huge amount of the books' backstory and background make very little sense to me, and it feels like the social history, the economic history, and the political history of the various polities in the books make very little sense. It feels like the author did a very half-assed job of the background history in these books.

** I watched /Justice League: Gods and Monsters/ a few days ago, and holy shit this is awesome, Bruce Timm is awesome, and he needs to start his own franchise now with more of this stuff.

The movie is about some an alternate DC Comics universe, with heavy emphasis on the "alternate" part. Every DC characters who appears has been heavily re-imagined in one way or another. Amanda Waller is the USA president, Lex Luthor is an eminent scientist, Steve Trevor is an US Army general, and last but not least, Superman is the son of General Zod and was raised by Mexican immigrants. Along with New-God!Wonder-Woman and Vampire!Not-Bruce-Wayne!Batman they form the super-murderous-but-well-intentioned Justice League!

I can't say much more without spoiling the plot, but if you liked the Justice League episode /A better world/, /Gods and Monsters/ is basically the same except more gritty, more mature, and Superman is allowed to kill people. The story is well written with many clever twists (Wonder Woman's backstory in particular is fantastic), the dialogues all hit the right notes ("The new world order will have to wait" is probably my favourite line), and the characters are all mostly rational and multi-dimensional.

Superman in particular is much more complex than he seems at first, especially for a "the ends justify the means" character. He cares about other people, and human life in general, yet he's ruthless when he needs to be. He's perfectly fine killing evil NPCs, but he never hits someone out of anger.

So if you liked /B:TAS/, and /Justice League/, and you feel DC movies have been disappointing lately, /Gods and Monsters/ is a must see.

- Imagine that I may be a P-Zombie.
- By hypothesis, there is /in principle/ no way to detect whether or not I am a P-Zombie. In other words, physical effects may not have (dualistic) mental causes.
- If 'my mind' is affected by physical causes, I consider it to be a physical effect. Hard or impossible to measure, but it's not unique there.
- If it is /not/, how can 'my mind' be related to 'my body'?

So the most-coherent proposition I could work out is that there is a dual world of conscious entities, utterly unable to interact with our own.

If they have read-only access, so what? If the body does exactly what a non-physical mind desires for coincidental physical reasons alone, that's (a) suspiciously implausible and (b) who cares?

The BOOJUM chapter was a full, complete story, and while it wasn't connected to practically anything else, /as a chapter/ it still had a complete beginning, middle, and end.

UNSONG has no such direction. Chapters that are supposed to provide additional background information and worldbuilding are rendered pointless when we have no idea what they're building up to or why it's important.

***** If you haven't watched DBZ I would personally advise [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&list=PL6EC7B047181AD013][Dragon Ball Z Abridged]] over Kai, it's funnier faster paced and still contains most of the plot and character development from the original series unless you don't find it funny or would prefer a more serious show even with it being slower.

******* My personal recommendation against Kai is, good god the music is horrible.

Maybe it only seems horrible because the amazing, genius soundtrack by Bruce Faulconer in the original series is so iconic to people who grew up on it.

But I'll put forth that this:

Beats this:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D30wKMvndEw]] (ignore the weird shift in language midway through)

By a longshot. IIRC, they didn't want to pay Faulconer when wanting to re-use his music, so they decided against it. To me, one of the worst cases of penny-pinching ruining a show's potential I've ever seen/heard.

Because normally, yeah, there's a ton of filler in DBZ. But I'd rather just skip those episodes or fastforward through those parts and watch the original than watch it without music like this:

********* Yep. There's some replacement music they use in Kai that's almost universally terrible and disjointed, with nowhere near a cohesive aesthetic.

To be fair, some scenes really are cut down. I believe that clip above is a minute shorter, despite starting and ending at about the same place, and there are some episodes that are totally skipped or merged in Kai due to how much time is spent on the occasional slice of life episode and blond men screaming.

(It's hard to convey how exciting blond men screaming can be when watching the show as a kid, because you just knew it was a build up of suspense to something awesome, but as an adult with things to do, it's definitely a bit much)

In any case, you'll find a lot of clips on youtube overlaying DBZ music over Kai for the best of both worlds, but I don't know if there's a way to watch the whole show like that.

To be honest though, I don't know if I'd even recommend DBZ to an adult. DBZ abridged is hilarious and pretty much the strongest argument I can make for watching the original, just to better understand the refernces and whatnot.

*** I managed the first 13 chapters and thought it was kinda funny throughout but basically completely americocentric, as an European the idea that any government could actually enforce law against people just speaking stuff even with new magic powers across the whole world is absurd to me. Considering that people do commit suicide with the intent to kill others for (at least stated) religious ideals the wrathful name would be the end of mankind in my opinion.

**** I was also confused by that, especially when it became clear that international politics must have descended into chaos with all the insanity going on in the world. The only way I could make sense of it is if theonomics was the only multinational industry left, which would make sense given how names have supplanted most technology. The idea that the corporations could maintain their monopolies on names is suspect, though.

****** You mean the conversation between Ana and the CEO? That didn't explain anything. It said that governments enforce the patents on the names and punish pirates with jail time, but it didn't explain why. It is in a nation's rational self interest to have access to as many names as possible, and the specific example given would've lead to economic growth in that country. What motivation do countries have to enforce the patent?

  “Ever hear of Chesterton's fence?” asked Simeon.

  “Yeah. The story of a guy who sees a fence in a field, gets angry that it's blocking his movement, and tears it down. Then he gets gored by a bull that the fence was protecting him from. It's supposed to mean that you shouldn't get rid of a system until you're sure you know why it's there.”

  “Ever think of applying Chesterton's fence to the theonomics? Or UNSONG?”

  “‘Rich people want more money' seems like sufficient explanation for a system dedicated to giving rich people money.”

  “You know the Comet King helped found UNSONG?”

  “Even the Comet King makes mistakes.”

  “Really?”

  “You're going to say the same thing you people always say. If we didn't make sure that the people who discovered Names got obscene profits, there'd be no incentive to discover Names, all the sweatshops would close, and then we wouldn't have the magic we need to treat diseases or run the railroads. But people have done plenty of basic science research for centuries without those incentives, and I would rather get Names a little bit slower but have them available to everyone than -- ”

  “Forget curing diseases. That's a red herring. You want to know why we need UNSONG and the theonomics? Look around.”

  *“Uriel's machine is deteriorating,” Simeon told Ana. “When it finally falls apart, it's going to loose a lot of things that look at humans as the bottom of the food chain. The Drug Lord. Thamiel. Other things. Older things. Technology won't save us then. The only thing that can save us is Names. Lots and lots of Names. We beat the Drug Lord back with Names, but not well, and now we don't have the Comet King on our side. When the last screw falls out of that machine, I want us armed with as many Names as we can get. Cate Ilyov buys private jets because Cate Ilyov is an idiot. Me, I'm sinking all Countenance's profits back into Countenance. And a few other projects besides. Not because I'm not selfish. I am.

******** I don't buy that. Patents make sense in other industries because innovation requires creativity and insight, but theonomics are just brute-force hacking with Hebrew. Publicly-funded sweatshops could achieve the exact same thing at the same cost while also providing increased economic growth by releasing useful names to the public, who then pay more taxes.

All the patent system does is restrict the use of names for the sake of a profit incentive, but all your rewarding is either luck or the best secret algorithm. This is a very inefficient system that hemorrhages money due to rampant piracy and the cost of enforcing unnecessary laws. There is no reason for megacorporations to be the sole source of innovation.

**** For me it was the lack of what I call "plot". Truths, lies, and falsehoods need to be revealed at a particular rate in order to keep the narrative advancing. No matter how fascinating the world is, if I'm not getting meaty answers to well-established questions (especially the ones related to a story's main characters) then I get tired of slogging through excess exposition.

As Parker and Stone say, everything on screen has to matter. Each new plot point must be tied to the previous ones with a "therefore" or a "but"... otherwise it's just one damn thing after another.

A narrative always contains an implicit promise that there's a good reason we're being told all this stuff. Not keeping that in sight breaks that promise. When the dog gets sufficiently shaggy, I lose interest fast.

There was a bit too much self-congratulatory free association for my tastes, and not enough clever power application or world-building.

** <span class="only_half_joking">Either [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318171][Perfect Lionheart]] has been keeping an alt-account in reserve since 2013, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5362799][tkepner]] is his long-lost twin.</span> /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447][Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly]]/ (115k words, in progress) seems *eerily* similar to the infamous /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ in its tone of "simultaneously crack-fic and deconstruction"--check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/9][Chapter 9]] for a shining example.

Edit: In later chapters, the similarities begin to become even more blatant.\\
- In Chapter 15, [[#s][spoiler]], and also [[#s][spoiler]]. This instantly calls to mind the harem shenanigans for which Perfect Lionheart's stories are infamous.\\
- In Chapter 16, [[#s][spoiler]]. In Chapter 30 of /Partially Kissed Hero/, [[#s][spoiler]].\\
If this writer isn't Perfect Lionheart, he's treading dangerously close to plagiarism with the second example, I think--especially since he hasn't mentioned any inspiration from /Partially Kissed Hero/.

EDIT: I've conferred with a fanfiction email group I'm part of and responses are generally negative: someone who considers Perfect Lionheart as a friend doesn't believe that tkepner is Lionheart, and it's been pointed out that there's just so many HP fanfics out there that a similar one is unsurprising.
