** Ignoring the commentary, I feel that the Mulan comic severely discounts the ingrained sexism of the setting. The commander seriously considered killing her for her crime of being a woman on the battlefield.

*** I don't think making that into a sexism thing is helpful. Capital punishment for slights we would consider trivial was a common thing in ancient countries, especially in ancient China, /especially/ in the army. Lionel Giles's [[https://avikdgreat.tripod.com/InterestingReads/ArtofWarbySunTzu.pdf][1910 translation of /The Art of War/]] records a soldier who was beheaded for advancing without orders (page 80), an officer who was executed for stealing a bamboo hat from a townsman (page 113), and a commander who condemned /himself/ to death because he negligently allowed his own horse to trample a field of corn (page 37)!

**** I know very little about the cultures involved (either Chinese or military), so I will defer to your knowledge. My point about the joke stands, though. The punchline relies on a misrepresentation of the source material.

It's like that comic about how [[https://i.imgur.com/dLu5xEk.jpeg][Gendo is Best Dad]]. Funny, but not really accurate.

***** Yeah, if the point is just to poke fun at a story's conceits, that's fine. But if you start getting smug and making jokes about how these characters are dumb, not /smart/ like /me/, that's what makes people write snippets about magical wars.

**** It seems like the people depicted as focusing on the Dragon rather than Mulan's Gender reveal are the three footsoldiers that she befriended during training. It would make sense that they would be more accepting of her and focused on the appearance of an Actual Dragon than the elite leadership who never knew her personally and have a stronger interest in maintaining public appearance.

â€‹

This actually gives me the idea of a story where Mulan uses the presence of her supernatural support and friendship with the regular troops in order to stage a mutiny against the incompetent or outright treacherous leadership of Chi-Fu. This seems like it could be the start of an interesting journey where Mulan transitions from a single courageous soldier into the revolutionary leader of a mass movement.

*** I feel its important to note that her crime wasn't being a woman. Her crime was conscription fraud, which as the conscription order came directly from the Emperor and explicitly asked for 1 man from each family her sabotaging it to protect her father was treason.

Technically the punishment would (should) have been the same if she was a dude that was merely covering for her friend from another family, although of course the dude that wanted to kill her /was/ a sexist asshole so...

*** Y'know in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Mulan][original chinese folktale of Mulan]], no one was particularly /upset/ that she was a woman, merely /surprised/. But perhaps /that/ wouldn't have been realistic to a western audience!

**** Yeah, but they also learn about this at the end of the story, after a 10 year campaign, having defeated the barbarians and met the emperor who "confers promotions in rank and prizes of hundreds of thousands" on them. In the movie they knew her for maybe a few months after basic training and learn about it at the start of the campaign.

The singing isn't the problem, the situation with animals in real life is a moral disaster.
