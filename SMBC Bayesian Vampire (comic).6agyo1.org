** Though being a vampire is less likely than not, the very bad consequence of being on and in sunlight would mean it rational to test it before stepping into daylight (and dying).

*** Additionally, upon touching sunlight and being burnt, he should immediately retreat back into the shade before being completely incinerated. Even if his prior for being a vampire is super-exponentially low, there are unfathomably many other unlikely explanations for sunlight burning you, such as: some disease that reduces ultraviolet resistance, something weird happened to the atmosphere, someone is firing a laser at you, invisible acid is falling from the sky, something you've never heard of or even thought of before exists and is causing sunlight to hurt you, etc... Even if all of these are incredibly unlikely, so is hallucinating that you're being incinerated when nothing is wrong.

Even if vampires don't exist, clearly something is happening. You don't need to have a peer-reviewed scientific theory of why the sun is burning you before you decide to avoid it.

*** Maybe he has always done that? On second thought they look uncomfortable and expensive.

Why does vampirism cause anachronistic evening clothes anyway? I wonder if the change causes some kind of set neural pattern which likes suits. Maybe suits are a part of the life cycle of some kind of vampirism causing parasite?

Sort of like Toxoplasmosis and cats.

That could also explain the whole sleeping on native soil thing.

****** Well I suppose they could be trying to take over the world, maybe in some way that doesn't require toppling existing governments. Then again, just finding really powerful wealthy or influential people and teaching them rationality might be enough that actually taking over the world wouldn't be necessary? I mean it doesn't seem feasible to topple the current system(s) at less not violently. But if they can somehow make it possible for some good and sufficiently wealthy person like Elon Musk to totally outcompete all the other super rich, and then have him or whoever to use the money to leverage saner smarter and more humane policies across the world...I mean that would still be kind of taking over the world right?

The question is how would they make that happen exactly? Maybe invent some kind of new tech that makes a lot of current tech obsolete, and then use ridiculous patents to keep that tech away from the competition? Problem with this is that it might incentivize other wealthy people to change their minds about super-long copyright terms that never seem to end. In which case that might put Elon Musk on the wrong side of public opinion because he would be seen as the one person benefitting from overly restrictive copyright law.

******* That clearly isn't the plan, though, as Tesla has released all of its patents to the public.

Of course, they did that so their charging mechanism would one day become the industry standard and because they knew no other company could actually use their ideas because none of them have Elon Musk, but the point is that universal victory by patent trolling isn't the plan.

***** eh. That's all misdirection. It's well-known (in certain, exclusive circles) that achieving actual, general, friendly AI on a first attempt is just too improbable, and that it is far safer and easier to deliberately make something near-optimal. And so, while they pretend to be trying to solve the former problem, they're actually already coding up the Celestia AI. The fic /Friendship Is Optimal/ is, obviously, part of the cover - kind of like the show Stargate, which was created to cover up the actual Stargate program. If the truth leaks, even with fairly compelling evidence, skeptics will point to the fiction as evidence the leaked info is just the rantings of some crazy person, or the work of conspiracy trolls.
