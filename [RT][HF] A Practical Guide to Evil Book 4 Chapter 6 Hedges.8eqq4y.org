** So, either we have a near-unstoppable scouting force consisting of comedic relief, or we have the comedy relief stomped on hard by the heroes to show that things have gotten serious.

In the spirit of Robber I must now announce that I'm *taking all bets*!

**** Depends on the mentor hero, I think. If he's supposed to be, like, a scary grim reaper-acting motherfucker, then him showing up and shutting down the funny could be a killing stroke. But with Robber /and/ Archer there, well, he would have to be pretty fucking scary.

***** Arguably it could be the reverse with the mentor dude being weaker because he's so serious. When the Tyrant was sieging against the White Knight's band of heroes, he set the tone for being lighter, which make the more amusing of the heroes less prone to danger. If Robber and Archer take the initiative, I think they'll do well, but if the heroes catch them out, it could go badly

****** I assumed it was some form of teleportation, which places an object at some specific position, despite any material which is already there.

For instance, know the exact location of someone, and open a gate to arcadia which bisects them. Or something which can teleport a crossbow bolt into their brain.

** Hmmm... absolute positioning, the ability to Scry on anyone, and the ability to open up portals?

Is Cat about to introduce /Scry and Die/ tactics to her world? Spot a target, teleport/portal in, assassinate, escape.

I'm wondering if it's possible to find the exact location of a Hero by having multiple people scan simultaneously at areas a set distance apart from each other. If the "Scry block" is a set size and not some nebulous changing area, then it is possible to target them using a bit of simple geometry. Find the radius of the sphere and the center is the Hero.

*** Warlock mentioned making an array for mapping out the zone where Bumbling Conjurer tried to block his scrying, so you don't need a few people for that. Though I wonder, whether Catherine has mages good enough for that, aside from Masego. Tracking a blocked area is how Warlock found the White Knight in Nicae, though the shapes and timing of the blokcing may well be irregular: scrying isn't exactly unknown, just not practiced widely.

Scry and Die isn't instantaneous in the Guideverse, which means the target would have to stay immobile for days or weeks, not to mention heroes being more likely to find a way to get into Arcadia, or just happen to be on the other side of the portal in time.

**** What if Masego can open portals through something less "occupied" than Arcadia? I wouldn't want to bet against his ability to perform a rods from god orbital strike or back of the head "bang" through a portal or (the only non warlock based guess) as GeJO mentioned above just peeling some of the crust of the planet off with "absolute positioning" and extrapolating from things we've seen Warlock do.
