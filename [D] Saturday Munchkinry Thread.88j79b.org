Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

*** Even without the deja vu feeling, you have a manual outcome pump, and could spend many bits of anonymity to double your money by going to a casino and putting all on black.

Depending on what counts as an idea, you could establish communication between timelines. To write "Hello" to variable "welcome", you would consider the idea "Use Captain's Log Protocol v1.0 to set the first bit under the welcome heading to 0", and corresponding ideas for the remaining 39 bits of Hello. To read the contents of "welcome", you would consider all ideas one might use to write things under the welcome heading. If you receive a message from this, proceed to rewrite the message under headings welcome_l and welcome_r. If all ideas were previously considered, use a trusted random number generator to choose from welcome_l and welcome_r and recurse.

This would be the point where I go into messages from the distant future and AI boxing but we've been through that.

*** Well lots of people have mentioned lotteries, however due to being extremely susceptible to butterfly effects I don't think that would work so you would just end up repeating the lottery until you had tried every number or you won by sheer luck.

Instead I would invest in high risk stocks, if I fail I would revert back. So I would invest in a high risk stock extremely briefly, if I got deja vu I would change stocks if not I would keep invested. If at any point the stock stopped profiting (they may not be profitable indefinitely) then I would go back to exactly when they stopped giving returns and the sense of deja-vu I got from everything I did would be a signal to me to change which stock I was invested in.\\
I would also revert back if something bad happened to me, so my more general goal strategy would be to basically not do any action that triggered deja-vu.

Eventually as others have already pointed out I could bootstrap this into an extremely slow binary anti-telephone, at which point I would progress from becoming a billionaire to using my power to send information like science back in time. I would also use my power as a probability pump in order to impact global events significantly (for instance replaying extremely close elections or other events until the desired candidate won).

I'm using the definition of "happen" that is the literal one that everyone uses ordinarily. This is explicitly stated to be a time travel power with the extra caveat of near total amnesia. So you still subjectively experience every timeline regardless of whether you remember it, which means you have to consider the utility you had experienced in a given timeline when calculating total utility.

This is actually a very good point, however I would still worry that if you're spending such an absurd number of years buying tickets it seems like something is likely to break that loop that's more likely than getting the winning ticket, though this is something of a meta-level modesty argument.

However the more important issue is whether it's really worth spending the vast majority of your subjective life buying lottery tickets even if you may not remember most of it after the fact. Certainly it would seem like that would make the expected utility payout very low compared to something like the stock manipulation I mentioned.

Sure but we still know that you do still experience those events even if your memory of them is reduced to the absolute minimum level. That becomes important because it means when considering hedonistic utility you need to consider these timelines even if you know you won't remember any of them but one.

For instance it means that if you plan on utilizing plans that involve spending centuries doing unpleasant tasks that leave you extremely unhappy in order to leave yourself better off in the final timeline iteration, well it's probably not worth it. So the lack of long term side effects from previous timeline iterations doesn't change the fact that it's not worth it to have the majority of your life be unpleasant, even if you what you actually remember is all pretty pleasant.

#+end_quote

I'm really not sure what exactly your point is, but if I had to guess it might be that spending many subjective years doing unpleasant work would be worth it if you got FAI at the end of it all.

That would be something I would agree with however I don't think spending centuries buying lottery tickets would be involved in any plans to use the outcome pump/deja-vu antitelephone to create FAI as fast as possible (well as fast as possible while reaching some desired expectation of safety).

Plus to play devil's advocate there is a hedonistic objection you could make to that reasoning as well: That it's not really worth trying to get FAI earlier unless the amount of time you spend in time loops is less than you expect to have spent waiting for FAI ordinarily.\\
Actually there's an altruistic version of this argument as well, that the utility of other people in the other timelines still counts, so there's not necessarily any motivation to get FAI much earlier if you're still effectively extending the amount of time people spend experiencing the pre-singularity world.\\
Plus there's the extra point that if you're opposed to wireheading then the extra utility you get from getting FAI earlier is also not /that/ drastic, particularly if you're already well off and only really care about your own utility.

And now I've actually convinced myself.. So /now/ I think the best strategy is to use the outcome pump to gain as much money/power as possible and try to develop FAI completely under your own control (so your researchers are the only people working on it and you have zero competition). Basically I think trying to get a FAI with the closest approximation of your own utility function (as well as maximizing safety generally) is probably the more important part of the speed/safety development tradeoff (or rather that considering the alternate timelines maximizing speed is extremely hard).

  I'm not really sure what you mean here, once you have FSAI then what point is there to using your time travel? I mean [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon][I can think of some ways you could use the antitelephone/probability pump component as a free energy/negentropy generator]] however that almost certainly won't be worthwhile for trillions of years.

  Given you still experience the same amount of experiences for a given amount of subjective time what good exactly is your time travel once you have FSAI but prior to the heat death of the universe being a major concern? I mean if you (like me) have something of an aversion to having your memory wiped then it would seem like you would want to avoid using the time travel once you no longer had a strong incentive to do so.

  Anyway I'm imagining in addition to doing that trick to get free negentropy, at some point once you've decided to ascend to full superintelligence level you could always just merge all other minds so they're connected enough to count as part of you for the purposes of the power. Then one could simply travel into the past, and by then you would have long since bootstrapped the crude anti-telephone into a system you could use to transmit massive amounts of information like all the memories you and the other members of your hivemind had gotten in the previous timeline.

The easiest example when it comes to knowing the number of loops would be to regularly write "1" in a ledger. However if you get deja-vu from that then write 2 instead, if /that/ gives you deja-vu go to 3 and so on until you've written the number of loops. Then you can know when to stop if the number you write down reaches a certain limit.

The ability works the same way as ordinary deja vu: it doesn't tell you what happens next, it just tells you when you have repeated a situation. So in this case, in order for me to find out the winning lotto numbers, I would have to spend time thinking of every single possible lotto number, one by one, until the deja vu effect triggers. And I can't speedcount through them, I have to give each one a good long think to see if the deja vu triggers. So it will take forever =(.

****** So you're saying break down the lotto numbers into parts, and determine each part one by one? That doesn't quite work because I will be riddled with false positives: an entire lotto number is a fairly unique pattern, if I see it and get deja vu, I can be sure I saw it as a lotto number before. And if I don't play the lottery normally (which I don't), then that means it must be from the previous timeline.

A part of a lotto number is a number with around 2 digits. It won't trigger deja vu for the same reason eating your favorite food doesn't trigger deja vu: it happened too many times. I see small numbers all the time. And even if it does trigger deja vu, I can't tell whether the deja vu is because I saw the number on the previous timeline, or simply saw the number in the past.

Although, that gives me an idea. I need an accomplice for this plan though. What needs to happen is, first my accomplice gathers a bunch of very distinct images that I have never seen before (preferably newly drawn). My accomplice then assigns each image a number, and first shows me image 0. If I experience deja vu, I'm in the second timeline. If I don't, I'm in the first.

If I'm in the first timeline, then we wait for the next lotto. When the winning numbers are shown, my accomplice will show me the images that match each of the numbers. My accomplice then destroys all the images to ensure I never see the others. I now time travel back.

If I'm in the second timeline, my accomplice shows me all the images. The ones that trigger deja vu are the winning lotto numbers. The rest won't trigger deja vu because I didn't see them in the first timeline.

YES! This will work! Now I just need to find a good lottery and an accomplice. (I don't know how to time travel, but I have delusions of grandeur and empty hopes that I might have already done so and simply forgotten about it because the time travel doesn't keep memories.)

******* [[/u/blasted0glass]]'s approach works even in situations where you don't have an after-the-fact way of finding out the answer, such as when guessing passwords. All you need to do is a recursive search.

Here's another way of doing it that you might find less objectionable. Break each part down into a stream that you can easily reason about. Let's go with a binary stream. First test {0}. If you get deja vu, choose 1, else choose 0 (call this x). Then continue, and test {x0}. If you get deja vu, choose 1, else choose 0. Then continue with {xy0}, etc. You can get around the fact that the early numbers won't be triggering deja vu by prefixing them with some random string.

If you get to the end, try the value. If it fails, jump back to just before the most recent zero.

*** I wish I saw this post yesterday, because I've made a really good response to a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/536z7p/saturday_munchkinry_thread/d7qqzlx/][similar post]] before.

The only difference is that in the other version of the question, you know for sure if you have reset the timeline while with this question it's uncertain. So you ask a friend to print out a desired number of visually striking/memorable images and put them in a folder with a number attached to each image starting from #0 without letting you seen any of the images. Then whenever you reset and want to know how many times you made a reset, you pull out the images until you reach the first image you /don't/ feel a deja vu. Whatever number that image has is the number of times you've reset. First image means you have reset 0 times. Second image means you have reset 1 time. Third image means you have reset 2 times, and so on...

For better use of this power, don't do the image thing to figure out the number of resets you have done. Instead, plan out what you want to reset the timeline for and write a list of options/actions you will try for each reset. Then iterate through the list as you go through the images to know which option you are going to act on for the current timeline.

- Work at a dock, scanning shipping containers for radioactive material. By narrowing the sensitivity of your eyes to particular gamma-ray transitions, you could identify radioactive material being smuggled.

***** It does, but somebody with this ability could conceivably do so with higher efficiency and lower cost. It depends on a large part whether the eyes keep their angular resolution when they change frequencies.

Directional radio antenna need to be very big, because radio waves are so large. When tracking down pirate radio, the sensors typically measure the strength of the radio waves, but not their direction. You can walk in the direction of the stronger signal, but with magic eyes that can see the radio waves, you could point right to them.

Geiger counters are rather indiscriminate in what they detect. With an appropriate sensor, they can detect gamma rays, but they detect only that a gamma ray was present. The energy and direction of the gamma ray are not recorded at all. In order to measure the energy, you need to step up either to using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillator#Gamma_rays][scintillators]] such as Caesium Iodide, or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_detector#Germanium_detector][high-purity Germanium]]. That lets you determine whether a shipping container contains U-235 (oh no), or K-40 (probably a shipment of bananas). However, you still don't get position information.

If the eyes could see gamma rays, restricted to a narrow energy range, and could detect angular information, it would let the person scan more containers, faster, and to identify where the contraband material is located.

*** Well as has already been pointed out technology can already do basically everything this power can. However there might still be a few niche uses here, for instance seeing radio waves so extremely low frequency that they're difficult or impossible to detect with normal tech. Plus there may be some uses to being able to perfectly filter out all EM outside an extremely narrow spectrum and cranking up your sensitivity to max, so you could maybe look at some "noisy" EM objects and see them in greater detail.

However ultimately the primary use of a power like this would just be to exploit the fame that comes with being the only known human with superpowers.

** Rule of three: You have magic. More or less wicca - you can do a great many things, all of them via rituals in prepared spaces.

Rule: Anything that can be done and that you know how to do in sufficient detail can be done with magic. You could, for example, make gpus out of sand if you have the full mask of the chip and understand how it works.

Rule 2: Anything which cannot be done without magic cannot be done with it.

Rule 3: Becoming magic makes you subject to forces "muggles" are not. The rule of three is in full force - For you, karma is not an abstract idea, but a very rapid and vindictive law of nature. And it does not cancel out - if you punch one person and heal another, you will first get hurt three times as badly as person a was, and then rapidly heal even in the absence of further action on your part. This will kill you if you are ever responsible for sufficient harm coming to someone.

Lots of ways that may or may not work depending on how skilled he is at his telekinesis. Burn him, freeze him, poison him, drain the air from the room so he suffocates, use radioactive materials to gamma ray him to death, other energy beams, teleport attacks past his skin, attack him in his sleep, use more physical force than he can push away with his telekinesis, attack faster than he can deflect, use massive sound blasts, attack the body parts that aren't covered by skin (his eyeballs, nostrils, mouth, etc.) or just keep food/water away from him until he dies from thirst/hunger.

#+begin_quote
  how to make a way for his range to increase with time without power-creep, or making him OP too fast?
#+end_quote

The simple way for him to increase his range is simply to grow more skin. It can't get OP too fast, because growing skin takes time. He can slowly increase the total amount of skin he has by grafting skins from one part of his body to another, or using genetic treatments to grow extra appendages. We already have the technology to do this, as shown [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/Vacanti_mouse.jpg][here]]. The extra appendages the MC grows probably won't be functional, but he can control them with his telekinesis anyway since they are covered by his skin. Eventually he will become a telekinetic tentacle monster. Heh.

#+begin_quote
  Also what would be some possible interactions with inanimate matter i.e dark matter, spiritual energy, conceptual power?
#+end_quote

- No reaction: strange matter bypasses his telekinesis, so people can harm him by throwing stuff made of strange matter at him.
- Anti-reaction: matter moves in precisely the opposite direction that he wants them to. Would result in him being horribly weak against it at first, but quickly learning to reverse telekinetic directions when using strange matter.

By the way, this power sounds a lot like Accelerator from [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index][A Certain Magical Index]], who has the power to change the vector of anything that touches his skin. [[https://i.imgur.com/silNqJd.gif][Here]] he flies by creating winds on his back and punches people really far by changing their vectors on contact. [[https://i.imgur.com/jfjGlLs.gif][Here]] he gets beaten up by a power nullifier. The story is full of ideas for what the power can be used for, how to strengthen it, and how to break it, so you may want to check it out if you haven't.

Let's say it starts at around the level of punching trucks. Though I don't know if that would apply for speed since forcing limbs to move fast can damage the muscles, and I doubt the human brain has enough computational power to constantly move the body through 1cm of space in a loop while concentrating on a fight.

*** Work equals force times distance. We know the distance is 1 cm. We can see check common levels of energy from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy][various guns]]. So for the lightest caliber and muzzle velocity of firearm we need to exert 140 J in 1 cm, thus requiring 140/.01 14,000 Newton of force. For heavy firearms you need more .44 magnum you need 1150/.01 115,000 Newton of Force. Note how much more force you need for higher caliber and muzzle velocity.

What does this mean intuitively? We can translate these forces into weight (since our Main Character will likely also be using this power to throw stuff around). Just to quickly get an intuition for it: [[http://www.kylesconverter.com/force/newtons-to-pounds--force][here is a converter to force pounds]]. 14,000 Newtons is 314 pounds, 115,000 Newtons is 2585.3 pounds.

If your setting is medieval, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow][for reference]]:

#+begin_quote
  The quarrel-like 102 gram arrow from a yew 'self bow' (with a draw weight of 144lbs at 32 inches) while travelling at 47.23 metres per second yielded 113.76 joules, more kinetic energy than the lighter broad-heads while achieving 90% of the range. The short, heavy quarrel-form bodkin could penetrate a replica brigandine at up to 40° from perpendicular.
#+end_quote

So about as much KE as a lighter firearm

Of course, as they author, you can finagle things either way if you want your MC to have more durability and less strength or vice versa. If you want more durability and less strength, you could mention that your MC's power acts instinctively and much more powerfully against threats versus raw strength. Or you could mention that your MC's power works better in small intense burst (thus allowing more force against stopping bullets and less for lifting weights). Conversely, if you want your MC to be throwing around boulders but barely able to stop an arrow from killing them, you could mention their power works better with more surface area or time to focus. Either way, you could make up a factor of added efficiency and this can account for difference.

For electricity... it's a bit trickery but you have even more discretion as the author. Let's start with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroshock_weapon][wikipedia page for stun weapons]]

#+begin_quote
  Output voltage is claimed to be in the range of 100 V up to 6 kV; current intensity output is claimed to be in the range of 100 to 500 mA; individual impulse duration is claimed to be in the range of 10 to 100 µs (microseconds); frequency of impulse is claimed to be in the range of 2 to 40 Hz; electrical charge delivered is claimed to be in the range of 15 to 500 µC (microcoulombs); energy delivered is claimed to be in the range of 0.9 to 10 J.[8] [9] The output current upon contact with the target will depend on various factors such as target's resistance, skin type, moisture, bodily salinity, clothing, the electroshock weapon's internal circuitry, discharge waveform, and battery conditions.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, an actual naturally occurring lightning bolt had around a billion joules of electricity. No way the MC can directly survive it with brute force and still not be OP otherwise.

So if your MC can apply their TK power to the movement of electrons with anywhere near the efficiency they can apply it to physical objects, the can easily stop nonlethal shocks. Of course as the author you can BS anything you want about how magical electrical attacks works. Maybe the magic forces the electrons along a path so the conventional calculations of the energies involved don't work and the MC's TK defense doesn't work very well. Maybe your MC's power is ineffective against electricity because the electrons are too small or some conceptual limit.

For blocking fireballs, the trick isn't to stop the heat (which would be a lot of [[https://www.quora.com/How-many-joules-does-a-Bunsen-burner-on-a-medium-flame-500-degrees-Celsius-output-per-second][joules of energy to block]], enough to make our MC require ridiculous amount of energy dissipation, at least compared to blocking bullets and electric shocks). Instead they should push the fireball itself away and minimize the contact with the flammable material (as is done in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewalking#Explanation][firewalking]] for instance). Firewalking works because the coals have low thermal conductivity, as the author you can set the fireball material to whatever you want to make them more or less dangerous. For this, F=MA and the above Work=force times distance will let you estimate how good they are at keeping the fireballs off.

For exotic effects (magic, exotic particles, etc.), I can help but really you can kind of make anything plausible.

Edit: One more note... I assumed you were set on the 1cm range, but note that increasing it proportionality increases the total kinetic energy it can deflect with a given level of force. I.E. increasing range to 5cm is 5 times the KE it can handle with the same amount of force, or decreasing to .2 cm is 5 times less KE. Not sure how set you are on the 1 cm range.

For shooting things, if we're in post-gun times you should just carry a gun. If we're in pre-gun times some kind of custom bow makes sense. You can use absurd draw forces with effectively zero effort, so you should be able to shoot pretty rapidly at very deadly speeds.

For protecting against fireballs, he should be able to just block them by holding the air in front of him still. Blocking lightning is harder without BS like controlling the electrons, and even with it you'd need absurd reaction speeds. Regardless, there's very little reason for him not to move around combat zones in some kind of flying ball of armour, so none of these really pose a threat when prepared for battle.

Oh yeah... any kind of TK strength that is enough to stop an arrow is enough to wear heavy armor on the order of hundreds of pounds.. So I guess if the main character is minmaxing effectively raw power matters a lot less than carrying the right gear.
