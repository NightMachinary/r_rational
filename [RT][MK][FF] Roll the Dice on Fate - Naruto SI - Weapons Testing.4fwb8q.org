** Hah, very nice chapter. Interested to see what's going on with Shikamaru... By the way, you could consider including a last-updated date note in your sig on SV.

*** Glad you liked it. A last updated note? I'm not dismissing it out of hand, but it seems a bit redundant considering anyone can just hit watch thread.

**** Aah, didn't think of that... I'm not used to using functions like that on forums, as by past experience it ends up spamming my e-mail, although that may not be the case on SV, I'll have to check and find out.

***** SV gives you a very obvious choice about whether or not you want to be e-mailed about things when you hit watch.

*** Self-Insert. It's a story where the viewpoint character is based upon the author.

**** Which basically gives me an excuse to add in a new character with a more modern mindset. Naruto isn't exactly packed with rationalists, after all.

***** You could hijack a Nara, no?

Also, did I get it right that willingly getting under a genjutsu makes it harder to fight them in general because it's similar to recognising that you're inside a dream (lucid dreaming, Inception, etc)?

****** I could have hijacked a Nara as chiaroscuro did, but then I wouldn't be able to make references to Akria and Pinky and the Brain. Which is obviously vitally important.

It's not so much a matter of recognising in this case, it's the delay between recognising the illusion and breaking out of it. Much like a martial art, if you practice enough you can have the reaction become automatic and save valuable time. Which is pretty important since knocking someone out for 2 whole seconds should be /plenty/ of time for a ninja to plant a blade in their throat.
