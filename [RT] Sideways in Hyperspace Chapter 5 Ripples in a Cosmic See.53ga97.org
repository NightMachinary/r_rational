** SIH Will be going on a short hiatus while I rebuild my buffer. I moved and my mum ended up flying across the country to visit shortly afterwards, and I've managed to burn through all of my backlog. I'll need a bit of time to replenish it.

** Okay so this is something of a setup chapter, and I'm not sure how it meshes with the pacing from the previous excitement-packed spectacle. There are a bunch of story threads happening and I'm not sure if it works to open a new one especially with this much setup while another is ongoing. Though I'd probably have to read it in one go to be more confident. Also maybe the bit with the radiation hazard can be made slightly clearer.

Is this meant as serial fiction or a book that's just happening to be released chapter-by-chapter?

I'm really sure how I'd describe it. Probably along the lines of Ra or Unsong, where there is an underlying plot, but concessions are made to make each individual chapter more interesting, given that they're released one at a time.

*** Funny thing, one of the most common critiques I see of rationalist serial fiction is that the author introduces too many story threads. I'm wondering if it's a fluke (my sample size is small) or if it's really a common mistake for the sort of people who write these stories. Or maybe the audience is highly enriched with people who find multiple threads annoying?

** I understand that you're aiming for the "hey look, we live in the future but we're teens and we aren't that different." It just feels so out of place.

*** I disagree that if feels out of place. It's a lovely slice of normality which will (no doubt) link to the wider action/adventure fairly soon. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with these characters as much as I am the other sets of characters.

*** I wrote it out about a year ago as a prompt and then never went anywhere with it, the original version I wrote is first person though.

**** Yeah, I found it again. It's wanderlust on talesfromaeria... Didn't realise you were the person behind Fall of Oso. I enjoyed that one, would love to see it continued, the world building was interesting.

***** Its not totally dead, but Tales from Aeria is really a pretty massive project and I just got sort of burnt out on it. Despite the universe that SIH takes place in being much vaster in scope, I find its a lot easier to write about since its an extrapolation from our world instead of having all these fantasy cultures that I basically have to detail out from the agricultural revolution onwards.

So someday there will be more Fall of Oso, but probably not until after I finish SIH.

****** Cool, looking forward to it (and I'm also enjoying SIH, so not going to complain about waiting for it to finish :))

I can completely understand how the world building on Tales from Aeria is much more work... Creating a world with multiple civilisations is definitely quite an undertaking...
