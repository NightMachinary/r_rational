** #+begin_quote
  The man's chest stopped moving.  He's not breathing. I reached out towards Deon's Pith.  Even though he'd been swapped into a healthy body, his Pith had become no more than a few wisps of lightning in his skull.  He sustained too much permanent damage to his brain.  We had taken too long.

Why doesn't Ana transfer into this body? It feels like she should really be able to, and everybody should /really/ be considering it.

I think the subtext is that she can't transfer because the body stopped breathing? If so, that needs to be made a lot clearer. And it's a bit hard to justify, because it takes a few minutes of heart failure for brain damage to settle in. Neon's Pith is dead, but the body should still be fine.

I don't know, for the last few arcs Ana has been obsessing about her imminent death and her need to get a new body. It's really offputting that now that they have a lot of opportunities to steal one they don't even consider it.

*** I dunno, I think it's been stated in-text that the right to steal a body mid-battle is exclusive to Paragoners, and explicitly denied to Ana, whom they want to control and manipulate by dangling possible salvation infront of. Given Lorne's assholishness, I could see Ana taking advantage of the situation and Lorne's friend's death to gain a body causing a dangerous end to the group's cohesion.

Also, Ana has clearly pre-decided against stealing Green Hands' bodies for herself, and may not have realized in the moment that this was an exception.

Finally, Ana has claimed previously that she is used to the current body and will fight better in it, which at this point begins to stagger belief and we may have to suspect is her lying to herself.

But I agree that it's clear that for authorial reasons Ana will not get a new body yet, and having Ana's own reasons for not taking this body be so opaque is frustrating. Better, perhaps, would have been if Paragon had given her a body for the current crisis on a purely temporary basis. Her unwillingness to run away and attempt to steal the body or, body-swap into another and end her ability to work with Paragon to fight Commonplace would be more believable.

*** If she steals one she can't get a replacement without turning herself in and going to, well paragon doesn't seem to believe in jail so much as a torture bottle.

But yea that was lampshaded back in one of the early chapters.

*** It's one of the lines she drew, that she wouldn't steal someone else's body, even if it meant her dying.

Kinda hypocritical to instead force the guy into a body that was dying, but that's her thing now.

**** I think the relevant thing here was that the body in question was unoccupied (or occupied only by a few wisps of dying pith).

**** Yeah, but she went back on it later, at some point she thinks "I should have done it when I had the chance".

Like, there's a lot of possible justifications, but this chapter should at least mention them.

** Cool chapter.

I'm super annoyed that Ana's hero worship is stronger than ever, but that's part of the fun. But ugh she's really irritating sometimes.

** I remember Ana gushing at how cute Penny & Sebastian Oakes were as a couple. Now she knows the truth, that's one less "good" thing about Paragon.
