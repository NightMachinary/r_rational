** Reading this chapter, Hakram's thought process seems much closer to black's than Catherine's. he's just so logical in the way he views things, even the personal relationships within the band.

*** It sorta reflects what Juniper said about him in the last chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “Used to think he was a coldblood,” Juniper admitted. “Everything was surface deep with him. Nothing real under.”

  Coldblood. A disease of the mind, I'd been taught. People who felt less, didn't get remorse or really understand consequences. Adjutant had told me some things in the dark that let me see why she'd thought him one. What she'd taken for absence was just apathy.

*** I think Thief's actions here have more weight than what Hakram perceives. Hakram talks about a rivalry with Thief, but he's not considering the Rivalry that could be developing, or that Thief could be playing a longer game. Thief's origin story and actions thus far suggest someone who backs down to a stronger opponent. But that only works as long as Hakram isn't vulnerable.
