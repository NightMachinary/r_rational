I'm generally speaking an agnostic. But to say the least, I've always been fascinated by religion and the concept of deities. Are there any pieces of rational fiction that explores the topic well?

**** I'm curious how you arrive at such a strongly held opinion that Unsong isn't rational fiction? At the very worst, it is rational-adjacent, but mostly in that it avoids the tropes about turning the protagonist turning the plot on its head by tangential attacks on the central problem.

​

Is it because that the in-universe context is so irrational? That is a feature of the universe, like math.

I would argue that it is as least as 'rational' as MoL, but I have difficulty forming the specific argument without knowing the objection. The classification seems self-evident on initial inspection.

***** I haven't read Mother of Learning, so I can't speak to

a) whether Mother of Learning is above the threshold for being considered rational, according to the standard definitions of the genre (separate from whether it's /socially popular/ among lovers of rational fiction)

b) whether Mother of Learning and Unsong are /comparably/ rational, regardless of whether either meets the bar

The universe being irrational is a large part of the objection. Possibly the central defining characteristic of rational fiction is that the universe is sane, consistent, and sensible---that it's lawful, even if the characters or the reader don't know the laws.

Unsong very specifically doesn't do this, by throwing two dozen /different/ ways-the-universe-might-be-lawful into a blender, and having them co-opt and controvert each other. There's spell-casting, narrativemancy, placebomancy, Uriel's metamagic, random throwaways like Walldrug and the cactus thing, the laws of judgment resulting in people going to heaven or hell, etc. The end result is "pretty much anything could happen; the author can introduce fundamentally brand-new magics three-quarters of the way through the plot and the reader has to update their little mental suspension-of-disbelief document."

The other contender for "the central defining characteristic of rational fiction" is that the /characters themselves/ make sense---that they think and react the way real intelligences think and react; that they pursue their values at least somewhat sensibly and agentically; that they munchkin at least as much as real people munchkin, etc.

Unsong /does/ meet /that/ bar. It's full of people who are, in fact, actually trying (although some of the actually trying is sort of disappointingly first-level obvious and cliché). People do in fact exploit advantages in the way that a capitalist market encourages them to; the organization UNSONG itself is a central example.

IMO, though, you need both in order to qualify as rational fiction. And I'm sort of a stickler for making sure to maintain the boundary that lets rational fiction remain something special and different---I don't want us to slip into calling things rational /just because they're well-written and contain good munchkining./ Similar to how I think it's important to maintain the boundary between parkour and freerunning---freerunning looks very similar to parkour, but it in fact subverts parkour's central (and /only/) defining principle, so blurring the terms destroys the only meaningful distinction.

****** Ah. Thank you for the cogent explaination of your position.

I would substantively disagree with the supposition that the universe itself needs to be rational for a work to be considered rational fiction. This is disctiction between 'the universe' and 'the aggregate actions of nonspecific characters populating the universe'. The universe merely /is/, it does not need to be consistent, it needs to be metaconsistent. It needs to obey the rules set for it, which may conform to constraint criteria which do not exist within its own framework. In the context of unsong, the very meta-rules that operate the universe are of inconsistency, that many in-universe physical and logical constraints can be broken on a regular basis.

In contrast, the aggregate actions of characters in unsong are, as far as I can recall, consistent. They operate within the physical rules of the universe, as disconnected from our own as they may be.

The other argument that I would put forth is that purity arguments are counterproductive. Unsong may be subtly 'not rational fiction', but it is definitely close enough under any definition to not warrant warning people off of reading it for fear it doesn't meet a purity test.

PS: I love your work.

******* Absolutely. It's specifically not Word-of-God, but I've heard Eliezer offer his headcanon-as-author about how the magic system came to be, and it makes perfect sense and holds together even in "normal" universe terms. Not to mention the fact that magic which is shown to work once within the fic always works the same way.

There are certainly places where HPMOR could be better, but I believe it clears the bar. I am less stoked about e.g. the end of Metropolitan Man---my interpretation of the earlier parts of the story is that when Superman is moving at super speed, he's also superperceiving and superprocessing and thus is invulnerable to "surprises," but this is not borne out by the conclusion.

***** I'd say UNSONG and Practical Guide are equally rational, in that both follow the stories of characters using the laws of the worlds they find themselves in to solve their problems. The only reason these stories may seem irrational is because the laws of those universes diverge heavily from ours, mostly through the action of narratives on events in the world. But the fact that their world runs on narrativium is explicitly known by the characters, and they rationally exploit this fact for all it's worth at every opportunity. That makes the protagonists rational.

*** See, I find this response unsatisfactory. If simulation theory is correct, then just by knowing about a universe is equivalent to that universe existing (given perfect omniscience). So when god differentiates between a good universe and a bad one, both the good and bad exist as perfect simulations in god's mind. Therefore, just by virtue of being omniscient, all possible evil worlds and good worlds and every world in between exist. Or so it seems to me.

Because, yeah, obviously, why would he do that?

If I myself can imagine the /concept of/ the existence of a Bad Universe, in the abstract, without personally modeling every subatomic particle of any particular one, surely God can avoid accidentally simulating universes that are truly not worth the processing power.

Even with an error margin added to the cost of running the process itself, He can come out ahead, net, without making the whole exercise pointless like you're imagining.

********* It's something of a philosophical question, I suppose. What does the sentence "X matters to you" mean? I assert that it means "X is something that will cause preventable negative consequences to you." That harm might be physical (e.g. injury, death, destruction of your property) or emotional (e.g. someone you care about is hurt or is angry at you). Being mugged matters to you because you don't want to be shot or have your property taken. Your child being mugged matters to you because you will suffer emotional harm if they are shot/have their property taken. (That's what empathy /is/: Suffering emotional harm as a result of harm some to someone else.) If you are a person who cares about everyone then a hurricane that destroys a city on the other side of the planet matters to you to the extent that you have some capacity to help -- perhaps by sending money to help with disaster relief, or by physically going there to do the disaster relief work yourself. If you have no ability to help in any way then it is right to say that the hurricane the hurricane does not matter to you and you should try not to feel badly about the situation since that simply increases the amount of suffering in the world for no good reason.

In a predetermined universe where we have no ability to make changes, there is no reason for anything to matter to us. Things will play out as they are destined to.

In a universe with an omniscient being, there is no free will. The being knows what you are going to do and there is no way for you to do otherwise. You do not actually have the capacity to prevent any harm, since any harm that you perceive is inevitable and cannot be averted.

That leaves the question: Is the real universe predetermined or do we actually have free will? It's difficult to account for where free will comes from, but we feel like we have it and therefore we need to act as though we have it. That means acting as though things matter.

I mean imagine if there were currently an omniscient (but not immortal or omnipotent) being sitting on some moon and pondering all your future actions with detailed accuracy. As you say, this means you don't actually have free will. Then this being dies. It knew that was going to happen but it didn't have the power to stop it. Otherwise nothing really changes as far as your place in the universe and its laws is concerned. Do you really think that the death of that being might grant you free will? How?

I also want to point out that predetermination and free will aren't the only two option. You can also introduce random chance without that in any way leading to free will.

If you imagined/calculated/simulated each of their atoms in exact detail, that would presumably be morally equivalent (in this universe where dreamed universes have moral weight) to someone in 'real life' suffering in the same way.

If you decrease the resolution of the simulation, fill in the blanks with low-level guesses, how does personhood correlate to simulation fidelity? Assume (!) a simple vision in your head (if you have visual imagination) of someone suffering has negligible moral weight, you're not causing an agent significant suffering by doing that, and a full simulation is as bad as a 'real-life' equivalent's suffering.

** I know With This Ring by Mr. Zoat is fairly popular on this sub (despite not being strictly "rationalist"), and deals with numerous religious and philosophical themes. In the DC universe every religion is true in some fashion or another, and as you can imagine that has /huge/ consequences.

This is my favorite bit, from the MC in a TV interview:

#+begin_quote
  "There are any number of more powerful beings out there. Refusing to believe they exist when you have good evidence that they do is simply... Foolish. Instead, what you get are materialists. People who believe that there's no... Fundamental difference between 'higher powers' and lower ones, merely a difference /of/ power."

  "What I find particularly amusing about it is how painfully logical such philosophies tend to be about moral utility. If a normal man or woman dives in front of a bullet to stop it killing someone else, they are performing an exemplary act of self sacrifice. There are few acts more worthy of praise. On the other hand, if someone bulletproof like me does it, we're not really sacrificing anything. If I step in front of a regular bullet I probably won't even feel the impact. Rather than being an exemplary act of self sacrifice, it's merely a good deed. To that way of thinking, the more powerful you get, the more you have to do to justify praise.”

  "To that philosophy, anything that wanted people to directly worship it had better either be doing a lot of good in a non-self-serving way, or actually require it to accomplish a particular thing. An omnipotent being is of no interest to such a philosophy, because it would be trivially easy for it to do anything, and as such there is nothing it could do that would be worthy of praise."

****** Going by the same rationale as The Salvation War, the unleashed plague would likely be something like what we've already seen historically (Spanish flu or something) rather than a genetically engineered perfect superplague, which we can counter if not perfectly.

Blotting out the sun in a local area is something humans can both do and counter relatively easily depending on how it's done - the angelic forces don't seem to have access to planet-sized solar sails.

The telepathy is of course up in the air for how to counter, but like in the story I'd give even odds that humanity could use the scientific method to learn how magic works better than the native superstitious users before the year was up.

Well, in the Bible it's done by, y'know, magic. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+10%3A1-15&version=NIV][They can stop the Sun in the sky as well]].

I guess it depends on what the underlying reality is and how complicated it is. You could certainly write it in such a way that it's solvable and humanity wins, either by figuring out the mechanisms involved (although note that IRL understanding and unifying different parts of physics has taken centuries and is still incomplete) or by having it prove not /too/ OP (perhaps they can puppeteer people but not read minds, although traditionally they can do both.) Or the opposite - there's no law of physics that says "superstitious natives" can't have an insurmountable advantage, or for that matter that they have to be "superstitious" at all.

Regardless, it would be a more challenging and interesting conflict than "tinfoil hats block telepathy lol".

First of all, there have been quite a few historical plagues much more dangerous than Spanish Flu. But you're right, that's exactly what would happen in the Salvation War universe - everything is downplayed, ignored or cartoon-ified so as to make humanity win with ease.

******** Indeed, learning the rules of magic depends on the specifics, though it is notable that you don't need to know as much as a doctor in order to know more about diseases than someone from the first millenium. They may of course not be as bad as 10th century doctors.

I think The Salvation War generally goes from an interpretation of the passages where Gods' chosen people are turned away by chariots and follows logically from there when it makes judgements about how much of the divines powers are mostly show rather than power.

I know there's a few (like the sunstopping and the claimed creation of the entire universe) where humanity still cannot reach, but it's surprisingly often that a supposed miracle falls short of modern human achievements by enourmus margins (feeding thousands with loaves of bread on a single occasion vs modern technology and economic systems producing enough food /every day/ for billions to eat cheaply).
