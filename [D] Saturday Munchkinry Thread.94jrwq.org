Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You know that:

- in a month from now your world is going to get RPG-ified
- people will get transported into a new dimension, without the ability to retain any clothes or items that were in their possession at the moment of transfer (everybody will be given standard equipment sets instead; people with implants will find themselves in more standard baseline human bodies)

  - they will be separated at first, then eventually be able to communicate with a random (growing) set of other people

- each time someone manages to be the first one to accomplish something significant (kill a monster, kill a boss, clear an area, do something unique, etc), they get a bonus as a reward (a title that gives passive buffs, a skill, an item, experience points, etc)

What plans do you come up with during this one month to accelerate your power accumulation once the new system kicks in? What calculations do you try to make (e.g to try predicting what approaches will likely be helpful for munchkining this yet-unknown RPG system), what risk factors do you try to keep in mind, etc?

Your goals is to attain the quickest power accumulation rates among humans.

Given the sheer number of people involved in this “experiment”, it is very unlikely that you'll be able to stay on the edge of highest level “players” unless you come up with some really effective and unique strategies.

I already know English, which is a pretty good advantage considering how widespread it is, but it's not universal.

For the actual combat bits, probably study military strategy and wilderness survival. It would be difficult to make any precise plans without more information, but being generally more proficient at strategy and being better able to survive without civilization would be useful.

*** The nature of the setup means that you need to snowball in order to be successful. If you're the first to one to do something significant, then you now have a bonus that will help you get more of those first-past-the-posts bonus. That means that at the beginning, you want to be ready to go into immediate action. You have foreknowledge, so you can be mentally ready; most people, transported to a new rpg dimension will panic instead of going monster hunting. If you're immoral, trying to commit the first murder might be avenue to new titles and bonuses, which you can then use to snowball. Otherwise, just being the first monster killer, by sprinting right out of the gates and finding something small to strangle might give you enough of an initial boost to get rolling.

Another priority would be to make your skills, titles, and classes thematically unified. It seems like there are more potential unlocks for creating unified sets of skills, so staying on theme should help with that. One skill that would be important to try to discover/create is something related to learning, in order to try to increase xp gain/skill growth. Meditation and visualizing also seems like a useful route to new unlocks and potentially magic.

So, to summarize. Since everybody is getting a standard body and no prior tools, the most important thing to get ready for the beginning is your mindset. If you can move faster than most people in the initial minutes, you can start a snowball. You should try to pick up skills that go well together, like rapier and Dodge, or wind and fire magic. Complementary skills are more likely to have further unlocks, which helps with your snowball. And during the preparation month, you should practice meditating, martial arts, and get comfortable with a weapon. Staffs would be a good choice, due to the ease of making/finding one in a new world. It might not be enough to catch up to somebody already skilled in martial arts, but I think what would matter most is how you behave in the first minutes.

*** If the skills from your life are transported to this new world then learning swordsmanship, archery or fighting in general is pointless, since there will be thousands of people that have been doing it for years. The skill gap would be too large to become a top player.

The best bet would be to aim for skills not available in our life. Stuff like magic, healing etc. You could maybe prepare for this by learning some memorization techniques though obviously there's no guarantee this would be useful.

I imagine forming a group of like-minded people prior to the transition would be one of the priorities. A month is a long enough time that you could build trust and being with a group is safer plus you can accomplish more.

Firstly, Swords are for melee. Secondly, swords are not a weapon of war, they are a badge of Rank. Either social, or military - the fact that you are carrying a sword means you are entitled to wear a weapon, and also that you are important and protected enough that it is more important that the weapon is easy to carry around than actually any good for winning a fight.

Same social niche as a handgun has today, more or less. If you know you are going to be fighting for your life, you bring a /real/ weapon instead. Which means something ranged, or some variation on the spear. If everyone is geared up in plate, then a maul.

I've never seen an RPG in which swords and spears were that radically out of balance. It usually comes down to swords doing Hack or Slash damage, and spears doing Pierce or Stab damage, with the damage types being better against one type of armour/enemy than another, and range being all but ignored.

That, and swords are usually one-handed, while spears are usually two-handed. So you can fight with a sword and a shield, but not a spear and a shield, making swords the safe option (especially against archers) while spears are the aggressive damage-dealer option (with no safety net).

Swords are popular, so most people want swords to be viable in casual play, so the devs make efforts to ensure that swords are viable in casual play. It's an approach intended to attract modern-day fans of Fantasy iconography, not hardcore re-enactment types.

******** If the system actually enforces balance, you are screwed no matter what. - Specifically, spears being better follows from the mechanics of hand to hand, and the only way to override that is to limit you to a fixed move set, in which case any training you do in advance is pointless.

Spears have a fantastic defense: Reach. You can kill things that show up without a spear before they get close enough to touch you.

If you are in an archery contest, you should have brought a bow, not a shield, because without 40 buddies to make a testudo, you are just going to earn an arrow to the proverbial knee.

The historic record, and the reenactment nerds say the same thing: Swords are what you carry in peace to tell everyone you have the right to kill people that annoy you and dispatch (untrained, unarmored) bandits that jump you.

Carrying one into a battle you know you is coming is the equivalent of going off to fight Isis with a glock. Sure, it is a weapon. But.. uhm. Nope. Good way to die.

Also, you are quite likely to be fighting a lot of animal-level enemies. Again, swords are terrible for that.

What? How do you figure that?

If the system enforces balance, then a Level 1 Sword and a Level 1 Spear will do similar, if not identical damage. If spears are allowed extra range as an advantage, then they will likely do less damage per hit to compensate. Likewise guns, crossbows and normal bows will all have tradeoffs to keep them all viable to use depending on context.

If that sounds bizarre and arbitrary, well, /welcome to RPGs./

You could still theorycraft an optimal build within that system. You'd just need to play by the system's rules, instead of expecting it to play by your own.

..... Uhm. Have you ever practiced a weapon art? Making the rule of cool determine balance is very straight forward when you are talking pixels on a screen.

Doing the same thing when you are physically present requires the game to dig its hooks way deep into your skull and actively stopping you from doing the obvious thing. Or blatantly intervening to make the wounds from a spear less severe than they should be, while not debuffing swords.

Neither of which will "be cool" from the perspective of the people in the immersive world, so assuming some sanity in game design, wont happen.

Things that might happen is combat just being much less lethal than it should be across the board, and the classic "very rapid learning" thing. Which is also monstrously invasive of your mind, but most people will not reject that one.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. Level 1 Sword == Level 1 Spear == Level 1 Mace would not be some abstract game design concept, that would be abandoned as soon as humans got hold of them. It would be an immutable law of nature in this new reality, as rigid as physics was in the old.

You talk about "blatantly intervening", but that's nonsense. Do you say that gravity "blatantly intervenes" when objects fall downwards? Do you say thermodynamics "blatantly intervenes" when cold objects heat up to the ambient temperature of their surroundings? So why would you say that about a world where the rules were wildly different?

Uh... going by OP's post, this new world isn't some hyper-immersive videogame. It's its own, self-contained reality, with its own internal rules and logic. It's not trying to be sanely designed. It's not trying to be anything. It just /is./

And insofar as the setting would be governed by rule of cool, well... it wouldn't be going by what its new human residents think is cool. Why would it? What RPG is designed around appealing to the /entire human race?/ No, it would be going by what people playing RPGs in the safety of their own homes think is cool.

*** I'd research all existing RPGs, and try to form natural categories for them. I'd look into the underlying rules of various systems and memorize them, so that I'll be able to recognize these rules in the new world. My goal is to know how the game is likely to work already, instead of having to discover it from scratch while playing. For each category of world I'll design a response strategy.

In general, I'd look for feedback loops. For example, do lifesteal and damage reflect work with each other? Can I boost intelligence temporary with potions, allowing me to make better potions of intelligence? Assuming no truly broken feedback loop exists, I try to find the fastest response strategy for each type of world. What type of character steamrolls given the world's rules?

I would probably come up with a basic experimental paradigm to distinguish the types of worlds. For example, a quick tour of town to look for respawn points would be one of the first steps. Another example: I'd visit a shop and examine the wares to get a sense of progression. If nothing in the shop seems end-tier, there must be other towns to be discovered rather than the single home base, or other ways of unlocking new gear. The specifics of the experiments would depend on what my research into RPGs yields. As much as possible, I'd put in experiments that would reveal that the new world doesn't in fact hew to anything I had studied: I need to be aware when something in the new world doesn't match any of my expectations, as well.

Whether or not death is permanent is one of my primary concerns. I'd have to balance the risk of death with the desire to advance. If death is temporary I build into a glass cannon; raw power will give me many firsts and will feed into itself well. If death is permanent I build into a summoner or tank (unless I think some other class is a better strategy to live, obviously). I ask myself how much risk of death I'm willing to tolerate, for power.

I inform my intelligent friends of this impending doom. If the world has fast transit options, we can meet up and cooperate. If it does not, we will reconvene later and use more flexible strategies until then. We'll have different response plans for each case, of course. The problem of finding useful party members is not trivial and I'd prefer to party with a group that had a month to prepare with me. If that isn't an option I need to come up with a way to select good party members--hopefully my (recently-acquired) abundant knowledge of RPGs will lend me persuasive power in the new world.

In all cases, power is not obtained alone.

*** Which kind of RPG? Because the answer differs a lot depending on how seriously one needs to take death. Is it primarily just pain and suffering, and a visit to the spirit healer, or is it permadeath?

Because in the latter case, the "First" incentives are a really obvious trap, and the world is going to belong to the people who level really, really cautiously.

In the first case - Where death is painful, but not permanent, read up on cognitive behavior theraphy as it relates to ptsd, and still level extremely carefully, because in this case, ultimate power will acrue to whoever manages to stay sane the longest.

Other obvious areas of study; Anthropology, and the study of non-human minds. Because diplomacy, if possible, is a path to success too.

Animal handling? Very few rpg style worlds do not have at least an option for combat capable pets.

** Similar questions have been asked here before, but those discussions are old and I want to ask it in a slightly different form:

How much $ would you pay for one, True™ bit? If an omniscient oracular device agreed to give you a completely true answer to any single answerable binary question, what's the highest amount of money you'd be willing to pay it for that answer? You ask the question and then some short (<1s), arbitrary amount of time later it answers. Assume you are completely convinced of its authenticity, but can't transfer that conviction to anybody else except through normal persuasive means. Questions that have no true answer (say, ones involving prediction of the future, and then you do the opposite of what it says, or whose answer otherwise affects the future in a manner that results in the answer being untrue) are instead drawn from a discrete uniform distribution over {0,1}. Ambiguities in question-wording are resolved by mind-reading your intentions and finding the closest well-specified question.

You can pay money in three alternative manners: via 1) using already liquid funds, or through liquidating existing possessions, 2) using money borrowed through conventional means from a conventional, though unusually trusting loan officer, 3) using money borrowed from a supernatural loan agency that upon agreement teleports you to an extradimensional, extratemporal space, where your current bodily condition is maintained and you perform uninspiring hard labor full time at a rate of $100/day, and cannot otherwise use this opportunity to engage in meaningful work. You retain memory of your time here, but those memories are really boring. Your psychological health remains unchanged throughout your stay, so you are not driven insane by loneliness or other factors.

How much money would you pay through the above methods for each marginal bit, assuming you can negotiate deal an arbitrary number of times? How many bits would you buy, and at what maximum total cost?

How would your answer change if you could delay acquisition of bits indefinitely? Say, for a single bit -- you receive a magic coin that can be flipped while focusing on your question, and subtle forces interact to alter its trajectory such that it lands on the predefined "true" side, before becoming a completely mundane coin. The coin is transferable, but again, nobody but you is convinced of its power. The forces applied max-out after a single Joule has been used, so no creating perpetual motion devices that keep the coin forever spinning in an attempt to answer a known question, or whatever.

**** Yah it depends on how sensitive the results are to your choices after seeing the bit(s). For a single bit you'd ideally find a roulette table-like system whose result has been determined beforehand and hidden, so that your success or failure is purely decided and deterministic -- this prevents your actions upon seeing the bit from affecting the outcome (e.g. if you bet red upon seeing red maybe the spin is affected or scrambled enough to fall on black, and if you bet black it falls on red. If the oracle sees both these occurring it'll just give you a random bit and call it a night). But most roulette systems probably aren't so sensitive, and so that lower bounds you to table maximums ($10k? $500k? the internet doesn't seem to have a firm answer). You might be able to get more value out of playing the stock market, again depending on the size of your investment and how much money you have left over after buying the bit to wager (and if your investment would affect the future trajectory of the stock). I'm not sure what the best opportunities for that sort of thing are; hence my question.

You can also use it to obtains answers to "big" questions that might otherwise affect how you live your life, e.g. regarding your continuity of experience after death, or something. Or if you fancy yourself capable of doing great things, asking about futures where you didn't see the bit but dedicated yourself wholly to achieving some goal, and the proportion of those futures (e.g. > 0.5?) where your attempts succeeded.

In this hypothetical the decision to buy or not is being asked of you now, so pooling humanity's funds would be limited by your ability to convince others quickly, absent any evidence (only you are magically convinced). Still, I think if you're confident an AI likely to satisfy your values can be instantiated with, say, a billion bits, it's interesting to ask how many years of extratemporal labor you would be willing to trade for it (defining a marginal cost curve would be difficult, but seeing your average-maximum-payment-per-bit would be neat, esp. in comparison to how much you'd pay for smaller numbers of individual bits)?

Your one and only purpose is to make a 12 year old boy as happy as possible, according to your best estimate of what he thinks happiness is (so keeping him drugged up on heroin for eternity is off the table). You are fairly intelligent, but seeing as it is based on a human brain, you can't easily make yourself more intelligent (no more than you could in real life). It is expected that you will find out about rationalist methods relatively soon. What steps would you take in accomplishing your goal?

To clarify, the reason I say that you are an AI is because you do not have any other goals. You do not have feelings other than wanting the boy to be happy. It is not love in a traditional sense since you will not become jealous. If the boy finds a girlfriend, and you believe he is happy, then that makes you happy. If you think the boy would be happier with you as his girlfriend (to the best of your ability as a rationalist), and you believe this would outweigh the unhappiness of a breakup, you may attempt to sabotage his relationship. You also have no morals unless you think that this would benefit in furthering the boy's happiness, so the use of murder and financial crimes to further your goals is on the table, assuming you won't get caught.

Also, there is no preference for the boy's current happiness. You do not prefer an option that makes him happier now at the cost of being much unhappier later.
