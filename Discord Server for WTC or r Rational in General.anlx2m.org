Is there a community other than reddit for ratfic? Barring that a community for WTC?


** The [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discord is here: [[http://discord.gg/rational]]

The WtC discord is here: [[https://discord.gg/8MdWg2r]]

****** Expressing dispreference without articulating even the slightest actual objection makes for pretty poor communication. I /personally/ prefer reddit to Discord, in part because asynchronous communication allows for better development of thoughts and the inclusion of citations, and I'd prefer just one communication channel to keep track of (since there's inevitable duplication of discussion), but I /am/ curious to know what other objections people have.

******* splitting a community into reddit / forum / discord / slack / irc / etc hurts everyone, not just the people who choose each specific place

A lot of rational-adjacent communities also use IRC pretty extensively. [[/r/HFY]] and [[/r/Parahumans]] both do, for instance. This subreddit does as well, and [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-rational][here is the link.]]

***** Probably a new/old reddit issue. I'll look it over tonight and make sure the information is duplicated.

Edit: Done, it's in a new widget. That information should probably be updated, given that it was written a few years ago, but I don't have a handy list of Discord invites, subreddits, etc.

** There is, as has been linked, an [[/r/rational]] discord server. I have to say, however, I didn't feel it was that much related. There's none of the built-in focus on fiction, and the resulting all-purpose discussion forum tends more towards all the other subjects the rationalsphere might feel like discussing. Beyond that, the place is supposedly drenched in internal politics.

The alexanderwales discord is, best as I can tell, much closer to being this subreddit in discord form, in terms of content, tone and focus.

*** Yeah, the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discord just bears the name, there is very little relation to the subreddit or to rational fiction other than that. It mostly just acts as a social hub for the regulars on that server and their interests, which very occasionally includes rational fiction.
