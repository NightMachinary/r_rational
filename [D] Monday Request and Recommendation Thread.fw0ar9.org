Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** It's... Monday somewhere right?

Is there any engaging ‘rational' fiction that has NO ‘weird sex stuff'. It's all I can find lately and it's been dragging me down. Metaphorically.

**** Most of the generally recommended fiction...

Mm, the list is too long. It's too much to expect the casual observer to read so I was kind of just hoping someone would have read something interesting lately that wasn't too well known or had slipped through the cracks.

The most obvious ones are: Delve, Worm et. al., He Who Fights Monsters, Something Healer, Cradle, Ra, Unsong, most of EY's stuff (HPMOR et. al.), 14, Gilded Hero, Metropolitan Man (ehh), etc. etc.

Edit: Weird Sex stuff shows up a lot. Or if not sex stuff it'll just be really weird and uncomfortable. And I know I have a lot of triggers on that front but I can't get past most of them if they're one off. But when the character is thinking with their dick more often then their head or they're getting ‘serviced' for no particular reason or one of their skills is ‘talk with women' I just can't. It's too much. I don't like all that stuff in my normal fiction :<

***** Just checked your posts and saw you already read Mother of Learning, which was gonna be my rec, and Worth the Candle, which while it definitely has some extremely weird and uncomfortable moments deals with them pretty well.

Long shot, but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] has zero romance and I've been enjoying it lately. It does have some prurient jokes in the game text sometimes. For shorter recs, you could give [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/][The Northern Caves]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]] a try, in that order. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][CORDYCEPS]] seems like the kind of thing you might have already read.

I think you might've got less of a "can't find good non-sex stuff" problem and more of an "already read every good rational fic" one. A lot of people in these threads seem to have that problem, including me. (Maybe write some?)

****** Yeah your... right. The stuff I've been reading lately has been full of that kind of stuff but it's probably just been some bad luck. I've read so many rational and rational-adjacent fictions. I'm kind of sad the well is starting to dry of stuff that isn't low-FanFiction quality. WtC was a little weird but it's well written and engaging, I took a break to numb the pain and awkwardness of her death but came back to catch up on the updates.

Thank you for the recommendations! I haven't heard of them so hopefully they're engaging.

And on the topic of writing... I used to write a lot of FanFiction plots, nothing published of course but I'm pretty sure it's in the 100k+ word range in total. Which is kind of wack. Proof is easy, I know words on the internet are cheap, if it matters. I haven't been particularly inspired for a few months but even before that I could never convince myself to commit to writing anything. It's a lot of effort and I get distracted really easily. My grammar and spelling skills are also pretty messed up from all those years of reading not-quite-edited FF so I'd probably just feel bad and rewrite everything 10 times. I wrote this stupid plot for BNHA, some romantic fix-it-fic, and then rewrote it 7 times. It was after that I realized I'd run out of ideas for that fandom, felt about not working on my original ideas, and well, here we are now much later with no updates.

So, uhh... 50/50 chance you'll see something not under this pen name out eventually.

******* If you want something not entirely rational I may have a few things.

Ar'Kendrythist is super long, starts off like Delve but becomes its own thing very quickly. Same level of worldbuilding and consistency as Delve (though not as much math). The main protagonist is a middle aged dude, so anything romance related takes a long time to appear, much less happen. Character development is well done, and the author has been pretty respectful about how he approaches character relationships in general. Heavily recommend.

River of Fate is a xianxia written in native english. It's pretty good, and the characters actually seem like they think before making decisions. It does the mystical aspect of cultivating well. Zero romance so far.

Chronicles of Fid is a good superhero trilogy about the world's biggest supervillain, Dr. Fid. It's not as self-consistent as Worm, but for what it sets out to do, I found the story to be engaging and Fid's character to be interesting. Zero romance.

****** Just caught up to DCC and it was pretty interesting. The writing is fairly consistent and the distasteful humor is only over used in the kind of ‘this was never edited' kind of way, maybe... Let's say it was engaging enough to overcome its flaws by a slight margin, at least in my opinion. It's unfinished and unless there's time skips in the future it's timescale is looking to be very, very, long so I guess I'll check back in a few years.

Thanks again! On to the next one I suppose...

It's set in a rationalish fantasy world, and the protagonist finds herself stranded in the wilderness fighting off monsters. She eventually fixes up an old inn and becomes an [inkeeper] (with levels).

*** Most of Brandon Sanderson's stuff is reasonably rational or at least adjacent. But my recommendation in general is, go for published books that are known to be good. They tend to be rational adjacent, that's what makes them good, imho it has more to do with the authors intelligence and care than with an actual intentional desire to make their stories rational..

​

The book of ancestors by Mark Lawrence is great and has a powerful non mary sue female MC. Published books tend to have less sexual or misogynistic stuff, because they are meant to be sold.

​

You may also be able to find a 'booktuber' with tastes similar to yours and read some of their recommendations. I like Daniel Greene, even though our tastes aren't exactly the same and he's kind of ignorant when it comes to foreign fiction, the books he likes tend to be good.

​

If you don't want or can't pay for books you can get them for free on library genesis. Here's a link, [[http://gen.lib.rus.ec]] search around if you don't trust it. It's a site made to freely distribute scientific publications and books in general to the world, and there's a fiction section.

** I have discovered [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrxKX44qBJ0][The Guy who Didn't Like Musicals]] on this subreddit and it absolutely blew me away. The same team has recently released a new one, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqt4_tHLSB4][Black Friday]], and it's also absolutely incredible.

I wouldn't call them rational or rationalist fiction, but this is the best thing I have discovered in the last few years, and I wanted to share in case you haven't heard about it.

They're Sci-Fi Comedy Horror Musicals, which is a pretty crazy mix, but they're /so/ good. Imagine Dr. Horrible was 2 hours long, and every minute of it was exactly as awesome. Just watch the one from the first link, I fell in love with it in since the first song.

The same team has a bunch of other musicals, they're also pretty great, though not on the same level as these two. The others worth watching are:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5mkyhYMaQ8][Twisted]] - the Aladdin told from the perspective of Jafar
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOblLPsAK_U][Firebringer]] - how humanity has discovered fire
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAi0XQPgXmQ&list=PLC6A915952D67F112][Starship]] - Aliens meets Little Mermaid.

I have also enjoyed [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmZhMeY5L44][Holy Musical Batman]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd3aJl930YE][Spies are Forever]]. They're also quite delightful.

Lauren Lopez stars in all of these musicals and she's amazing, absolutely steals every show she's in. Check out [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_U1iYqdkyU][this scene]] from Spies are Forever(even if you aren't planning to watch the whole thing). All the actors in this team are talented, but damn.

*** I have to say, I've never really understood why so many people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] like Twisted so much. I really like it's premise, but the execution was just very sub-par. It's been a while since I've watched it, but I remember my main issue with it was the constant jabs at Disney through world building elements that made literally no sense. It leans much more towards contrarian, or subversive fiction than full on rational fiction. Not to get too semantic here, but I'd barely even call it rational-adjacent. The only similarity between Twisted, and true rational fiction is Jafar's more intellectual approach to policy. I'd like to see a rational fic with the same premise (Jafar as a small time city manager trying to reform his country using evidence based policy), but where Jafar must figure out ways to politically outmanoeuvre his political opponents, and win the common people's votes and support.

tl;dr: Rationality is the art of winning. Jafar is the biggest loser in the land, and the land is a world building exercise in roasting Disney. Thus, Twisted is not rational, nor a good story.

EDIT: To be fair, I did like Twisted's depiction of Jafar as an idealistic intellectual, facing problems that challenge his core beliefs and are not suited for his intellectuality. Certainly it makes sense how many on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would identify with this aspect. But, he never actually solves his problems! The best he can do is take the necklace his wife gave him and “believe that magic is real”! And then he's shown a path that'll make all his problems go away. This is not rational.

*** As a Team Starkid fan, I'll agree TGWDLM was pretty darn good... but I did not enjoy "Black Friday" nearly as much. The songs weren't nearly as strong, there were too many plot lines to devote attention to specific characters, and the best of the jokes were really just references to previous shows (especially TGWDLM). It was worth watching, IMO, but it was definitely not one of my favorites.

I would put "Twisted" up there as my favorite, tied with the Harry Potter musicals (more as a fan of the series than for how strong they were in any particular way). TGWDLM was great too, though I'm not sure I like the Hatchetfield spin-offs it has set up if "Black Friday" was any indication. We'll see how "Nerdy Prudes Need to Die" goes (rumored to be their next musical, though "Working Boys" may get a stand-alone release first).

** I am in search of several different recommendations:

- New sites for webfiction other than RoyalRoad, AO3, Fanfiction.net, Fimfiction, Storiesonline, and Novelupdates. Especially looking for any blog webfiction that isn't on other websites (like [[https://www.themagineer.com/][The magineer]] or [[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/][Taint]]) or fiction that is on websites you wouldn't expect ([[https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01][Dream Drive on literotica]])

- Long (>500k words) web/fan/erotic fiction you've read. [[/r/rational]] readers tend to overlap with my interests even if it's not rational

- Any sci-fi/fantasy that covers if magic/crazy super-tech were introduced to current day society and how that magic/tech changes life. Effectively "the singularity". Most novels seem to skip this phase of the process and jump to 100 years later after most of the changes have already happened.

- Anything pro-immortality that isn't the villain. Preferably with a real chance of getting it

- Looking for stories that give the feel of the main character being surrounded by dumb-ish NPCs and abusing that fact. Examples of this concept would be HPMOR, With This Ring, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, or Two Year Emperor.

I try to define my entertainment based on whether or not I was entertained, not whether or not the content was objectively good. Junk food entertainment is fine, so don't feel like you only need to suggest books with no typos or excellently crafted plots. It's enough if you found enjoyment from it.

It's interesting in how it explores sapient creatures created by the MC's system, and their dubious existence (are they automatons? do they have free will? Are they philosophical zombies?). There's some sorta deconstruction going on also with the MC's charisma and libido stat(which is ever rising), as well as his role as The Gamer (his origin and purpose). And the mc's build is really cool, it's like a mix between dimensionalism and summoning. Also copious amounts of sex and bodily fluids, hence the un-recommendation.

I'd argue that, while there are story-like elements and the rare bit of deus ex machina, the world and the characters follow the tenets of [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I'd recommend it if you enjoy Delve.

For example, when they say "Oxygen doesn't exist, you draw sustenance from Lavi via your lungs", it isn't just flavor text. There are predictable implications from that, which become clear later.

I think you might just be fixating a little too much on this... It's a symbolism/trippy dream sequence, her chest is swelling with pride - if you take that literally it means she is becoming more and more barrel chested as the size of her upper body increases.

Is it the usage of the phrase"cup sizes" that is throwing you off? Would "I feel warm inside and my chest swells with pride. 5 inches... 10 inches..." have been better? It doesn't have nearly as good of a flow or comedic effect.

When someone references that "her chest swells", I don't think it's possible to not make some connection to the fact that women have breasts.

I think describing the story in this light is a very negative misrepresentation based on a very small selection of content.

I'm very curious to see more of the world the author has built, and the AI characters. The human characters are OK, but are not exceptionally well written. If you've read about the world and just aren't interested on a game mechanic / murder mystery level, then you can drop it without looking back. We all have different standards and I'm not a book salesman.

Also...

The AI creators are unknown. I think you skipped the bit of the prologue that stated the translocation event occurs randomly (soccer stadiums, basketball games, ect...) not exclusively Comic Cons. The AI were (most likely) not engineered by a previous batch of abducted Comic Con attendees. My personal theory is that the AI are those who failed the game, but that's unsubstantiated.

It feels clunky to me and the rest of the story isn't enough for me to just ignore it and keep going when there's a chance to be more that will make me groan in disappointment.

I know that sex is a large part of human nature, that it always has been. There's just so many fetishes out there and it's such a personal thing, an author dabbling in sexual content is as likely to scare someone away as they are to draw them in, even if it's just vanilla near-fluff. For example, I just read Dungeon Crawler Carl and it was chock full of so many references to a foot fetish, which personally disgusts me for a number of reasons, that I'm surprised I managed to get through the current content. I had to back out and let my mind wander a few times before the raw ‘ugh' of reading it faded away and I could get back to the kind-of-sort-of-not-really-at-all rational-adjacency of the dungeon crawl. If I backed out of every story that had something disagreeable in it then MoL might have been the only fic here I ever finished. (On review the fact that Zorian did the typical ‘not-trusting-anyone' thing that always causes me second hand emberassment I might have ducked out of that one too... I just wouldn't read anything. And that would be very, very, boring.)

Also the ultimate response to any ‘in-story' explanation is that the author had a reason, or lack of one, for including or not including something in their story. It's up to them, at the end of the day, because what matters most is that the author is making something they enjoy and if they pandered to everyone's whims there wouldn't be a story. That stuff felt unnecessary to me, personally.

** I've been reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst][Ar'Kendrithyst]] for the past month or so. It starts off sort of like Delve, where a middle aged dude and his daughter get isekai'd into another world with magic and a "system." It quickly becomes its own thing though. I highly recommend it.

Things I liked:

- The characters are all well written and three dimensional. There is a lot of good character development, as well as meaty relationships.

- Worldbuilding is great. Veird is a well developed place with believable history and vibrant environments, which are shown well when the characters visit those places.

- There is a good balance between the powerful protagonist and his powerful enemies, not all of whom can be defeated by purely physical means.

- The magic development + the magic of Veird itself is really interesting.

Things I didn't like:

- The main character faces a moral/personal dilemma which can be sort of hit or miss. For me it was more on the miss than the hit. I will say that it makes sense given his character though, so it doesn't seem unwarranted.

As for requests, I've got two. Anybody have recs for big meaty stories, preferably 200k words or more, that have a bunch of time pass? One thing I've noticed with long stories is that the pace is almost always really slow. I want a long story with a significant amount of time passing between the beginning and the ending (or the latest chapter I guess).

My other request is for stories with hivemind protagonists. Something like Zorian from Mother or Learning, or Taylor from Ex Synthetica, or the virus from Biomass Effect. Bonus points for using the hivemind in interesting ways (other than just a supercomputer).

The Long Price series, by Daniel Abraham (Book 1 is "A Shadow in Summer") is excellent. It's well written with believable (imperfect) characters who act in line with what they believe instead of what the author forces them to do.

It's a well-developed fantasy world that's undergoing some very major changes throughout the series. It mostly follows the same ~6 characters throughout, with about a ten-year timeskip between books (for a total of 30 years across the series).

*** If only LotM had an even better translator it would've been a great work worthy of adaptation to other mediums, I think.

Don't get me wrong, the translation is still far better than MTL or an amateur blogger working in his free time, and the best thing about the translations is the sheer speed and consistency of updates by the sole translator (20 chapters a week, 2000 words per chapter, minimal padding). I just wish there was a professional editor that went over the translations to correct all the issues that bugged me as I read.

*Edit:* Read your review, can't disagree with it on most points. From sharing the story IRL with other book buddies, most people only got fully hooked after finishing Vol 1, Vol 2's pacing dragged a bit too long during the middle, some less attentive readers didn't like the information overload from earlier chapters but acknowledged they were necessary for the payoffs hundreds of chapters later. Most agreed the fights are short as they should and brilliant, even if the author cheats a little with 'Unspoken Plan Guarantees' to give Klein a better chance (which also has in-story justification). He's a paranoid one, our MC.

I do think the main group of characters are more interesting than you give credit for, though. I never find myself bored wondering when the viewpoint would be switched back to Klein's. The focus on the value of money early on is because Klein is a penny pinching miser who constantly spends himself into poverty for reasons, which is often humorously contrasted with the near-infinite wealth of another character in the next paragraph.

Klein's character development is rather minimal as you said, more like someone near the end of their character growth arc and given opportunities again and again to show what sort of person he really is. He doesn't change much since Vol 1, but the repeated situations he keeps finding himself in fleshes him out realistically as more than just some reader self-insert.

And yes, strongly agree that the most satisfactory part of LotM is how it all fits neatly together at each climax and the excellent use of foreshadowing.

The books that feel most similar to the Vorkosigan series (which is one of my favourites) to me are mostly in the genre of urban fantasy - The Dresden Files, by Jim Butcher, October Daye, by Seanan McGuire, The Rook, by Daniel O'Malley, or Alex Verus, by Benedict Jacka.

- Short videos with decent density of information. I don't want to watch a vlog, I want to spend less than 20 minutes a day knowing whether the US is going to go to war with Iran this week.

It's an MLP fanfic, though IIRC nothing in the story actually depended on the MLP universe (I followed it without knowing anything about the setting). There's a temple on the edge of the desert with some writing on the walls from 50,000 years ago and some people in the area who remember old legends not to go near the place. The rest of the plot as I remember it (major spoilers) is that they break into the temple and go exploring while they wait for an expert in ancient languages to fly over, but when the expert arrives they translate the message as saying that there's a sealed horror at the end of the tunnel that should never be breached, and to leave this message in the reader's language to warn the the next civilization. The people who have explored are finding themselves deathly ill at this point. I think it was implied but not stated to be radiation in there? It had to be left alone for a million years, or something.

I read up to the end of the Golden Age arc. The only good thing the manga has going for it are the relationship between Guts and Griffith which I admit is pretty good. But the rest of the story is just feels like a typical manga with just a lot more gore and sex. Nothing else impressed me: the worldbuilding is standard pseudomedieval, the romance weak, the fights are mediocre with just Guts slicing everyone with ease (granted on that last one I went into after reading much more clever fight scenes from Sanderson which might have made me biased).

In particular, I can't fathom why people praise it for the art: while it does quite a few detailed scenes it's not much more so than most other popular series and IMO the characters look meh because the artstyle is obsolete 80s style. And the arc ends with a literal Deus Ex Machina with Guts being saved by Skull Knight. Maybe subsequent arcs fix those things but I googled 'best Berserk arcs' and most people seemed to think the Golden Age arc is the best so I decided to cut my loses right then and there.

Thanks for the recs though!

***** Ah I see. If you didn't like it by the end of the Golden Age arc you probably won't like the rest of it. I guess the reason many people, me included, really liked it was because the end of the golden age arc is such a drastic change for all the characters. Besides a lot of people compared it to the Red Wedding scene from GoT, which I can't disagree with.

As for the art, honestly I have to disagree. I think the style is perfect for the tone it wants to convey, and the amount of detail for even the minor stuff is what carries it forward. While other manga would reserve a lot of detail for the two-page spreads Berserk does that for almost each page, which is why chapters take a long time. You'll see what I mean if you just browse through the latest chapters, and Miura has been doing that for at least 150 chapters.

Basic premise is taking the traditional sport manga and flipping the personalities of the protagonist and antagonist. The main character is unlikable, skilled without working for it, and enjoys making other people suffer, while the antagonist is the wide eyed, happy-go-lucky, "practice and friendship is the most important thing", hero you normally see.

I know this sounds incredibly edgy and irrational, but it really isn't. The main character grows a lot, and you start sympathizing with her as you learn more of her past. The author is well aware of all the tropes and pitfalls, and never tries to make her indifference or abrasiveness good traits like normally happens with edgy protagonists.

Give it a shot. The first chapter is enough to decide if you like it or not.
