I ended up listening to an audiobook my brother had because of his MBA. Apparently instead of textbooks, they get rationalist fiction.

Alex Rogo is a manager at a production plant. They recently started buying industrial robots to automate stuff and improve performance, and things have been going great ... on paper. Alex is surprised to find out that the plant is losing money, and if he doesn't turn things around quickly, it will be shut down.
