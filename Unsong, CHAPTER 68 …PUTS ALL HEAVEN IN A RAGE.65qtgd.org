** I wonder what Robin sold her soul for. She might say "nothing in particular," but the fact that we /don't know what it was/ makes me think it will be at least a little bit relevant during one of the final chapters.

*** So she wound up in Hell, giving birth to Malia Ngo. The fact that Ngo was where she was allowed Ana to power the Black Sail, which allowed her to catch Leviathan. This /might/, if our speculation is correct, allow her to learn the Explicit Name from the Captain, assuming he is Metatron.

At that point, three people will know the Explicit Name due to SCABMOM. How one of them might manage to get into Hell is another question entirely.

*** Not only do we have "nothing in particular" in reference to a binding deal made at great cost, we also have a "promise me" in reference to an unspoken oath.

Placebomancy demands these be important.

I'm trying to tie the deal to an existing character's story, but I can't think what it would be.

***** I thought so initially, but the conversation as laid out would be a little confusing:

#+begin_quote
  For an hour and forty minutes, they lay there on the bed. They held each other. They talked about Nathanda, and Caelius, and Jinxiang, and Sohu. They talked about the time they met, in the dining room of the palace, and how confused Father Ellis had been when Jalaketu asked him to officiate their wedding.

  Finally, Robin said: “Promise me.”

  And Jalaketu said: “I promise.”
#+end_quote

Also, I don't think she really needs to extract that promise from him. The point of her going to hell is that it will be sufficient motivation on its own. If she expected him to give up it would be a pretty poor plan that wouldn't be significantly improved by the promise.

****** I'm not following. Whatever Robin traded for was /her idea/. So anything that Thamiel suggested, such as forcing her to have sex with him, couldn't have been what she traded for. Robin didn't go into it planning to create Malia Ngo because she wasn't planning for Thamiel's addition to his end of the deal.

Bow = front of ship (which breaks the rhyme, but whatever), therefore the "harpoon" that /Not a Metaphor/ shot out is "the bitter groan of the Martyr's woe" and the ship itself is (or is owned by) God?
