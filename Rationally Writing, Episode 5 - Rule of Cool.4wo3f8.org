** In my opinion it's not necessary to have a rational premise, just to rationally explore all the implications of the premise.

In HPMOR magic doesn't make sense, in The Metropolitan Man or Worm superpowers don't make sense, in Frozen creating a sentient snowman doesn't make sense. To me lightsabers are the same sort of thing, there's no need for them to have a scientific explanation.

When you come up with a story, I think you can say that some things just are, even if they are ridiculous. Then you just gotta explore everything that happens from that point on.

I kinda think that this is the whole point of scifi, rational or not. To ask a cool "What if?" question("What if we could travel faster than light?", "What if we could have lightsabers?"), and then figure out how the world would look like.

The perfect example of this is [[http://what-if.xkcd.com][What if?]] by xkcd. He starts with something absolutely silly([[http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][throwing a baseball at 90% of the speed of light]], [[http://what-if.xkcd.com/4/][a planet made out of moles]], etc), and from there rationality and science take over.

*** That was covered in the podcast. Even if it's implausible, you can make it rational by elaborating on the idea.

So for example in The Metropolitan Man (written by one of the hosts of this podcast), Superman is a fundamentally impossible entity. However, assuming that he /is/ possible, what would you expect the world to look like?

Well, for starters people would freak the hell out about privacy. Superman can literally see through every material except lead; it's an order of magnitude more personal than government spying, both because it's physical (seeing you rather than data you leave behind) and because it's one person.

So in the story, people start lining their houses with lead, encouraged by Lex Luthor. This greatly diminishes the value of the ability, because lead linings no longer map one-to-one with criminal activity. This in an instance of both the public and Luthor reacting rationally.

By contrast in the canon settings everyone is more or less okay with an invulnerable demigod watching them so thoroughly that he can spot crimes before they happen. People don't react to the information the stories introduce, because the writers thought only as far as "Wouldn't it be cool if..." (and, to be fair to them, the majority of their readers don't care anyway and in fact prefer the "cool" factor).

** I don't think something like artificial gravity in spaceships is rule of cool at all. It's not there to be cool. In fact, it's not even there to be noticed--it's there to be ignored. /Lack of/ artificial gravity, even though more realistic, would be noticed.

The episode even mentions scene-setting, which artificial gravity is closer to.

*** Yeah, the point of bringing it up was that it's a setting conceit that's meant to make the world cooler, meant to be accepted and not thought about, as you say. Kind of like sound in space battles, but a bit more acceptable since it can be handwaved as "magic tech" rather than simply changing how reality works.

To look at an example, a lot of tension and action is communicated in Star Trek by people running through hallways, or falling over as the bridge rocks from explosions. People slowly navigating their way through a spaceship by kicking off things and delicately adjusting themselves into chairs isn't nearly as visually engaging in most circumstances.

Of course, part of this is just the result of realistic budget constraints when filming. But a lot of subtle "coolness" in spaceship stories comes from being able to ignore the lack of gravity in ships.
