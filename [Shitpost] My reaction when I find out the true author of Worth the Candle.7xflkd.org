** In hindsight it was pretty obvious. Still, finding out that [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] was secretly [[#s][]] was the highlight of my day.

*** I dunno. I don't think it was that obvious. There are some similarities in writing style, but there were differences as well. It does well explain why [[/u/alexanderwales]] was so slow with the writing lately, though. lol

**** There's one thing that really ought to have tipped me off, but didn't: in that "Piss off [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in one sentence" thread, he says,

#+begin_quote
  "You can suspend your disbelief about dragons but not inconsistent travel times?"
#+end_quote

And this reminded me of a post I'd seen by Wales where he discussed that being a pet peeve of his at great length. So I thought to myself,

#+begin_quote
  Oh, what a coincidence, cthulhuraejepsen and alexanderwales have the exact same complaint. But maybe it's not a coincidence. Aha! Clearly, the former is making a reference to the post made by the latter, and everyone else has noticed this clever in-joke and upvoted accordingly.
#+end_quote

Whereupon I dismissed the matter and never thought about it again, until the reveal in the most recent chapter thread.
