** I've been following this story for the past few chapters and the writing is pretty polished. The world building lore is slowly doled out and it doesn't take long for the main conflict to be identified. The protagonist's power is pretty strong, but based on the events that happened in universe, he's not exactly overpowered. To me, it looks like a rational reaction to the way society would develop if people did develop powers. Chaotic with some form of government backed by people with powers.

** Was Inheritors restarted multiple times? Or else, what used to be behind things like "4.15.4", "4.14.10", "!.!.!", "?.?.?" and "EPISODE FIFTY-SIX"?

*** No, but I did a rewrite of just the first arc of the original series, and when I did, I changed the numbering scheme from “episode XX” to “1.2.3”

**** I'm talking about [[https://www.reddit.com/domain/inheritorsserial.com/][this]]. It seems like you posted a tonne of links for a tonne of chapters, some of them sharing the chapter number, but all the links go to an "oops" page as if the content was deleted.

***** Right, but this is the only reboot. The different chapter “names” was because I decided to change the numbering scheme. That all belongs to the old version of the serial. Which I do need to scrub haha

****** So 4.13.1 was after FIFTY-SIX in the pre-reboot original?

******* Yes, I think FIFTY-SIX was the last episode of Volume 3. I issued a rewrite of Volume 1 and changed the numbering scheme before starting volume 4, which is when 4.13.1 began
