  Only humans can think in three levels of recursion, and all other magical races stop at 2.
#+end_quote

---Eliezer Yudkowsky

Okay, I think I get what this /is/. You can think about a car, and then think about how you thought about that car, and then think about how you thought about thinking about that car. But what actual implications would this have, aside from the obvious? This just seems really abstract, like something a competent programmer could use is some very specific function, but which is otherwise practically useless for everything except philosophy.


** Forget about thinking about what /you/ think. If you can't think about what /other people/ think you think, then you can't be a very good liar. You can tell lies - try to get other people to think certain things - but you can't think about your lies, and adapt them based on what you think other people think. This will cripple your ability to engage in deception.

But I think you're still one level down from what Mr. Yudkowsky meant. Thinking about cars is level zero, the object level. Thinking about how you thought about the car is recursing once, and thinking about that is recursing twice. So magical races actually can think about their lies, but only humans can go further. This means that while magical races can believably lie, only humans can believably lie about lying. Magical races can use spies and informants, but only humans can use double agents. Only humans can even think about the concept of double agents, without going cross-eyed and needing to work it out on paper.

Also, only humans can realize that someone is trying to make them think that they are lying. Say, Alice saw a red car, but wants Bob to think that the car is blue. Any magical race can say "The car is blue," and fill in details of the story, adjusting to the picture Bob has (2) of the picture Alice is trying to make for him (1) of the car (0). But if Alice is human, then she can avoid eye contact and fidget uncomfortably and mumble, "The car is bl- I mean, /red/." Bob instantly thinks: Alice wants (2) Bob to think (1) that the car is red (0). She is lying badly, and the car is probably actually blue. Bob congratulates himself on piercing the deception. Alice wins, because humans can pretend to pretend.

**** I can do it in my short term memory without needing paper because I'm human. An elf would need paper to work through it, once they realized that there was more to the problem in the first place. And the elf /could/ work through it, it just wouldn't be intuitive. As opposed to a human Bob, whose literal first instinct would be "Either the car is blue, or Alice wants me to think the car is blue." If Alice is a known competent liar, then it might not even occur to human-Bob that Alice might be having an off day - the car is definitely not blue.

Humans can't actually get much deeper than that in practice, on an intuitive level. We tend to immediately get stuck in a loop of, "But what if that's what she wanted me to think she thought I thought she thought? Damnit, get me some paper." At some point in recursion/iteration (you're right, there is no computational difference in this context), every higher level of abstraction is indistinguishable to you. It's entirely possible for different people/races to hit that point at different levels. That fact can have interesting worldbuilding implications.

Not every elf will notice that the problem even requires further thought. Not every elf will care to give the problem more thought even if they recognize that the human is being all /human/ about it, and would prefer to just ignore all information from humans. Not every elf will have the Nobel Prize winning insight to be able to work through the bizarre twisty nature of human minds even if they wanted to. Some will. It is very unlikely that this is a hard limit. But the difference can have interesting implications for interactions between random people on the street.

***** It's not that we /can't/ go deeper intuitively, it's that it's impractical to go any deeper than a really good lie unless you can model the other person very well, since it's so easy to backfire. Simplest solution and all that. You're more likely to succeed with a good lie than with trying to convince someone you were trying to lie to them recursively.

We usually figure out lies through body language and context, if you can control those well enough to lie there's no reason to go any deeper.

Say Alice is a good liar, Bob knows this. Alice seems to fumble in the lie, Bob knows she wouldn't do that. So the fumble must be intentional. Alice knows Bob knows she's a good liar, so he knows she wouldn't fumble except on purpose, so it can't be the obvious (that the car really is red and she's trying to convince him it's blue) since she knows he'd see through that. At this point you enter a bunch of recursions where Bob is wondering how well she predicted how he interpreted what she did, and then decides to go one level above it...unless she predicted /that/. Alice can't reasonably predict how Bob will think about this, so you basically just have it down to random chance.

By fumbling the lie intentionally, Alice gave away that she was trying to lie about something. She would have better odds of succeeding by just lying since Bob wouldn't have suspected anything.

My point, which I'm trying to close in on, is that the HPMoR world seems to be one where the Strong C-T hypothesis holds, so it's not actually consistent with the way that world works.

If you want to read some rational stories set in a world where the strong C-T hypothesis is REALLY taken seriously, I suggest /Permutation City/, /Diaspora/, and /Schild's Ladder/ by Greg Egan.

Permutation City was about his first book, so the climactic arc is kind of forced and kind of breaks consistency, but the Copy society and Solipsist Nation are fascinating. Diaspora and Schild's Ladder are totally solid (and the latter has some existential fridge horror that's worth the trip).

But assuming the counterfactual, that's easy: "If you don't pass this course you can not work in any human-facing position in Gringotts."

OK, that's basically a fantasy application of "humans are special" (TVtropes link left out). There's no end of stories about the elves being incapable of lying or bound by their word or otherwise having artistically interesting cognitive defects, and humans taking advantage of that to win over them.

Personally I would have picked [[https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Consciousness-Breakdown-Bicameral-Mind/dp/0618057072][bicameralism]] as the defunct cognitive model. Bicameral elves would be REALLY interesting.

So I've pretty much covered the skill it would teach them, to keep track of previous statements and see if they are inconsistent... for extended discussions, or where you find an inconsistency, you'd have some kind of signal for a clerk to patch in and keep track of what you're hearing and make notes and prompt you to ask leading questions though a magical earphone...

In practice, given a group of people X, you can find concepts that these people have an easier time understanding, because most people in group X already have experience dealing with similar concepts or have thinking patterns that adapt well to them. These concepts could reasonably be designated as "intuitive" or "intuitive to group X".

In the context of this thread, Anakiri is saying that humans would have an advantage over elves, because they'd be able to create and spot complex multi-layered lies "intuitively" (as in, in the case of most humans, without needing to spend a lot of time/effort learning it), whereas elves would need to spend much more time training to keep up with human deceptions, and only long-trained elves could do it without a mental effort (the same way skilled mathematicians start internalizing complex math concepts on a gut level after a while).

As an aside, I really don't like the "Nothing but the nipple" quote (especially when discussing UI) because it erases a lot of that nuance. In practice, people aren't Turing machines, and they deal with some concepts better than others. Saying "but /really/, nothing is /actually/ intuitive because everyone learns at some point" is often pedantic, the same way epistemological nihilism (eg "your point about ethics is invalid because morality is subjective anyway") is often pedantic.

- (double-agent, 2) pretends to work for cause A, works for cause B;

- (triple-agent, 3) pretends to pretend to work for cause A, pretends to work for cause B, works for cause A;

- (quadruple-agent, 4) pretends to pretend to pretend to work for cause A, pretends to pretend to work for cause B, pretends to work for cause A, works for cause B.

Recursion here means the number of relations with a particular concept ("cause"). An agent has one relation [agent] → [cause]. A double-agent has two: [agent] → ← [cause], triple-agent has three: [agent] → ← → [cause], and so on. If you treat arrows as vectors and sum them, you would see that agents and triple-agents work for the cause, whereas a double-agent doesn't.

Another way of looking at it is, an intelligence agent is expected to model/predict the behaviour of the agency's enemies, which is already recursion 1. Double-agent thinks at recursion 2, and triple-agent thinks at recursion 3.

Humans aren't usually able to be quadruple-agents, which means non-humans wouldn't be able to be triple-agents, i. e. be fake defectors.

** This idea is inspired from a quote "in practice, infinite recursions are at most three levels deep."

The zero level is generic statements about the world around us such as 'the sky is blue' and 'Alice is a nice woman'.

The first level is any statement/reflections about yourself which includes statements like 'I (Bob) am a nice guy' or 'I (Bob) like Alice'. A common question of the first level is "What do I think of myself?" or "What do I think about other people?"

The second level is any statement about other people's conceptions about yourself or another person. For example, 'Alice thinks I'm not so nice' or 'Alice thinks Carl is nice'. A common question of the second level is "What does Alice think about me (Bob)?" or "What does Alice think about Carl?"

The third level is any statement/thought about another person's thoughts about what they think of someone else. For example, "Alice thinks Bob believes Carl is rude', 'Bob thinks Alice thinks he is attracted to her', and 'Carl thinks Bob thinks Carl wants to date Alice'. A common question of the third level is "What does Alice think I (Bob) think about Alice?"

The first level is a model of your own mind. The second level requires you to have a model of other people's minds to reason about how they think about you. The third level is required to have models of how other people are modeling your thoughts.

In this way, the magical races can reason about themselves and how other people think about the people around them. But without the third level, you can't know how other people think /you/ think. The third level is required to lie or bluff convincingly. Without it, you can't model how other people will react to your lies.

Recursion is taking a step back and calling a function within itself. So we take function thinking() and make it call function thinking() within itself, usually with something changed each iteration. An iteration is an important step in recursive functions, but while you need to iterate to recurse, iteration != recursion. Meanwhile, iterating function thinking() loops it continually. So you would be thinking about something, and then thinking about it again.

I have been a professional computer programmer for almost 40 years. I wrote my first compiler in 1979. I have implemented at least a dozen arithmetic expression parsers (an inherently recursive algorithm) in Fortran (a language that doesn't support recursion). I know the difference between iteration and recursion. Given indexable storage they are Turing-equivalent operations.

Iteration and recursion are both tools that can be used to implement a recursive algorithm. Therefore iteration with a simulated stack is equivalent to recursion. This is basic computational theory. This is literally what "Turing equivalence" means.

But this is false, yes? Iteration is a necessary part of a working recursive algorithm, and recursion is a word that encompasses everything a recursive algorithm is. They are not at all the same, as you can, for example, iterate through a list without recursing.

It's perfectly conventional computing theory. This kind of equivalence is actually kind of central to the whole structure of computing. No processor in the world implements "recursion" as a basic operation, they all put it together from iteration and bookkeeping.

The point is that this oddly specific deficit is probably computationally impossible, and violates the Strong Church-Turing Hypothesis. Which I'm pretty sure EY didn't intend. It was a throwaway line that sounds good, but it's not essential, and can be treated as a minor oops.

#+begin_quote
  I believe that humans have already crossed a threshold that, in a certain sense, puts us on an equal footing with any other being who has mastered abstract reasoning. There's a notion in computing science of “Turing completeness”, which says that once a computer can perform a set of quite basic operations, it can be programmed to do absolutely any calculation that any other computer can do. Other computers might be faster, or have more memory, or have multiple processors running at the same time, but my 1988 Amiga 500 really could be programmed to do anything my 2008 iMac can do --- apart from responding to external events in real time --- if only I had the patience to sit and swap floppy disks all day long. I suspect that something broadly similar applies to minds and the class of things they can understand: other beings might think faster than us, or have easy access to a greater store of facts, but underlying both mental processes will be the same basic set of general-purpose tools. So if we ever did encounter those billion-year-old aliens, I'm sure they'd have plenty to tell us that we didn't yet know --- but given enough patience, and a very large notebook, I believe we'd still be able to come to grips with whatever they had to say.

Recursion is mostly different from iteration because it has an implicit stack however a recursive algorithm can always be represented as an iterative program with an explicit stack. Likewise any iterative algorithm can always have its sequence of repetitions represented as a stack and made into a recursive program.

If the people can't handle nested loops then they wouldn't be able to function because most actions like walking and eating are made up of actions which are made up of sub actions which are themselves made up of smaller sub actions.

  Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where *a function being defined is applied within its own definition.* While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

************************************ I feel like you are failing to grasp mine. The brain itself doesn't directly implement recursion. It uses a stochastic neural network which when given proper input can emulate recursion but isn't actually a recursive system. If elves can't directly recursion then they can model it fairly easily using iteration. This is actually what humans generally do. If they can't model procedures that could be implemented recursively then they can't model anything because you can implement any loop as nested recursion.

The basic way recursive functions are actually solved by humans and computers is iterative (though humans and compiler optimisations may actually skip the process in some process by using mathematical reasoning the answer must be a certain value) using a stack as I posted earlier.

E.g Let's say have the definition

#+begin_example
  EvenOrOdd(n):

      if n == 1: return odd


      if n == 2:  return even

      if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {
           return even
      else
           return odd
#+end_example

And you are calculating EvenOrOdd(5) using the above algorithm (without skipping).

Your stack at start would be something like [

EvenOrOdd(5) At (START)

]

Then you would get to part with if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd and that would go on the stack

[

EvenOrOdd(4) At (START)

EvenOrOdd(5) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

]

Again

[

EvenOrOdd(3) At (START)

EvenOrOdd(4) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

EvenOrOdd(5) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

]

Again except this time it is different

[ EvenOrOdd(2) At (if n == 2: return even)

EvenOrOdd(3) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

EvenOrOdd(4) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

EvenOrOdd(5) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

]

There is a return value so

[

even

EvenOrOdd(3) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

EvenOrOdd(4) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

EvenOrOdd(5) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

]

The value of the function is sent back to the function that called it. That in turn calculates its new value

[

odd

EvenOrOdd(4) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

EvenOrOdd(5) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

]

again

[

even

EvenOrOdd(5) At ( if EvenOrOdd(n−1) is odd {)

]

[

odd

]

Your answer is odd

** This topic is a black hole of contemplation. It's far too easy to just sit down and try to puzzle it out. It's fun thought, and potentially useful (for psychology especially).

Let's assume the function that's recusing is (person) thinking.

1: Me Thinking (Joe thinking) => I know how Joe thinks. I can predict his behaviors, generally.\\
Animals have it- wolves that know how to herd their prey away from the herd, cause they know how their prey will react.\\
Also metacognition (not for animals though, unless really basic)- I know I'll normally run away in panic after seeing hungry wolves, and that's bad (because an elf can protect me, but only if I am close to him). So I do things (breathing exercises?) to stop myself from panicking.

2: Me Thinking(Joe thinking(me thinking)) => I know what Joe thinks about my behavior. I know what Joe's model of me. An Elf (Joe) may lure a pack of wolves into thinking he's defenseless, because he can fake vulnerable behavior.

3: Me thinking (Joe thinking(me thinking(me thinking)) - I know how Joe models my meta-cognition.\\
Joe thinks I am aware of my panic attacks, but not of me getting distracted by background chatter.\\
So he tries to make me bet on finishing writing a letter before it gets completely dark, while purposefully saying random stuff. Except I know what he's trying to do, and got earplugs prepared before hand. Bet won, humanity wins!

Thanks to being a level higher on recursion, I was able to out-intrigue a magical person.\\
Could Joe use pen and paper to think about this possibility? Sure. But he may not see the need (why bother?), not have the energy (it's like doing /calculus/), or not have pen or paper at hand.\\
Or, you know, he didn't attend Advanced Social Dynamics class at his school. Or he didn't deal with humans nearly enough to pick up on their advantage and counter it.\\
What I am trying to say is: a non-intuitive skill is harder to acquire and use properly; recursion is great for mind-games, and humans are naturally better than elves at it.

There's also the implication that magical races may have other mental handicaps compared to us. As far as I know, there isn't a piece of brain responsible solely for recursion. This limitation may be a result of smaller working memory or worse imagination or something.
