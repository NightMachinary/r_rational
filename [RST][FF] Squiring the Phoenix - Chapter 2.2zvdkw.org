** Seems like they rebuilt Hogwarts pretty fast. Did you forget it was nuked in Following the Phoenix? Ignotus did talk about rebuilding it, but it's been less than 6 months since it was destroyed.

*** Ermmm...no. There's absolutely zero chance that I would forget something that significant. /cough/. Um...look! Shiny object!

Yes, Ignotus gave them the spells and then Dumbledore and a whole bunch of other very powerful wizards did the swishy-flicky thing and boom! Rebuilt school. That's my story (literally!) and I'm sticking to it.

Although, in fairness, once you have the spells it shouldn't be time consuming. IIRC, the founders raised Hogwarts either overnight or over a weekend, I forget which. I refuse to believe that there are no other wizards in the world as powerful as Dumbledore, and there's plenty of money available to hire them -- I guarantee the Ministry would shell out, and plenty of noble families would as well.

Fair enough. So why hasn't anyone opened a /Yogworts/ just across the street? You know, the knockoff, state funded, Korean-run franchise magical educational center, with half-priced admission and 100% fewer Death Eaters on the board of directors (and enrolled)? Muggleborn and poor-as-dirt blood traitors would fucking flock to that obvious hole in the market.

Or consider the lack of a /Hogtown House Preparatory/, the centrally located UK school for Death Eater legacy applicants /only./

Bugs me seeing a world with magical infrastructure and only one of everything ever even mentioned -- and that the most boringly prosaic version possible. Must be the Ministry magical building codes or something...no wonder Arthur also gets around those, with his house being the only /other/ interesting bit of magical architecture in the entire country.

***** Seems like it might well happen now that the spells are known. Widely known, too, since it required about twenty wizards to match the power of the original Founders, and they came from all over the world.

None of which was canon, but now it is because I just said it.

Because they are /British/, and that means there are /ways things are done/, and they do them that way, and no way else. You are asking this because you think like an /American/ ;-).

** So Hogwarts, one of the most impressive magical constructs in Britain, was rebuilt after a few months even though the founders were supposedly more powerful than any wizard now living and it even includes the room of requirement which very few knew existed and as far as we know nobody knew how it worked.

Your son comes in with a magical firebird and your first reaction is to make a joke and calmly consider that it probably has something to do with the wizards? What happened to the mission that the phoenix is supposed to take you on when you first get it? And then your second question is what the boy named it? And then he finds out it's sentient and wants to uplift humanity and your though is something along the lines of "neat, I should help."? *Wait, what?!*

Why don't the researchers recognize Harry when they see him? This is the biggest historical event of these researchers lives, magic has been confirmed to be real and an entire shadow government has been discovered and not only was it close to declare war on Britain but nukes went of in Scotland! During the past few months this would be the only thing they talked about on all news channels, in all newspapers and all research communities and the face of Harry Potter would be on everything.

These things just took me completely out of the story as it doesn't make any sense unless the magical equivalents to the Hogwarts blueprints were somehow discovered, Nancy and Fred are hermits or work with government work that require them to lock themselves into a vault without outside contact and Joel's father is insane or confounded.

You really don't seem to get how being a post-doc works. Yes, academics live basically monastic lifestyles. Source: experience.

  Word of God says Felix Felicis doesn't exist in HPMoR. Is that an intentional change?
#+end_quote

I looked around to see if it was in or not, and the only thing that I found that seemed to speak to it was [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=722rasd1fu9p8mn5fdcbp572&page=158#3934][this post]] in which Eliezer said "If it exists". I checked in with hezzel to see if it was in FtP; she didn't have an opinion either way and didn't know any more about HPMOR canonicity than I did, so I decided it was a thing.

  Also, Harry appeared on Muggle television in Following the Phoenix as leading negotiations with the magical world. He would be instantly recognised by the researchers.

They're both American. Our reporting doesn't cover the rest of the world very well, and not all of us actually watch the news.

  As for felix felicis, he says it 'probably doesn't exist', and if it does he said it was badly crippled.

Oh well. Looks like the fan3fic differs from the fanfic. I was planning on nerfing it pretty hard anyway.
