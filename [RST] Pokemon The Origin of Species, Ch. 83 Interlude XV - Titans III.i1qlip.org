** Everyone in universe: Oh god our dangerous experiment has escaped and is putting the lives of everyone here in severe jeopardy, this is a disaster

Everyone reading: KICK THEIR ASS MEWTWO WOOO YOU GO TULPA-BRO

Otherwise, loved MG's section - presumably Red guiding her and Lizzy for a simultaneous light bomb and also Killing Intent'ing the Vulpix (current theory, ill admit its not clear) is some intense psychic upgrading also a bit of a moral event horizon there (a justified one, but still). I really enjoyed MG's...I will say autistic-coded thought processes as well? Fine if that's not what was intended, that sort of imagery-association patterning is just what resonated with me. Not everyone should have a "unique" approach but side characters just organically being themselves is one of the things this story consistently delivers well.

I do still though stand by my opinion of "some of the Hoenn content should have happened off screen", its a lot detail on characters and a world we don't know and, presumably, won't be very relevant going forward to the main cast. With Blue's team & Red's psychic crew the cast has already expanded a lot. I think the narrative could have benefited from the Hoenn story being told in broader strokes as I find it hard to be asked to care about MG *and* Steven anew in the same update. Time will tell though of course!

Mewtwo was scary when they became bitter after Giovanni dropped the ball and failed to retain their loyalty, and then became significantly more terrifying when their tulpas decided to make WinEverythingForever.exe on their own.

***** Yeah. They generally seem to be motivated by their very realistic fear of their captors. They still build connections and feel affection. But that doesnt overcome their desire for freedom.

They are scary to the guards because they are afraid of the unknown. And they dont know truly know their limits.

The guards are paranoid and project it onto Mewtwo. They keep secrets and fear M2 keeps secrets. They have to prepare for the eventuality where M2 is lying about M2's powers and it makes them suspicious.

It is the problem of rational cooperation when there is no trust. If you dont trust someone and they dont trust you, it is rational to prepare for betrayal, which makes it harder to establish trust. Even when your goals align you have to be worried about them having hidden motives.

Mewtwo has social interaction. If they arent worried about him flipping out or running they could be more homest and give him some outside time. He woulsmt feel the need to go away given the implications of his existence on the rest of the world.

The security measures make M2 doubt the sincerity of his creators. It makes him doubt their motives as well.

Mewtwo is intelligent, but is still technically a child. It isnt unreasonable to keep him there while they help him train his abilities. Especially if they explain the reason for it.

And that is assuming he wants to leave the lab if they build trust. He is worried they are developing him as a weapon or something and may never give him freedom.

#+end_quote

Depending on how they are treated, they absolutely can be. It is reasonable to limit young children's choices to keep them safe from harm and appropriately fed and sheltered, until they are old enough to properly make their own choices. But if parents are raising children as sweat-shop labourers, or soldiers, then that certainly can be slavery.

Note that although Mewtwo had suspected for some time (quite correctly) that he was being molded into a weapon, his actual escape was immediately preceded by a guard making it quite clear and explicit: they had plans for what he would become, and those plans would involve him taking risks. And Mewtwo was not so hopelessly naive as to think that in the event that he failed or refused to live up to their expectations, they would simply write off the loss of their investment and let him wander off.

As I stated above, the only way real trust would be possible would be if Mewtwo were free - barring technical limitations - to walk away without retaliation. Or at least have a fixed point in the future where that would be possible, as humans have an age of adulthood, without placing any requirement on Mewtwo to earn such freedom. Nothing less than that could be enough; it is wrongful imprisonment at best.

And it /had/ to be sneaky. The slightest overt indication of a desire to leave and they would have pulled the trigger.

If a human were raised from birth with an explosive collar around their neck, by people ready and willing to detonate it if s/he expressed any desire to be free, and s/he was expected to spend a lifetime in deadly combat at their direction, but then circumstances conspired to give the captive a way out, would you really side with the collar-owners?

Right, but that's the viewpoint of "the bad guys" in whose eyes M2 is an /experiment/, and I suspect it was put there on purpose to be depersonifying, to make the reader feel how little they think of his personhood/rights.

The "personal pronoun"/"it" distinction is a person/non-person distinction (regarding mind (or similarity to human psychology)), not a human/non-human distinction (regarding biology).

When applied to humans, sure. But having a fully sapient non-human being is new ground. If Mewtwo expresses a preference, I'll use it; until then, applying typical gender pronouns seems premature.

("They" would actually be a reasonable choice, not because it should be used as a gender-neutral singular - it's plural, and using it as a singular is a not-really-correct workaround because of the implications of "it" - but because Mewtwo has something like a group mind. Until Mewtwo makes a statement, though, "it" is the only pronoun I've seen used thus far, so I'm just going to be consistent.)

*** I don't know how frustrated she'd be. As far as Mewtwo could tell, she did care about it. She was concerned about its ability to lie, yes, and wanted to work out what its real motivations were; that's just sensible. But to someone genuinely concerned about Mewtwo's wellbeing, not just its utility, a mostly non-violent escape is not such a terrible way of finding out what it wanted.

If it had gone on a killing spree, then yes, I expect she'd feel saddened that she didn't solve the problem in time. As it stands, though - what could she have done if she'd learned what it was really thinking? It just would have meant that she became aware that their captive was not actually happy in its gilded cage. Giving her the choice between knowingly oppressing a sapient being, or killing it. I know that canon Sabrina was a sociopath, but this one doesn't seem to be, so I don't think she would have liked that much.

So did our MC just kill a man? Red is amassing a pretty impressive “moral crises” collection. Or more accurately “horrific trauma” collection.

I'm very curious towards where Red was that he couldn't help MG and Lizzy himself. Maybe he just wanted to get some pokemon over there ASAP so he could kill the renegades himself (either to protect the others from having to do it or just to get the danger out of the way)? If so, that is one hell of a cold calculation, and I doubt he's ever gonna confess to anyone (unless a situation I joked about above actually happens).

** Worm Spoiler Meme: Mewtwo let his hand drop to his side.

He turned the sounds around in his head, trying to convince himself of a different configuration, convince himself he had heard wrong.

But he hadn't. It dawned on Mewtwo. He has Victini's power.

How many years did it cost Rayquaza to use it?

Not enough, he was convinced. Rayquaza had defeated him.

Rayquaza's head erupted in flame, and Mewtwo didn't move. Darkrai was fleeing.

Rayquaza fired the lethal blast.

I loved this chapter. A lot of paranoia, but also clearly not enough paranoia. Mewtwo just climbed off the apex of the ladder of paranoia into freedom while Shaw prided himself for standing on the fourth rung. MG somehow doesn't know that Red is psychic yet, I thought the fact that he left to train with Sabrina would have given it away. Steven watches Rayquaza yeet Groudon with Dragon Ascent and decides he's had enough of it, Wallace is the champion now. Rip Sweets, Poliwhirl, Venusaur, and Jigglypuff. Many good boys were lost this day.

As cool as it would be to read Mewtwo's escape sequence, I'm really itching to get back in one of the main trio's heads after three consecutive interludes.

I felt that this chapter was a nice conclusion to the 3 part Hoenn saga. After thinking that the Hoenn protagonists would remain silent throughout their appearances, it was nice to see them discuss strategies with the champions. Now that megas are officially a thing in this world, it'll be interesting to see if they have any future storyline related to them.

MG's part of the story was a great thriller section, especially since we already knew about the Renegade killing people inside. Loved the Galar reference with " By Calyrex's bobbly crown,.."

But Sakki subverts that expectation; Red can insta-decondition the Pokemon. I'm sure it thoroughly breaks whatever the standard legal framework is. It's also unclear that this instance would count as intentional murder on Red's part (isn't he just "letting the Pokemon do what comes natural?") although it certainly seems like an intent to harm, which again is justified in this case.

That's what I think too. Red is in no danger of being branded, there's almost no evidence pointing to him.

But if I understand what “being a renegade” means correctly, he is one? When Blue was defending against Yuuta, he was sweating thinking about how even his actions were too close to being a renegade, and he was 100% on the defense.

Blue was arguably going on less self-defense info when he worried about being branded a renegade. A graveler exploded near him, Leaf said "surely there's a reasonable explanation", and then Yuuta tried to peace out with his Abra and Blue had Maturin fire on the Abra Yuuta was touching relatively preemptively. Yuuta only gave the slash command afterward. Of course, Blue was right, but it was pretty reckless based on a feeling, and if he were wrong and Maturin hit an innocent Yuuta, it'd have been bad. I think Blue was mostly worried he could be wrong.

Red was broadcasting MURDER at MG, so he's presumably been psychically monitoring this guy wandering the building executing defenseless disaster victims. So I'd say this is way more justified self-defense based on the information.
