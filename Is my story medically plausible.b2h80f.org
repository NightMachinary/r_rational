** If you did not have H2O in your system, you would be a rather small pile of dust. Unfortunately your premise is impossible.

There does exist a condition where the skin itself has an allergic reaction to water (but not the rest of the body). So with some modifications and mumbo-jumbo about a more severe case occurring for your character, you could work with the concept.

****** The soft tissues of her throat react, the rest of her body still has H2O in it and still finds it necessary for life....so like I said, if you modify your approach slightly, its still viable, but having zero H2O molecules in your body is not.

Look, you asked for our opinions and I gave you mine. If you dont like it, feel free to ignore it.
