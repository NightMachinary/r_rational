** I just bought the first book yesterday on a whim after reading raving reviews about it. Is it as good as they're making out to be?

*** Yes, in my opinion. I'm rereading it right now, after having bought the second, getting part way through, and realizing that you kind of need a good feel for all the moving parts as introduced in Book 1.

**** Do you know if this is supposed to be a trilogy? Are the books enjoyable on their own in terms of resolution or is the plot left hanging between one and the other?

***** Baru 1 is quite enjoyable even on its own. It's meant to be a trilogy I think, and Baru 2 and 3 sort of lean on each other, from what Seth has talked about.

Definitely pays to start with Baru 1!

*** I definitely saw it live up as a subversive, thrilling, tightly written book that packs a solid ending.

** What is up with all the spelling and grammar mistakes?? It kinda looks intentional, but I don't know why they would put them in.

*** #+begin_quote
  following the events of the first book, she is depressed, *drunk*, and deeply uncertain of her methods and purpose
#+end_quote

You can see how she gradually becomes more and more incoherent with each letter, until (presumably) falling asleep and re-writing the last one on a clear head the next day.
