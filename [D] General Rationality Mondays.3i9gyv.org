** Some useful rationality exercises I've used recently:

1. Avoiding impulse buys
2. Become calmer and less prone to reactions based on negative emotions.
3. Admit your own bias and steelman your opponent's arguments.
4. Use math, not emotional response, to determine if something is a good life choice.

For #1:

"If someone offered me $1 to /not/ buy this $1 Snickers bar, would I take it? Yes? Okay, I won't buy it." (NB: There are times that I find myself answering 'no', in which case I feel good about buying the thing.)

--------------

For #2:

Read / watch / listen / bring to mind the thing that makes you angry. Focus on your breathing and remember that you have feet.

Anger is a mental thing and it tends to draw your awareness up into your head and away from your body. It also makes you clench your muscles and makes your breathing shallower. Focus on relaxing, breathing deeply and slowly, and be aware of your feet.

--------------

For #3:

When someone is making a weak argument that you disagree with, try to strengthen their position. Look for stronger arguments than the ones they are making. Try to think how /you/ would argue for their position. Facing these better arguments will help you differentiate between a bad idea and a good-but-poorly-argued idea.

See below for an example.

--------------

Example of #4:

I had a wall'o'text here; let me boil it down:

My SO is a nurse (RN). She's been thinking about going back for her BSN in order to get the attached $1.75/hour raise. She's been really nervous and stressed about this whole process, so we sat down and crunched some numbers.

- The education would cost about $27,000. (90 credits at $300 each.) Her employer will pay half, so she's on the hook for ~$14k if she does this degree.
- 60 of those credits ($18,000 worth) are not relevant to the BSN -- either undergraduate nursing things she doesn't need because she's, you know, /a nurse/, or general liberal arts.
- While working a fulltime job she feels she could take 12-15 credits per year (6-8 credits/semester), so it would take her about 8 years to graduate.
- Once she had the degree it would take about 5 years to pay for itself.
- Each week of each semester she would need to do 12-16 hours of work outside of class -- 2-3 hours of outside work per credit hour. There would also be some in-class time, obviously
- She works 12 hour shifts, so this basically means she's doing the equivalent of /more than/ an extra shift each week.
- She gets paid overtime to do extra shifts.
- If she does the degree, then 8 years from now she'll be at -$14k.
- If she works one extra shift per month, then 8 years from now she'll be at +$38k.
- Over her expected career duration, she will end up well more than $100,000 ahead by doing the overtime instead of the degree.

I was very upfront about the fact that I thought she should just do the overtime, but because I was admitting bias I tried to steelman the advantages of the degree. What I came up with was: personal sense of accomplishment, good networking possibilities, potential reputational benefits among colleagues and the general field. Neither of us thought those were good enough reasons to spend $13k and work a part-time job for a decade, so she decided not to enroll.

Note: After the fact, she realized that the BSN is a requirement to get into a non-bedside (i.e., management) job. She doesn't want to be working the bedside when she's 60 -- nursing is hard, physical work, especially on an ICU -- but she also doesn't want to leave the bedside in the near future, as she likes the "3-4 long days per week" schedule over management's "5 short days per week."

*** That's a rather weak steelman for getting a degree.

Regular overtime in a high-stress job seems like a good recipe for overwork, which has all kinds of nasty effects up to and including death.

Overtime also has a high opportunity cost. You are comparing $400 from 8-12 hours overtime a month, to a raise of $300 a month. You're overlooking the 8-12 hours of not-work that are also on the table! She is currently selling her time for about $270/shift. If that's how much she values it, then the degree gets her $300 cash /plus/ $270 worth of time every month, compared to the overtime plan that only gets $400 cash. Equivalently, when comparing those two plans, she's only getting paid an extra $100 for the extra shift. Is she willing to be a nurse for minimum wage?

On a completely different note, we're going to have a new US President before she completes the degree. The four current front-runners known to be running for the Democratic candidacy (Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, and Jim Webb) have all made university tuition rates a part of their platform and claim to plan to reduce them. If you had to commit to one plan or the other right now, and you think there's a non-negligible chance of them achieving their stated goals, you should expect to pay less than the current $14k quote over the course of their presidency.

Very true. There's a few other factors though -- she's probably got 15-20 years left in her career, and getting the degree would mean she was taking a loss for about 13 of them.

As to overwork...she actually does less work if she does the overtime option. The degree requires 15-20 hours per week (12-16 hours of out-of-class work, plus several more hours in class means 15-20 hours all up.) That's 60-80 hours a month unpaid work for the next 8 years before she gets the raise. Alternatively, she can work one extra 12-hour shift per month and make more than she would have made from the raise. Even if she does one extra shift per month for the next 20 years she will end up doing less work than she would have done for the degree:

- Overtime: 12 months * 20 years = 240 months * 12 hours/ month = 2,880 hours
- Degree: 32 weeks/school year * 8 school years * 15 hours/week = 3,840 hours

Even if the degree were free, it would be hard to justify it purely for the money. The primary utility is as an entry requirement for management.

*** I'm not a financial planner. I'm an engineer and I spent some time thinking about how to spend as little time possible thinking about investing while still getting it done. Here's my knowledge, with no promises. Anyone who's in the business is probably better than I am. My steps to investment:

*0. Invest instead of not investing*

Even accounting for the crash today, I'm still up like 10% from two years ago in my stocks. If I waited a couple years to invest, I'd be 10% poorer. This is taking a low-risk "don't beat the market" strategy. Generally, the first step is deciding to do something, rather than nothing, with your cash.

Also, I am assuming you are in your 20s, in the United States, and gainfully employed, and have cash to spare, and will continue to make money at a rate that you can deposit into investments, and won't withdraw that money until you retire in your 60s.

*1. Setting up Accounts*

You should go to a bank and open two accounts for investment. I use Charles Schwab, which also does Checking. It's possible your bank already offers this service for you, you'll need to look into it.

One account is a Brokerage Account, which is a special kind of bank account designed to hold both cash and other things like stocks and bonds that you use for investments. The other is an Investment Retirement Account, which is like a Brokerage Account but is also tax-free and has a limit in how much you can put into it each year, and also you can't take the money out until you retire. There are two kinds of IRA. One, the Traditional IRA, lets you not count the money deposited in it towards your income this year, though you pay tax when you withdraw it in old age (when your rates are lower). So if you make 105k, and deposit 5k into your IRA, the government treats you as having earned only 100k that year. So you pay probably like 2k less in taxes. Instant 40% return! The other kind is ROTH IRA. You pay tax on money put into a ROTH IRA, but once you do that money doesn't exist as far as the government acts. They do not tax you on the gains made by investments in a ROTH IRA, and do not tax you when you withdraw money from it. Generally, if you make under 100k you go for a ROTH IRA, and if you make over 100k you go for a Traditional IRA for reasons to do with eligibility and your tax rate now relative to when you withdraw the money.

*2. Transfer Cash and make plans to deposit*

Move money into your brokerage account. Bear in mind that money in your brokerage account will not be accessible quickly because it won't be in cash form, so make sure to have plenty of money still in your checking account. Brokerage account is for storing money you won't touch until much later. You can still withdraw your money from this account, but you'll often have to sell things to do so, so plan not to use the money. Deposit money every 6 months. Every 3 months is better. Every month is best to average out market fluctuations. I save 15% of my income and put it into savings.

*3. Don't be a day trader. Also, avoid wacky things like individual stocks or mutual funds*

There are many tools for investment but typically, we'll talk about Bonds and Equities (Stocks). Bonds are very tiny loans or pieces of loans from big, safe organizations that bear interest and get repaid. Stocks/Equities are very tiny pieces of public companies that reflect the value or perceived value of those firms and pay dividends based on earnings. Equities are good for young people who can tolerate risk and want to grow their wealth. Bonds are good for people closer to retirement who want to focus on preserving their wealth as much as possible, even in bad conditions.

Investing in individual company stock is a Bad Idea because I Am Not A Financial Analyst. Trying to buy and sell stocks to "time" the market is a Bad Idea because I Am Not a Financial Analyst. Trying to do anything to beat the market overall is a Bad Idea, because I Am Not Smarter Than The Market. These statements might not hold for everyone, but the hold for most people and for me. I invest money, keep my portfolio balanced, and deposit money every year.

Instead of investing in stocks individually, I invest in Funds, which are collections of stocks. By investing in a Fund, I own a tiny piece of that fund which represents a portfolio of stocks. Let's talk about what stocks are in the fund and how it's managed. There are two major kinds, Mutual Funds (actively managed) and Index Funds/ETFs.

Mutual Funds are managed by experts who charge some proportion of your investment with them each year, and (often) try to beat the market. Some have other goals, like hedging against certain conditions or having a certain behavior. They cost money as a ratio of your investment. Theymight charge you a 1% ratio, which means they will take 1% of your investment with them each year as pay. Some of these funds attempt to do more than 1% better than the market. Many fail. Some succeed. I do not know how tell the good ones from the bad/lucky ones. I do not invest in Mutual Funds.

Index Funds (and the very similar Exchange Tradable Funds) track an index, a commodity, a type of investment, or a basket of assets. I use ETFs instead of Index funds due to structuring issues that allow me to get ones I want that behave in ways I want, but for many purposes, the important distinction is between Index/ETF and Mutual Funds, rather than Index Funds and ETFs. In any case, Index funds track something (like the market as a whole, or "big companies in USA") broadly and don't have big expense ratios. Good for tracking the market with low effort.

*4. Investing in ETFs and diversifying*

So since we're young and will be depositing money every year, we go for an aggressive equities-only portfolio. Since we're not financial experts, we do not invest in individual stocks, but use a fund. Since we're not able to determine which mutual funds can beat the market, we just match the market, not beat it. So we go for ETFs. Which ETFs, though? Well, to get the most out of our money and not expose ourselves to undue risk, we want to /diversify/, which means invest in a lot of different things. This can be done pretty easily.

For geographic diversity, I keep 35% of my money in overseas investments, and 65% in US investments. Most people like to keep more in the US. My US money is mixed between Large Cap (companies with a large market capitalization, or total value) and Small Cap (companies with small market capitalization, or total value) with some in Real Estate which acts unusually and is more like Small Cap than Large. My international money is in foreign markets (developed economies like the ones in Germany or England) and emerging markets (growing economies like in India or even a more developed area like Tunisia).

The specific breakdown I use is:

- SCHX (US Large Cap ETF): 35%
- SCHA (US Small CAP ETF): 20%
- SCHH (US REIT ETF): 10%
- SCHF (INTL Developed ETF): 25%
- SCHE (INTL Emerging ETF): 10%

Some research indicated dropping SCHH and SCHE and going 50/20/25/5 between SCHX/SCHA/SCHF/Cash is the best aggressive investment plan.

When I deposit money into my account, I purchase shares to bring my account back into line with these ratios. Also, each year I deposit into my IRA to pay less tax.

/Other than my 6-monthly deposit/rebalance, I do not touch my account./ This is very important. This kind of "leave everything in equities, deposit money to balance it fairly often" strategy is a good long term growth strategy, but it assumes that you know very little about investing/finance and don't plan on actively managing your account. If you want to do tricky things like buying and selling stuff based on like, watching the news or something, this is not the way to go. Your shares will go up, and then go down, and if you are the kind of person who wants to buy and sell things, a diversified portfolio like this will always have SOMETHING going down on a daily basis. Don't freak out. In the long run, the market grows. Recession years are good because your deposit goes further (since stocks are undervalued). Don't freak out and sell or buy more than you would according to the plan. That being said, if you know more than I do, disregard my advice. This is just me trying to figure out a simple way to invest that I don't screw up.

In any case, keep depositing money and balancing your portfolio.

*5. Financial Planners often don't know what they're doing*

Yeah, if you go a bank they'll have a guy there and for free he'll tell you to get into mutual funds. He'll believe himself when he says "that great fund with the 1% expense ratio will keep your money safe." The kind of person who becomes a Financial Planner is the kind of person who believes, at his core, that beating the market is possible, and beating the market by more than 1% reliably is a real thing. Of COURSE he believes that. Financial Planners are the mother of all selection bias. Listen to him when he tells you to open a brokerage account or whether an IRA or Roth IRA is better for you at your current income. Listen to him when he says it's important to invest. Listen to him when he tells you the legal limits of what you can and can't do. Otherwise, if you want good advice from someone in person, you probably need to pay for it.

And who knows? If you're smart and informed, surely it's possible. I'm not, though. I'm a guy who pays attention to his investments occasionally just to make sure nothing's wrong. I deposit my cash each year and trust that I can't really outperform the market. As I age, I will move to more fixed-income assets that are lower risk (like bonds) and then I will retire.

**** Just to add to that good advice, if you work for a company that offers matching as part of their benefits package, it's usually good to look into that, because it's quite often better than doing anything else. If you have a 50% match up to 3%, you're basically getting a 3% raise by investing 6% of your salary. Another way of thinking about it is that even if you're only holding steady on the market, you're still getting a 50% return on your investment because of the company match.

***** This is correct. I forgot about this, as my company does not offer a 401k.

*What is a 401k?*

A 401k is a tax-deferred account (like an IRA) that is offered through your employer to help you invest. Like an IRA, a 401k is a good investment vehicle for tax purposes, because deposits into it aren't taxed. This means it gives you an immediate return on any invested money equal to the amount of tax you would have paid. However, unlike an IRA, a 401k places some limits on which kinds of investments you're allowed to use. This varies from company to company.

*What is "Matching"?*

Most companies offer 401k with "matching" which is a good thing. If your company offers 401k with "matching", what this means is up to a certain limit, for each dollar you deposit into your 401k, your company will ALSO deposit a dollar into the account for you (or 50 cents for each dollar, in some cases). This limit is usually a percentage of your salary.

*Show me an example of why a 401k can be good*

So in a best-case scenario, let's say you make $105,000 and decide to put $5,000 into your 401k, and your company matches the first 5% of your gross income as deposit (so they will match up to $5,250 of your deposit). First off, you pay about $2,000 less in tax, and secondly, when you look in your account you'll see $10,000 instead of $5,000 because your company matches your input. In effect, your $5,000 deposit immediately turned into $12,000. This is really good.

*What are the weaknesses of a 401k?*

Now, some caveats.

- 401ks place restrictions on what you can invest in, and a lot of people sort of deposit into mutual funds and forget about it then pay a bunch in fees.
- your company's "matching" deposits vest over a period of time, which means that if you leave the company you don't get the matching stuff. This is a way for the company to encourage you to stay on and not change jobs.
- like an IRA, you can't really withdraw money from a 401k before you retire.

*How much should I put into my 401k?*

Overall, a good rule of thumb is "if you can afford it, invest into your 401k enough that you get as much matching money from your employer as possible. Put the rest of your investing deposit each year into your IRA and Brokerage account"

*What should I do with the money inside the 401k?*

The money inside your 401k should be treated like in your IRA or Brokerage account: invest it in low-cost index funds or ETFs that track overall market performance. Your options for what you're allowed to invest in will vary. If there are no options for low-cost index funds or ETFs, a "target date" fund might be an okay choice, but your main goal should be to find something that doesn't have a high expense ratio.

******** In the case of "exact same tax rate at either end" it's still better to defer. If you have to pay $2,000 in tax on a certain money, or instead you can pay the same amount in 40 years, in the meantime you could invest the saved $2,000, grow it massively, and come out ahead. This is assuming no changes in tax rate, and you're taxed the same on both ends. Any time you can borrow money with zero interest rate (and I guess you could think of this that way) is good.

In any case, as a general rule you make somewhat more money as someone during your career then when you're retired, and in the cases when you don't, you can use a ROTH 401k (the 401k version of ROTH IRA) which is good for people at the beginning of the careers earning very little.

This kind of tricky business is best not discussed in the "simplest investment" post above though, and is also a bit out of my league.

******** Because taxation piles on over the years, just like compound interest.

Scenario: 40% income tax, 20% capital gains tax.

Taxable account: You make $100. After income tax that's $60. Invest that at 10% a year, you're at $66, but those gains are taxed at 20%, so you actually end up at $64.8.

Tax deferred account: Make $100, pay no tax, grows at 10%, at the end of the year you're at $110. After you pay income tax at withdrawal, $66.

The difference seems small but, like compound interest, the tax drag becomes HUGE when it's taken in to account year after year. Extrapolate the above example over 10 years and the tax deferred account is at 155.62 while the taxable is at 129.54, a 16% difference.

******* A typical vesting schedule (And by that, I mean the minimum allowed by federal law.. so... typical) looks something like like:

<2 years: 0% vested 2 years: 20% vested 3 years: 40% vested 4 years: 60% vested 5 years: 100% vested

The percentage is how much of your company's contribution (Not your contribution, the part that they contribute through matching) you get to keep if you leave. So if you leave within 2 years you get none of their contribution, if you leave after 3 you get 20%.

So if you make 100,000/year and contributed 5%, and your company matched 5% at the end of the year you would have 10,000 (5000 of that being your company's contribution) in your 401k.

If you left you would only be able to keep the percentage you were vested in of their half of that.

If you don't already have an IRA setting up a 401k through your company is still useful even without the matching, assuming their expense ratios aren't high. It's taken out of your check before taxes, so it's hard to miss it because you never see it.

If/When you leave your company you can roll your 401k into your own IRA or into your next company's 401k if they offer that (many do).

******* If you stay for three years, you will typically get the matching funds from the company. Vesting rates very from company to company but for graded vesting 25% is pretty normal-- so after 3 years if you left the firm you'd keep 75% of the matching funds.

In addition to what BSRussell says, it's also possible to roll an orphaned 401k into an IRA, which will give you more options but I think has a different set of restrictions for how/when you can borrow money from it or take money out.

Generally, even if you plan to switch companies every three years, it's probably a good idea to invest into your 401k enough money to get the matching contributions.

This is a way to average out your investment across the little ups and downs that occur daily with the value of your chosen investment. If you only dump money over every 6 months, it might be an "up" day or week where the investment is priced higher.

If you buy every two weeks, you get more shares when the price is low and less shares when the price is high...which averages out your "input" into the fund.

If anything ETFs are newer and more "exotic." Both mutual funds and ETFs can have a wide variety of goals, from outperforming a commodity index to capital preservation. There are mutual funds that track an index just like an index fund does. Characterizing them as all aspiring to beat the market is innacurate.

***** To address the core of the critique, I'd say that 100% equities is definitely madness for anyone over 30, but for someone young and depositing constantly it's pretty normal. Equities are high risk, yes. This is also the basic problem with small cap and international equities that BSRussel doesn't like. It's entirely possible he's right; my small cap and international investments haven't performed as well as my US Large Cap.

That being said, the small cap investments aren't super unreasonable for someone young who is more focused on growth than wealth preservation and risk mitigation. That's why the large investment there.

Since I don't own a home, the 10% of my investments in real estate isn't unusual. I'm probably underexposed to real estate relative to homeowners. It's worked out fairly well for me in the past couple years but it could be a bad choice overall.

The large amount of my portfolio that's in international markets is an expression of "bearishness" on the US economy, which is my way of saying I have a certain expectations things may go south in the US relative to what others think. You actually already get some international exposure through US Large Cap also.

For the most part, BSRussell notices that I'm investing very aggressively in higher-risk equities and doesn't like it. It's possible he forgot the "in your 20s" caveat for the "don't be in all equities thing", so if I were to put together a portfolio that he wouldn't complain about at all, it would be:

- 50% US Large Cap
- 20% US Small Cap
- 25% International
- 5% Cash

This allocation is more bullish (optimistic) on the US economy, less risky, and includes no real estate.

If you want independent sources to read, here's what I read as my own research, which you can use to know as much as I do:

- [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M2ASZG][The ETF Trend Following Playbook]] by Tom Lydon

- [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWSXX26][Stocks for the Long Run]] by Jeremy Siegel

- [[http://www.amazon.com/All-About-Asset-Allocation-Second/dp/0071700781/][All About Asset Allocation]] by Richard Ferri

The first one talks about ETFs, and despite the name is a general introduction to ETFs rather than being explicitly about trends. The second one talks about stocks (of which our ETFS are made up) and what they do in the long run, which is: reliably go up, and why they beat out other investment vehicles in doing so. The third one provides advice about how to diversify your portfolio and prevent risk.

If you read those three books, you'll be informed enough to start making your own decisions-- at least as informed as I am. I had some amount of background knowledge just from listening to my father discuss his investments, but I'm pretty sure if you read all three you'll know what you need to know.

**** An addendum to this:

There are several classes of investment that are only open to "sophisticated investors", meaning people with >$1,000,000. Some of these have advantages over, or at least differences from, more common investments. If you get to that level of savings, it's worth talking to someone about it.

As an example, hedge funds are designed to have lower risk than index funds; the returns are lower in years when the market does really well, but you lose less in years when it does well. Over the long haul, you are likely to end up with more money if you go into a hedge fund than into an index fund.

Regardless, hedge funds are an /incredibly/ broad category. There's a stereotype that they're there to promise massive returns, but in reality most of them exist to offer access to alternative investments that add additional diversity to large portfolios. Some hedge funds are generic "beat the market" instruments, but most have a very specific objective (aka add exposure to the energy sector with no additional systematic risk, maintain a -.6 correlation to the S&P500 etc).

When you look at the numbers and factor in the fees, survivorship bias, and the fact that hedge funds tend to experience losses when they're at their peak of managed assets, and most hedge fund investors have been fleeced.

They try to "hedge" your bets, so to speak, and have a certain amount of growth whether the market goes up OR down, or whether a particular sector crashes or grows. Based on my very tiny knowledge of investment it seems like this sort of strategy in general would perform worse than the market in good years but much better in bad years.

There as many different hedge fund strategies as there are hedge funds. For example there are market neutral funds that go short on a market index and use that money to buy specific stocks so that, even though they're using a hedge, they're actually a much riskier investment because they are isolating the performance of those specific stocks while hedging against overall market ups and downs.

I can't tell whether or not he's being serious, though, as it's all very tongue-in-cheek.

Some funny quotes:

#+begin_quote
  If you apply a political filter to his [immigration] proposal, it is pure nonsense mixed with evil and flavored with crazy. That's how the media is reporting it all over the Internet. Just like Trump planned.

  I hear you in the comments that you are tired of my Trump posts. But if he keeps delivering a master class in influence, you will hear a lot more about his methods. I'm not terribly interested in politics, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see influence as an art form from a master operator who doesn't feel the need to cover his tracks.

  Someone accused me of having a man-crush on Trump because I keep writing about him. I plead guilty. I have no idea whether he would be a good President or not, and I don't believe you know either. My man-crush is based on Trump's persuasion skills. I have never seen better.

** It is not particular about rationality, but it is rational - to consider modern science and neuroscience.

Recently i began listen brainsciencepodcast and found mindfulness and brain plasticity fascinating. The imaging (fmri) is evidence that brain can change itself by means of meditation!

But connection between 'embodied cognition' and 'feeling of knowing' if disturbing.

The idea of embodiment is that there is a lot of things in a brain that computating our body or perception of reality through body. So human mind is not in the brain, but in the brain-in-body. One of the follow up of this is idea that our brain evolved to understand through action and for action. So when Harry Potter-Evans-Verres reasons about how Voldemort can be smart and Order of the Phoenix members be alive, it looks different for those who actually have done subjective bayesian inferences and for who is not. Those who did not done subjective bayesian reasoning will not understand this type of reason unless they actually spend some time doing this. We can't make clever argument to make them understand. No easy-quick way.

'Feeling of knowing' is discussed in ep 42 and 43. Long story short. When we think that we know something ( like "Ah that was all about") it dopamine reward. It is experienced not as feeling of knowing, but as knowing that you is right. It give confidence.

People certain that they know what is right. And it cannot be changed unless they do some work. How to communicate? It is getting pretty lonely here.

******* Ah, there seems to be some misunderstanding here. The youtube link is a link to a youtube show named "Game Theory", which in this case seems to be literally a show depicting a theory about a video game, as opposed to some kind of economic thought experiment. Same phrase, different meaning. When Transfuturist says it isn't rational, he's not referring to the economic theory, he's referring to the youtube show which seems to be pretty much unrelated.
