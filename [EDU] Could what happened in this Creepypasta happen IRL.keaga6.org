** What you are talking about is called spontaneous human combustion. It is thought to be a myth.

If it was true, you would expect to see people bursting into flames all the time. However, it seems that every proposed case of spontaneous combustion always happens when the victim is alone. It makes more sense to just call these "deaths by fire" caused by some external combustion source, but instead people assume that spontaneous combustion must have happened based on nothing but a charred corpse.

Also, cremation in extremely hot ovens takes about 3 hours. I would bet my life that the bones being reduced to ashes in 20 minutes is false.

  According to Britannica, up to 10% of gas in the intestine is oxygen, up to 15% of it is methane and up to 50% of it is hydrogen.

Link? Because I'd expect a mixture of 50% hydrogen and 10% oxygen to ignite pretty much immediately instead of waiting for a shock or a spark or whatever. Hydrogen is pretty volatile.

Also, as the comment said, spontaneous human combustion is an urban legend.
