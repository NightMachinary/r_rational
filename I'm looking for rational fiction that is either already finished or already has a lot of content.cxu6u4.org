No realistically, they'll live as ordinary citizens-joining the military, security firms, various corporations, brand ambassadors etc. Governments will pay millions for supers to become their citizens because an abundance of supers is an insane level of increase in a countries military preparation.

Ie, Eidolon becomes an Iranian citizens-> Iran now has one of the worlds strongest militaries.

Aka, they'll live an exceptional life- the most privileged and powerful people on the planet.

And those people do not roll around in the dirt like gangsters, like supervillains AND superhero's

Therefore, worm makes no sense as it is entirely based around supershero's and supervillains.

What worm then ignores, is the huge impact that non-powered people would have a huge effect on the lifestyle of a powered person.

It makes anyone not powered useless-which couldn't be further from the truth. Every major government would realistically create kill squads consisting of ordinary humans to kill ANY powered threat. Every democracy would have debates on the roles of powered in society, every authoritative state would try to control as many powered as possible- through any means necessary.

Lastly, all of the worlds most powerful powered would never be in America. India and China would be the real powerhouses with: a more dangerous lifestyle, more people. And that would have great repercussions on the world.

Seems like the entities are american too. How shocking, and unique.

The style of the writing makes me feel like I have to shake my head to clear it. Of which I actually did and it didn't help.

I like the premise a lot but as someone who doesn't remember/know much about the bible and not particularly giving a shit about the Abrahamic religions, means I'm having a hard time getting into it. I also feel all the verses are overcrowding the rest of the story. I understand the why they are written and discussed between the characters but it's hard to not gloss over it when there is more than a paragraph or two.

*** Came to say exactly these three. At this point, I honestly like the Arithmancer a bit more than HPMOR (heresy, I know). It stays closer to canon, people are a bit more realistic in their capabilities, and the magic system is more universally explored, beyond just a few spells that are explained.

Worm is probably the second king of Rational stories, and is incredibly well-written. It explores what a world that actually has superheroes/villains as a sizable minority of the population would actually be like. Warning: it's fairly depressing.

Lastly, a PGtE is the most unique of the three. While not yet completed, it still is incredibly long, absolutely hilarious, and has some really fascinating world building. It's set in a fantasy world where being a protagonist or main villain is a measurable quantity, and tropes and story beats are both predictable and can even be weaponized by those who know what they're doing.

I would personally rank the Arithmancer as a 10/10, Worm as a 9/10 (it's just a tad depressing for me), and a PGTE as 10/10. For reference, HPMOR is probably a 9/10 and MoL is 8.5/10

****** I think it picks up in the 30s. When all the crazy stuff starts happening in the second year Hermione responds to it in her own way and tries to find solutions (including contemplating a transfer to Beauxbatons in France, because who wants to keep going to a crazy-dangerous school with apparently incompetent staff?). If I'm remembering right, that's also when she starts to get mixed up in the house elf plot line and starts making some discoveries about Hogwards.

It reads like a slice of life story from a rational student caught up in crazy happenings at wizard school rather than an adventure story. She really just wants to learn math, learn magic, be with her friends, and keep safe. I happen to like slice of life writing, but it does get slow in places...

It is possible to have a significant departure from cannon in the first year, but it requires significantly changing the characters and circumstances. Arithmancer tries to play it straight with the only change being Hermione as a math prodigy and fleshing out the field of arithmancy. Stories like HPMOR give /everyone/ the benefit of competence and rational pursuit of their goals and the story changes radically as a result. Can you recommend some fanfics where the first year was significantly different from the novels?

*** Having recently been in your exact situation (looking for something nice and logical to read following HPMOR and Worm), I can tell you what I found that kind of scratches that itch:

Worm, probably second after HPMOR as the archetypical Rational fic, which has reasonably-motivated characters, very well-thought out world dynamics, and a really brilliant power system, with people who fully use their powers.

MoL, which, while it doesn't have quite as hard of a magic system as HPMOR, is still quite logical and the characters each have their own motivations, and stick to those motivations, that ultimately makes it a very satisfying read.

The Arithmancer, which fully explores a magic system much closer to HP canon (or at least closer to typical fanon), involves a very reasonably-motivated Hermoine (most of the others are left unchanged) and is overall an incredibly satisfying read. She combines science and magic in a way that is much more reasonable than HPMOR, and her new innovations come at a much more believable rate.

By the same author, the Accidental Animagus is also quite good. While it doesn't explore the magic system nearly as much, it works out fine. It's much more character driven, and both Hermione and Harry (who serve as our primary POV) are prepared, reasonable, clever, and way less willing to go along with things “just because.”

The Practical Guide to Evil is also top-notch. It examines a world where “hero” and “villain” are actual, measurable qualities, and protagonists and antagonists are actually just far better at fighting than regular people. Stories can be weaponized, our protagonist is fed up with how the good guys have the deck stacked in their favor so much, and Dread Emperor Irritant (the oddly successful) is one of the best historical figures ever.

Lastly, there's the Metaworld Chronicles. While nowhere near the quality of the others I listed (especially at the start), it still becomes a fairly good read in time. It only passed muster as ‘rational' in my mind thanks to the main character, who actually acts based on logic rather than emotion, but it does become a fairly engaging read with time.

**** #+begin_quote
  The Arithmancer, which fully explores a magic system much closer to HP canon (or at least closer to typical fanon), involves a very reasonably-motivated Hermoine (most of the others are left unchanged) and is overall an incredibly satisfying read. She combines science and magic in a way that is much more reasonable than HPMOR, and her new innovations come at a much more believable rate.

Ehhhhh, the Arithmancer is okay, the sequel is just godawful Mary-Sue claptrap with a contrived plot. Honestly with how "competent" the main character is compared to the DE the war should be over within a few chapters, but she just sticks to bad tactics and it goes on as a result.

***** I understand where you're coming from, but I've always felt that Mary Sue-ness comes from a lack of development and everything coming very easily. Hermione spent six-ish years growing in power, so her strength is understandable. As for why the war isn't over quickly, she simply has different priorities. Once she does accomplish her other goals and is able to stop holding back, the war does end quickly.

But like I said, each to their own.

****** Most of the OOtP cream their pants when she makes barbed wire to fight inferi.

Barbed wire. So impressive. That totally makes her "scary" according to the other hardened veterans. God forbid she buy a gun.

******* It's easy to forget that we're looking from Hermoine's perspective, who by her own admission doesn't feel that it was that great of an accomplishment, just clever use of tactics that Harry even came up with. From the Order's perspective, they just hear that Hermione managed to take out three hundred unstoppable death machines single-handedly. They didn't know what she did, only that it was something that should have been impossible. Sort of like with Voldemort's flight, it's only impressive if you don't know how it's done.

******** She didn't do it alone, it wasn't three hundred, and raising a pillar of rock to hide on and a sharp stick to poke with would have been both less dangerous and more effective.

She's terrible and praised for it, classic Mary-Sue

** Worth the Candle is the obvious choice. It has a ton of content and is written by an author that is very well regarded here.

I'm greatly fond of Metropolitan Man, also by Wales. Rational Lex Luthor.

Sticking with Lex, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]] is another good read.

The Erogamer is coming along quite nicely. While I wouldn't say it is nearly finished it does have a lot of content.

Unsong isn't really rational/rationalist but it is definitely rationalist-adjacent.

Also rationalist-adjacent, Worm captures the general sentiment of having a protagonist that coldly considers her options at each point and a lot of the story takes place in her head as she tries to plan out how to respond to her rather crazy circumstances. The narrator is er.. a bit unreliable, which adds another layer to parsing the story.

** It's not to everyone's taste, and it's far from finished, but With This Ring definitely has a lot of content (over 2.5 million words and counting).

Compared to HPMoR or MoL, it's not especially rational. Compared to the source material, though - comics and animated series - it's highly rational. The author puts a lot of effort into having the universe (or multiverse) make sense within the constraints of comic book logic.

Typical pitfalls are the slow pace - updating daily, but often providing more detail rather than moving the plot forward quickly - and concerns that the protagonist is not properly challenged, though opinions on that are quite divided. Strengths include the carefully considered and detailed plot, humor, and author involvement; as well as updating the story every day, he's active in the associated discussion thread and fixes any reported typos in under a day.
