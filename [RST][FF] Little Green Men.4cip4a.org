** This is by the same author who wrote Crystal Society, the first of the [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][Crystal Trilogy]].

I haven't actually read that work myself, but this short story is just as thoughtful and well-written as I expected based on the very positive reception of Crystal Society here.

Or, to sell it another way, it's a DS9 Star Trek fanfic looking at Ferengi in their element.

*** Crystal Society is definitely worth reading. I just finished it yesterday, and it was probably the most clever thing I've read since Worm.

** Just out of curiosity, has anyone else read [[http://www.amazon.com/Balance-Power-Star-Trek-Generation/dp/0671520032][Star Trek: Balance of Power]]? I don't think by any stretch it's rational, but it's clever and made good use of the Ferengi... If anyone's looking for a laugh it's a short, entertaining book.
