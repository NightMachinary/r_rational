Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

The Powers:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /clearly/ defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

- The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

- In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, /powerful/.

The Problem:

- In which we solve problems posed by other users.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** This thread seems fitting enough for a discussion on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_%28film%29][/Oculus./]] (spoilers from here on)

Oculus is a horror movie about [[https://imgur.com/F7FKjhx][a large antique mirror]] that:

- seems to have reality-warping (mainly malfunction of electric devices) and mind-warping (hallucinations, rationalisation of actions dictated by the mirror, gradually increasing insanity, etc) abilities;
- tends to protect itself from being damaged;
- tends to eventually kill living things (plants, pet animals, humans) in its proximity (radius of influence /appears/ to be ~30 feet.) with extreme prejudice, often using the same living things as the instruments of murder;
- was responsible for at least 45 deaths in the four centuries of its recorded existence, the trail starting in London of 1754 (I'll maybe upload the death descriptions scene later).

If you were aware of these properties of the Mirror, knew were the mirror itself was (soon to be auctioned with a starting price of $10,000 not far from where you live), and had enough money to buy it but not enough for going Lex Luthor on it, how would you try to acquire, experiment, and benefit from it?

edit: [[https://a.desu.sh/rmqaip.webm][Here's the scene as a webm]] --- ~12min/~1gB, with some skippable parts in the middle (maybe I'll add a lower quality version later). As a bonus, try to count all the blunders and mistakes the protagonist made in her preparations. : )

Use various forms of life from bacteria to plants and animals placed at various distances from it to see if there are any patterns in what dies when (orientation of the mirror, orientation of the planet, moon, etc, local environmental conditions, where the mirror is located on the planet) and whether it's notably affected by placing shields of various materials and thicknesses between the mirror and the subjects, or encasing the subjects/mirror entirely.

In addition, monitoring of the mirror's damage-prevention process might be useful. Can it actually be damaged at all? Does it regenerate? What does the regeneration process look like through an electron microscope? If it can't be physically damaged, what happens at the submicroscopic level when things (matter, various forms of energy) strike it? Can it be heated or frozen? Does the material(s) it's made of expand or contract? How about interaction with chemically active materials?

The protagonists attach a large hammer to the ceiling in front of the mirror and set it to go off when a timer runs out. If they had walked away at that moment, the mirror likely would have been destroyed, but since their goal was to prove the mirror had preternatural abilities they only used it as a fail-safe.

Imagine if you could harness that and apply it to general products. Build products (everything from smartphone cases to bridges and rockets) out of tinfoil/cardboard/wax, then apply the invulnerability. When the time eventually comes to replace/upgrade the perfect unbroken product which has never required maintenance, switch off the invulnerability.

Heck, if the invulnerability protects against things like melting at high temperature or being affected by extremes of pressure, build products out of carefully textured ice or frozen air. Instead of throwing anything away or trashing it, just switch off the invulnerability and it evaporates.

******* The mirror isn't actually invulnerable, it just uses its mind effecting powers to protect itself. If a human tries to damage it, they find themselves unwilling and then rationalize it. Later in the film, it also manipulates people into protecting it from the device they set up once it had more power over them. The most dangerous part of the mirror is its intelligent use of its powers.

On a point unrelated to that, it was my impression of the film that the mirror doesn't effect electronics, it just alters people's perceptions so that they think they're seeing something else. The video cameras in that house recorded everything exactly as it happened, the protagonists just couldn't tell because they were under the mirror's influence.

** You have "perfect" memory in a universe where memory manipulation exists. How do you maximise your defence against that threat given that you don't know the exact mechanics of the manipulation?

To clarify, "perfect" memory means:

1.  All data you receive from your various senses (the five major ones and all the minor ones, e.g. proprioception, thermoception, nociception) is encoded as a memory.
2.  Memories can be retrieved in their original level of detail if required.
3.  Memories are never lost naturally.
4.  Memories never decay naturally.
5.  There is no storage limit.
6.  There is a robust retrieval system akin to the normal human functionality (e.g. "details of person matching this face", "elements of the periodic table", "events in my life that had this smell", "muscle contractions required to perform this manoeuvre").
7.  Retrieval can be fuzzy (i.e. "reminds me of..." instead of "is exactly like"), since requiring exact matches would be crippling.
8.  This retrieval is virtually instantaneous and complete, but actually analysing the memories takes as long as it would for a normal human (i.e. retrieve is O(1), process is O(n)).
9.  Memories of accessing memories are encoded, but the content of the memories so accessed is directly linked to the original (i.e. if you forget X, your memories of remembering X will not tell you X).
10. Your inner monologue and non-memory visualisations are independently encoded, but they work exactly as a normal human's would.
11.

If it helps, you can think of it as your brain interfacing with an infinite-capacity, instantaneous database. =INSERT= to add memories (automatic), or =SELECT= to retrieve them (automatic and manual).

The memory manipulation may be "dumb", deleting or altering random memories, or it may be "smart", targeting specific memories.

In the latter case, the way it targets memories would mirror the way you might access them (see point 6). Going with the database metaphor, it would be like issuing a =DELETE= or =UPDATE= query.

So they could delete all your memories of your name and all memories of you saying, hearing, writing, reading, and thinking your name. Each of these would constitute a separate query, so it would be the responsibility of the manipulator to come up with all possibilities to delete.

Given that absurd wall of text, what's your strategy?

I'm also assuming that perfect memory and memory modification are relatively rare and/or difficult, or else the world would have solved all of the easy solutions and there's really nothing you can do about it as an individual.

Subvocalize a diary to yourself, preferably the day (or week, or month) after the events in question. If you remember something you didn't subvocalize, you know it's a false memory. If you subvocalized something you didn't remember, you know it has been erased.

For more secure memories, store them as riddles/puzzles so that they don't have direct associations (Also, make sure you don't solve it early, so that the manipulators can't follow the new memory and delete it.). For example:

- I am the first in earth, the second in heaven, I appear two times in a week. You can only see me once in a year, although I am the middle of the sea.

- I am a pirate's favorite letter.

- What is the only word in the English language that reads backwards to forwards, and if turned 180' would still read the same?

**** Yes, mind reading would be impossible. At the very least, it would be completely impractical to use on somebody with this perfect memory, as the sheer quantity of memories would make digging through it would take literally millions of years.

In the setting I'm working on, there's only a handful of people with the perfect memory ability and an unknown number of entities with memory modification, but can be safely assumed to be extremely rare.

The diary method is solid, especially if you double the information with some sort of cipher. Even if the second copy was just using pig latin, it'd still be enough to defeat the memory manipulator.

The riddle method may be overkill, though. Since they can't read your mind, they can't follow memories anyway. Although I suppose it would make things more interesting if the manipulator was also able to delete "nearby" memories (e.g. deleting the memory of a person also deletes any memories you associate with them, even if they don't directly contain that person). That would make the riddle method pretty useful for small data sets (could take ages for a larger one), which I think is a good change.

The idea is that you can apply force at a distance.

For instance, it's possible to build a magic staircase. One field acts as a step while its partner lies on the ground. They move together, so they'll compress the ground just as if you were standing on it directly.

If I designed them right, the fields should be mostly compatible with physics. Since they're always parallel to each other, they should conserve momentum. And they shouldn't break conservation of energy, either.
