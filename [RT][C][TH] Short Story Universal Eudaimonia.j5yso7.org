** So is the characteristic leading to the small number of people for whom immiserating their enemies really seems to be their most important terminal value culturally learned or a genetic trait that is still latent in Eudaimonia's population?

What is the difference between this Eudaimonia and wireheading? The curmudgeon in me is wondering if the AI keeps it all on this artificial island, or if it's going to let me make my own Eudaimonia, with blackjack and hookers, in an O'Niell cylinder.

*** Even if that characteristic isn't culturally learned, it can probably be culturally suppressed.

The "immersive virtual environments" may be wireheading, but the difference between the other experiences and wireheading is that there's no direct input into the brain. The AI isn't making you happy; /you're/ doing things that make you happy, with the opportunity to do so simply being made available to you by the AI.

My reading of it is that your own Eudaimonia is certainly possible (if a floating city on Venus isn't off the table), but may be constrained by resources. There's plenty of mass with which to build the O'Neill cylinders in the solar system, but building enough for everyone who wants one might take a while.

(Yes, I know the following is a Futurama reference, not a serious demand)

The blackjack and hookers... Blackjack as a game of skill, sure. In a post-scarcity economy, though, gambling doesn't make much sense. What are you risking? What could you possibly win, if there's an entity willing to make an O'Neill cylinder to make you happy? Similarly, what do you have to offer the hookers as payment that they can't get directly from the AI?

**** I don't want it to make an o'neill cylinder for me i just want the mining drones and 3d printers to bootstrap asteroid mining and second checks on engineering.

Personally I don't like games of chance, I lived 5 miles from a casino for three years and never put money on a table, and blackjack is solved enough that you can show the house edge for the dealer playing by the book, so there I can skim whatever resource allocations from people who don't understand statistics as I imagine any compensated escort would also be doing. I'd probably end up making somewhere like Golden rule (from the cat who walks through walls) , but less skeezy political.

I imagine I would want out because an AI planned vs an AI assisted world seems too much like facilitated wireheading to me.
