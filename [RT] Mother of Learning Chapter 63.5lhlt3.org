******** The Silent Doorway Adepts were willing to train Zorian for a huge quantity of crystallized mana. However, assuming they have a Bakora Gate, would they be willing to teach Zorian how to use it---the artifact that gives this web their very name? Perhaps, but considering how secretive the Adepts are and how protective aranea are in general about their most prized knowledge, I doubt the Adepts would be willing to give Zorian access to their gate.

As an absolute last resort, storming in, killing everyone except the elders, then extracting the Bakora Gate lore, then spending a restart studying it could catapult Zorian's knowledge of both spell formulas and dimensionalism. What's more could recruit Xvim perhaps even Nora Boole to help him study the artifact. Nora Boole might be brought to tears to have the opportunity.

And it may be that the knowledge gained would also help ZZ disrupt the Bakora Gate used by the Ibasans---which may be critical once the loop ends.

In my opinion, Zorian really ought to get access to that Bakora Gate if at all possible. Maybe it'll be a dead end, but it be well be an incredibly fruitful experience.

Plus, if violence is the only way he could access the Adepts' Bakora Gate, then it is unlikely he will ever get access outside of the loop. He might as well do it considering the Adepts will simply respawn in the next loop. He should certainly give them every chance to share the information though; I cringe to think of him gaining access by force.

There's three plot threads converging towards this. There are +Banora+Bakora Gates in both the timeloop, and the real world. Connecting them could make an exit.

The Sovereign Gate is barred, but it's not inactive if RR is travelling through it between the Timeloop and the Real world. If that connection didn't exist, then the Timeloop world would be already dissolved. Perhaps the Bakora gate can piggyback on this connection? All speculation. I'm desperately trying to find a way out for Zorian, preferably with his body intact.

It seems very possible that the Primordial is not within the Timeloop, and is being summoned from a pocket universe that is located outside of both the Timeloop, and the Real world. It's bridged by a lifeforce/blood connection. This is something that Zorian will have between himself and his irl self. If this is true, it indicates that another exit can be made, but will trigger the loop. A solution is to wait until the final loop.

******* There's no reason to suspect any relationship whatsoever between the Bakora Gates and the Sovereign Gate. The only thing they share is that they have Gate in the name and we learned about them fairly close together. They're different technologies from entirely different civilizations and time periods which work according to completely different principles.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They have a way out. Collect the keys, unlock the Sovereign Gate, walk out.

If the Primordial were being summoned from a pocket universe outside of both the loop and the real world, that would imply that a) all pocket universes would display unexpected behavior during the loop, in particular a Bag of Holding or somesuch would let you send information from one loop to the next and eventually out of the loop, which directly contradicts one of the primary design goals of the Sovereign Gate b) it wouldn't work more than once, since summoning the Primordial into a world and then destroying that world would either destroy the Primordial or cause devastating consequences across all nearby universes, neither of which is consistent with what we've observed.

Even if some kind of blood-bridge to summon looped!Zorian bodily back into the real world were possible, that bridge would have to go through the Sovereign Gate for the same reason that the ritual to summon the Primordial has to happen at the hole. You can only access a pocket universe at the point where the pocket universe connects to the rest of the universe. The problem with this is that /the Gate is barred/. You'd still have to unlock it, which would still require finding the keys, at which point you could just walk through. The only advantage is that the summoning thing might be able to move you through bodily rather than having your spirit supplant your original self, which is extremely useful but not necessarily worth the tremendous difficulty involved in designing such a ritual.

This may not be true. The Sovereign Gate utilizes time magic and dimensionalism. Bakora Gates use dimensionalism. I'm not saying they're necessarily related, but there may be a connection that can be exploited.

For example, imagine there is a dimensional bridge connecting the loop dimension and the real dimension. What if Bakora Gates can punch into that exit path?

But I agree that the keys are certainly their best bet. I wouldn't be surprised if unexpected problems arise however.

I think the strongest case against these kinds of dimensionalism shenanigans is that, from a storytelling perspective, they would feel very deus ex machina, especially when the Sovereign Gate keys are a valid option.

It's the nature of "tests" in Mother of Learning, that Zorian is going to have to develop some kind of skill that's crucial to getting the Grey Hunter eggs, that Silverlake needs him to know. The Haste spell that his simulacrum used during the encounter is also in that area of magic (and a big tip off). Zorian's dimensional gate also had some success against the Grey Hunter.

I'm trying to my best to be a good reader of what the author has constructed in this world. It's a struggle not to turn everything Zorian encounters into a Chekov's Armoury. This is my first encounter with "rational" literature, and it's full of novelty -not just the cheery spider.

It's not about his targets being “inherently evil”, it's about setting at least some kind of boundaries in his mind regarding who can be an acceptable target (e.g. eldritch entity summoners, their goons, their support network, etc) and who can not. Friend-or-foe differentiation is usually very important in matters like this for people, especially during wartime when soldiers have to kill or torture their enemies. For instance, even members of Unit 731 had to be trained to double-think around their victims being humans and think of them as wooden logs.

I agree with that, but only partially. What I was trying to point out in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5lhlt3/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_63/dbx0hre/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational][my original comment]] was that immoral actions are not all grouped together in a single homogeneous bundle, and that if a person is ready to make immoral choice A then it doesn't automatically mean that they're also read to make /any/ immoral choice at all.

Let's assume there're two versions of Zorian: one who's ok with mind-probing non-criminals personally, and another who's ok with doing that through a proxy clone.

The first one mind-probes people day after day, and gradually starts to realign his morality principles in an even more drastic manner so that all his personal experiences of what he considers mind-probing of innocent people wouldn't paint him as some kind of a monster in his own eyes. Eventually, this Zorian!A's moral compass will change so much that he'll not only be ok with mind-probing them, but also with mind-torturing them, mind-torturing their families for leverage, etc. And each immoral choice that's one step harder will warp his morality principles even more.

The second one, on the other hand, will know that he's mind-probing people, but since this knowledge is more of the academic variety because he himself has none of the first-hand “personality-contaminating” experience, through time he'll stay on the same level of only being ready to mind-probe non-criminals when there's a very dire need for that. He /may/ decide to make some harder immoral choices, but those decisions won't be affected by his deteriorating moral principles as much as it would've been the case with Zorian!A.

/p.s. This all is of course only my current opinion. Also, this is likely my last comment in this comment chain. Thanks for the discussion!/

***** Zorian's been using simulacra for eight restarts so far; they don't seem to maintain themselves.

The memory packets theory is definitely possible. It's possible that Zach had been trained in a lot of things pre-timeloop. There is one major flaw:

Even Zorian would have a difficult time overwriting a person's life story that much. If Zach had been skilled enough to cast simulacrum, to have (novice or intermediate-level) unstructured mind shaping abilities like RR exhibited, etc., I don't think RR could have successfully purged that much information.

Plus, it is unlike Zach to have the patience or temperament to undergo that level of training, then hide it from his peers to pretend to be untalented in school. All that mastery would have required a few years of training.

It's still possible I suppose, but I find it really unlikely. Veyers also feels unlikely considering his volatile temperament, but we shall see. :D

*** I have another idea for simulacrum abuse.

Simulacra share Zorian's mana supply. If simulacra were to do the mana-regeneration meditation procedure near the Cyoria well they should be able to regenerate Zorian's mana in parallel.

We have not yet seen any range limitation on maintaining the simulacra, or a numerical limit on the number he could maintain at once.

The apparent lack of a range limitation should allow Zorian to effectively bypass the constraints on mana use when far away from a mana well.

As Zorian can maintain a number of simulacra simultaneously while being principally concerned with their use of mana-intensive spells rather than any sort of constant mana draw, and on the other hand Zorian can regenerate his entire mana reserves in a matter of minutes when near the Cyoria well, maintaining such simulacra should provide Zorian with far more mana than they consume.

This idea may not work as well if mana regeneration is principally limited by the ability of the soul to assimilate mana. In which case Zorian should still see substantial benefits from having a single simulacrum dedicated to mana regeneration, however he would not see additional benefits from having more.

******* Any series with teleports I start wondering about how it is affected by teleporting to/from a moving object, especially since the planet itself and everything on it is moving at different rates depending on latitude.

I feel like until the author makes a statement about it directly, teleporting to/from a moving vehicle is always an option. I can't remember if this has ever been addressed in the story.

I also wonder about what happens to pre-existing matter in the location being teleported to, but that's not the question at the moment.

The main issue here is that the basic teleport spell has a range limitation. It's not a big deal since we've almost always seen the characters stay in Eldemar: [[http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/Altazia-s-Central-Valley-525095257]]

Last chapter was the farthest we've actually seen them go away from here, but we don't know if they were able to teleport directly or if they had to make multiple jumps:

#+begin_quote
  In the Ishekatara Sea -- the southern sea enclosed by the two 'prongs' of the Altazian continent -- there was a pirate ship.
#+end_quote

Koth (Daimen) and Bianyrre are other continents entirely.

The aranea colony with the Bakora Gate seems like the most likely route for Zach and Zorian.

Other possibilities involve teleportation and Gate spell variants, or even an established teleportation route across the ocean using islands/boats?. I think there's sufficient reason to have a much faster transoceanic route available for information/small goods/small groups of people, that would be prohibitively expensive for individuals to utilize for themselves. This chapter seems to argue against that because if it did exist Zach should have brought it up as an option, unless it's illicit knowledge that Zorian gained on his own.

**** Out of pure curiosity, I did some quick research on this.

Peregrine falcons are one of the fastest flyers in the world. Their speed in level fight is about 65 to 100 km/h. Assuming the maximum is probably unreasonable so let's say they can fly at about 80 km/h normally. Assuming 10 hours a day spent in flight, that's a travel distance of 800 km per day.

But wait! Peregrine falcons are migratory birds ('peregrine' means 'wanderer') and while finding information about their migration speeds is surprisingly difficult, the internet is telling me that some individuals travel as much as 480 km per day. This is considered very impressive. Although it's possible that peregrine falcons are just being conservative with their energy, I'm going to assume they have good reasons for traveling at that speed. Let's round this to 500 km per day for easier calculation.

I have not thought too deeply about actual numerical distances in my world, but I consider the planet on which the story is happening to be the same size at earth. Since Altazia is temperate, and Koth is equatorial, that's roughly the distance between Northern Europe and Central Africa. Web calculators tell me that the distance between Copenhagen and Kinshasa is 6678 km. Since I assume actual peregrine falcons are way better navigators than shapeshifted humans, let's round that up to 7000 km.

7000 divided by 500 is 14, so the best case scenario says Zach and Zorian would need 14 days to fly to Koth as birds. Not unworkable. However, spending half of the restart traveling is clearly quite suboptimal. Not to mention that reality is unlikely to be ideal, and that they would likely encounter unfamiliar complication the first few times they tried that.

In general peregrine falcons don't strike me as the kind of bird you would pick to fly across the ocean. They are small, which means they are unlikely to be able to fly 24/7, and would probably run out of energy reserves (i.e. fat) pretty quickly.

If we are talking about ways to get to Koth quickly in general, I think there are several good options:

- The easiest and the most likely to work into any other activities: use the same method Zorian's parents use at the start of the month, which likely involves a hired teleporter who knows the road. In later restarts Z&Z would know all teleportation locaitons and would be able to travel there independantly.

- Some sort of polymorph potion to turn into an extremely fast bird, along with some other potion to increase it's speed, letting Z&Z complete the journey in just a handful of days. Requires them to develop/buy the necessary potions, and I don't see what are the advantages over the first plan.

- A plane golem. Make some sort of semi-aerodynamic platform, inscribe enough spell formula into it to make it float and cut through air without any resistance, strap a big magical engine on the back, load it up with mana crystals, strap in and go. Advantage being that this platform can be used multiple times, and all it requires is a supply of mana crystals (and thus could be used by non-mages. Z&Z could get rich after the time loop by inventing aerospace industry and selling tickets to other continents)

- My favourite method: ICBM transportation. Use magic (Like that sphere Zach used) to gain enough speed to reach space and travel to Koth using a ballistic trajectory. Main advantage is that this method should be /fast/ when compared to something like a chain of teleports (since they would likely have to rest somewhere in the middle).

***** Not sure what the range on teleport is, but if I were Zorian I would just use a simulacrum to travel to the maximum range of his teleport using a bird transformation (and to each telepathic relay point) and then contact Zorian and Zach for a gate so they could memorize the locations for future restarts. Rinse repeat until the entire way could be done in a series of teleports. Then they could just chain teleports at the start of the next restart to get there insanely fast. I believe this would be easier then dealing with different people for different amounts of money and their own schedules. With Zach's huge mana pool it would be a triviality to make the trip.

Hypersonic means five times the speed of sound (Mach 5). The speed of sound is 1200 kph (750 mph).

In Ch 62, Zach uses the sphere to escape giant eagles.

The fastest bird, the homing pigeon, has horizontal flight speed of about 80 kph (sustained) to 140 kph (short distance) (50 to 90 mph). If the giant birds were going that fast (they were probably slower than this, seeing as they're giant birds and were each carrying a human), then we know Zach was also going at least 100 kph (for ease of calculation---well under the speed of sound.

Zorian's reaction to escaping the giant birds wasn't that Zach was going slowly to let the birds catch up---rather, he was surprised the eagles could keep up. This suggests Zach's speed when escaping the birds was comparable to the first time Zorian saw the sphere used. I take this to mean that Zach wasn't killing his speed too much to escape the eagles, so his max speed is probably somewhere between 100 kph and 500 kph, depending on how much more he can push himself, and probably closer to 100 kph.

How long can Zach sustain that speed? If the above is accurate to how the sphere works, then Zach can easily travel 100 kph, but not for extended periods of time. The first time we saw the spell, Zach used the sphere to travel from the invasion army to the Hole. At 100 kph, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes to travel across the city (it takes 15 minutes to travel the length of Manhattan at that speed)---after which Zach was exhausted.

I think they might do better traveling as birds or, as you said, dimensionalism---or whatever else Zorian has up his sleeve.

So my reasoning was that the sphere was clearly pulling high-g maneuvers, while passengers were unaffected; it didn't give a damn about physical obstacles it encountered (which means it doesn't give a damn about drag) and it would not care about heating as it's not material anyway. If it was operating under proper Newtonian mechanics, it should have been possible to launch it like a ICBM.

But apparently that's not the case. Oh well.

Ellipses generally have a space on both sides, although when a sentence ends with an ellipsis, you don't have one after it. E.g.:

#+begin_quote
  “I see,” I said. “Um. What are you doing here?”

  “I am your batman.”

  “My . . .”

  “Not the notional hero,” Sith said, a bit of a growl in his voice. “Your batman. Your orderly.”

  “Orderly . . .” I frowned. “Wait. You work for me?”
#+end_quote

Notably, /CMOS/ dictates an ellipsis that has a space between the periods themselves rather than supporting the preformatted glyph which you use (Word AutoCorrect).

**** CMOS asks for the ellipsis to be separated by spaces because the pre-formatted ellipsis glyph may show up as another character depending on platform. They prefer writers to use . . ., then an editor can do a search-replace on the document, replacing all . . . with three periods surrounded by two non-breaking spaces.

In reality, this is not considered the best way to make an ellipse by many typographers, who believe that an ellipse should be three dots separated by /thinspaces/. To not have spaces makes it feel to scrunched together, but it doesn't look as crazily wide as . . . either.

#+begin_quote
  For manuscripts, inserting an ellipsis character is a workable method, but it is not our preferred method. It is easy enough for a publisher to search for this unique character and replace it with the recommended three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces (. . .). But in addition to this extra step, there is also the potential for character-mapping problems (the ellipsis could appear as some other character) across software platforms---an added inconvenience. So type three spaced dots, like this . . . or, at the end of a grammatical sentence, like this. . . . If you know how, use two nonbreaking spaces to keep the three dots---or the last three of four---from breaking across a line.

The argument about not recognizing the character correctly is nonsense; they're already recommending the use of a non-ASCII character. Anything non-ASCII could be recognized incorrectly if the document is opened with the wrong character set. (Which is why you should always use UTF-8.)

The problem of “...” being rendered incorrectly is a matter of font choice. It's rendered poorly in Verdana, but it looks good in Helvetica and Times.

Templates. If you have a style files that you just add to over time, you eventually have a lot less to figure out. My template had a font section, so once I figured it out once, I'd just change the font for that section and it'd be okay. Sometimes, certain fonts require certain packages, so you just keep font and package pairs commented out for when you need them.

I think LaTeX takes that route because most people don't know typography well enough to make those decisions, and it tends to do a really good job of it---certainly better than MS Word. At the same time, it gives you the control to make the decisions where needed, albeit using a forty-year-old markup language.

Anyhow, changing fonts can be annoying---it depends on your pain tolerance certainly---but I didn't find it too bad. I remember making a few resumes in LaTeX and then spent an hour recompiling with different fonts.

My own theory to how he gets to koth is that he gave his mom an anchor stone to take to Koth that way he could teleport to that.

There is no way that's really what's happening. If they were sending letters or small packages maybe, but no way could you transport an army like that. Even if Quatach-Ichl is the best mass teleporter in the whole damn world, the mana costs for such long jumps would be completely impractical on that scale.]

  Admittedly, such a small number of stops would do much to explain how they could transport such an army through Eldemar territory without being discovered by Eldemar, but...

  [They're not teleporting in the manner we've seen you do it,] Memory of Sublime Glories noted. [They are using some kind of stone construct to open a dimensional passage between two points. Like a door to another land.]

As for destination, I believe one merely needs some way of divining the target location sufficiently accurately. Having been somewhere before should make that easier, but I do not think it should be a strict requirement for someone of Zorian's skill.

*** Along with the distance thing others brought up, maybe it's also possible that there're some kind of wards being maintained along borders to discourage sneaking across?

Though maybe implementation of something like that is a bit tricky. Zorian said before that there are three steps to teleporting - the divination, the dimensional barrier, and I presume the actual transportation. None of of these are the kind of things that can be prevented outright if you limit the wards' area of effect, so if an anti-border-crossing ward exists it'll have to be country-wide. Otherwise, countries could just place detection/prevention wards where they can along the border and physically maintain a presence in border villages to catch anyone who sneaked through.

Which is not to say that he should stop sending them on potentially lethal or boring missions. The ability to copy himself is just too valuable to pass up. But a little more consideration and sympathy might go a long way.

Consider: it was entirely foreseeable that when actually faced with the expectation of being torn apart by a super-spider, he would be scared. So he could have planned ways to mitigate that. Real-time memory uploads and a promise to promptly re-cast the spell afterward. Or letting it do something fun first, so it resented its existence less.

** So, we know that one part of the Key is held by our undead supermage friend, one part is somewhere within a ridiculously well-defended encampment filled with traps and with a small army of battlemages on short dial (aka treasury), one is somewhere deep within the Xlotic desert, one is located within Koth jungles and finally one is on Blantyrre. Here is what I think:

- Crown will probably be either the last or the first part of the Key they will collect in the final restart. Collecting it first would involve first spying on QI, finding out where he is certainly located at a set time, and then catching him off-quard while he doesn't have his stack of buffs (haste, all his shields, likely perception magic, contingency teleportation, etc) up. This is best done as early in the restart as possible, to maximise the element of surprise (as invasion draws near QI will likely grow more and more paranoid). On the other hand, collecting it last would probably probably involve defeating QI during the invasion, if finding him before that point proves troublesome. Now, I can't guess how that would work, but I imagine it would involve a really big magical cannon that would be able to launch a projectile with similar properties to that coin Kael developed. It would have to be big because that projectile would have to be moving fast enough that QI wouldn't be able to dodge, and magical enough that it would break straight through all his shields.

- Taking dagger might be attempted in two different ways. One way to do that is to go at it all stealthy-like, sneak into the treasury and nib it without triggering the alarms. Personally, I don't think that is very likely, as the treasury seems incredibly well-defended. Alternatively, they could break through with brutal force, and then it should probably be the last part of the Key to get-as we have seen, otherwise local military won't let them do anything for the rest of the restart.

- We obviously don't know anything about the other parts of the key, but I think that the one on Koth will involve Damien, one in Xlotic will involve those wasp-creatures nobody103 wrote about on his worldbuilding blog, and finally one on Blantyrre will be in the hands of the lizardpeople. Personally, I don't see "you need to search a whole desert to find it" as much of an obstacle to them, since they could probably use a combination of simulacra and polymorph potions to swiftly search for it. Turn into an eagle->fly around triggering the key-searching part of the marker once every couple seconds->do that with 10 simulacra simultaneously and you can cover a whole lot of ground in a day. For example, Homing Racing Pigeons have horisontal flight speed of 177 km/h, or about 50m/s. Assuming marker can ping the key from 200 meters away, that's 20 000 square meters covered per second. I think that with the use of magical drugs and potions you should be able to make them fly for 16 hours a day, for a total of about a billion square meters covered in a day. You could cover something the size of sahara desert pretty quickly like that.

If the soul resides in a parallel dimension meant to store soul information, then that dimension does not have to map the distances of the spatial dimension---like how a holographic card does not preserve the distance of the hologram it creates.

I doubt that a cannon of any caliber could penetrate them anyway. At least, not in a single shot - and even if it could, the discharge of energy on impact would surely destroy the projectile. And you're unlikely to get a second shot.

Catching him with his shields down seems to me like the only way. Except for beating him in pitched battle. Which they still haven't done. It's all very well to make him flee and shore up other parts of the invasion, but that's a very different order to actually destroying his body - and preserving the crown in the process.

#+begin_quote
  Firearms were notoriously tricky to enhance with magic. Like all ranged weapons, they had the problem that you could only enchant the device to be more accurate and durable, and if you wanted the projectile to have any sort of magical effect upon striking the target you had to enchant the projectile itself. Bullets were unfortunately very hard to enchant, being much smaller than arrows and crossbow bolts and usually made from some very magically unsuitable materials. You also couldn't touch the bullet to channel mana into it once it was already in the gun... though maybe if he installed some crystal mana channels into the gun via alteration...
#+end_quote

For a complicated enchantment like what Kael put on that coin, it may be difficult to make the "coin cannon" work. But Zorian is good at spell formula and can recruit a small team of researchers. They definitely should explore the tactic. If they can fire the gun before QI can cast a haste spell, they should be fine.

** So, what's the timing involved in the pipeline for a simalcrum memory packet? Ex: If a simalcrum sends over a full day's memories, how long does it take to a) make the memory packet b) send the packet c) for ZorianPrime to absorb the packet?

It does seem like Zorian is using them to good effect (clone per job!), but I'm still curious as to what the improvement ratio ends up being.

** Hi, there. I'm new to this series. I've just had a huge binge read of Mother of Learning. It's great. I'm going to have to read it all again from the start. There's so much.

The simulacrum perspective is really good stuff as it picks up on Zorian's questionable status as a copy. Nice that this is being explored, and I like that it's adding a new PoV. Potential for extra runtime and replace his need for Black Rooms.

Nice that there are so many body/soul options that could all be possible escape exits from the Sovereign Gate. I have a hunch that Lich and Mayor Necromancer could become allies, or at least tools, for the duo's exit. This is tipped off by Red Robe's quick escape, and I think they may have to reconstruct RR pathway to get out.

Still wondering if/when the story will circle back on the soul alteration that started this story. This is so mysterious to me as the story has established that Shifters get benefits from having animal souls within them and inherit special abilities from that infusion. Did Zach get something from Zorian? Such as an improved his Shaping ability? Did Zorian get more that the Marker?

Speculation: If Zack carried Zorian's soul outside of the Gate with him, he has enough mana to manifest Zorian in a simulacrum. Don't know if the magic system supports this sort of thing. I'd like to see more Zorian's internal conflict over having to "kill" his true self played out in his simulacrums.

I miss those damn cute spiders.

*** There's no indication of Zach or Zorian picking up anything except the marker, but it would be hard to tell. Zorian's mana reserves might well grow a little bit more than he'd expect, but he doesn't have any precise way to measure that, since his magic missiles are way more efficient than when he started measuring.

The author has confirmed on his [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comments][blog]] that you could make a simulacrum of someone else, but you would need soul sight, not just personal soul awareness.

Of course the lich will become a tool of escape - or, at least, they'll take such a tool off his head. To actually recruit him, though, would unbalance the story. If he said to pack up and go home, or to massacre the cultists before they complete the ritual, the Ibasans would do it.

Sudomir also isn't likely to become an ally, but they will probably take the opportunity to disrupt the invaders' preparation by toppling him.

**** Hey, thanks! There's clues sprinkled around this story, and it's a lot of fun trying to piece them all together.

I think Red Robe is an ally! I don't think he came from inside the loop- I think he is Zach's mage trainer and the one that put him into the Gate before the story started. He either entered the gate with Zach and a copy of his marker, or he knew he was copied into the Sovereign Gate, and was given a marker by Zach once inside. It's plausible.

I'm concerned for Zorian. It doesn't currently seem possible that he can exit the simulation without doing something drastic. I really enjoy how the author has so much restraint in defining Zorian's character growth. It's refreshing to read a coming-of-age story that isn't littered with false drama, and I have my fingers crossed that Zorian will remain both credible and consistent.

I'm looking forward to meeting Damien as it has so much potential for Zorian to get over his old hang ups. Damien, being older and having excelled, seems to be a parallel to Timelooped Zorian and his irl self. If Timelooped Zorian somehow exits the gate, I think Zorian Prime would be feel incredibly inferior to him for the same reasons that he feel inferior to Damien. Not sure how that going to play out so I'll be here for the next chapter.

***** Red Robe as Zach's trainer doesn't work for me.

- He criticised Zach's failure to shield himself from divination. A trainer would have told Zach to remedy the failure, years ago, or decades.

- He approached Zach as an enemy, assaulting him to get access to his mind. If he were any kind of ally of Zach, he would have just asked. We know Zach was lonely and jumped at the chance of companions.

- He's apparently a cultist, based on his easy access to the robe, and they're bad news.

****** All very good points.

What baffles me is how Zach got into the Sovereign Gate, and for what purpose? What are your thoughts on this?

It seem that the Gate activates once every 400 years, and may be tied directly to the Noveda bloodline. Otherwise, why put him in there. The same astrological conjunction that occurs is also the best time for summoning the Primordial, so maybe the SGate is a divine safety net against such an event. Possibly there's a reason that's yet to be revealed that Zach /need/ to be at peak mana. Zach's fantastic stats aren't as relevant in the final battle as strategy, though this could be story bias towards Zorian.

I agree that RR is the one that mind wiped Zach. On top of that, Zach has a compulsion to prevent anyone from undoing this. To me this indicates that there is a plot twist hidden inside- as the amnesia trope is often used to conceal information such as this. What does Zach's amnesia achieve?

RR is a covert agent that infiltrated the invasion force, and used it to hammer Zach until Zach matured and found way to defeat it. After that, RR collected the five keys- four that he has access to because he is an agent of the Crown, and the fifth he can get from Quatach-Ichl due to this previous reconnaissance. Why did RR leave at that point?

Zorian speculates that RR feared multiple time traveler. I think it's because the purpose of the Timeloop was completed. A solution to the invasion had been found- an alliance with the Arenae can foil the invasion without any input from Zach. Furthermore, the control conditions had become polluted with (seemingly) additional time travellers that were corrupting Zach.

Maybe RR departure should have ejected Zach, but Zach's tie to Zorian has anchored him from leaving. Zorian is the spanner in the works.

I think it's highly likely that the Zach has a lot of safeguards around him that will allow him to exit, and these are going to be the obstacle to Zorian's survival.

The gate was no longer in Zach's possession- having been sold/donated. I find it curious that Zach is the controller of the Gate if he had no access to it.

Thanks. That's what chiefly stuck out to me.

In addition, the Noveda bloodline ability is only loosely described as a capacity for high mana. Hardly unique, as others have been mentioned to have this (e.g. Damien, Fortov) though not as absurdly high as Zach.

It was also pointed out (somewhere!) that Zach's high mana, and slow shaping maturation, was something that would keenly benefit from Black Room time dilation. The Sovereign Gate is a perfect aid for him to capitalise on these qualities, if indeed his bloodline are the "chosen ones".

Doesn't explain why the keys are scattered everywhere.

Qualith Ichl may have answers- if he's 1000 years old he's lived through two activations of the Sovereign Gate, and if the Planar alignments are evenly spaced at 400 years apart. We know from the Ghost Serpent that some entities undoubtably know of the Sovereign Gate's function. This is a massive can of worms- there are people copied inside the gate could keenly know the scenario, and may want a way out. May not be a plot point- The Gate may be too esoteric for anyone to operate, and a true Noveda family secret expunged from or buried in Zach's compromised mind.

I still have my doubts about it being a bloodline. Zach said:

#+begin_quote
  "No one I consulted about [having a large mana pool yet good shaping skills] has any idea how that is possible. Most people think it's some kind of undocumented bloodline of the Noveda."
#+end_quote

My pet hypothesis is that Zach's strange abilities are part of the whatever ritual gave Zach the loop marker. Like you said, the loop is the perfect environment for a huge mana pool in exchange for slow shaping maturation.

If Zach's abilities are the result of a bloodline that only pops up every once in a while, it's a /huge/ coincidence that the bloodline happened to manifest in the same generation that gets to use the Sovereign Gate. So, my guess is that Zach's abilities and the Sovereign Gate are intimately linked. Either the bloodline is somehow a once in 400-years thing or it's a part of the loop marking ritual. Or maybe it's a second ritual done in addition to the ritual that gave Zach the marker---and that's why Zorian didn't get the mana reserves boost when he got the soul marker.

As for Quatach-Ichl, I would freaking /love/ for ZZ to spend a couple restarts chatting his ear (skull?) off; he must be a fascinating person to talk to. Sadly, I doubt QI would give ZZ the time of day unless QI knew they were loopers, and if QI knew they were loopers, I'm pretty sure he'd find some way to make them into lab rats.

I'm really disappointed that ZZ aren't fighting QI at the end of every restart, trying to find ways to beat him. And if they could eventually disable him to the point where Simulacrum!Zorian could access QI's mind . . . hoh boi, would that be interesting.

(I say Simulacrum!Zorian because personally invading the mind of a 1000-year-old lich has NOPE written all over it.)
