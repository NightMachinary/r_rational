We use the same system as on [[/r/HPMOR]], so [context for spoiler] plus (#s "spoiler goes here") gives [[#s][context for spoiler]]. It shows the spoiler if you hover, and works on mobile. Let me know if you have any critiques.

ETA: It's 100% fixed now; thanks again for all of your help everyone!


** It doesn't look like [[/r/HPMOR]]. There's a big blank space where we should be seeing "context for spoiler".

*** Huh. Works for me! I'll try in a different browser, see if I can replicate what you're talking about.

****** I see. Bb, you mod [[/r/hpmor]]; care to share the code? Since the one I'm using obviously isn't perfect, despite coming from [[/r/modhelp]]...

******* I would guess you need to set the colours. Look at [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]]'s stylesheet, as bbrazil said, and fiddle with the colours in the different sections to see which is the right one. Looks like at the moment it's white text on a white background.

********* It kinda got worse. Now I can't even read the spoilered text.

Tried it on a Mac OS X Lion and on a Windows 8.1, with Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Same result on all combinations.

*********** As of this post, I think you can get [[/r/HPMOR]]'s behaviour by replacing

#+begin_example
  a[href="#s"] {
      visibility: hidden;
      display: inline-block
  }
#+end_example

with

#+begin_example
  a[href="#s"] {
      display: inline-block;
      background: black;
      color: white;
      padding: 0px 0px 0px 10px;
  }

  a[href="#s"]:hover {
      color: #8F8F8F;
  }
#+end_example
