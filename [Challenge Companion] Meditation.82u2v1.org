*tl;dr: This is the companion to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82u2ei/biweekly_challenge_meditation/][the biweekly writing challenge]], post anything relevant that's not actually an entry here (e.g. ideas, recommendations, idle thoughts).*

Apologies for the lateness of the challenge and sparseness of this post, just got home from a family trip.

** So, now that you've exposed your secondary account, are you going to stop posting to these challenges, post under a different pseudonym, or just post using either of your account and assume people aren't going to be biased?

*** I have other accounts, and will probably use them, but I think the new strategy will be to just "burn" individual accounts immediately after the challenge is over rather than allowing them to have continuous identities. I don't tend to write a story for the challenge unless there's something that really grabs my attention away from other projects, or I'm not working on anything with an explicit/implicit deadline.

(Part of my process for deciding on a challenge is seeing whether I can think of at least three good story ideas in a short period of time, and one of the risks to that is that I might stumble on something that it seems like I need to write to get out of my system.)

(There are currently six drafts in my Challenges folder that have enough meat on them that I want to finish them at some point, and another thirteen that are mostly bones and sketches. It's fairly common for me to start but not finish a story, especially for challenges, where I'm more comfortable walking into things half-baked.)

** Stupid question as I've never done one of these, does the "etc." regarding the acceptable way to link one's story only include other private sharing services like Google Docs, or is even something public like FictionPress or Archive of our own okay?

*** Public is totally fine. You can also use a personal blog or website.
