I am working on a rational fanfic at the moment and I go by the philosophy that crowdsourced intelligent/rational! characters will be more intelligent than if I try and model them all myself. As such, I am testing this out to see if this is a good place for asking and if it will work. Anyway, here goes.

Question:

If you had to hide a car so that it could not be found, then immediately transfer to another vehicle of some time in a way that would give no information about you, how would you do it?

For example, you could leave it in a parking lot somewhere near a train station, but the police regularly check on cars in parking lots that have been abandoned for a certain amount of time.

You could sell it or trade it, but records are made. You could do it in cash or barter but then the person you did that with would recognize you. You don't want ANY information to be available later because RATIONAL! antagonist will track you and is thorough.

You could hitchhike but that isn't fast or predictable and you still have to abandon the car somewhere it ideally can't be found for at least a few weeks and then transfer immediately to the highway to hitchhike.

I need suggestions to use for my story. Preferably suggestions that can be explained in two sentences or less in the story. You can take more than two to explain here but it can't something I couldn't summarize.

I look forward to seeing what you come up with.


** Sneak into a junk yard, put the car in the crusher and call it good. You can bribe someone to do it for you, swap the car for the one that is supposed to be destroyed, whatever.

Alternatively, drive it into a deep lake / old quarry. Just make sure you erase the tire tracks from where it went in.

Alternatively, drop it off in the bad part of town with the doors open and engine running. It'll be stolen and run through a chop shop in minutes. For extra paranoia points, buy a lot of paint and give the car a new paintjob before you drop it off.

If you're really in a hurry, just take the plates off and torch the car -- soak it in gas inside and out, toss a road flare in. The shell will be found but there won't be any fingerprints, DNA, etc. You'll probably want to scratch out the VIN too. [[http://www.autocheck.com/consumers/car-facts/vin-numbers/find-vin.do]] for where to find it.

Getting a new car -

Cover yourself up (e.g. hoodie and sunglasses, keep your head down) and hire someone to go into a junkyard and buy you a wreck. The junkyard owner (who is easily findable) knows nothing about you. The random citizen who bought it for you is not easily findable (being utterly random with no obvious connection to you or the junkyard) and never saw you enough to identify you.

How moral is our protagonist? If you did the 'hire someone' option above, you could kill them and bring their body with you until you can dispose of it.

Alternatively, you could carjack a person in a deserted area, kill them, and bring the body until it can be disposed of.

Ways to dispose of a body:

- Best way is to dump it in a barrel of nitro-hydrochloric acid; it will even dissolve the gold fillings in their teeth and their wedding band, let alone their flesh and teeth. Failing convenient chemical stores, you can:

- bury it in the woods

- tie a few cinder blocks to it and throw it in the ocean. Ideally puncture the stomach first so that gas buildup doesn't make it more buoyant after a few days

- throw it in an incinerator

- knock out the teeth to prevent dental matching, then pour gas on it and torch it to destroy face and fingerprints

*** The protagonist is fairly moral and wouldn't kill an innocent. As for driving it into a lake, they still need an immediate transfer to another vehicle that won't be easily trackable. I think the immediate transfer is a limiting factor.

** Easiest way would probably be for someone with a vested interest in not revealing its origins to take ownership of the car. So ... arrange for the car to be stolen.

Leave the keys in the ignition and the car running in a bad neighborhood, put a post on Craig's List, contact known criminals, etc. Depending on the level of technology you have available, it wouldn't be all that difficult to anonymously set up someone to take it. They would never have to see your face, and so couldn't reveal information about you if they were caught (which they wouldn't be, assuming that you can hand over the paperwork).

**** Well, with no prior plan in place, you're pretty much stuck with having some unpleasant problems, it's just a matter of picking your poison. Give the constraints you've outlined elsewhere in the thread, I think sticking the car in a parking garage is probably sufficient - that would likely give you around a week. I know the parking garages that I've used in the past don't tow until three or four days have passed, and even then the van ends up in an impound instead of being registered with the police, IIRC. Long-term parking at an airport would actually be my recommendation, since airports generally connect to bus lines and have a plethora of taxi cabs ready and waiting (assuming they don't have the resources to fake their way onto a plane).

If they're in a big enough city, it would be pretty easy to ditch the car in the hopes that it got stolen and then simply walk to the nearest bus stop or train station.

If they're worried about the plates being run, and they judge they have sufficient time, they could stop in a random parking lot somewhere and swap their plates with someone else before ditching the car, which buys even more time, and likely goes unnoticed for a significant length of time.

*** They have enough money to buy a small house, but that is the entirety of their resources and they want to use it efficiently. This will likely be necessary later in the escape so it needs to be done as cheaply as possible. They have the van itself. That is it. The threat is an attack by someone that they do not know but who they fear has a great deal of resources at their disposal to track them down .They don't want to give out any information, including which of the group survived the attack, if at all possible. The car can be found, but ideally no one can report seeing them and it won't be for two weeks, though a week would be sufficient.

They want to transfer to anonymous transportation as soon as possible because they fear the unknown assailant has put the car's plates into the police's database or will soon do so.

They are operating without knowledge of the assailants capabilities and are assuming the worst due to certain elements of the attack, including a belief that the attacker might be able to track them if they are in the area near the attack for too long regardless of how anonymous they are. They want to be out of the state, in anonymous transportation, with their old van rendered unfindable for one to two weeks, using as few resources as possible.

**** One thing you could do that's pretty simple: paint the van in hippy signs and switch the plates with any random car on the street.

Painting it like a hippy van has several advantages: painting a van a different color is hard to do without it being obvious that it's been repainted (paint isn't quite even, little splotches on the chrome, etc. Painting it as a hippy van, no one is surprised if there's a few glitches in the paint job. It's greatly distinct from its original appearance, and no one is paying attention to the faces of the people in / around it, because they're too busy looking at the van.

** Why do I have to switch cars? Are the police watching for this particular car? If so, I'd probably just switch plates, drive along country roads, and give my car a crappy spray paint job.

If I really need a different mode of transportation, hm. Carjacking or identity theft seem too difficult for me. Probably the easiest would be to look up someone who's selling a used car, and then lie through my teeth (sob story, fake name on bill of sale, pay with cash or forge check). Alternately, maybe I could acquire a fake ID and buy train tickets with cash.

Of course, this is a very "lifeboat" scenario - all alone in the middle of the ocean. How about borrowing a friend's car? Having a friend buy your train tickets / rent a car. Call up my parents and get them to buy me a plane ticket - or even come pick me up.

** I don't know how common this is in other countries but in Melbourne, Australia parking on the side of the street is common in suburbia. So just park it behind another car in a random backstreet. Each household assumes it belongs to one of the others near by, bystander effect means it wont get reported for a month at least if it is in reasonable condition (i.e. it hasn't been in a gun fight). Then you walk to the nearest bus or train stop and disappear.

** If I might offer a late entry to the mix. Buy a tarp for cars, bring the car to someplace semi-public pull into a driveway for a house that has a for rent sign. If you can manage it talk to the person you of the building for rent if you could rent the place for a few days and cover the vehicle with the tarp. Call for a taxi or take a bus or other form of public transportation. The tarp stops the car from being readily id'd and stops most people from lifting the tarp to see what is under it. Rent is a lot cheaper than buying a house outright, even for one month. Pay in cash and you are almost untraceable as you can get. The person you rent the house from might be able to ID you but for the short term you are golden.

** How much time do we have to hide the car?

If we have a warning of a day or something I still think driving out to the middle of no where, ditching it, finding a road and hitchhiking (or walking back). Then when you need to get the car back you either hitchhike back out, or take another car but burn that car when you get there. If you don't have to get the car back you can just burn it in the woods, or drive it into a pond or the sea.

It doesn't have to be impossible to find, just unlikely, chances of someone walking through a forest in the middle of nowhere have to be damn low, you could also just put it in a storage garage.

--------------

1. Buy the car you're going to escape with, find someone on craigslist, show up in a balaclava, buy it in cash. Buy a new set of clothes and put it in this car.\\
2. Take that car and put it outside of town, somewhere no one will find it for a few hours, out the road and hidden.\\
3. Come back into town, walking or cycling or hitchhiking, take your old car out there.\\
4. Get out your old car, throw all your clothes into it and burn it.
5. Simply get into the car you bought earlier that day, literally seconds between switching transport.
