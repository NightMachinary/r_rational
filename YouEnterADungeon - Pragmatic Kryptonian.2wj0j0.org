*** Metropolitan Man is a solid story. Really nails home how utterly terrifying it would really be to have someone like Suoerman flying around.

Lex Luthor doesn't seem so crazy anymore.

**** I read the hell out of Metropolitan Man the second he linked it to me. It's an /excellent/ story. I wish my YEAD would head in that direction.

***** To be fair, as you are an actual human being, albeit one with Superman's powerset, your YEAD is a bit more understandable to a Lexpy ( I made a word!) than Metropolitan man's Supes.

Lex's issues there were both that Superman was too strong to stop if he caught you plotting, and that it was impossible to know if he was truly good or if he had ulterior motives - partially because he was not human.
