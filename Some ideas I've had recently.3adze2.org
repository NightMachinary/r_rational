So I've been thinking a lot about that martian transhuman setting I made a post about earlier, about the mythology of the green lantern corps. and objects of power in general, and about the show Steven Universe.

The main idea I'm interested in is an Object of Power that searches through the cosmos to find someone Worthy. The exact logistics of that are interesting but can be figured out later.

I imagine that while there would be a central planet and generally benevolent and powerful beings in charge, they would try to be diplomats rather than police. It would also be focused on them making mistakes and working through growing pains rather than being literal billions of years old.

The backstory is that they are artificial beings created by a Sufficiently Advanced Civilization (future humans). They were given some general goals about making the universe a better place and acknowledging and including the perspectives of as many sentient races as possible before being abandoned.

The Steven Universe influence is largely aesthetic, with these beings being made of hard light with a crystalline core. They're technology is all based on self-sufficient hyper advanced crystalline constructs and hard light projections. My imagination says it looks really rad.

So let's say you are a hyper advanced crystal being with basically human values. How do you go about accomplishing the goals you were assigned? I have some ideas, but I'd love to here your guys' suggestions as well.

P.S. you should really check out Steven Universe. While the main character isn't exactly rational, he does display impressive emotional intelligence which is something I think this sub could stand to emphasize more.

Edit: It occurs to me that this probably isn't quite enough information to go on. Feel free to ask about their specific capabilities or whether something would be possible. Technologies they definitely have access to: hard light projections, really thorough scanning, very small and powerful computers, ftl travel, pocket dimensions, and remote energy transfer. They aren't likely to go for agi, seeing as that's what they're for.

Create pocket dimensions that contain arbitrarily large and ever-expanding perfect eternal computational substrates linked by FTL gateways, and upload everyone and everything into them. Finally, after everyone has been rescued from the messy entropic universe, upload myself as I turn the lights off.

*** An interesting proposal. Unfortunately you forgot the part about asking everyone what they wanted.

Also, I'll clarify some limits on the pocket dimensions for everyone here: They have a finite amount of space, and have to be maintained through outside energy. The larger they are, the more energy it takes to maintain them.

I'm also more interested in initial strategies rather than the main end goal. Especially since, even with ftl, searching the entire known universe for sentient life will take a very very long time. And this ftl is of the gotta go fast rather than the portal variety. The fastest you'll ever get is a few months between galaxies, and that would require a great deal of improvement to the stuff you start with.

Edit: Thanks for the suggestion, btw. I didn't realize that other people wouldn't think of the same thing when I said "pocket dimension".

Spoilsport.

Build N robots with copies of my mind-state uploaded into them... well, I guess I'm already one of those... and then send them to N star systems to do the same thing. Within not too many cycles I'll have one of me at every system in the galaxy, and let these instances proceed as needed for that specific circumstances in that system. Meanwhile, repeat in the next N^{N} galaxies until copies of me are managing the whole universe.

Probably going to end up turning stars into more efficient energy sources, plus computronium to upload people into.

I don't think you're quite taking this seriously enough. This is the Big Problem. The fact is that a lot of folks won't want to live in a simulation, no matter how nice it is. I'm one of those people, to be honest.

The whole purpose of this exercise is to achieve some degree of harmony between vastly different value systems. Not just doing your best Celestai impression and insisting that this whole simulation thing is an absolute must for every single being in the universe. You can only ignore the desires of individuals/species if they are completely incapable of cooperation, not just if it would be more convenient to.

Correct me if i am misinterpreting what you said, but it seemed to me like you implied by this that you can simulate the world in a way they will not be able to tell, so it is somehow better to forcibly upload them without them knowing then to let them live in reality.

If we assume that this is possible, but that doing so is using more energy then actual reality what possible reason could you have to simulate them? because you seem to imply it is better, and i cannot see how that will be better if it is less energy efficient.

In the context of my original post, yes. Because I was creating non-entropic subspaces that were growing as fast as necessary to provide enough processing time and storage to run the simulation basically forever. Really forever. Like in the Greg Egan novel /Permutation City/ I previously noted.

The point is that if you can achieve the same with less effort then it makes more sense then to go about a more difficult and less efficient approach.

And anyhow infinite energy doesn't mean infinite amount of it available at any time, if a simulation is a 10 orders or magnitude less efficient then reality it would mean that the universe you will be able to maintain would be 10 orders of magnitude smaller.

******************** Manipulating atoms on a large enough scale to back up and restore, say, a human? Yes, I can see that being possible though it wouldn't be instant and would probably be a destructive process. You'd need to change the laws of physics to "scan" a human at the atomic level non-destructively.

You also need to do the backup regularly, because the restore would lose everything that happened since the last backup. How often are you going to volunteer to be broken down into atoms and rebuilt?

Or you can take a less complete backup, maybe just scanning the neural connectome, and rebuilding the body from a template. That would feel even less like a "backup". I dunno, I'd rather just go through that once.

And that's just for a human. In a simulation, you can roll back whole planets to a recent snapshot.

First, my original post had the universe the simulation was running in growing perpetually, so you can just wait until it's big enough for whatever you want to simulate.

And don't forget, the simulation is running on simulated time. It doesn't matter how long it takes to page in bits of the universe. The simulated world will never know about it.

its not just that it would be slower, you have limited memory, you cannot simulate more then a certain amount..

i will give you though that from subjective aspects if you need to chose between a pure good world running in a simulation which is slower in real time it would be preferable to me over the real world running faster, but from a global perspective that might not work as well..

What are you basing this claim on? It seems awfully arbitrary to me. if we were talking about some kind of simplified universe(like in FiO) i could maybe see the argument, and to be honest even that kind of a simulation might not be possible. but i honestly cannot see any argument for a simulated reality being in any way more likely then a manipulated reality...

If there is some limit to the compute structure, because that's the only reason an infinite or indefinitely expanding universe with infinite energy supplies would need to defer execution.

You build a cellular automaton that implements a simple computer. It doesn't matter how inefficient it is, because it's either infinite in extent or grows indefinitely so you can simply pause the simulation until you have enough resources. You run a simulation of physics on it, again, it doesn't matter how inefficient it is, because you can allocate as many processors as you need to any volume of space however small.

Done.

you are forgetting that we just said that infinite doesnt mean that you have infinity of it at any moment, only that as time passes you have more, and that it is not limited. you could store an infinite amount of data, assuming you have infinite time, but it does not mean that at any moment you have infinite storage.. so the arguement that your virtual universe could be 10^{99999999} smaller then the actual universe it is running inside stays true, also for the people inside, it is possible that with all the resources in your universe you will only be able to simulate a cube of matter which is 15cm^{3..}

and the universe will multiply itself every 10^{10000} years, so in 10000 years you will be able to simulate 30 cm^{3,} of course that is also assuming that simulating more matter isnt exponentially more resource intensive..

the universe seems to be running on a quantum ruleset, it is not proven that it is possible to build a quantum computer, thus it is possible yourinefficiency in calculation will be so big that with all the matter in the universe at your disposal you still won't be able to simulate more then a tiny amount of matter. the point being that unless we are literally talking about infinite amount of energy available to you immediately, loss of efficiency -is- important.

I don't think that anyone has claimed you can't simulate a quantum system in a classical computer, and it only needs to simulate reality to that level when someone "requests" it by making an observation. Most of the simulation can be fairly low resolution most of the time. There's no reason to simulate minds by simulating brains below whatever level is required to get the same results, for example.

And simulating the whole universe /undetectably/ is a thought experiment you suggested, not part of my original plan. Most universes wouldn't find it necessary to do that, and besides people would catch on that something was going on when they quit aging and dying, or they started consciously reincarnating, or whatever hack I came up with to destroy death for that population.

This Btw also brings another assumption which i believe is baseless, you assume it is possible to simulate a world well enough(i assume that when you talk about simulating you include all of the 5 senses, as well as reality which is of no lower "resolution" then is perceivable by a human being, meaning you wont simulate an 8 bit universe where everyone are 2d sprites that can just see as simple 2.5d world with sounds coming from all around them, but instead simulate a world in as good fidelity as human beings are able to perceive, so when you dig in the send on the beach you will feel the heat and touch of the sand, when you build something in the sand it will continue to exist after you go home, and the waves will slowly run it down.

Even if we assume that the world will not continue to exist when a human is not there(what about a bacteria? an insect? a mammal?) just real simulation of all of the 5 senses at the moment is something we have nothing to suggest as possible. Today simulations which encompass such large scales take -huge- shortcuts which significantly lower the fidelity of the reality they offer. it is just fake, its good enough for people -trying- to immerse themselves in the world, but it is nowhere close to reality.

i didn't reference that point because it has no bearing on the question of uploading people. as i said earlier, in case i misunderstood you you were free to correct me.. i was under the impression that you were saying you would upload people without their knoledge and convince then to upload ex post facto.

if what you actually suggested was: a. spread onto the rest of the universe b. prepare "computronium" so upload is possible

and thats where your plan stops then cool..

Personally i am still not sure if a simulation of reality would ever possible\effective in any way close to reality, but maybe you will convince people to live in downgraded worlds so its a non-issue

Btw is there any kind of proof\indication that "uploading" would ever be more efficient then a brain? i can see some better energy efficiency in large scale brain storage, but can't really see any inherent efficiency increase in "visualizing" the brain.. I see the concept of "uploading" is so entrenched in this circle i am just wondering if its pure fantasy or if there ever was an indication it might have something to do with reality..

Depends on how much of what the brain is doing is thinking, and how much of what the brain is doing is maintaining living cells that do the thinking. What's the computational element in the brain? Synapse? Something smaller? How many gate-equivalents are a neuron? Is it less than building that many gates out of technology T?

Given that neurons were developed from little self-repair-and-replication factories, and they still have all that overhead, it seems much more likely that they can be simulated with something smaller even if that's general-purpose enough to be programmable.
