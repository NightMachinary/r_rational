** The story reads a bit strangely and plods along at times -- no doubt in part because of the translation. However it features great worldbuilding, and the ending is absolutely fantastic.

Recommend.

** Just... awful (the essay; I didn't bother reading the story after that).

The user comments on the page include some good rebuttals to the essay.

*** Personally, I quite liked the story. It's not god tier, but it's not /insanely/ long either at ~225K words and if nothing else it's a very interesting alternate perspective.
