** Why did Bellatrix summon a Patronus and tell Milo to look? Only thing that comes to mind is that she's showing she's having happy thoughts... and that feels a bit clumsy/obscure.

*** Protection from Good is exactly like Protection from Evil in its secondary effects of removing any sort of mind control, like that of the imperius curse. Milo is using the spell book of an evil wizard(who totally has a name but I fail to remember what, as he was an inconsequential threat even within the story.) as he does not have his own with him.

**** Interesting question on that: why didn't Boccob give Milo his spellbook? He clearly wants Milo to accomplish /something/, so Boccob has a better chance of getting what he wants if he gives Milo the relevant resources.

***** Limited options for reviving him. Also as per the Spell True Resurrection you don't generate with your stuff. All his items are currently sitting with his body over on the HP side of the multiverse. Baccob is True Neutral so he would be well within His right to only just revive Milo and not give him his equipment. He did however give him the equipment of another wizard.

*** Milo doesn't have his own spell book he has (Thalmior?)'s and the evil equivalent of protection from evil is protection from good.

** How is it that Bellatrix has multiple wands? I thought Ollivander basically never made duplicates?

She mentioned something about a Geminio charm, which probably duplicates your wand, but that seems like a total authorial cheat -- Milo found an overpowered way to beat an HP wizard, so Sir Poley had to come up with something that defeated that specific tactic. In HP canon, no one ever targeted their opponent's wand, so why does this charm exist?

Actually, I guess Expelliarmus counts as targeting your opponent's wand, but there's still no point in having multiple wands. Given the spells at their disposal, HP wizards are glass cannons -- whoever lands the first hit wins, so the duel consists of not getting hit. i.e., if someone can hit you with a Expelliarmus, they can also hit you with an Avada Kedavra / Cutting Charm / Blasting Charm / whatever, all of which kill you.

If you can duplicate wands for basically nothing, why not go into business for yourself selling wands at ridiculously low prices? Ollivander's would be superior, but poor people would happily pay a few Knuts for a wand that worked "ok" as opposed to "great". You could make it up on volume, since your only cost would be rent on the storefront, and that could be just a lemonade stand in the market place.

*** The Geminio charm is from the original Harry Potter universe, and allows you to either duplicate an object arbitrarily or cause an object to duplicate on touch. Duplicates made in this way rust, tarnish or otherwise disintegrate much more rapidly than the original. +This means that buyers of Geminio'd wands would have to buy many of them over the course of their lifetime as opposed to a single Ollivander wand, and each Geminio'd wand they buy will perform worse and worse over its duration.+

As for why Bellatrix had cast it--well, she's smart, and the majority of her power comes from a single object. Even in her own universe, Protego shields come in multiple variations (Protego Horribilis, for example, only deflects magic classified as Dark) so it's concievable that an Expelliarmus could succeed where another spell would fail.

**** Would a Geminio'd copy of your own wand work as well as the original? If so, I don't see any reason to ever carry your own. Just Geminio one (or more) every morning, throw them away at night.

***** After looking into it a little more, Geminio falls under Conjuration, and even fairly simple Conjured objects tend to last only a couple hours. As the complexity of the object increases, the duration decreases correspondingly. For magical or living objects, I suspect the duration would be in the neighborhood of 15 minutes (although there seems to be no strict documentation as such). Either way, that rules out the Lemonade Wand Stand entirely, as a wand conjured this way wouldn't last out the day. Similarly, leaving your main wand at home is not useful for more than a brief outing along the lines of apparate in, kill target, apparate out again. More likely, I expect that Bellatrix was using wordless wandless magic to duplicate her wand during the conversation with Milo, then used only the copies while keeping the main wand hidden or invisible.

*** I think to go head-to-head with Milo, Bellatrix is also a Munchkin. Therefore she, like Milo, has a tendency to adhere to the "text" of the rules of the HP universe rather than the "intent". Bellatrix, alone among HP wizards and witches, tries to push HP magic to the extent of what a "DM" would allow as legal. That includes duplicating wands.

Note that Lucius did not do this with magic; he paid a fortune to have spare wands made for him. This shows that Bellatrix is a Munchkin and Lucius is not.
