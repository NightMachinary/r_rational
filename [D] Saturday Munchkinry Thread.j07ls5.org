Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Suppose you have a magical level of Touristness about you which causes everyone you meet to be willing to let you off with a warning the first time they see you violate a particular custom or taboo. Everything from gum on the Singapore sidewalks to cutting in line at the grocery store to wandering into a staff only area. No matter what you did, the first warning is always /just/ a warning with no further consequences, blame or mistrust involved. The maitre de asks you politely to stop belching, the guard dog growls and nudges you back toward the gate, the secret service agents escort you back to the tour group and tell the guide to keep a better eye on you.

How do you adjust your behavior to take maximum advantage of this ability?

*** What constitutes a custom or taboo? Is "no murder" a single taboo, or are there perhaps "no premeditated killing", "no killing in moments of passion", "no hiring a murderer" etc. all different things? What about different methods of murder?

Also, will everyone warn you the first time, or just people who would otherwise oppose you? For example, if I tried to enter into a criminal conspiracy with someone who would normally be down for criminal conspiracy, would then warn me once and accept my offer the second time? Because if so, that's a rather strong limit, but if not, that plus the destruction of evidence is a pretty massive tool in your toolbox.

Also, what happens if there are multiple offenses before anyone can warn you? If you you commit tax fraud for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, then the 2021 fraud is discovered in 2022 and the IRS gently warns you not to do that, are there penalties if your 2020 fraud is later discovered?

Is the "this person has committed this offense before" record global, per person, organizational, or by word of mouth? If I rob Alice and she lets me off with a warning, can I never safely rob anyone again? Can I never rob Alice again, but rob anyone who was not a direct witness? Can I rob Bob, her next-door neighbor whom she told the funny story of this tourist who accidentally robbed her without realizing it was inappropriate? Can I rob someone else in Alice's family? Someone covered by the same local police department, or national government?

**** You can only get away with things that a tourist who is four to five standard deviations above average in terms of cluelessness might plausibly think was allowed, and only if the person who would normally punish you for your transgression has no specific evidence that you knew better. Whether Bob lets you off with a warning or calls the cops depends on whether he recognizes you as being the same tourist from Alice's description of the prior incident. If he thinks you might be someone else, you get the warning instead.

It doesn't work for most murders (because even the most clueless tourist knows that you're not allowed to randomly kill people), but you /could/ get away with lethal self defense in a jurisdiction where that is not normally a defense, on the excuse that you thought that it was. Hiring a hitman is also a possibility if you do so via euphemism, so long as a sufficiently clueless person might have plausibly been trying to request the literal meaning ('surprise delivery' or what not) rather than the implied hit.

It only triggers if you find yourself in a situation where you would otherwise be punished for your actions, and covers all prior violations of the taboo, but not subsequent ones. In the IRS example, your 2020 tax fraud would be forgiven on the basis that you didn't know it was illegal back then. For the conspiracy version, fellow criminals wouldn't be compelled to warn you, since they aren't inclined to enforce the rule.

** After building a pillow fort, you discover that you are able to connect to other pillow forts as well. You can only do this because your fort contains a scrap of cloth that was originally from a couch in the Palace of Versailles-whichever fort the cloth is in becomes the center of the network. After you've established a center fort, any other fort that contains an item that once belonged to you will become connected to said center fort, though they won't connect to each other. The pillow forts don't have to be deliberately made-something like a propped-up couch cushion with a blanket thrown over it works just as well, as long as there's a space defined within that contains an item from you.

However, there is also an international organization keeping track of linked pillow forts. They are capable of entering any center fort in the world through their headquarters, and require all potential members to perform a good deed with their fort to join. Furthermore, they will monitor any future links created.

How are you going to leverage this for maximum power?

*** The easiest method of making money, so long as it's okay with the central organization, is probably through circumventing borders in one way or another, whether that's by running drugs, running guns, ferrying over immigrants, or simply dodging taxes.

If it can be done en masse, without secrecy, then it might be better to operate within the bounds of the law and set up an expedited shipping company which can accomplish international travel in minutes rather than taking half a day. Of course, doing it out in the open has some problems, mainly that you're dependent on no one finding out about and taking your scrap of cloth, and there's a major organization that's presumably invested in stopping this (for whatever reason). Depending on what scales it's possible to work with, you could make enormous pillow forts that a semi could pull into as part of a transfer to the central fort, then transfer out to their destination, saving thousands of dollars. Similarly, you could make a massive central fort that would compete with the airlines and have only security as a cost.

Lastly, if you don't have to construct the pillow fort yourself, or if the fort can be mobile, you could spend a big chunk of capital gotten through other means and shoot a "satellite" into space, which would give you access to orbit around Earth. Similarly, with a fort landing on the Moon or Mars, you could shave billions off creating colonies and scientific expeditions there.

(As a natural part of all this, you would need to find out the minimum requirements for 'pillow' and 'pillow fort', stretching the definitions as far as they would go in order to drive down costs and figure out what solutions to problems are actually workable.)

#+end_quote

Let's take this in the other direction. How deliberately made can we get while still counting as a pillow fort. Can we use internal props to increase size and stability? What happens if we make a literal building frame and pile up pillows for walls. Do they have to be general purpose pillows, or can we commission special "structural pillows" that are easier to turn into large spaces. How far can we go and have something still count as a pillow?

In theory, the more space you can create the more you can build it into a useful transport hub. Is there any way to make it large enough to literally run a rail line through? Because serving as an intercontinental rail hub could be massively lucrative.

Alternately, can you make it large enough to run pipes through? In theory, if you had the capital you could claim some barren spot of land somewhere in, say, the Western Sahara or similar then use your pillow fort to provide transportation and resources. The costs to get it up and running would be more than most have at the ready, but if you could do it you could potentially found a viable nation of your own.

Another one you can do is to create super high density housing. Make your primary pillow fort a suitably gigantic warehouse somewhere with cheap land. I imagine your fort is probably just a layer of pillows and blankets insulating / stapled to the inside of an actual warehouse. Then buy a commercial space somewhere expensive and fill it with closet-sized pillow forts. Build entire luxury condo complexes inside the warehouse, wherever those exit. Sell units in the expensive place with land costs from the cheap place. This is very capital-intensive, but you can bootstrap it up from enough money to rent a commercial space plus buy a home somewhere cheap. If you run out of room, you can always link new warehouses to the prime one, keeping only the connective corridors in your main pillow fort. You can also add cheap heating and cooling to this scheme by connecting to hot/cold parts of the Earth.

Speaking of heating and cooling, if you want to gather power more literally, you just need exits in Death Valley and Antarctica to power a heat engine. However this is limited, since pillow forts aren't going to survive the kind of temperature and environment extremes you really want out of a teleporter powered heat engine.

Also, your good deed can be providing housing to the homeless. It's not very far out of the way of the above scheme.

** Astrologers believe in the rule: "As Above, So Below". The idea being that the movements of cosmic bodies, and the moods and behaviours of humans, are merely expressions of the same great pattern, manifesting at different scales in the universe. Similar to how fractals repeat at every scale of resolution. Thus, by studying the movements of the planets and stars, one can predict human behaviour here on Earth.

However, this leads to a very interesting corollary: "As Below, So Above". If the cosmos represent the many shades of the human experience in macrocosm, then by logical extension human experience represents the movements of the cosmos in microcosm. And if there exists a symmetry between human behaviour on Earth and the movements of the cosmos, then could we not, through cunning psycho-engineering, alter the positions of heavenly bodies?

Unfortunately, that kinda strips everyone of free will which is mostly boring, though the degree to which it's possible to confirm that probably depends on the accuracy of your astronomical observations and models, implying that in this universe there are speculators who have fuck-off big telescopes and teams of scientists in order to build better and better models of the future in order to make more money.

If you assume that there's not a bunch of free-will stripping pre-destination nonsense going on, you probably end up in sort of the opposite situation: teams of scientists who want to study astronomical events or gravitational waves or whatever doing a bunch of social engineering in order to make those events happen.

Since the heavenly bodies you're manipulating are lightyears away this maybe also gets you FTL communication?

** Every time you hold your breath you have the choice of mentally triggering a state of altered consciousness where time seems to slow down massively, to the point it almost seems still (think SuperHot). You can only sustain this state for as long as you can hold your breath, so it can be held longer if you've trained in holding your breath. Once you've hit your maximum time you lose the state and breathe out in a normal manner, so no exhaling really loudly once it's over. However, you do feel the fatigue in your lungs, so another round of Bullet Time will last a shorter period or it'll take a while to work up to another maximal length Bullet Time period.

During this state the only thing you can move is your eyeballs. You're not able to move your limbs because your nerve signals travel slowly enough as to be still during this state. You can however "queue" up actions to do after the state ends. Once the state ends, all the actions you queued up happen at the same time (since essentially all the nerve signals are getting sent at the same time). Your accuracy isn't great when doing this, but practicing the same movement a lot will let you queue up complicated movements which will happen with good accuracy (like being able to shoot an arrow close to the bullseye each time).

*** The obvious exploit is just using the bullet time to complete mental tasks, whether its math homework or crime solving or novel writing. So let's analyze what can be done with the 'queue'ing up power.

I suspect this can be used to be a legendary baseball batter. Hold your breath the moment the pitcher throws, analyze exactly what kind of ball is being thrown and its target location, then queue up a home run swing that hits that location and release your breath at the exact moment you need to swing. Since the strike zone for a baseball is relatively small, you should be able to heavily practice a separate home run swing for each and every location the ball could land in, and so queue up the complicated movements necessary with good accuracy. Considering how much money the really good team sports players make, this is probably the most lucrative option.

(It isn't the most lucrative sport, but the others like soccer, golf, etc. all tend to require far more complicated movements, so there is no way you can practice them all. I think it also makes more money than single-person sports like Archery, but to be honest I have not researched this in depth.)

** A modern person is reborn as a monarch in a feudal society. Ignoring specific issues caused by local politics, how should this person go about reforming the system into a democratic one?

Note, I am not asking if this is actually a good idea. This person has set out to do this and can't be persuaded. I'm just curious to know in a general sense what people think the best way to go about such an undertaking is.

*** Honestly the best way to do this is to bootstrap your own military state using your knowledge of future technology, take over the original society, and forcibly implement democracy.

I guess you could also invent mass communications technology and try to start a grassroots uprising, but that's way harder.

** I'm not sure exactly how to word this, but the power is being able to move gravity's effect on you to any part of your body. You cannot reduce or increase the effect of gravity upon yourself, it is dependent on your mass.

This means that a downward kick or other hits would have your entire weight behind it.

You can put the weight into the bottom of your feet and be really hard to knock down.

Additional/supplementary: Your body is capable of withstanding the stresses of doing this, whether it's shifting blood pressure or just your body weight pressing on a single finger.

You cannot focus it so much that you get a black hole

*** I feel like I don't know enough physics to discuss this... But would this affect inertia as well? Like, I focus all my weight in my fist to punch someone. Before I can, they kick my leg. Does my entire body spin wildly around my fist like a tetherball around a pole?

*** This would make you an amazing fighter if you get a lot of practice. A whole lot of combat is about your center of gravity. It influences how you can move and dodge, and how opponents could pin or throw you about. Your power lets you literally shift your center of gravity wherever you wish, which is just plain crazy.

That's not so useful in a modern society with guns though.

​

So let's check something else! Which gravity does your power affect, exactly? We feel the gravity of the Earth most strongly, but the Moon's gravity also affects us since that's how it makes tides. So... when the moon is in the sky, can you transfer all Earth gravity to one part of your body, and transfer all moon gravity to another part, and watch the second part just float upwards towards the moon?

​

But now, what happens if your body is split in two? For less gore, imagine its just you cutting your hair. You shift Earth gravity away from your hair, and moon gravity towards it, then cut it off. Does your hair now continue to ignore Earth gravity and fly towards the Moon? Can you repeatedly grow and cut your hair in the same manner to generate a lot of pseudo-anti-gravity material that floats upwards towards the moon, allowing you to make hovercraft-esque objects or even cheaper rockets, albeit ones that only work while the moon is overhead?

*** You can fly with this. Move all gravity to your head and jump with your weightless legs. Your head goes down, your legs go up. When your legs are on top, move all gravity to your feet. Your head maintains its (lateral) velocity while your feet accelerate down, pushing your head up. Repeat every time you swap end over end. And... probably do this by holding your arms out and spinning instead of going end over end, to make it easier to do this without vomiting.

It's a little wonky without the effect changing your center of mass, and I'm not even sure if changing gravity without changing mass is well-defined. But regardless of how that works out, moving the effects of gravity higher on your body means increasing your potential energy, and gravity will convert that to kinetic energy, so however it works you're still accelerating.

**** I think this falls into the same problem as most of the "troll physics" memes. The sum of the forces acting on you is still going to be the mass*acceleration for your center of mass. You can change how you spin in midair, but your center of mass will still be following a parabolic arc.

***** Troll physics can generally be discounted because it violates conservation of momentum or energy, but that doesn't apply here since the power itself can increase gravitational potential energy out of nowhere.

****** Ah, that's a good point. For some reason, I keep thinking of the gravitational field as being conservative, even when there are weird and wonky changes being made to it.
