** Berserk seems a nice fit. No stupidity, and the baddies are flawed in the normal ways that humans are flawed, albeit often dialled up.

It has very little angst. The main character, who receives more than most protagonists' share of darkness, responds by growing harder and colder. The world is also very rich in reasons to despair. It's got Lovecraftian levels of demonic entities that have the power to harm mankind, but unlike Lovecraft the demons of Berserk care very much indeed about humanity, and think we are delicious. The series is made all the better, I think, because it's not /always/ dark. Something like 25% of it is pretty standard heartwarming comradery and positive character development and adventures as you grow to love the main cast. Then the darkness sets in, and you think to yourself, "they wouldn't /actually/ go through with this," and then they do.

It's available in cheaply animated anime or in well drawn manga. I recommend the manga, but the anime has the advantage of not spoiling the end of the best arc before it even begins. Both are easily obtainable online.

I didn't really like RWBY's first episode when I watched it so I've seen pretty much none of the episodes and still +was completely addicted to+ liked the story. I can't say for sure but from reading the fanfic it sounds like RWBY is a pretty generic monsters vs people cartoon and anything that is specific to RWBY seems to have been explained in the fic adequately.

***** Fine Structure is really, really rough - it's got a lot of good stuff, but that good stuff is buried in a lot of stuff that is much less good.

It feels like the author was experimenting a lot with the story structure, and got decidedly mixed results - it's a lot less linear and straightforward than Ra was (and Ra itself was not exactly the most linearly written story of all time...). Also, the characters are even weaker than Ra's decidedly skeletal cast.

If you didn't find Ra compelling or interesting, I think it's probably unlikely you'll like Fine Strucuture either... unless your problems with Ra was that it was too character driven and too linear, I guess?

***** [[https://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]] is great. The first chapter isn't representative of the book, so skip it if you don't like the pseudo-psychedelic lyricism, but come back it after you finish, because then it'll make perfect sense.

Compared to Ra, I found it much more engrossing (i.e. I didn't pick it up/put it down every month or so out of sheer lack of sufficient interest). The synopsis on the page I linked isn't /quite/ accurate, since it's a common complaint that the powers-of-two superhero plotline just sorta petered out in favor of /real/ plot (which I can't describe because my memory is bad enough I couldn't tell if it'd be a spoiler or not).

I've heard it said that people usually don't know why they like/dislike things, so if you ask them they'll just make stuff up. I liked FS. I think it'll be one of greatest pieces of web fiction when qntm gets around to ironing out the kinks. I'd say give it shot.

** [[http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2012/02/reviews/review-prince-of-thorns-by-mark-lawrence/][Prince of Thorns]] is /gorgeously/ dark, set in a post-apocalyptic world in which Doomsday was the rendering of reality magical. It follows a precocious -(but not so much so as HPJEV, and with in-universe reason)- 13 yearold who initially seems to have psychopathy to rival HPMOR!Quirrel's apathy. Character's actions are always their own (or, if pawns, their unseen master's) and never the plot's, the amorality of the setting is altogether its own achievement, the protagonist wins only insofar as his resources merit (though sometimes these resources are hidden from the reader until after their relevance is revealed, and not every apparent win is real). I haven't seen the Rationalist community's take on it, but I think it fits the bill at least as well as any other non-Rationalist derived works and on top of that is, well, /gorgeous/.

Oh, and fun trivia: Its author, [[/u/MarkLawrence]], has a background in pure mathematics (PhD in Several Complex Variables) and [[http://www.marklawrence.buzz/about-the-author/][worked in AI]]. Come to think of it, I'm surprised I haven't seen his work mentioned here before.

** I heartily recommend the First Law trilogy and the four books in the same universe that follow it. It's fantasy with some magic, and it's rational in that battles are bloody and people die in them, villains have motivations from selfishness to really shady values, politics happen behind the scenes and mostly it centers on the characters and their struggles to change or to find meaning in their lives. It's written by someone who studied psychology and I find that it's mostly psychologically realistic, but I found nothing particularly irrational in other aspects. But most characters are very interesting and pretty much all of them are tragic in their own way.

***** You are confusing the model with reality.

"For all Y: (Y is X) ^ (Y is not X)" is a tautology, /in the model/.

If the predicate 'major darkness and sadness' carved reality at the joints, then you'd be right to say everything either satifies it, or doesn't. But asserting that your language is isomorphic the ontological structure of reality itself is not at all trivial.

The heap problem -- one thing isn't a heap, neither is two, so at what point does some amount of thing become a heap -- is the most common example of this disconnect. 'Heap' is a map. "Amount of things" is also the map, but it's closer to the territory than the binary 'is a heap'/'is not'.

Please note: I am not making any object-level statements here. /Maybe/ 'major darkness or sadness' is a predicate that cleanly slices the set of rational stories. Maybe it isn't. But the general form of your statement "I model objects of this class as having certain properties -- therefore all objects I'd recognise as a member of this class meaningfully instantiate those properties" is simple map/terrain confusion.

Think of the statement [[http://blog.kenperlin.com/?p=2068]["Gravity drowned"]]. Ask if it's true or false -- obviously false. But it's false in a different way than "the sky is green" is false. "The sky is green" /could/ be true tomorrow. "Gravity drowned" is false and it could never be true, because gravity isn't the /type/ of thing to drown. It's /ontologically ridiculous/ -- a category error.

Generally speaking, everything is probably ontologically ridiculous, because language =/= ontology.

That's all I'm saying
