** All I can say for now without revealing plot details is that it's worth sticking through till the end just because of the sheer world building and resource utilisation.

Side note: If I'm correctly modeling your response, anything that makes you feel this way is a rare treat my friend.

*** I love that "if I'm correctly modeling your response" is a synonym for "if I gotchu" in this community.

** You should continue. I remember almost quitting at the same point as well, but it gets a lot better in the next book. I can't say much more without spoiling it for you.

*** I downloaded all three to my phone and then forgot about them for several months. Because my ebooks were sorted alphabetically, I started with Flashes accidentally, and assumed it was first. Boy, was I in for a spoiler-filled time! After I finished it, I went back and read Luminosity and Radiance in order, then returned to re-read Flashes. I got a lot more out of it the second time!

*** /u/ _vargas_ is a prolific reddit troll who tells long stories that start off believable but get progressively more outlandish (and often disgusting) the further you read.

He's perhaps one of my favorite reddit novelty accounts because he's pretty creative and knows how to tell an engaging tale. I enjoy how invested I get in his comments before realizing it's complete BS when things go off the rails.

He's also a mod of [[/r/shittyaskscience]]

** #+begin_quote
  Does Radiance resolve the story in a happy way?
#+end_quote

Definitely. You actually don't understand the end of Luminosity yet. Once you have read Radiance, then you will understand it.

Also, wave goodbye to canon, because Radiance is in all-new territory. There's even a new narrator; it shifts to Elspeth's point of view.

If you really can't keep going without knowing more, then most of the vampires are just disassembled and imprisoned so that a witch can channel their powers, not dead.

** Radiance is great, I would definitely recommend it to you even knowing that luminosity's ending hit you hard. Do note that Radiance has two sequels; it's followed by either Effulgence or Silmaril, even if it can be read without either one

** You're not alone, I took a breather after Luminosity too. I recommend reading Radiance.

Spoilers for after you finish it, I actually think it over-corrected and I didn't feel that Radiance's ending was quite earned, specifically the memory-blast-reviving. Still a great read though.

** As I recall, Radiance ended happily, but not 100% happily. And in some ways things get worse before they get better.

Well, of course :). It wouldn't be much of a plot if there were no new tension.
