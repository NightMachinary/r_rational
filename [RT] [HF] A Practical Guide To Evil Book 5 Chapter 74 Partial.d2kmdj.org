**** Stabbing a mysterious friendly stranger merely for being a mysterious friendly stranger would have huge narrative consequences especially when she's here for a peace conference. Especially when this kind of plot can easily branch into a friendship instead of enmity.

Remember, though, that Cat talks to many people, it's just they're not important enough to mention in the plot, so she isn't always immediately suspicious though she probably started to wonder a bit as the conversation went on.

Plus, this is sort of a unique situation in that /Catherine/ is actually the mysterious stranger here even more than he is - he's just working on the farm, she's the mysterious stranger who wanders in. They just fit the mysterious stranger role for each other, simultaneously.

** Dumb question: do we know what the White Knight actually does? First, is it a given that Hanno's coin expresses the will of the Choir of Judgment?

If so, what are the criteria used by the Choir? Is it simply "destroy that which is more Evil than Good?" Because I have no clue what that means in practical terms. If we don't know, does Hanno know?

This bears heavily on just how insane Hanno is, and therefore whether I can support this ship.

...it would be amazing if the Choir of Judgment simply doesn't care about arbitrary killing, and the only special thing about Hanno's coin is that he trusts its determinations.

*** Given the way Judgment smote Black and almost killed him when he interrupted Hanno's coin-flipping Aspect (with Bard calling it a "formulaic Aspect" when gloating afterwards), and Hanno immediately realizing that Cordelia was coming into a Name when she grabbed it out of the air, and how it burned her hand when she rejected that Name, it seems pretty clear that it is actually Judgment making the calls on how the coin comes down, and they have substantial leeway in what they can do to show Hanno the result. I'm not clear what other effects it has; presumably, it has some combat application beyond baiting savvy opponents into pissing off a heavyweight Choir (I believe earlier in the story, it was suggested that Mercy and Judgment were two of the most powerful/influential Choirs, with Contrition being mid-tier and Endurance [who had the random hero Cat killed at the start of book 4] being one of the weaker ones), but we haven't seen what that application is.

That said, one of Hanno's big things from his introduction way back when was accepting that he wasn't capable of determining what justice was, and neither was any other mortal, and so his best option was accepting the will of the Choir of Judgment, who have way more information than any mortal. He doesn't try to necessarily understand their criteria; we've seen Judgment spare people in the midst of committing crimes, and condemn people who don't appear to currently be doing anything evil, so the implication is that they take more than current conduct into account, but by and large they seem to condemn those who are evil and spare those who are good, so it probably maps roughly onto the Above/Below dichotomy.

However, it seems like one of the fundamental differences between Choirs and good mortals is that the Choirs exemplify their respective virtue to such extremes that its occasionally hard to recognize it as being good, partly because of the lack of other virtues to give them context and limits in how they act. Contrition didn't care at all about the good people had done, or the net results of its actions, only rejecting individual's own evil in as dramatic and final a way as possible. Mercy is utilitarian to the point of occasionally mirroring evil in is ruthlessness (see the debate around Grey's use of a magic disease to slaughter Black's force, at the cost of killing many innocent Procerans). Presumably, Judgment is similarly one-track to an occasionally abhorrent extreme. Some hints we've seen of that include the rejection of any mortal ability to be just, and hence mortal laws, and the extreme dichotomy of Hanno's response to evil; death or no punishment whatsoever seem to be the only two options. I imagine we'll get a moment where the extremes of the nature of Judgment are laid bare, at some point relatively soon, because we got one for Contrition and Mercy, the only other two Choirs to have a major story role.

*** The fascinating yet infuriating thing about the Choir of Judgment is that their function is so complex that mortals rarely judge /rightly/. I suspect you're right about killing, at least from a sentimental point of view. Mercy is about caring; Judgment is about correctness.

The best description I've seen about Hanno's function is that he doesn't judge - but he determine's when the Choir's judgment is needed.

I have issues with that philosophy. I don't doubt Hanno and the choir hold to that notion, but I'm curious to see what happens when Cat/Pilgrim point out that by choosing who to judge Hanno's judgement is still a major factor in outcome.

Also, I really want to see a pissing match between Mercy and Judgement. I'm pretty confident it'll happen even if it's not over Cat.

That's not the worst of it. The problem isn't outsourcing the function of passing judgement to the Choir, but in also deferring to the rules by which they make that judgement.

We know the principles on which the choirs operate are inscrutable to mortals. They /might/ very competently judge, using inscrutable angel rules, that a three-day-old infant should die. Hanno's insanity is that he wouldn't question or argue or hesitate at all. Judgement was rendered.

The way in which Hanno attempts to overcome this is to only enable the Choir to pass judgment on the cases he selects for them. But that's just welding the two flawed processes together. How can Hanno identify the cases that need divine judgment, especially if he doesn't know the rules divine judgment follows? Is he bringing the right cases before the right court?

Best case scenario: Hanno understands and agrees with whatever the Choir's criteria are, and they're preforming a purely functional task (weighing the sin of the subject).

Worst case scenario: Hanno /thinks/ he understands and agrees with the Choir's criteria, and that they're preforming a purely functional task, etc. etc.

Paranoid rationalist scenario: The Choir's rule is "pass the judgment that will result in the greatest degree of confidence by mortals that a just decision was made."
