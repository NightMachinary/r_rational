[[https://conquestofavalon.wordpress.com/2021/01/18/fernan-i-the-scout/][A story of intrigue, magic, and piracy, it begins in the wake of a brutal war, following the generation raised in its aftermath.]]

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Seventeen years past, the Kingdom of Avalon invaded the Empire of the Fox from across the sea and conquered its capital, Malin, sending its rulers fleeing to the city of Guerron. The strange new technologies of the distant kingdom triumphed even over the power of the spirits, killing the Fox King and thousands along with him.

  Though time has brought with it peace, resentments have only grown in the wake of this War of the Foxtrap. Refugees defiantly dream of the day they can retake their homeland as nobles plot behind closed doors, even knowing it would mean another war. Until then, those of Guerron must put forward a friendly face, plying Avalon with tribute and trade, lest the Kingdom resume its ambitions of conquest.

Currently about sixty thousand words in, with twice weekly updates on Mondays and Fridays.

I've lurked on this subreddit for a long time, but I didn't consider posting CoA here until it was recommended in one of the weekly threads. While those have looser standards than top-level posts, it made me check the sidebar again and realize that it could actually qualify.

Specifically, with its ensemble cast and focus on specific and divergent character motivations, the story revolves heavily around:

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Additionally, I've put a great deal of work into maintaining consistent and rational worldbuilding. In fact, I built the world and magic system before I even started the story, with the intent of it cohering logically in the way many people on this subreddit look for in their stories. I believe this allows it to qualify under this point:

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

Accordingly, I believe it counts as rational (not rationalist), and might be of interest to the community here, even if it doesn't necessarily seem like an immediately obvious fit. Conflicting agendas and plotting is a major focus, with everyone involved aspiring to think logically and maneuver to the best of their ability, even if personal unconscious biases and blindspots do come into play. No idiot balls or deus ex machinae here.

** I just caught up and it seems solid. I am a little worried about whether it can manage to keep a good pace given the web serial format and the many main characters. But we'll see

*** Cool!

It's a fair concern, given the format. My main technique to address it is fairly copious outlining to ensure the story doesn't get sidetracked or drag. Basically everything from now until the end of Book 1 is planned out, and Books 2 through whatever will receive similar levels of planning as they go. Hopefully that will prove sufficient.
