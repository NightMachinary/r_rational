** Using everyday examples, this video explains why to adopt Occam's razor both in day-to-day reasoning and in science. After presenting the historical justification, found in thinkers prior to the 20th century, it present an empirical and mathematical justification of this philosophical heuristic. I think the idea of Occam's razor is extremely important right now, as uncritcally accepted false information about the ongoing pandemic makes people do stupid things out there.
