I've just noticed that "[[https://www.audible.com/pd/I-Am-a-Strange-Loop-Audiobook/B07HJ9NHHM][I Am a Strange Loop]]" (a more straightforward and understandable version of GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach) and "[[https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Elephant-in-the-Brain-Audiobook/1541446216][The Elephant in the Brain]]" by Robin Hanson (author of [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/][Overcoming Bias]] blog) are now released as audiobooks. I figured you guys would want to know about that, if you like me prefer listening to reading. Also, in case you didn't know, [[https://www.audible.com/pd/Rationality-From-AI-to-Zombies-Audiobook/B076ZY6Y9C][Rationality: From AI to Zombies]] is an audiobook as well.


** I can't imagine trying to read a Hofstadter book by audio rather than having it written down in front of me, but I'm glad it exists.

*** For harder to read stuff I like using both at the same time.

** I do find dense material easier to get through in audiobook form, I'll check them out, thanks.

A few more recommendations:

There is a starslatecodex podcast, with quite a good narroator. I found it much easier to get through than the written posts.

Superintelligence by Bostrom was also quite a good audiobook.

There are two recordings of Rationality from AI to Zombies available, read by differen't people. I much prefer from-ai-to-zombies.eu because it sounds like they are having fun, so you might want to check out both and see which you prefer.

** Thanks! I was hoping that "The Elephant in the Brain" specifically would come out as an audiobook, this is great news!
