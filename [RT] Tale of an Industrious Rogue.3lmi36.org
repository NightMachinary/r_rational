** While I'm not quite sure this would be considered strictly rational, this is one of the most fun D&D stores I've ever read.

*** /tg/ has a bounty of great stories. There was one very long saga I remember about a group of Earth humans dropped into a typical D&D setting, and they try to keep themselves together as a group and survive. I remember there was a bit of a focus on warring technology; that was where I first learned about the strategic benefits of mounted soldiers.

**** If I'm not grabbed by entry 72, am I likely to get grabbed by the rest of the story? So far the prose is dry and the story uninspired. Does it pick up?

The wiki entry says 'and then it gets awesome', have I passed that point or is it still to come?

***** I read the whole thing. It's pretty okay, nothing amazing and it stretches disbelief by the end. The beginning is the strongest part, so if you aren't grabbed by entry 72 it's probably not worth continuing.

*** It is indeed fantastically entertaining, to be sure.

At the very least, I would call it at least somewhat rational, as they decided to go munchkinning for enormous profits.

** I did something like this once. I built a fighter that did enough damage per round to tunnel through normal materials at speed, according to the hit-points-per-inch-of-thickness tables in the DMG, and then started bypassing dungeons by going through walls and around fortifications. Eventually my DM got sufficiently annoyed that he declared that the wizard's tower that was the next dungeon had walls of solid adamantine. Mistake. Adamantine has a price-per-pound. It's a /big/ price-per-pound. I funded basically the rest of the campaign by selling off chunks of that tower.

** I have to admit when I read the title, I thought of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes][roguelikes]]. Has anyone posted on [[/r/rational]] about them before? IMO, the best games in the genre (DCSS, Brogue) are some of the best games full stop, at demanding thought out action, rewarding relentlessly rational behaviour and punishing irrational behaviour.
