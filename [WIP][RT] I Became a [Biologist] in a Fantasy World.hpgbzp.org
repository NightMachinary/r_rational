Recently I've stumbled upon this fresh rational isekai that you may find interesting, it's about a scientist working on his PhD, who by mistake(?) gets transported into a fantasy world where he starts researching local fauna and trying to understand how magic and biology work there. The story is a bit biology heavy, and I admit I don't understand 50% of what's being said, but it sounds plausible. So far there's not much plot, just The MC doing his research and applying it to create new things. There's also some meta-awarness of Isekai tropes, that the MC tries to avoid.

*** The story is great! I really love the idea of biology in an isekai fantasy world (particularly taxonomy and phylogeny). The characterization, world-building, and style is also very well done. It sets the perfect stage for a journey of experimentation and discovery.

I do have one criticism, though. And while it only covers a small portion of the story so far, I think it severely harms the quality of the story.

Eric treats vaccines like a one-size-fits-all solution to smallpox despite it being a primarily preventative measure. It was seriously off-putting to see Eric deal with smallpox with the certainty that he could simply treat it with a vaccine. His treatment of Arlett was like intervening in the middle of a war by sending the losing side readily-identifiable copies of enemy drones, then expecting them to manufacture and fight them off with dedicated weapons, all before the the land gets damaged beyond recovery. Not exactly a reliable strategy, right?

I know that there is some evidence that certain vaccines can hasten the production of antibodies, but medical treatment is much more complicated that that and neglecting the curative side of medicine will only stunt future plot developments. I would suggest adding a magical component to the strain of smallpox Eric encounters that allows it to hide from the immune system to some degree. That would make the way he cures it more straightforward and also explain Healers being helpless against it.

**** I went and looked this up after reading the chapter, and as far as I can tell giving the vaccine early on in the infection, as has been done here, is believed to reduce the severity of the symptoms of the disease. And as far as I can tell, there are no known treatments for smallpox, so Eric doesn't really have any curative options.

Of course, I'm not a biologist, so I could be completely wrong about this.

*** Try not simplify it, explain it simpler sure but people are attracted to these sorts of stories by curiosity in part I think. I prefer not to understand something than to not have something new to understand.

*** i just started reading it and think the whole time "dang this needs a webcomic version with more biology explanation for noobs like me who know nothing" and i'm also having the urge to do fanart, but couldn't find any pictures at all on google how to imagine the char and slime-bro :( but i'm still at the very beginning of the novel, so back to reading with me XD

  Had a bit of feedback about the biology being very dense, I'll try and have him simplify it when explaining it to someone, although some of the technicalities might be a bit tough to get through (mostly because I suck at ELI5), especially for the more molecular side of things.

Out of curiosity (and not to sound like an asshole), but you're not actually an immunologist IRL, right (i.e., this isn't a /self-insert/ isekai)? Some of the biology sounded a little... funny -- not necessarily /wrong/ -- mostly just described oddly (on the evolutionary end, which is where I've more expertise, but also confirmed by my partner, who knows her wet bench / cell biology / physiology / immunology). Looking through your previous comments it sounds like you'd be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72eiqy/how_are_studies_on_rat_behaviour_applicable_on/dniwids/][finishing an undergrad degree]] in some relevant field right about now, which would explain it, unless your account is shared with somebody else?

Otherwise finding the story quite entertaining!

** That premise reminds me of the manga [[https://mangadex.org/title/26079/heterogeneous-linguistics][Heterogeneous Linguistics]]. It's about a linguist studying the nonhuman languages, though it really ends up being more anthropology, and the biology of the nonhuman races is interesting too.

** Looks good, thanks for the recommendation.

One thing though, I do hope that authors would stop refering 'liking isekai genre' as something undesireable. Maybe this is just me but recently I found a trend in novels which the protagonist self deprecating themself just because they read isekai stories.

** I really enjoyed this. I just wish there were more chapters. I also absolutely agree it's biology heavy. Thanks for sharing it!

** This is fun, even if my eyes mostly glaze over the jargon. It could use a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson][Watson character]] from the very first chapter, so that the protag has to explain everything he's doing in ELI5 terms. Still, the story is fun even with that caveat.

** I really like it so far!

Eric creating fire bombs is hilarious to me because I am about ten sessions into a GURPS isekai TTRPG, and my PC, a computer scientist/rationalist/prepper named Gwen, and another PC in my party, a mad scientist/tinker named Ivan, just made a bunch of chlorine gas mortar shells and sawdust bombs to protect our nerdy hides from hostile undead. (Gwen is freaking out about the implications of introducing war crimes to this fantasy world and how it will impact her technological uplift plans. Meanwhile Ivan is innovating further on his explosives options and possibly making an armored tank.)

There is just something about scientists isekai'd into fantasy settings that inevitably leads to explosives.
