** "...and then I'm going to consult with Hermoine on something I'm going to do." /oh shit/

I am reminded of phrases from some remarkably iron-willed characters from someplace else entirely: "The situation as it stands is untenable." and "Don't do that, because then I'll have to kill you, and then you'll be dead."

** Interesting. I am surprised by how little discussion this gets, here. I wonder how much of it is due to the fact that it's just more alive on [[/r/aih][r/aih]], versus how much that at this point, the story is less overtly rational (just as HPMOR was less overtly rational towards its end, and much more about plot; this was not a subtle criticism).

*** This is also a direct link to a discussion on the topic in a more active subreddit, as it always is. If you have something to discuss on the topic, why would you post on it here rather than in the much more active comment section directly linked from here?
