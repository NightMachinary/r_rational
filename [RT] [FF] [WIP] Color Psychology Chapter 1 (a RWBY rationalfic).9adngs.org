** [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] posted a thread recently asking if there were any RWBY rational fics. As far as I know there aren't really, which is a shame because the world has so many interesting tropes to try and systematize.

I felt this couldn't be allowed to continue, so I'm going to take a stab at it.

EDIT: apparently I'm an idiot and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12466638/1/Broken-Blades]] already exists :P

** Nice start, I'd really like to see how is it going to continue. A few questions:

1. Is it going to be focusing only on Ruby's POV? Are other characters going to be more rational then in canon? How much will they depart from the canon?
2. Is Ruby somewhat autistic? At least that was my impression based on how much conscious effort it took for her to interpret social signs. Plus some stuff she says is a bit cringeworthy, hard to imagine her talking like that to her own sister.

*** Thanks!

1.a. Most of it is going to be in close third person from Ruby's point of view, with occasional interludes from the perspective of other characters. I'm still unsure whether these interludes will be in close third person like Ruby's parts, or in far third person. I'm also unsure whether they'd be better as standalone chapters or short addendums at the end of chapters.

1.b. All the characters are getting sizable upgrades to their mental skills, but not all of them are going to be more rational. (I'm not even sure I'd describe Ruby as all that rational at this point in the story.) One of the things I'm hoping to do is have different characters embody specific intellectual virtues, which Ruby will learn from and integrate into her own thinking.

2.a. She's based at least in part on several slightly-aspie engineers I've known over the years. I hope it didn't come off too strong; she's supposed to be a little oblivious to the other people in a conversation, but not necessarily outright unpleasant to talk to.

**** I think that came across really well - especially the way you presented the way she was working through it, that made her feel extremely sympathetic. Also, Jaune just felt like a super kind, reasonable if na√Øve guy with decent interpersonal skills rather than the fladerized klutz he's often portrayed as. That's refreshing.

Also, a defense of the chestplate - for hunters, mobility is everything, and fighting grimm, most of which are giant monsters, you're going to be defending against a lot of strikes coming from the top down. In that case, it's possible that armor is really only valuable when it mitigates aura drain - and something that prevents broken ribs and damage to heart and lungs mechanically without interfering with flexibility the way a full breastplate might could actually be a valid strategy.

That said, that's just an ad hoc rationalization of a character design that is primarily aesthetic, sooo take with a grain of salt.

** Hey... that's pretty good!

Ruby is, so far, simply adorable.

I wonder what happens if Ruby tries to /talk/ while under semblance. What would others hear? And speaking of semblance, I guess you are removing the rose petals effect, given that it wasn't mentioned here (and it being something that Jaune is likely to mention).

My personal favourite, so far, of RWBY fanfics is /Hazredous' Interruptions/, a cross with Nanoha. It's not really a rational fic tho, I would say that it's in the sister genre of "competence porn" fics. But I also just like fics that make the grimdark settings lighter.

I have something planned for the petals, but yeah, Ruby doesn't produce petals every time she speeds up in this universe.

** Great prose, and really nice synergy between her hyperactivity and the sort of constantly thinking mindset you want a smart character to project and her semblance. I'm not a big fan of the source material, particularly beyond the 3rd season, but if you take the danger of the world more seriously than the authors I think this could be extremely good.

*** One of the things I think is really fun about rational fics is taking absurd or nonsensical plot points from the original work, and trying to figure out how to build a similar world with a couple of small changes which make that plot point reasonable.

I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that I gave Jaune's situation a lot of thought.

*** I thought Ozpin knew that Jaune hasn't unlocked his aura and was not trained, so he had some ulterior motifs in admitting Jaune into Beacon. However, I don't think that was ever mentioned in the show, and it was my overall impression, and it was mentioned in several fics.

***** I always looked at it like it was a plot by Dumbledore from HPMoR- one small part of his success was that Dumbledore made convoluted, far-fetched plots that were unlikely to succeed... and he made lots of them and hoped that some would come to fruition.

So Jaune could have been a long shot, with the downside being that there's one fewer idiot in the world.

******* What makes you think he would've let him die? Ozpin is purported to have lots of observational skills and knowledge, if he monitored the situation and saw that Jaun was in danger, he simply intervenes at that point. But he's going to be saved, there's no need to do so.

** This is really fun. I'm very excited to read a rational RWBY fic, given that I'm such a huge fan of the series.

I am wondering though, how much will her normal teammates feature? The character list shows Ruby, Jaune, and Ozpin, which might imply that her team will be secondary characters at best?

The main characters will all be important characters from the show. I want there to be a little bit of suspense around what Ruby's team ends up being; I'll update the character list once it's nailed down in-Universe.

*** I'd recommend to watch the first 3 seasons of RWBY. It isn't a bit time investment, as there are ~12 episodes per season, episodes are short, especially in season 1. It's cringey at times, but very lighthearted most of the times, many characters are good, many battles are cool. I'd watch just for the fight in the Emerald Forest in the middle of the 1st season.
