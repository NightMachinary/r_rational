** Fantastic so far, no idiot balls, no incompetent people, no conflict ball, a bit strong on mutual understanding but still excellent in terms of culture to culture contact.

I think this can be qualified as a bit of [MK], for mass producing and chemical compound combination. AND HOLY SHIT a character that immediately assumes the low power of material reconfiguration to be a superpowered weapon, FUCK YES VIGILANCE.

And maybe a little bit of [RST] for teacher that is always i nlesson mode.

Kiba seems to like contact stories.
