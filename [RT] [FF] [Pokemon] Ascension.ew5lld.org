This project started as a way to explore why the pokemon world behaved the way it did. After a lot of discussion, we ended up with our own interpretation of the verse. We delve into typings, moves, physiology, and history to craft this Pokemon AU. Elements from both the Game and Anime have been incorporated.

We have currently finished writing the first Arc, which includes quite a bit of lore and sets up several pieces for how we wish the take the story forward.

*Summary:* Red had always loved dragons. He wanted them. He dreamed of them. He desperately awaited the day he'd get a Charmander, something that would one day reign as a mighty Charizard. Unfortunately, he ends up with something quite different. Something cute. Something... cuddly. In a world where size is power and innocence is weakness, it will take everything he has to survive. AU.

*Tags:* Action | Adventure | Horror | Humour | Slowburn

*Warnings:* Violence | Dark Themes | Strong Language

*** Two authors. The Blackstaff and NightMarE. I should probably have made that clearer.

** I'm enjoying this so far, and it does seem broadly rational. It would be better if it weren't hosting on ff.net though, Ao3, SV or any of the other places would make it a much more pleasant experience to read.

** Oh yeah i was reading this on spacebattles and really enjoyed the portrayal of the pokemon both as intelligent and being their own characters to an interesting degree. Do you have an estimate on how long it'll take you guys to get to posting the second arc?

** If you're okay with some constructive criticism it starts out a bit heavy on the exposition/infodumping. Obviously there's facts about the AU you want to get across early, but launching straight into a biography of professor oak is going to put some people off. Same with the dialogue with Ash and oak, a bit maid and butlery. On the positive side I like the world building itself, but I just think it could be integrated better

*** We know. We make some of these mistakes especially early on. Though after the first chapter, there is actually not too much. Criticism is always helpful. Thank you.

** Interesting. I liked the nods to starters from other fics.

That said, not a fan of all the pokémon Sapience that is going around, nor of this cockamanie plan of Red's to let his Pokémon do the fighting by themselves

*** Really? I've always thought of pokemon as sapient from when I first played the games/watched the anime. Granted, I was a kid then, but I always figured it was cannon especially after the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games.

**** Traditionally, rational fics play them as closer to...well animalistic as far as intelligence goes. No complex thought chains like what we have here.

** Fuck man! This is amazing! Just finished Act 1, and damn! Like, this is the best stuff I've read since Worm! My only complaint is that I got nothing done this weekend because I couldn't put this down! Keep up the good work, because when this ends I will mourn the characters.

already am the Feraligatr, and misty, and maybe Red, although I doubt you'd kill off the main character so quickly... unless Mawile's the real main character.

EDIT: Also, any estimates for when the next arc will be released?

**** I know. I read them, but I kind of wish I hadn't read Act 2 Ch 1, because now I didn't stop during a natural ending, and I really want to know what happens next. Typically I'd just read more, but now I can't!

Do y'all know when the rest of act 2 will be done?
