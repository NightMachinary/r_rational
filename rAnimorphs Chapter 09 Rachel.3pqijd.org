** Wow. Pressure turned up to 11. I feel kind of funny because, I mentioned in a past comment how interesting I found Jake's leadership, a result of what seems to be a very astute subconscious. [[#s][]]

** Hiding behind a hologram, Rachel could morph now and take out Visser 3. Except Erek won't let her, and presumably he'll stop her if he even thinks she's going to try to hurt him. Would an andalite be fast/strong enough to do it anyway? She could say that she's going to demorph-remorph to escape. I'm guessing not though, canonically Erek took out like twenty Hork-Bajir when he got hold of the crystal.

If there was a loophole in his programming, he would probably (not definitely) know about it and be able to tell her. ("If you tell me that you're just going to threaten him, I can let you get your tail blade up against his neck.")

I'm guessing that if Erek held Visser 3 in that force field for two hours (assuming it can prevent morphing, which isn't clear), that would count as violence?

Hm, how about this: "I need to demorph and remorph to get away. I'd like you to close your eyes while I do. I have secrets I'm not ready to reveal to you." Then morph elephant, and hope Erek isn't powerful enough to stop it.

Why the change from "generate my own kandrona, show a hologram of my yeerk leaving/entering my ear" to "edit the yeerk's memories"? Memory editing seems more out-there to me. Do yeerks in the pool have more ability to communicate than canonically?

*** To your last question: yes. There has been a major change to Yeerk biology and culture that hasn't yet come up in the text. It was done for reasons of sanity/internal consistency/elegance ... it covers MOST of what we know about Yeerks with one simple, powerful explanation, at the cost of changing a few canon details (like this one) that I think are minor in comparison.

**** Whether it's minor or not depends on how much it's considered violence. Since he's able to do it to his own Yeerk, I'd imagine that it isn't, so... determine the range on memory editing, walk over to Visser Three, and make him never remember fighting in the war, killing anyone, or any aggression by Andalites/Yeerk Propaganda. Continue doing so for all other major controllers. Further, offer all of the Chee up as "voluntary hosts" to anyone who is willing to give their hosts their bodies back, edit the host memories to not remember being captives, and end the entire invasion bloodlessly.

Naturally, I assume that the Yeerk memory editing can only be done in-brain by the Chee, rather than remotely, since an invasion still exists.

*** If Erek tries to stop Rachel, she basically has no chance to do anything else. Even an Andalite or bear isn't going to overpower a Chee and I don't think she could outspeed it either.

Although this would be a very convenient time for her to have kept that gun on her. A trigger pull would probably be too fast to stop.

*** Good question. My wife had never read the series and she enjoys it, but then again she's also had to sit through me lecturing on the differences between this and canon, so she's got a bit of a leg up.

*** Hmm, I think it would be fairly enjoyable but with just about all fanfiction, a large part of the enjoyment comes from having enjoyed the previous work and seeing the changes the author makes.

** Bringing the Chee into play so early has an awful lot of possible effects. For example, it seems very plausible to me that Erek may be able to "awaken" Jake as basically a clone of the dead Jake, now missing a few days worth of memories.

** Bringing in the Chee is going to be interesting. Especially since they now want to help stop the Yeerks.

Going to be cool to see where it goes though. The Chee were hyped up to be almost impossible to kill except by Howlers. Their non violence programming could either be a big problem, or not that big at all. I'm assuming they aren't going to able to kill the Yeerks by any means, but they will probably be a good font of intelligence and will probably fix whatever is up with Jake. Both of those are several degrees removed from actively hurting anything.
