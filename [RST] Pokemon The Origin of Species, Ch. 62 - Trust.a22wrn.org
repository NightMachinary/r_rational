** Spectacular as always, especially for Leaf's character. I'm so relieved that she's acknowledging the mistakes she made in ch. 58, and learning things about herself in the process. Her realization that she /needed/ to sac something during the fight, and that something needed to be a less "important" pokemon...ouch. That's already a tough decision to make, and I can't imagine how disgusted Leaf is going to be with herself later. I hope Red can help her through it.

Speaking of which, poor Red, as always. I hope he can get into the hospital with all limbs intact so he can maybe try and not get horribly traumatized by how far he's pushing his powers + the fact that I'm pretty sure he /felt/ someone die? Same thing with Leaf, jesus christ. I do not envy her for walking into an apartment and finding a dead mother and child. I hope Joy's eye injury can get fixed, but it's chilling that she's out for the rest of the fight, considering how useful Sing is.

** Damn this is such an effectively oppressive atmosphere. What I love most about it is the sense of unceasing attrition, a wound here a death there, like these are Pokemon they spent many chapters acquiring and one by one they are getting cut down, but never all at once. It has a brutal realism to it.

​

Also I was someone who commented on the Red/Leaf cruise chapter that they thought Leaf was coming off like quite a jerk, and I wondered if that was intentional. This seems like some good confirmation that it was, and Leaf is dealing with the need to respect that good people can disagree on things.

​

A prediction I have is that this is going to serve as a fiercely radicalizing chapter for the two of them vis a vis being a trainer. Red in particular had sortof put being a fighter on the backburner, but after this I think they will consider that particular skillset to have a much higher value.

​

If it wasn't for the fact that it would be incredibly boring, I could see Leaf resolving to give up being a trainer after this to become a nurse. With how guilty she seems to feel about not being able to help she may do away with training altogether to pursue a more direct line to her goals. As for Red, I agree that he'll definitely reconsider the value of being able to fight against pokemon, although I don't know if that will lead to him wanting to become a battler any more or less since his methods of fighting tend to rely more on clever thinking and use of the environment than his skillfulness as a trainer. Can't wait to see him mind merge with his future charizard into battle like boss though.

** Seeing the danger that the magnetite posed, humans must spend some effort in either capturing or killing the really powerful Pokemon around their cities and regions. IRL humans are known to kill off lots of large predator populations that pose even a small risk to people in cities or other settlements; when those animals are dramatically more dangerous, the incentive to do the same would only be greater. Imagine if an onix got an equivalent of rabies. It could level a city block before anyone could even be mobilized to fight it. Maybe the rangers do periodic sweeps to capture/kill any of the dangerous evolved Pokemon in an area? This could also help to reduce the danger of Stormbringer rampages, if the average danger of each Pokemon in the stampede is lower.

I don't think the effort would necessarily be worth it for the numerous Pokemon that never get that powerful, like Beedrill or rattatta. But sweeping caves out for larvitar or pupitar before they can become tyranitar could be practical.

There's also a market-like negative feedback loop where trainers are incentivized to go and capture powerful Pokemon where they're most numerous, decreasing the danger and increasing the power a trainer can bring to bear. Years of this system could produce the world we currently see in Origin of Species, where the extremely powerful Pokemon haven't killed off and outcompeted all the weaker one: those really powerful Pokemon get taken out of the gene pool pretty quickly whenever humans set up shop nearby.

Doesn't seem that way. Seems like its the weakest pokemon that would get captured the most, because they're the easiest to do so with. Look at how hard it was for the team to get Absol.

Rangers also seem to be somewhat about wild life preservation, so I don't know how they would feel about doing raids to wipe out certain pokemon. I agree it would be smart, i can imagine groups of trainers going into forests hunting Shiftree sort of like fox hunting

**** From what we've seen of wildlife left to its own devices in this world it seems as though most pokemon tend to work in symbiotic systems (like the pineco's just hanging out with a vespiqueen's nest) so that pokemon culling pokemon tends to stray more towards the rare side. As for humans, I could see some effort being put in to eliminating especially dangerous or erratic pokemon to protect the wildlife and civilizations that would be effected. Although, depending on how much of a burden these pokemon naturally put on their ecosystems, it might be possible that there just aren't enough of them out there to naturally throw things out of balance without some crazy catalyst.

****** Interfering with ecosystems can have wide ranging consequences. There are lots of reasons why you might avoid taking unnecesary action against pokemon species. Taking out the king or queen in a local population could cause the entire local nido population leading to an overabundance of prey species that if riled up could be harder to deal with than the king or queen if riled up while also threatening any species of flora or fauna that they prey on due to overpopulation. Or any species that prey on the nido population are forced to roam further afield or migrate to find food. Or it might be that after taking out the king or queen a 'rina or 'rino quickly evolves to take it's place which would make it too risky to keep putting them down.

I'm not sure this is necessarily true. We follow the perspective of people who have been trainers for less than a year. Trainers who already have a good selection of Pokemon may decide not to go for weaker Pokemon at all, because even though they're easier to catch, it would either take too much effort or not even be possible to train them up to a usable state. Except for people who have a reason to own weak Pokemon like gym leaders, I would expect most trainers with a few years under their belt to skip the easy to catch rattatta for something more powerful or exotic. Time spent training a rattatta or Pidgey up to a usable state is time not spent training something like a Alakazam or Gyrados.

We're also seeing the world after my hypothetical historical changes. Young trainers would have an easier time catching the powerful Pokemon when they were more common, and they would want to catch them because they are stronger.

Then again my original post is just speculation and may be either based on wrong/incomplete data or flawed in some way. There isn't a good way to tell until the author confirms or denies it in or out of story.

But even experienced trainers and rangers were getting messed up by the Absol. I'm not saying that trainers with 5 pages are still going to be catching pidgey, but I do think it would pretty hard for them to catch an Alakazam or a Gyarados. And even then, they are going to end up catching the weaker Alakazam and Gyarados. Because the stronger ones probably won't get caught.

****** Absol is a rather unique pokemon in this setting. The challenge wasn't that experienced trainers couldn't handle something that strong, it's that it has pressure which seems truly crippling, it hinders decision making ability (easily the most important part of the trainers' job) and makes wild pokemon crazy/aggressive.\\
You wouldn't face those issues fighting a Nidoqueen, so as long as you have a sufficiently powerful team you could probably handle it.\\
Also consider the fact that most of these powerful pokemon evolve from things that are much more easily caught, so there should be veteran trainers who've raised them from the first stage, so not only would they be able to fight them, but other trainers would have to be good enough to beat those trained Nidoqueen to stand a chance in tournaments.

At least Red and Leaf are been able to manage, even if it is with so much pain and deaths. And probably permanent mental trauma (not even accounting for pressure added damage). But hey, at least their relationship is growing. We shippers are content. Just don't kill them before the confession.

However, what we should keep in mind is the power gap which exists between the lesser legendaries (birds, beasts, regis) and the greater legendaries (Ho-Oh, Lugia, Rayquaza). We haven't seen or heard of any of them yet in the story, but I could imagine the gap between the two being massive, just like the one between legendaries and regular mons in this fic. Something to keep in mind is that Pokemon like Snorlax and Arcanine have a closer Base-Stat Total to the birds than the birds do to Lugia.

** Im starting to get the impression that trainers are a lot less common then I expected. It seems nearly every normal citizen has no pokemon, and even most trainers have very limited options. This is a pretty stark contrast to the previous chapters where we saw just random rangers have pretty strong pokemon, and quite a few high tier trainers around the gyms. Im sure there's some places with more trainers than others, but maybe being a trainer just isn't worth it for a lot of people. Is being a trainer just too much of a time investment for someone who wants to be, say, a banker or an engineer? Maybe its a huge cost investment? The only thing i think contradicts this is the age of the kids. If the kids are only 12, then it's clear that people can have a training period when they're young where they try out being trainers, and then if they want to do something else they can put down the belt and pick up the books. Maybe this is one of those societies where you have to choose your path ridiculously early, or maybe the cost investment thing really is the big difference.

So the people we see in this chapter, the people who aren't in the shelters, are much more likely not to have any Pokemon. You'll notice also that there's only like a dozen or so people left in an apartment complex? It's perfectly plausible that the majority of people have at least one Pokemon they can rely on to some extent, and we're only seeing the outliers.

On top of that is the danger factor, we've already seen a lot of rando's just straight up murdered on their journey. But yeah, it feels like the strong trainers are few and far between even among a select few.

Even in situations where physicality isn't important, like chess, a 12 year old will consistently lose against a 20 year old. There's a reason chess championships are age gated. This should hold even more true in a world where your pokemon get stronger over time. The kids are not only behind because they are children and have less physical and mental development, but they're also behind because the opponent's pokemon would have been trained for years longer. It's not really realistic unless they're significantly better off than normal kids in terms of training and supplies, which is possible. There are examples of child chess prodigies ranking pretty high at young ages. But those are like, one in a billion. They're not only natural savants, but are generally from very well off families and have a loooot of resources behind them (even for a relatively resource light endeavor).

Like you said, more time to trainer and gain experience and gather useful items and such. Although, it also seems like many adults didn't become trainers at any point in there lives, or at least for a very small time in there lives, so they're going to be less capable at the thing than somebody that continues to put effort in, which also makes sense (a junior competitive chess player will beat out somebody with only passing knowledge of the game pretty much every time). It also seems like our protags are also prodigies in their own right if we take their older acquaintances Amy and her brother as the standard for somewhat older trainers, so our view of the world is skewed in that respect as well. Could be that most 12 yr olds are basically scrubs with pidgeys and rattatas.

​

tldr: if adults seem to be less capable trainers in this setting it seems to be more a factor of they just didn't stay trainers long enough to really know what to do more than that they would be bad at it.

As for Red and Leaf, I'm worried this will end up making them codependent. Honestly I thought Red would be safer from pressure with his partition shields but constantly using abilities seems to be wearing him down faster than anyone else.

I'm also very very worried about Leaf making assumptions about her mind being altered by Red. Causing even more distrust, and pulling them emotionally apart. Then all it would take is Red reading her while she feels distrust toward him and he'll be devastated.

I think a lot of people use the two interchangeably, and it's something that bothers me on a clear-communication level. If people talk about trust/confidence in a way that indicates "there are good externally verifiable reasons to predict how this thing/person will act," then they're not talking about what most religious people mean when they say faith, which is usually something more like "I know this is the thing I'm supposed to do/believe regardless of what the evidence says (and maybe it feels good to do so) so I will."

Then they're still using the words "personal relationship" different from the way they would if describing someone in their life who they would decide to give their trust to or have blind faith in. It really is a matter of clearing up the language to show the difference: no matter what internal experiences makes someone feel justified in their faith in God, the lack of externally verifiable interactions still marks it as separate from "trust/confidence" in non-supernatural things.

First, a matter of levelling the field: you referred to "externally verifiable" evidence twice. However, if that really is what's required - What evidence could Leaf present in a courtroom to prove that Red is trustworthy? Could she bring enough to convince any fair minded but moderately skeptical individual that they are obligated to trust him implicitly, as she does?

There's his actions in providing Abra to help the community at below market rates. But as she's already seen from the online discussions, it's not hard for someone to suspect ulterior motives there, like gathering money with one hand and popularity with the other. Moreover, since she did the same, any effort to paint that as evidence of good character has a conflict of interest.

She's seen him hesitate to condemn Yuuta to death as a renegade, but was that because he's compassionate, or just because he was put on the spot? Or was he actually involved somehow? Not strong evidence to an impartial third party.

He's always been nice to her. But as she now knows, he has a crush on her, so that may not have been entirely unselfish, nor reflect his usual character.

And that crush leads into another point: she found out about it because he used his psychic powers to transmit that emotion to her. She has spent months in the company of a psychic who specializes in mimicking and projecting emotional states - and coincidentally enough, she feels inclined to completely trust him! That would go down great in cross-examination, I'm sure.

And both Leaf and Red have shown a willingness to flatly lie to authority figures when it suits their purposes, as on the SS Anne.

As far as I can see, she would have very little evidence that might convince a neutral external party to trust Red.

Is her own trust, then, irrational and naive? Or does she, rather, have sufficient valid evidence for herself, which nonetheless is not externally verifiable?

******* Well first off, the standard of a courtroom isn't necessary. As far as I'm aware no one acts or expects others to act on such a high standard of verification for their personal relationships. A courtroom is designed as an adversarial system: it's right and proper for people to nitpick, question motives, question intent, etc. But when people make friends and decide to trust each other, it's not about convincing other people that the person they're friends with or trust are "genuinely selfless" or any such impossible metric. It's just about being able to point to actions taken and efforts made that built their trust in them.

Like if a friend helped you move, you could be suspicious that they only did it so you could help them move at some point in the future, or to win your trust so they can come rob you, or something. There are plenty of people who do think that way. But I think most people would accept it as /weak evidence/ that they may be a good friend who cares about your well being.

Then maybe that friend drives out to give your car a start when your battery dies. And another time they bring you some food when you're sick. And another time they apologize first for an argument the two of you get into.

There is no way to externally verify that they actually care about your well-being and values. But you would probably start to trust them regardless, and if someone asked you why and you mentioned things like that, they would have to be pretty cynical to say "Well that doesn't /prove/ anything, they could just be playing the long con!"

They'd also be missing the point. Because it's not about "proof." It's about sufficient externally verifiable events, and what those mean /to you./ No one can /know/ what's in someone else's heart, or else the whole concept of trust would be meaningless.

For Leaf, the things you're listing that Red did are a start, but she has also seen him work hard to update his beliefs, seen him promise to try restricting his pokemon diet to align with her values, seen him put his fear aside to help strangers. None of this is proof that he's a good person, and you could dismiss a lot of the things he does toward her in specific by "well he has a crush on her." But why does that matter? She still has to make a decision to trust or not trust him. What other criteria should she use?

Sure, it's /possible/ that he's not actually a good person or doesn't actually care about her. But by any metric through which such a decision can be made, externally verifiable actions that continually benefit her and others makes it /probable enough/ that he's a good person for her to feel justified in placing trust in him.

Everyone has a different threshold for that, of course, but the criteria in a rational framework is the same.

By contrast, if Alice declares their deep trust in Bob and justifies it by saying things like "It's just this feeling I have when we're together" or "It's just the experience of being with him" or "When I talk to him I just feel so [positive emotion]," what all these have in common is they're about internal feelings, not specific, externally verifiable actions that may result from Bob's character or feelings.

A third party observer may /understand/ such a decision, because feelings aren't in our control and often influence our perspectives and actions, but rationally speaking it's easy to see why, on their own and without specific tangible actions, trust based on just those feelings might lead to bad outcomes, and has many times for many people.

(I'm ignoring the psychic thing for now because it's irrelevant to the difference of what makes up faith-based feelings of "trust" and non-faith based ones, meaning even if someone is using psychic powers on you, if you can't know it you'd still either be able to point to external events or not be able to, and one would still be more justified than the other)

However, I'm very much of the opinion that a religious journey is supposed to parallel the gradual, experience-based friendship that you describe, and not the mysterious case of Alice and Bob. Have you actually met many people who claimed to believe for no reason at all? Because I find the idea quite strange.

Jesus was definitely in the "build trust through experience" camp. The pattern all through his life was that when someone took a leap of faith, putting their trust in him, they were rewarded with miracles. When the crowds came to be healed, they may have started out with just wishes, but because they took a chance and acted, they came away with evidence.

Consider John 7:17, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." Or Matthew 7:15-16, "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"

So, if a Christian, at least, claims that they have no need for any evidence because they just have faith, I'd say that they don't understand their own scriptures. Faith might begin that way, as unfounded trust, but it's supposed to develop, through being acted upon, into trust based on experience. Very much comparable to starting a conversation with a stranger; you start off knowing almost nothing about them, but if you have even a tiny spark of hope and desire to build a new friendship, and if you have the courage to step outside your comfort zone and act on it, then you get a result that will either confirm your hope, or deflate it. To devote your life to a religion without ever expecting evidence would be like continually talking to someone who never responds, with no idea whether they actually want to hear from you. That's certainly not my idea of religion. And while it might, at a stretch, be considered a kind of faith, I don't think it's a kind that God ever asked for in any scriptures I know of.

Also, just kind of being a dick to non-believers, Matthew 13:10-13 /Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand./

It's always a dangerous game turning to scripture to prove one's preferred interpretation of religion. I can assure you that those Christians who disagree with your beliefs about the nature of faith can find many such reasons to justify it and insist that faith without evidence, even in spite of evidence, is quite clearly the correct path.

  The pattern all through his life was that when someone took a leap of faith, putting their trust in him, they were rewarded with miracles.
#+end_quote

And yet, to give an example of what I said above, I've met smart, educated Catholics who say that of course their beliefs are based on evidence, and when I asked why all the evidence they listed is impossible to verify, why not just go back to miracles (since those were pretty effective at convincing people in the biblical times), they then said that miracles are not necessary for faith because otherwise it wouldn't be /faith,/ or that focusing on miracles is missing the point which is to "just believe," or even that the miracles are metaphorical. There was some disagreement about this from the Catholics in this particular group. This is not uncommon, in my experience. There is no denomination or subsect of a religion I have ever met that did not have disagreements about what's actually true about their religious beliefs.

In any case, whether the miracles were meant to be empirically verifiable evidence, as you seem to imply they were, to reward trusting in the Jesus hypothesis, or just metaphors for the rewards those with faith will receive, either way, there's no big and obvious miracles around these days, so we're left with what seems to be a God who agrees with the idea that some blind faith is necessary BEFORE any evidence is given, and then doesn't reward people in any clear and obvious way, thus requiring MORE blind faith to be maintained.

This:

#+begin_quote
  Faith might begin that way, as unfounded trust, but it's supposed to develop, through being acted upon, into trust based on experience... if you have even a tiny spark of hope and desire to build a new friendship, and if you have the courage to step outside your comfort zone and act on it, then you get a result that will either confirm your hope, or deflate it.
#+end_quote

Is a rather silly thing to say, considering how many ex-religious people there are who used to have faith in God and loved God with all their hearts and wanted to continue to, but lost their faith when it became more and more clear that no such evidence was forthcoming. I'm not sure what the "deflate it" outcome you're envisioning is, but it seems like you're saying it's a crapshoot which will occur, even if you do everything right.

************ I wouldn't say that miracles are missing the point, necessarily. Jesus made some extraordinary claims, which require extraordinary evidence. However, I do think that God wants us to think for ourselves, to make choices without it being obvious that He's looking over our shoulders. If we were surrounded by flashy and obvious and undeniable evidence of God's existence, then we would have an even bigger problem of people blindly obeying. Arguably it would even be the logical thing to do; if there's a being of brilliant light and cosmic power standing in front of you, and s/he tells you to jump, it makes sense to ask "How high?" Possibly while already in the air.

By remaining largely unseen and subtle, we are instead left to have discussions like this one, to talk things out and use our own powers of reasoning and observation. We learn more from this than we would from walking behind a visible deity.

A quick reversal test: if I were in the presence of a visible, obvious, undeniable God, would I choose to instead enter a state of isolation in order to learn by my own experience? My church's doctrine says yes, that's exactly what happened, we were with God before we were born, and upon learning of this opportunity we were excited at the chance for personal growth.

************* It's convenient that God wants us to "think for ourselves" now that there's not a smidgen of externally verifiable evidence for him, as opposed to in biblical times when he apparently thought the extraordinary evidence was a good idea. I wonder what changed his mind? Also, since education and intelligence are correlating more and more with agnosticism and atheism as times goes on, God apparently wants us to think ourselves into disbelief, which seems like the kind of God I could respect, if I ever had any reason to believe he existed in the first place :P

And call me crazy, but I'd rather people end up in heaven than be left to follow their reason and end up in hell or divorced from God's love or whatever. I'm guessing you don't believe that happens, which is surely a nicer world to imagine we live in, but I have no idea what makes you think your beliefs are /right/ or /true./ Maybe you were raised to believe that there's no penalty for getting the question of God wrong. Maybe you just found the idea of people going to Hell distasteful and decided not to believe in it. I really have no idea, and that's a problem with this conversation: your epistemology seems to be missing the answers to some obvious questions.

For example, since something like 70%+ of the world's religious population seems pretty clearly on the side of "If you don't believe in God, or even if you don't believe in OUR version of God, you lose your chance at eternal salvation/bliss," I'm curious to know what makes you think /you/ or your denomination of religion got it right and they're all the ones who got the question of religion wrong, when they're probably using the exact same criteria as you?

************** Oh, miracles haven't ceased. However, they were never an everyday thing. Moses made extraordinary claims; he told hundreds of thousands of people that they needed to antagonise a powerful nation and walk out into the desert. And he provided extraordinary evidence, smiting the nation with plagues and opening the path to the desert by dividing the sea. Elijah opposed idol worship that had basically become the state religion, enforced by the king. And he was able to call down fire from heaven. Jesus claimed that their entire religious tradition was all in anticipation of His coming, and his whole ministry was full of miracles being used to assist and heal others.

Though it's notable that even in Jesus' ministry, miracles were withheld from those who refused to believe.

So, today, what extraordinary things are being asked of us, that would require extraordinary evidence? Being invited to pray, to read the Bible, to try attending church, does not impose much cost on us, so it's reasonable that there's no fire from heaven or walking on water to convince us. We can instead focus on the actions themselves and what inherent value they might have.

The occurrence of past miracles are still extraordinary claims. The assurance of life after death is a /massive/ extraordinary claim. The existence of an all-powerful deity is similarly so.

#+end_quote

Well, there are several possible answers to this :). But I should first clarify: my church is neither "all roads lead to heaven" nor "agree with me or burn." The first option makes no sense when different beliefs contradict each other, and the second doesn't make sense when millions of people live and die without even having /heard/ of 99.9% of religions - it would hardly be fair, let alone merciful, and most of those exclusive religions insist that God is both.

Rather, our view is that our time on Earth, while very important, is not by any means the end of our period of testing and probation. There will continue to be preaching and decisions made in the spirit world after death, and before anyone is resurrected and judged, s/he will have heard the gospel and had full opportunity to accept or reject it.

So, while we do believe that God has revealed important things to us that most churches reject, there's nothing that won't be revealed to everyone eventually. Wanting to share those things is just about doing our part.

That said, the "why do I believe?" mostly hinges on the Book of Mormon. Externally, it's a remarkable volume that could not plausibly have been written by a barely educated young adult in 19th century rural New York. Personally, I've found its contents to be both a very insightful life guide, and also a great source of clarification of Biblical passages that divide and confuse many Christians. Internally, I have prayed to ask God whether it's true, and distinctly felt an answer - although I recognize that this proves nothing to you, and that you are likely to think me mistaken.

You should talk to some ex-mormons: claims like this are very easy to find within mormon echo chambers, but there are plenty of people who can point out why it's entirely plausible far better than I can. Go ahead and check out [[/r/exmormon]] and assert this in a post asking for them to change your view if they can, and I'm sure you will be met with many polite and respectful explanations of why it's not nearly as meaningful a statement to make as you've been taught. That which can be destroyed by the truth should be, right?

Also, Occam's Razor is in full effect here. The idea that it's implausible for him to have made up the Book of Mormon as opposed to actual divine intervention shows a pretty poor understanding of how probability works. There's nothing in the books that couldn't possibly have been known (like, say, confirming the Big Bang theory or explaining an atomic theory of matter) and quite a lot of factual archaeological claims it gets demonstrably wrong.

It's great that you have had a good source of insightful life advice, but again, your internal experiences become largeley meaningless for those who care about truth in a world where others have the same experiences about different deities and religions.

Again: your pursuit of truth appears to stop at /what you experience./ You have shown nothing in your epistemology that shows how you check your experiences /against reality,/ which by definition is independent of your subjective experiences, and where indeed we can find many people with just as good a reason to believe you're wrong as you do to believe you're right.

************ Further to my "miracles" comment below: I would like to make a case that "empirically verifiable" evidence, while very useful for investigating impersonal forces, is missing an important part of the picture when it comes to personal relationships - which most Christians will attest is the nature of our relationship with God. Specifically, there can be evidence that is sufficient to convince an individual, but cannot be demonstrated to others.

Consider two scenarios:

1) Alice is having a rough day. Her friend Bob calls to check how she's doing, and after talking things out, she feels better. Her friendship with Bob is strengthened, and her trust in him increases.

2) Bob is having a rough day. He opens the Bible, and after reading passages like "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world," he feels comforted and at peace. He feels that God has spoken to him through these passages, and his trust in God increases.

Now, these two scenarios are really very similar. Both relationships are being built up via essentially the same process. But if we require evidence to be verifiable, especially externally verifiable, then we must entirely dismiss the second scenario - even though it operates on largely the same principles as the first - because we, as external observers, cannot tell what Bob actually experienced, whether it was a real communication or imagined.

Thus, I assert that it is at least theoretically possible for someone to have good evidence, for themselves, that cannot be proved to anyone else.

************* Sorry, but your understanding of what constitutes good evidence seems really strange to me. You're arguing that people's experiences influence their beliefs. Sure, of course. But the question isn't "what makes someone feel confident in their belief," it's "what makes someone distinguish beliefs they're confident in from ones that are /true?/"

If all someone cares about when trying to find out what's true is what /feels/ true or good, they don't actually care about what's /actually/ true, and have no method of actually learning and confirming it when faced with people who disagree by the same internal experiences.

Consider the following scenarios:

1) Bob is having a rough day. He opens the Bible, and after reading passages like "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world," he feels comforted and at peace. He feels that God has spoken to him through these passages, and his trust in God increases.

2) Alice is having a rough day. She throws some salt over her shoulder, leaves milk out her front door, and hangs a dream catcher over her bed before she goes to sleep. The next day she feels better. Alice feels that the positive spirits/fae folk/her ancestors have come to help her, and her trust in them increases.

What's the difference between these two situations, on the level of "knowing what's true about the world?"

Furthermore, imagine Bob's brother gets comfort from the passages in the bible about how sinners will have death and eternal punishment (Romans 6:23 and Matthew 25:46), which Bob doesn't take literally and believes aren't true. Is that the same God that's speaking to Bob's brother? How does he know? Because both may feel equally like they've been spoken to by God through these passages, and now you're at exactly the problem with relying on personal relationships to determine what's true about the world: people's feelings contradict each other while still feeling genuine and true, and the experiences that lead to those feelings can be direct opposites.

It gets even worse when you look at the history of religious warfare. If God is the actual source of that feeling of comfort, if that's the sign of a "personal relationship," why is God also giving it to people who believe in things like, say, murdering those who claim to receive it from other holy books or even other passages?

******** Ok, looking at dictionary.reference.com, the #1 definition for "faith" is "confidence or trust in a person or thing." That's how I use it, and in my view it's also how the Bible, for example, uses it.

Now, the #2 definition sounds more like how you've defined it, "belief that is not based on proof." Interestingly enough, the example given actually refers to having faith that a hypothesis will pan out - which works just fine, in my opinion, because presumably your next step is to test it and get a definitive answer.

Moreover, the definitions of "trust" don't say anything about evidence either. They talk about reliance and confident expectation, but there is no sign that evidence is a necessary part of the definition. If your confidence is groundless and foolishly misplaced, it apparently still counts as "trust".

So I think that the distinction you've drawn between the two does not correctly reflect their usage.

If you've had to deal with people who deal with ignorance by clinging to belief, then I can understand wanting to distinguish their attitude from the scientific approach of dealing with ignorance through investigation and discovery. But I don't think that trying to separate the synonyms "faith" and "trust" is the best approach. Perhaps it would be better to ask such people why they haven't asked God for more insight, as Matthew 7:7 and James 1:5 recommend.

Concept 1 is "Has seen sufficient impersonal empirical evidence in something to act as though that thing is true."

Concept 2 is "Has felt sufficient personal experiences with something to act as thought that thing is true."

There are many other concepts between and around these, but if we don't have words to differentiate them, both reason and communication suffer.

********** I've never found an answer as to why faith (in the sense you are using it as distinguished from trust) is a useful epistemology when it so clearly gives different results to different people. If we make the basic assumption that other people in the world are living in the same world that we are, and that they aren't projections from an alternate universe or something, and the basic assumption that the universe is internally consistent, I don't know why using the process of faith gives wildly different answers as to the nature of the universe dependent upon the person's culture and personal beliefs. Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Pagans of all flavors, etc. all have mutually contradictory theories on the basic structure of the universe, or at least in the governing intelligence of the universe, but all claim to use the same methodology to arrive at different conclusions, and usually without room for much doubt.

I remember a conversation I had with this nice couple that were going around my University trying to convert people to their branch of Christianity. Part of the conversation revolved around how their evidence for their flavor of Christianity is their deep personal conviction in the truth of their interpretation of the Bible, how good they feel when they contemplate their faith, various statements of that nature. From someone who isn't currently feeling those things, why should I take their personal feelings as evidence for their religion any more seriously than the all but identical feelings that people of wildly different beliefs have for their religion? I think concluding that all but one group of people is lying about their feelings would be a good way to start a holy war. So other than the fact that I live in an area where my neighbors happen to be Christian instead of Muslim or Hindu or anything else, why should I convert to this one sect over another when they all give the exact same evidence for their version of reality? I can't reach into their head and verify these feelings, and I rather heavily suspect that they aren't lying about them even if I could.

My conclusion, that I've held for a long time but haven't always been able to verbalize, is that faith is not a good method of epistemology. Even aside from any religious mutual contradictions, I think it's telling that by and large people and institutions need hard evidence before reaching a conclusion. Courts do not or at least should not convict or release people based on the personal feelings of witnesses. Policy generally is not and should not be decided on someone's personal conviction in the absence of externally verifiable events/records. If my toilet or sink isn't working, I do not meditate on the problem, then fix the problem immediately after correctly convincing myself of the problem's true source through personal conviction. I troubleshoot, or in other words I look at things, although experience can tell me which source problems are more or less likely ahead of time. Applying faith in these curcumstances, although logically consistent with the religious faith that most people claim to possess, seems absurd.
